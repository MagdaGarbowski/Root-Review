We monitored plants for 1 year, measuring seasonal growth and foliar and root functional traits under non_limiting water conditions, followed by recovery after severe drought. We quantified dehydration tolerance and summer dormancy, and measured rooting depth as a proxy for dehydration avoidance. Overall, we expected a close association between functional traits/strategies, drought survival strategies and environmental constraints that could have strong implications for restoration of communities in drought_prone environments.","On 6 February 2014, we transplanted one individual per population into long (6 cm diameter, 1 m length), clear plastic rhizotrons filled with 3,108 g substrate (75% sand, 25% local soil). Insulated rhizotrons were kept in a greenhouse and fully irrigated from February to May. Mean air temperature was maintained between 16.9çC (March) and 20.6çC (May); monthly mean relative humidity ranged from 46.7% to 55.3%, and radiation (photon flux) ranged from 42.7 to 86.7 _mol m_2 s_1. Rhizotrons (six per population = 30 total) were arranged in a completely randomized design and re_randomized weekly. Seperate experiment to measure aboveground traits.","1. Restoration of degraded grasslands through active revegetation often involves re-establishing populations of native grasses, which must withstand increasing drought stress to persist beyond initial establishment. In perennial species, superior dehydration tolerance is expected to result in more conservative growth, but this trade-off has seldom been studied among populations of herbaceous species. 2. We measured seasonal growth and foliar and root functional traits under non-limiting water conditions, followed by recovery after severe drought in four populations of Elymus glaucus, a perennial grass from California's Mediterranean-climate region. We hypothesized that populations from harsher sites would be more dehydration tolerant, summer dormant and resource-conservative. 3. Dehydration tolerance and summer dormancy were associated with a more conservative strategy (lower productivity, lower specific leaf area and specific root length), as well as earlier reproductive phenology. 4. Multivariate trait variation was associated with water availability in both the growing season and summer, while greater dehydration tolerance and summer dormancy were associated with increasing summer climatic water deficit. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides evidence of an intraspecific trade-off between dehydration tolerance and rapid resource acquisition. We discuss the implication that restored populations with superior drought survival may therefore be less competitive, and recommend further investigation to inform plant materials selection protocols and management practices.","Our study supports the anticipated trade_off between dehydration tolerance/summer dormancy and rapid resource acquisition, and thus, the association between dehydration tolerance/summer dormancy and more conservative resource acquisition (Reich, 2014; Volaire et al., 2009; Zwicke et al., 2015), notably in the context of intraspecific variability. The more conservative strategy was characterized by lower potential productivity and higher LDMC (lower SLA). The more acquisitive strategy was characterized by greater potential productivity, and higher SLA and SRL, both of which result in larger resource_capturing surfaces with lower carbon investment (Freschet, Cornelissen, van Logtestijn, & Aerts, 2010; Wright et al., 2004). This suggests higher growth potential is associated with more efficient competition for light and shallow soil moisture, but relatively lower investment in storage to survive severe drought. We did not find an association between an acquisitive strategy and our proxies for dehydration avoidance (deeper roots), nor did we observe a tolerance_avoidance trade_off. Our avoidance proxies were measured in optimum conditions for maximum root development; a direct measure of uptake under drought in rhizotrons or the field, although dependent on soil depth and water availability, may show the expected trade_off. The first axis in a PCA of traits opposed SRB (recovery or dehydration tolerance) and RSGP (growth potential) and explained 45% of total trait variance (Figure 3a). Greater RSGP was associated with higher SLA, later flowering, higher year_round productivity, higher SRL and a greater percentage of very fine roots. Greater SRB was associated with higher spring and summer Emaxleaf, and to a lesser extent, higher autumn LDMC, as well as a wider average root diameter. The second axis opposed deeper, denser roots from faster early_season leaf elongation.",,"Drought survival strategies can vary among co_occurring plant species (e.g. Zwicke, Picon_Cochard, Morvan_Bertrand, Prud'homme, & Volaire, 2015) and within species spanning environmental gradients (e.g. Berger & Ludwig, 2014). In perennial herbaceous taxa, strategies include dehydration avoidance and tolerance (Levitt, 1980; Ludlow, 1989), as well as summer dormancy in Mediterranean_type taxa (Laude, 1953; Norton, Lelièvre, & Volaire, 2006; Ofir & Koller, 1974). Dehydration avoidance involves continued water uptake to delay dehydration, and is often achieved by deeper, wider roots to access deep soil moisture. In contrast, tolerant plants have tissues relatively insensitive to dehydration. More tolerant taxa are expected to invest less in dehydration avoidance traits, and to be found where drought is more severe. Summer dormancy involves complete or partial summer growth suspension induced by increasing temperature and photoperiod. It protects perennial taxa from regrowth during episodic summer rains (Hoen, 1968) and often co_occurs with high dehydration tolerance (Volaire, Norton, & Lelièvre, 2009). vidence of a _productivity_persistenceÓ trade_off with respect to water stress has been found in woody species (Reich, 2014), but is rarer in herbaceous taxa (P_rez_Ramos, Volaire, Fattet, Blanchard, & Roumet, 2013) particularly at the intraspecific level (Volaire, 1995). Additionally, although root traits are important for drought survival (Comas & Eissenstat, 2004), knowledge of root_trait variability along environmental gradients remains limited (Lalibert_, 2016).",,Elymus glaucus,"Recovery biomass negatively correlated with specific root length, positively correlated with root diameter",Biomass (Recovery),Diameter,,Specific root length,negatively correlated with specific root length,Summer growth potential,Growth (potential),Specific root length,,,,,positively correlated with specific root length,,,Specific root length,,Specific root length,,Diameter,,Root tissue density,,Root dry matter content,,Root length density,,percent fine roots in 0-25 cm soil layer,,,,,,,,,"Growth rate, leaf elongation, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content",,,,,California,Elymus glaucus,field sites,,Quantitative,Graminoid,,,Single species,,Experimental,,,Only measured root traits under non-limiting water conditions...

For this purpose, we explored temporal changes in the community functional structure: trait composition at the community level and functional diversity (of both adults and recruits) in response to those climatic events. For this, we surveyed the species composition after the event and some years later, estimating the pre-event composition by adding together the live and dead volume of each species. We also measured a broad set of functional traits (including leaf, stem, root, seed and whole-plant traits) that could be related with plant survival after drought and/or low temperatures. Then, we quantified relevant indexes of functional diversity. Specifically, we studied three main topics with the final aim of answering the following questions: (i) regarding changes in the functional diversity of plant communities: was there a decrease in functional diversity after the climatic event? Were communities harbouring higher initial functional diversity more resistant or resilient to these climatic disturbances? (ii) Regarding changes in community functional traits: can we predict the functional traits contributing most to the community resistance and resilience to extreme climatic events? Which functional traits were affected (positively or negatively) by the climatic event? And (iii) regarding the regeneration patterns: was the community functional diversity of the plants at the recruit stage a reflection of the adult stage? Alternatively, are they biased towards certain functional traits associated with colonisers after disturbance?",,"Aims Extreme climatic events may have important consequences for plant community structure and composition. In 2005, a severe drought together with a cold winter promoted extensive damage and mortality in shrubland communities of southwest Spain (Donana National Park). Here, we aim to identify the mechanisms underlying community stability (resistance and resilience) in response to this extreme climatic event, considering changes in the functional structure of these communities. Methods We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in 10 functional traits at the community level (community weighted means, CWM) and the functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and divergence) in 18 plots at three different times: predating the climatic event (estimated from the sum of the live and dead volume of each species in 2007), and 2 and 8 years after the 2005 episode. We also quantified the differences in functional traits and functional diversity between adult and recruit stages, which allowed us to better understand the contribution of the recruitment to the maintenance of the functional structure and diversity of the community. Important Findings Communities with higher functional divergence before the climatic event maintained nearly constant their levels of functional divergence 8 years after, but they were more prone to changes in species composition. Community resistance in terms of vegetation cover was positively correlated with root dry matter content, whereas community resilience was positively correlated with leaf chlorophyll (LChl). We also found that some values (weighted means) of functional community traits (such as root dry matter content and LChl) had increased 2 years after the event, returning to the pre-event conditions after 8 years. In addition, there was hardly any establishment of new species in the community and the recruits did not make substantial differences to the community functional structure. Only seed mass differed significantly between the adult and seedling stages. In summary, the extreme climatic event induced rapid vegetation changes, modifying several functional properties of the community, but, in spite of the occurrence of changes in species composition, a rapid convergence of these shrubland communities took place due to the replacement of species with functional redundancy, thus recovering the initial conditions and supporting the existence of strong mechanisms of functional resilience.","Our results indicate that there were several significant changes in the community functional traits (3 out of 10 traits) with time, independent of the site (see supplementary Table S2). The community-weighted values of three traits (LChlCWM, RDMCCWM and PhgCWM _marginally significantê) increased after the event (+2 years) but returned to pre-event values in the +8 years survey (Fig. 4). The community values (weighted means) of seed mass (SmassCWM) increased over time, with a significant change between pre-event and +8 years (Fig. 4c). Stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that the adult and recruit groups differed in functional richness (FRich) and seed mass (SmassCWM), since these variables explained most variation in the analysis (Fig. 5). In addition, our findings reveal that these resilience mechanisms do not necessarily imply that the same species composition remains at a local scale. After an episodic disturbance plant competition could decrease, thus facilitating species replacement (Fattorini and Halle 2004), but we did not observe major changes in the functional structure of the communities in the short-or medium-term. With regard to the functional divergence, which indicates the abundance of species with specialized functional trait values (Villeger et al. 2010), the communities with higher values of FDiv exhibited a lower resilience composition (Rs- comp) value with time (i.e. lower stability). Thus, a higher functional divergence was associated with a lower stability of species composition over time. However, these communities maintained higher values of functional divergence 8 years after the event. They did not suffer a significant loss of functional diversity in spite of experiencing higher rates of species replacement. This combination of high functional diversity and species turnover can be possible when changes in abundance occur in species that are functionally redundant, likely because their functional traits are related to the major drivers of ecosystem processes in our case response to water deficit (effect traits) or because it allows the maintenance of populations in our case mostly by seedling establishment (response traits) (Vill_ger 2010). In general, a disturbance in the ecosystem can promote the replacement of dominant species by other, less abundant competitors with similar functional properties (Naeem 1998; Walker et al. 1999), which does not induce strong changes in ecosystem functioning (Cingolani et al. 2005; Schindler 1990).","After disturbance (drought followed by cold winter) redundency in traits matters for community recovery/ resistance. Disconnect between traits that result for adults (high RDMC high chlorophyll content) and seedlings (high seed mass). The most stable shrubland communities (with more resistance) were those dominated by species having traits more closely associated with drought resistance, such as higher values of root and stem dry matter (RDMCCWM and SDMCCWM) and lower values of specific root area (SRACWM) (Poorter and Markesteijn 2008). A large thawing rate in drought-prone ecosystems increases the probability of xylem embolism, as a result of high daily temperature oscillations (Granda et al. 2014). Thus, higher values of SDMC might confer an advantage because they reduce the plant vulnerability to xylem cavitation promoted by unusually low temperatures (Hacke et al. 2001). Similarly, Polley et al. (2013) and Majekova et al. (2014) found, in grasslands communities, that LDMC was the best predictor associated with greater population temporal stability, the more conservative and slow-growing species being more stable over time. In addition, the communities with higher rates of recovery of plant growth after the disturbance (higher resilience) were positively related to higher values of chlorophyll in their dominant species. A higher concentration of LChl is closely correlated with a higher mass-based maximum photosynthetic rate (Evans and Poorter 2001), and thus with faster plant growth (Poorter and Remkes 1990). The combination of demographic and functional attributes in our study enabled us to detect remarkable differences in the functional diversity of different demographic stages in the shrubland communities studied: it was higher for the adult than for the recruit stage.","The ecosystem response to disturbances (such as an extreme climatic event) comprises two main aspects related to stability: resistance, which can be defined as the tendency of the ecosystem to remain in a reference state despite perturbation; and resilience, which can be described as the ability of a particular ecosystem or community to return to a reference state prior to the disturbance (Potts et al. 2006 and references therein). At the community level, these processes are determined by the balance through time between demographic processes (recruitment and mortality rates) of the different coexisting species (Lloret et al. 2012). These processes may produce temporary changes in vegetation, although in many cases plant populations exhibit remarkable inertia (Lloret and Zedler 2009; Lloret et al. 2012). The effects of climatic events on plant community stability (resistance and resilience) can be analysed also by exploring temporal changes in the functional structure and diversity of the community (Dêaz and Cabido 2001; Hooper et al. 2005). Two widely recognized and complementary indicators can be used to explain how species traits within a community may influence these ecosystem properties (de Bello et al. 2010): (i) community weighted means (CWM), based on the biomass ratio hypothesis (Grime 1998), where the mean trait values of the species present in a community are weighted by their relative abundances (Garnier et al. 2004) and (ii) functional diversity, defined as the degree to which coexisting species vary in terms of their functional traits (Weiher 2010).",,Community,Survival/Establishment,Survival,Root dry matter content,,Specific root area,positive - root dry matter. negative - specific root area,Community stability,,,,,,,,,"Height, speciic leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf chlorophyll, stem dry matter content",Root dry matter content,na,specific root area,na,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Height, speciic leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf chlorophyll, stem dry matter content",,,"An event of extreme drought occurred during the hydrological year 2004_2005, when total rainfall only reached 173 mm (69% less than the average).

The species-specific resistance to drought and factors involved in its variation are of special interest to forecast community fate. We performed an experiment under natural field conditions from winter 2006 to end summer 2008 to investigate the structural responses of woody saplings to nine combinations of light (three habitats differing in plant cover: forest, shrubland, and open) and water (three climate scenarios: drier, current and wetter summers). Our working hypothesis is that plant strategies to cope with drought are determined by habitat characteristics and/or variation of plant traits, and that these different strategies may determine community composition and dynamics. Eight woody species with different life forms and successional stages (trees, mid-successional shrubs, and pioneer shrubs) were selected for the comparison, including therefore species representative of the entire woody community. We explored drought resistance at the population level (DS), the relations of the different morphological traits to DS, and the potential importance for plants of inter-specific trade-offs. DS ranged from 0% to 99% for the different species, depending on the habitat. Some structural traits were found to be related to DS: positively with total biomass and leaf mass ratio (LMR) and negatively with leaf area-root mass ratio (LARMR). Contrary to previous studies, the present work revealed no evidence of trade-offs, such as survival in forest vs. growth in open, or growth in forest vs. growth in open. Accordingly, some species with low DS values (Acer opalus and Pinus sylvestris) would be threatened under the future climate conditions, while species having structural characteristics to increase their resistance under expected dry years in coming decades (i.e., high LMR and total biomass or low LARMR, such as Quercus ilex and the shrub Cytisus scoparius) might enhance their recruitment probabilities. Thus, species-specific plant traits, and their effect on DS, may filter future community assemblages.","Also, we calculated the drought resistance of each species growing in the different habitats in terms of survival (DS) as the percentage of survival in the dry scenario relative to the wet scenario",Habitat specific (open vs. shade) for effect of traits on survival. ,"Although specific drought responses in terms of survival and growth vary along a continuous gradient, strategies for coping with drought can be classified as: (1) little effect on both growth and survival; (2) little effect on survival, but strong effect on growth; (3) strong effect on survival, with the surviving individuals showing a low to moderate growth reduction (Engelbrecht and Kursar, 2003).",,Grouped,Survival (Drought resistance) (in shrublasn),Survival,Root mass to leaf area ratio,,Root to shoot ratio,increased with higher root mass to leaf area ratio,,,,,,,,,,,Leaf area root mass ratio,,Root mass fraction,,Rooting depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"37ç05_ N, 3ç28_ W","Salvia lavandulifolia Vahl., Cytisus scoparius L., Berberis vulgaris L., Crataegus monogyna Jacq., Sorbus aria L., Acer opalus Mill., Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus ilex L",,,,Tree,Shrub,,Multiple,,Experimental,,,,,Seedling,"L.

Seedling survival required at least 206mm of water, which is twice the average rainfall and roughly equivalent to the precipitation during an ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event in this region. Seedling survival at the onset of the summer drought was best explained by leaf habit, root length and initial seedling size. However, only Senna cumingii seedlings survived through the first year. S. cumingii seedlings had distinctively longer roots than the other shrub species, enabling them to reach moister soil layers. Conclusions: Water conditions resembling rainy years enhance shrub seedling establishment in the Atacama Desert, but the effects of higher water availability are strongly dependent on the shrub species. Rapid and deep rooting appears to be a very important functional trait for successful first-year survival in this arid system where water availability is highly episodic.","Irrigation had a significant effect on root biomass (twoway ANOVA, F5,301 = 2.97, P = 0.0124) and root length (two-way ANOVA, F5,301 = 4.54, 4 P = 0.0005; Table 2). Roots were significantly longer in the irrigated treatments compared to the control, and root biomass peaked with 50 mm of irrigation. We found no effects of the water treatments on shoot biomass, root:shoot ratio or SRL. Shoot and root biomass, as well as root length and SRL,","Early seedling survival before the summer drought was mostly explained by root length, leaf habit and initial size. The only species that survived the drought was Senna cumingii, an evergreen species with the longest roots. In our system, most species had roots within the first 20 cm, where the soil water content was extremely low during the summer. Root elongation in S. cumingii reached the moister soil layers found below 40 cm. Deep-rooted evergreens with access to soil water during the dry season have the advantage of maintaining carbon fixation and growth (Harrison et al. 2010). This likely reinforced the initial effect of seedling size at plantation time. Although all species were of equal age at the start of the experiment, S. cumingii plants were among the largest. Several studies have shown a positive relationship between seedling size at planting and field performance (Cortina et al. 1997; Villar-Salvador et al. 2004; Luis et al. 2009). For the species studied in this experiment, root depth was more important in explaining seedling survival than the rate of elongation per unit biomass invested in roots. S. cumingii had the longest roots and also the largest root biomass and, as a consequence, a lower SRL compared to most other experimental species. We therefore did not find evidence for the prediction that species with a large SRL would have higher recruitment rates. Fast growth with deep root elongation may be critical for early seedling survival in these dry systems and may contribute to explaining the dominance of S. cumingii in several arid and semi-arid plant communities of the Atacama Desert (Squeo et al. 2001, 2008). Deep-rooting growth has been linked to higher woody seedling survival in semi-arid shrublands (Donovan & Ehleringer 1994; Padilla & Pugnaire 2007) and tropical dry forests (Markesteijn & Poorter 2009), but seems to also confer drought tolerance to grasses (Morecroft et al. 2004).","These two main types of plant strategy are associated with different plant traits that allow species to either (1) avoid drought stress or (2) tolerate it. For instance, plants can avoid water stress by maximizing water uptake through long roots with a high specific root length, or by reducing water loss through deciduous leaves (Harrison et al. 2010). Comparisons between species of dry and wet environments suggest that species from water-limited environments tend to have a conservative strategy, with relatively lower specific root lengths than species from wetter habitats, in which there is a lower amount of root length achieved per unit of root biomass invested and thus a lower absorptive surface produced per volume of roots (Wright & Westoby 1999; Nicotra et al. 2002). On the other hand, species from dry environments tend to have higher root:shoot biomass ratios, thus enabling water conservation (Canadell & Zedler 1995; Lynch 1995). Indeed,in some cases it appears that it is not the intrinsic root system architecture per se that confers a selective advantage in plants, but the ability of the root system to respond to environmental cues (Malamy 2005). In sand dunes, for instance, where soil water content declines rapidly afterrain, fast root growth seems particularly important to explain high survival rates (Yang et al. 2010).",,Grouped,Survival,Survival,Rooting depth,,,increase with root depth,,,,,,,,,,Biomass (AG),Specific root length,no effect,RSR or RMF,no effect,Root length,increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Six water levels (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 600mm) supplementing natural rainfall.

Once all plants had acclimated, a first harvest was carried out for 12 individuals per species (see methods below). In October 2009, just before the start of the drought experiment and 8 weeks after the first harvest, a second harvest was carried out.","Water availability is one of the key environmental factors that affect plant establishment and distribution. In many regions water availability will decline with climate change, exposing small seedlings to a greater likelihood of drought. In this study, 17 leaves, stem, root, and whole-plant traits of ten woody Mediterranean species were measured under favourable growing conditions and seedling drought survival was evaluated during a simulated dry-down episode. The aims of this study were: i) to assess drought survival of different species, ii) to analyse which functional traits predict drought survival time, and iii) to explain species distribution in the field, based on species drought survival and drought strategies. Drought survival time varied ten-fold across species, from 19 to 192 days. Across species, drought survival was positively related to the rooting depth per leaf area, i.e., the ability to acquire water from deeper soil layers while reducing transpiring leaf area. Drought survival time was negatively related to species ability to grow quickly, as indicated by high relative growth and net assimilation rates. Drought survival also explained species distribution in the field. It was found that species were sorted along a continuum, ranging between two contrasting species functional extremes based on functional traits and drought performance. One extreme consisted of acquisitive fast-growing deciduous species, with thin, soft metabolically active leaves, with high resource use and vulnerability to drought. The opposite extreme consisted of conservative slow-growing evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, deep roots, a low transpiring area, and low water use, resulting in high drought survival and drought tolerance. The results show that these drought strategies shape species distribution in this Mediterranean area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.","Soil water content in the second week of drought was positively correlated to the survival time of the species (Fig. 2a). Those species that dried the soil more rapidly during the first two weeks of drought (such as F. angustifolia, C. ladanifer and C. australis) had a lower survival time than others (such as Q. ilex or P. pinea), which showed a more conservative water use. Soil water content two weeks after drought was negatively correlated with the transpiration rate of the species (Fig. 2b). This suggests that a conservative strategy of water use during the first weeks of drought could enhance long-term survival. The drought survival time was strongly and positively correlated to Rooting Depth per Leaf Area (RDLA) (Fig 3a). Species which survived longest (Q. ilex and P. pinea) had deeper root systems and smaller transpiring area. In contrast, other species which survived shortest (F. angustifolia and C. australis) had deep roots, but a considerably larger transpiring area, and therefore a low RDLA. This suggest that, species able to optimize this relation, making deep root systems to explore the lower and wetter levels of soil, and reducing the transpiring area, can resist the drought longer. Drought survival time was also negatively correlated to the relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) (Fig. 3b and c). Therefore, those species with fast growth and high NAR (F. angustifolia and C. australis, followed by C. ladanifer), were less tolerant to drought than species with a slow RGR and low NAR (Q. ilex and P. pinea). The two first axes of the PCA analyses explained together 67% of the variation of the studied traits (Fig. 4a). The first axis, which explained 42% of variance, was positively related to drought survival time and RDLA but negatively related to RGR and NAR (Tables 3 and 4). The first axis seems to be associated with resource uptake and growth rate. On the left side (Fig. 4b) there are the species (F. angustifolia and C. australis) with a high RGR and NAR, that have productive leaves with a high SLA, high R:S and high resource uptake (i.e., a low soil water content) but a lower drought survival time. On the right side, there are the species (Q. ilex and P. pinea) with the opposite traits (a high drought survival time, RDLA, water content at the second week and leaf carbon content but slow growth and associated traits). Different studies have found that a deeper root system may be related to drought survival (Padilla and Pugnaire, 2007, Pinheiro et al., 2005). A deeper rooting system is advantageous as it allows plants to explore deeper and wetter soil layers for water. However, in this study, the rooting depth per se was not the best predictor of drought survival, but the ratio between rooting depth and transpiring leaf area, because it reflects a conservative strategy of water use (Paz, 2003).","Drought survival time varied ten-fold across species, from 19 to 192 days. Across species, drought survival was positively related to the rooting depth per leaf area, i.e., the ability to acquire water from deeper soil layers while reducing transpiring leaf area.

The opposite extreme consisted of conservative slow-growing evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, deep roots, a low transpiring area, and low water use, resulting in high drought survival and drought tolerance. Overall, a trade-off between fast growth and high drought survival was found, which is in line with the growth-survival trade-off found for other limiting resources in other systems.","Not only biomass allocation to roots, but also rooting depth is important, as water availability is higher in deeper soil layers. Woody species from drier environments with a longer dry season have deeper roots (Filella and Pe_uelas, 2003, Sack et al., 2003, Markesteijn and Poorter, 2009), and higher Rooting depth - Max per leaf area (Paz, 2003). Other root morphological traits can be related to drought tolerance. Root morphology can be described with the specific root length (SRL), which indicates how much root length can be build per unit of root mass (Ryser, 2006). A high SRL can be an advantage in water-limited conditions (but see Wright and Westoby, 1999), as maximizing SRL means an increased root_soil interface for the same carbon investment, and hence, a higher root absorption potential (Eissenstat, 1992).",,Grouped,Drought survival time,Survival,Rooting depth to leaf area ratio,,,positive with rooting depth per leaf area,,,,,,,,,,"relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, stem porosity, leaf dry matter content, stem dry matter content, maximum photosynthetic rate per mass, transpiration rate per mass, water use efficiency,",Rooting depth,,Root biomass,,RSR or RMF,,rooting depth per leaf area,,Specific root length,,Root dry matter content,,,,,,,,,,,"relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, stem porosity, leaf dry matter content, stem dry matter content, maximum photosynthetic rate per mass, transpiration rate per mass, water use efficiency,",,,"[Watered three times a week to field capacity, watering withheld]",,"37ç 51_ N, 4ç 48_ W",10 mediterranean species,,"a mixture of sand, peat and vermiculite (4.5:2:1)",Quantitative,Shrub,Tree,,Multiple,Greenhouse/Growth Chamber,Experimental,,,,No,Seedling,"Padilla, FM; Pugnaire, FI",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,English,Article,allocation; establishment; soil water; Mediterranean species; root growth,WATER RELATIONS; PLANT-GROWTH; ESTABLISHMENT; SIZE; RESTORATION; RECRUITMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; NITROGEN,220,2007,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01267.x,Rooting depth and soil moisture control Mediterranean woody seedling survival during drought,Keep,Ingrid Slette,yes,Effect,,Drought,Comparison - Interspecific,Independent (factor),"We related seedling mortality to the presence of deep roots in a field experiment in which we monitored soil moisture, root growth and seedling survival in five Mediterranean woody species from the beginning of the growing season until the end of the drought season.",,"1.

However, differences in seedling survival during drought are often due to varying tolerance to low soil moisture (Hasting, Oechel & Sionit 1989; Ackerly 2004).

The three rainfall timing treatments simulated in this study were: typical distribution of rainfall (typical timing), dry autumn with a wet spring (dry autumn), and wet autumn with a dry spring (dry spring). In addition, two rainfall amount levels were considered: mean rainfall amount (270 mm/growing period, from October to April) and slight drought treatment (25% rainfall reduction). Community sampling was conducted at three different times in experiment 1 (December, February, and April) in order to observe different life stages throughout community development, that is, the emergence and seedling stage, vegetative stage and reproductive peak. In Experiment 2, only seedlings and reproductive plants were recorded. For each experimental community and sample date, we registered each individual of every species and we then calculated the species richness and plant abundances as the total number of individuals in each pot.","Understanding the mechanisms that underlie species assembly is a central concern in community ecology. Abiotic and biotic filters are probabilistic 'sieves' that allow species with certain functional traits to become a part of the community, or not. We manipulated natural plant assemblies in order to identify variations in the timings of biotic and abiotic filters that determine community trait assemblies. We extracted soil portions when the investigated annual plant community was in its seed phase ('community monolith'), thereby maintaining the structure and similar soil characteristics to the field conditions. Community monoliths were subjected to experimental manipulation in terms of the rainfall timing and amount, and perturbations of the biological soil crust (BSC; intact vs. perturbed). We surveyed the experimental community assembly over time based on the functional diversity by considering important functional traits in different life stages. We found that autumn droughts acted as abiotic filters by favouring the germination and establishment of species with greater investment in the root biomass. Under severe droughts (66% water reduction), the experimental assemblies were dominated by species with functional traits adapted to water shortage conditions: high leaf dry matter content, low specific leaf area, small individual size, low reproductive ratio and high root:shoot ratio. We identified two roles of BSCs in annual plant species assemblies: (a) as a biotic filter that limited the establishment of species based on seed size, and (b) as a buffer against water stress conditions by reducing soil evapotranspiration. Synthesis. We demonstrated the importance of the timing and amount of rainfall for shaping annual plant communities, and identified germination filters as the main process that determined community assemblies. Our results suggest that the phenotypic integration of functional traits facilitates resistance to drought during the life cycle. The BSC-annual plant relationship shifted from negative, by acting as a germination filter, to positive, by acting as a buffer in later stages. Climatic fluctuations and fine scale biotic determinants of spatial heterogeneity emerged as sources of changes in the community assembly in time and space to possibly promote species coexistence and trait differences among the communities studied.",,"We found that autumn droughts acted as abiotic filters by favouring the germination and establishment of species with greater investment in the root biomass. Under severe droughts (66% water reduction), the experimental assemblies were dominated by species with functional traits adapted to water shortage conditions: high leaf dry matter content, low specific leaf area, small individual size, low reproductive ratio and high root:shoot ratio. Species functional traits were estimated based on at least 10 individuals per species, all of which were randomly collected from the study area where the community monoliths were sampled (not from the pots). We obtained functional trait data for about 90% of the species found in our experimental communities. We selected non_correlated functional traits related to different functions and processes associated with plant development and community assembly: (1) seed mass; (2) maximum plant height (omitting inflorescences); (3) SLA; (4) LDMC; (5) reproductive ratio (reproductive:vegetative dry mass ratio); and (6) root:shoot ratio (belowground:aboveground dry mass ratio).","Under severe drought, species with functional traits that facilitated coping with water scarcity dominated the communities. In particular, larger seeded species were favoured under water shortage conditions (Leishman, Wright, Moles, & Westoby, 2000; Metz et al., 2010) as well as short species and species with low reproductive ratios, which indicated their more efficient water use (Eskelinen & Harrison, 2015; Huxman et al., 2013; Karlsson & M_ndez, 2005). Similarly, species with high root:shoot ratios that could acquire water more efficiently during drought events (Craine, 2009; Lloret, Casanovas, & Pe_uelas, 1999; Zeppel, Wilks, & Lewis, 2014) were also favoured in severe drought scenarios. By contrast, plant traits that indicated high growth rates, such as a high SLA and low LDMC (Freschet, Cornelissen, Logtestijn, & Aerts, 2010; Gibert, Gray, Westoby, Wright, & Falster, 2016; Reich, Walters, & Ellsworth, 1997; Wright et al., 2004), were rare in the assemblies under water shortage scenarios. Therefore, we found that species had a higher probability of occurring in the assemblies under drought conditions when they had a higher seed mass, LDMC, and root:shoot ratios, but a lower SLA, reproductive ratio and height.",,Grouped,Establishment,Establishment,Root biomass,Root to shoot ratio,,"higher with increasing root biomass, high root to shoot ratio",,,,,,,,,,"Specifc leaf area, reproductive area, leaf dry matter content",Rooting depth,,Root biomass,,RSR or RMF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Specifc leaf area, reproductive area, leaf dry matter content",,,Drought stress; well-watered,"The rainfall timing treatments did not affect the species richness or plant abundances, but they led to significant differences in the species composition. Thus, the communities that developed in dry autumn conditions and dry spring conditions had similar plant abundances or species richness in the adult stage, but they differed in terms of their species composition. Slight drought or its interaction with rainfall timing had no effect on species composition...the species richness and abundance decreased according to the drought severity...The dry autumn timing decreased the species richness and restricted the range of root:shoot ratio values in the community, which is consistent with the selection of long_rooted species under water restriction scenarios in another study (Craine, 2009). Unexpectedly, we found that the Rao values for reproductive:vegetative and root:shoot traits increased throughout the life cycle of the annual plant communities in the dry autumn treatment. These findings suggest that evolution operates on the entire plant rather than on isolated plant traits (Reich et al., 2003), which is in agreement with other studies that found evidence of multi_trait syndromes across plant organs at the species level (Liu et al., 2010; Reich, 2014; Wright & Westoby, 1999). Overall, our results suggest that traits are phenotypically integrated as an adaptation to multiple ecological dimensions of the Mediterranean climate (Laughlin & Messier, 2015; Tielb_rger et al., 2014). In fact, under severe droughts, the constant CWM and Rao values indicate that the germinated species were already equipped with this set of traits. Thus, germination and seedling establishment appeared to control the community functional diversity throughout the whole growing season (Donohue et al., 2010; Jim_nez_Alfaro, Silveira, Fidelis, Poschlod, & Commander, 2016).",N/A,"Campanula erinus, Micropyrum tenellum, Plantago afra, Asterolinon linum-stellatum, Sharardia arvensis",Central Spain,Biological soil crust perturbation treatment.

Chaparral shrub species along the southwest coast of North America survive wildfire by three different life history types: non-sprouters (NS) are killed by fire and only re-establish through germination of fire-stimulated seeds; facultative sprouters (FS) re-establish by a combination of vegetative sprouting and seed germination; and obligate sprouters (OS) only re-establish by vegetative sprouting because their seeds do not survive fire. 2. Post-fire seedlings of NS and FS re-establish in open canopy gaps, whereas OS seedlings primarily recruit in deep shade during fire-free intervals. 3. It was hypothesized that these life history differences, compared within the same family, Rham naceae, would result in differential seedling resistance to water stress such that NS > FS> OS. 4. Seedlings were grown in large pots in a common garden under treatments of sun, shade, irrigation and water stress. Mortality and physiology of seedlings were monitored for about 1 year. 5. In response to the water stress treatment in full sun, life history types were not different in their dry season predawn water potentials, which were extremely negative (< -9 MPa). Water potential of water-stressed shade grown plants were also not different, but were less negative than the sun treatment during the dry season (about -6 MPa). 6. For plants grown in full sun under water stress, NS exhibited 23% mortality, FS 60% and OS 3 5% mortality, while irrigated controls had greatly reduced mortality across all life histories. Among shade grown plants under water stress, NS exhibited 30% mortality, FS 20% and OS 1% mortality. This pattern of differential mortality was the same for irrigated plants indicating that water stress was not the cause of mortality in the shade. 7. Greater stem and root resistance to water stress induced cavitation were strongly correlated with lower percent mortality during the summer dry season suggesting a link between these traits and fitness. 8. Synthesis. This study finds a link between life history type and water stress tolerance. Consistent with open canopy specialization, NS survived best in full sun. The FS and OS life history type had better survival in the shade. The OS was unexpectedly versatile, surviving well in the sun and shade. The evolutionary history of the life history types is discussed as an important factor in linking water stress tolerance and life history.","Root P90 for the different life history types showed a similar pattern to stemP90 (Table 1). Root P90 for NS (no sprouter) species was more negative that that of FS (facultative) and OS (obligate) species (Table 1 ; Fig. 5). Root P90 was less negative than stem P90 when compared across all species (anova organ term P< 0.001), indicating that roots were generally more susceptible to cavitation.",,"When cavitation resistance was analyzed on a relative basis, that is, a percentage of maximum Kh, roots stood out as being generally more susceptible to cavitation (Table 1; Fig. 5), especially at less negative \|/w. However, when analyzed on an absolute basis (as declines in Ks), a different picture emerges (Fig. 5 insets). Because roots have greater Ks values to start with, they can suffer a steeper decline in conductivity and still remain as hydraulically efficient as stems (Fig. 5 insets; Fig. 6d). This is illustrated by comparing the ^s at \|/min, which shows that root Ks is not different or significantly greater than stem K$ (Fig. 6b,d). Moreover, the shape of root vulnerability curves appears to be different from stems, which is likely important. Roots generally exhibit steep conductivity declines initially likely due to cavitation occurring in large diameter vessels, followed by a levelling off of conductivity where small but resistant vessels remain functional (a convex shape). Stems by contrast typically exhibited linear or con cave shapes indicating the larger vessels were not as highly susceptible. The shape of the root curve resulted in roots maintaining positive Ks values at very low xylem \j/w (Fig. 5), and a convergence of percentage loss of conductivity at relatively high conductivity losses, for example, > 90% (Figs 5 and 6a,c).",,Grouped,Survival,Survival,Xylem resistance,,,Positively correlataed with resistance to root cavitation in full sun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leaf water potential, leaf hydraulic conductivity, leaf cavitation resistance (P90)",,,,,,,,,,Shrub,,,Multiple,,,,,,,Adult,"Scholz, FG; Bucci, SJ; Arias, N; Meinzer, FC; Goldstein, G",OECOLOGIA,English,Article,Elastic modulus; Hydraulic conductivity; Stomatal conductance; Tissue injury; Water relationships,PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATIONSHIPS; SOIL-WATER AVAILABILITY; PATAGONIAN STEPPE; CELL-WALL; HYDRAULIC ARCHITECTURE; ARTEMISIA-TRIDENTATA; FREEZING TOLERANCE; PLANT PHENOLOGY; LEAF; ACCLIMATION,29,2012,10.1007/s00442-012-2368-y,Osmotic and elastic adjustments in cold desert shrubs differing in rooting depth: coping with drought and subzero temperatures,Keep,Kirsten Hein,yes,Effect,,Drought,Trait correlations/ Comparisons - Interspecific,Independent (factor),"Physiological adjustments to enhance tolerance or avoidance of summer drought and winter freezing were studied in shallow- to deep-rooted Patagonian cold desert shrubs.

The aim of this study was to assess the water relationship and hydraulic characteristics of seven Patagonian woody species with different Rooting depth - Maxs. In particular, we focused on seasonal variations in bulk leaf osmotic potential and the bulk elastic modulus. We sought to determine whether osmotic adjustment and increases in cell wall rigidity occur in response to summer drought and subzero temperatures, respectively, and if these responses depend on species-specific patterns of soil water uptake.

On the other hand, shallow-rooted species exposed to large seasonal changes in I-L showed limited osmotic adjustment and incomplete stomatal closure, resulting in turgor loss during periods of drought. The bulk leaf tissue elastic modulus (epsilon) was lower in species with relatively shallow roots. Daily variation in g (S) was larger in shallow-rooted species (more than 50 % of its maximum) and was negatively associated with the difference between I-L at the turgor loss point and minimum I-L (safety margin for turgor maintenance). All species increased epsilon by about 10 MPa during winter. Species with rigid tissue walls exhibited low leaf tissue damage at -20 A degrees C. Our results suggest that osmotic adjustment was the main water relationship adaptation to cope with drought during summer and spring, particularly in deep-rooted plants, and that adjustments in cell wall rigidity during the winter helped to enhance freezing tolerance.","Species behavior was highly dependent on rooting depth.

Studies of shallow-rooted Patagonian shrub species has indicated that they have a high degree of growth responsiveness to summer water pulses (Golluscio et al. 2009; Kowaljowa and Fern_ndez 2011). This behavior, in addition to the high xylem-specific and leaf hydraulic conductivity, support the idea that shallow-rooted Patagonian plants behave opportunistically by growing fast only when water is available for short periods of time in the upper soil layers during the growing season. With the results from this study, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the fast growth responses of shallow-rooted shrubs. On the other hand, the high leaf tissue rigidity of species with deep roots is consistent with the high __ (large driving force for water uptake and transport to the leaves) observed, which could contribute to compensate for the low xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (Bucci et al. 2009, 2011). In conclusion, the species studied varied in the degree of osmotic adjustment during summer depending on rooting depth and access to different types of water sources. Only species with deeper roots were capable of maintaining positive turgor throughout year. On the other hand, species that lost turgor during the summer drought (species with shallow roots and without osmotic adjustment) did not completely close their stomata, perhaps allowing them to maintain CO2 assimilation during the driest period. In addition, the shallow-rooted species had more elastic cell walls and high k L that may allow them to respond rapidly to upper soil layers recharge during rain pulses that occur during the summer. Although all species had more elastic cell walls during the summer, osmotic adjustment was the main water relationship adaptation to cope with drought.",,Grouped,"osmotic adjustment, leaf water potential, bulk leaf tissue elastic modulus, stomtal conductance",Osmotic adjustment,Rooting depth,,,,,bulk leaf tissue elastic modulus,,,Rooting depth,,,,,"stomatal conductance, osmotic potential, leaf water potential, tissue elasticity. stem hydraulic characteristics",Rooting depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"stomatal conductance, osmotic potential, leaf water potential, tissue elasticity. stem hydraulic characteristics",,,Deep-rooted spp v shallow-rooted spp,"The species studied varied in the degree of osmotic adjustment during summer depending on rooting depth and access to different types of water sources.

The present study aimed to characterize the adaptive responses by which temperate herbaceous grassland species resist, survive and recover from a severe drought and to explore the relationships between plant resource use and drought resistance strategies.","Monocultures of six native perennial species from upland grasslands and one Mediterranean drought-resistant cultivar were compared under semi-controlled and non-limiting rooting depth conditions. Above- and below-ground traits were measured under irrigation in spring and during drought in summer (50_d of withholding water) in order to characterize resource use and drought resistance strategies. Plants were then rehydrated and assessed for survival (after 15_d) and recovery (after 1 year). Optimum resource use strategies were identified under irrigation in spring, dehydration avoidance strategy was assessed under moderate drought (20_d of withholding water) and dehydration tolerance was estimated under severe drought (50_d). Plant survival and resilience indices (according to Van Ruijven and Berendse, 2010) were measured 2 weeks and 1 year, respectively, after rehydration. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the drought survival of temperate species mainly depends on dehydration avoidance through water acquisition strategies; (2) accumulation of WSCs, especially fructans and sucrose, in surviving organs including not only leaf meristems, but also all root types and root meristem parts (apex), is associated with dehydration tolerance; and (3) there is a trade-off between high resource use under non-limiting conditions and high ability to survive and recover from severe drought.",,"Pearsonês correlation coefficients (Table 3) showed positive and significant correlations between plant survival and some of the traits measured before drought (leaf elongation rate, root mass and Rooting depth - Max), during moderate drought (high DP fructan content in roots, leaf relative water content, root mass, SWC at leaf growth cessation and water use) and during severe drought (meristem water content, cell membrane stability of leaf meristems and sucrose content in roots). Plant survival was negatively correlated with RDMC, sucrose content in leaf meristems measured at leaf growth cessation, and leaf senescence at the end of drought. The resilience index of spring forage production was positively correlated with Rooting depth - Max, 95 % rooting depth and RDMC measured before drought, and also with cell membrane stability of roots, amount of carbohydrates in roots and sucrose content in the deepest root apices measured after severe drought. The resilience index of spring forage production was also negatively correlated with SLA and SWC at 50 % of leaf senescence. However, only a positive correlation with SWC at leaf growth cessation was observed for the 1 year recovery of greenness and the root resilience index, which were correlated with each other and not with plant survival. The first two axes of the PCA performed with traits related to resource acquisition before drought (Fig. 7A), dehydration avoidance (Fig. 7B) and dehydration tolerance during drought treatment (Fig. 7C) accounted for 75_9, 91_1 and 54_7 % of the total variance observed among species, respectively. For each PCA, plant survival was closely correlated with the first axis: 0_65, _0_74 and _0_73, respectively. The resilience index of spring forage production was correlated with the second axis of the PCA related to resource acquisition (0_74) and dehydration avoidance (0_66). However, 1 year recovery of greenness and the resilience index of spring standing root mass were not explained by these syndromes of traits. The multiple regressions performed with these traits showed that the contribution to plant survival differed according to the strategies with the following decreasing ranking: dehydration tolerance strategy (r2_=_0_76, P_<_0_001), dehydration avoidance (r2_=_0_54, P_<_0_001) and resource acquisition before drought (r2_=_0_44, P_<_0_001). Conversely, the resilience index of spring forage production was mostly associated with the resource acquisition strategy (r2_=_0_68, P_<_0_001). Against our first hypothesis, the results show a similar contribution of dehydration avoidance and tolerance to drought survival in species from temperate upland grassland. Dehydration avoidance is achieved through a combination of responses favouring maximized water uptake and minimized water loss under drought (Ludlow, 1989). The changes in leaf and meristem water content (Table 1) are indicators of the cellular adjustments (accumulation of solutes and/or cell wall hardening) made by the plant to achieve a low water potential while avoiding water loss (Verslues et al., 2006). In our study, leaf relative water content at moderate drought was correlated with root mass, water use and plant survival (Fig. 7B; Table 3), which confirms that maximizing water uptake during drought is an important mechanism in maintaining the hydration of lamina (Passioura, 1981; Chaves and Pereira, 1992; Volaire et al., 2009; Lelièvre et al., 2011). Although, the pot diameter may have impacted the lateral distribution of the roots (Poorter et al., 2012a), the length of the tubes (1_5_m) allowed a good estimation of root depth potential for the seven species. As previously shown for other species (Jackson et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2005; Volaire, 2008), water uptake is mainly associated with initial root mass and Rooting depth - Max (Fig. 7A). The species with higher root mass and Rooting depth - Max, such as T. officinale, D. glomerata _Medlyê, D. glomerata and F. arundinacea, had a higher water use before and during moderate drought (Tables 1 and 3; Fig. 7B). In arid and semi-arid environments, relatively small proportions of roots in deeper, moister soil layers may suffice to sustain water absorption of plants (Ehleringer and Dawson, 1992). The maintenance of water uptake by roots during a drought period is mainly driven by hydraulic continuity between soil, roots and leaves, which all depend on plant transpiration, hydraulic properties of roots (Passioura, 1988) and also on root morphology and anatomy (North and Nobel, 1991; Rieger and Litvin, 1999; Huang and Eissenstat, 2000; Steudle, 2000; Hern_ndez et al., 2010). Among-species differences observed on leaf relative water content, meristem water content and RDMC (Table 1) suggest differences in water acquisition strategy, and therefore in the ability to maintain water uptake, explained by rooting depth (Fig. 7A, B; Table 3) and differences in root diameter and tissue density (Picon-Cochard et al., 2012). Overall, root lifespan maintenance during drought could be related to root hydration maintenance by the hydraulic lift mechanism (Bauerle et al., 2008), cell osmotic increase in cortex cells (Sharps and Davies, 1979) and suberization of the endoderm protecting xylem cells against dehydration, which could explain at least part of the increase in RDMC and decrease in plant water content (Table 1). The species able to maintain a root production during moderate drought, such as T. officinale and D. glomerata _Medlyê (Table 1; Fig. 2), had higher drought survival rates (Fig. 6B). Root growth maintenance under moderate water stress was also identified as an important mechanism to avoid dehydration by maximizing water uptake through an increase in root absorption area (Passioura, 1981, 1988; Vartanian, 1981; P_rez-Ramos et al., 2013).Other mechanisms, such as modifications in water use efficiency and regulation of stomatal conductance, are involved in dehydration avoidance (Jones et al., 1981; Chaves and Pereira, 1992; Golluscio and Oesterheld, 2007). In addition, when stress intensifies, increased leaf senescence contributes to the minimization of water loss by reducing leaf area and evaporation (Ludlow, 1989; Gepstein, 2004). In this study, leaf senescence, which was inversely correlated with plant survival, was not adaptive but rather an indicator of drought vulnerability (Fig. 7C; Table 3). Conversely, gradual foliage senescence was positively correlated with plant survival in a range of Mediterranean grasses (Volaire et al., 1998b; Volaire and Lelièvre, 2001; P_rez-Ramos et al., 2013). This suggests differences in plant strategies for dehydration avoidance between temperate and Mediterranean herbaceous plants, which can exhibit summer dormancy with induced foliage senescence, as a specific strategy to survive extreme drought (Volaire and Norton, 2006). This study shows that plant survival is associated with high leaf meristem hydration and cell membrane stability under severe drought (Table 3; Fig. 4), which confirms that the ability of plant to protect leaf meristems is a key mechanism of dehydration resistance (including both avoidance and tolerance strategies) to ensure plant survival (Volaire et al., 1998b; Volaire and Lelièvre, 2001).","Which tarits are correlated with survival vary by drought, moderate drought, severe drought. Dehydration avoidance through water uptake was associated with species that had deep roots (>1_2 m) and high root mass (>4 kg m_3). Cell membrane stability ensuring dehydration tolerance of roots and meristems was positively correlated with fructan content and negatively correlated with sucrose content. Species that survived and recovered best combined high resource acquisition in spring (leaf elongation rate >9 mm d_1 and rooting depth >1_2 m) with both high dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies. We have shown that the presence of storage organs having a high WSC content is a key clonal trait to resist and recover from extreme drought. However, to compare drought strategies of forbs with those of grasses on a level playing field, it will be necessary in the future to study more forb species. The Mediterranean cultivar of D. glomerata survived better than the ecotype of cocksfoot of upland origin, probably because of the higher initial fructan level in its leaf meristems, confirming previous results for this cultivar (Volaire, 1995; Volaire and Lelièvre, 2001). However, the recovery of D. glomerata and its Mediterranean cultivar 1 year after drought was similar, emphasizing the capacity for resilience of the native species after a severe drought. .Key Results Dehydration avoidance through water uptake was associated with species that had deep roots (>1_2_m) and high root mass (>4_kg_m_3). Cell membrane stability ensuring dehydration tolerance of roots and meristems was positively correlated with fructan content and negatively correlated with sucrose content. Species that survived and recovered best combined high resource acquisition in spring (leaf elongation rate >9_mm_d_1 and rooting depth >1_2_m) with both high dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies.Conclusions Most of the native forage species, dominant in upland grassland, were able to survive and recover from extreme drought, but with various time lags. Overall the results suggest that the wide range of interspecific functional strategies for coping with drought may enhance the resilience of upland grassland plant communities under extreme drought events.","Perennial herbaceous species are interesting plant models, since they can resist and survive severe drought through adaptive strategies contributing to dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance (Ludlow, 1989; Blum, 1996). Under moderate drought, dehydration avoidance ensures the maintenance of plant tissue hydration and osmotic potential by maximizing water uptake and minimizing water losses (Ludlow, 1989; Volaire et al., 2009). Under severe drought, once complete leaf senescence is reached, dehydration tolerance ensures plant survival by maintaining cell integrity in meristematic tissues through cell membrane stabilization and accumulation of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) and dehydrins (Volaire et al., 1998a, b; Verslues et al., 2006). Grassland C3 Poaceae and Asteraceae species of temperate areas accumulate large amounts of reserve carbohydrates mainly as fructans in leaf meristems, and contain only a low level of starch (Chatterton et al., 1989; Pollock and Cairns, 1991; Jane_ek et al., 2011; Jensen et al., 2014). Furthermore, it has been shown that fructan accumulation during drought improves plant survival after drought (Volaire et al., 1998a; Clark et al., 2004). Fructans in particular were shown to stabilize membranes in vitro by interaction with lipids under stress (Vereyken et al., 2001, 2003; Hincha et al., 2002, 2007) and because they may act as antioxidants (Peshev et al., 2013). These compounds play an indirect role in drought survival when they are hydrolysed to fuel growth after rehydration (Volaire et al., 1998b; Thomas and James, 1999; Amiard et al., 2003). Under progressive soil drying, higher biomass allocation to roots (Poorter et al., 2012b) and an extensive root system have been commonly observed in drought-resistant species (Comas et al., 2013), since deep roots can take up water from moister soil layers. Under severe soil drought conditions, root mortality increases due to tissue dehydration (Eissenstat and Yanai, 1997; Facette et al., 1999). However, it has been shown in Lolium perenne that some roots can survive very dry conditions (soil water content less than _10_MPa), especially root apices, and that production of lateral roots from existing roots is observed after soil rewetting (Jupp and Newman, 1987). Thus, maintaining live roots in severe soil drying conditions should enhance plant recovery (Weaver and Zink, 1946; Huang et al., 1997). However, despite their crucial role in water uptake under drought, below-ground plant traits remain poorly quantified compared with leaf traits (Reich, 2014). The combination of these plant responses depends on species and genotypes, and can be investigated by assessing leaf and root traits (P_rez-Ramos et al., 2013) associated with water status and WSC metabolism (Volaire, 2008). Despite a decline in cell membrane stability, this comparative study clearly reveals a positive correlation between high DP fructan content and cell membrane stability in roots for all the species, except for the most sensitive one, P. trivialis (Fig. 5). This can be attributed to the role of fructans in cell membrane protection (Valluru and Van den Ende, 2008; Livingston et al., 2009). While several studies have demonstrated this role through in vitro approaches (Vereyken et al., 2001; Hincha et al., 2002, 2007), only one study on D. glomerata supported it in planta (Volaire et al., 1998b). The present data corroborate the protective role of fructans in D. glomerata and support it in a broader panel of temperate species, including a forb and several grass species. In leaves of resurrection plants which do not accumulate fructans, sucrose is the main carbohydrate contributing to drought tolerance by membrane and protein stabilization (Ingram and Bartels, 1996; Scott, 2000). In fructan-accumulating plants, fructans might play this role. In addition, we found that the cell membrane stability of roots was not significantly correlated to plant survival (Table 3). This suggests that dehydration tolerance of the root system was not enough to ensure plant survival, underlining the role of leaf meristems in re-growth capacity after rehydration in species from upland grasslands and especially in the Mediterranean cultivar. As in Ludlow (1989), the present results show that species were able to combine strategies for resource acquisition and strategies for drought resistance (Fig. 7; Table 3). The highest drought survival and resilience of spring forage production was observed for the fast-growing species with a higher leaf elongation rate and deeper roots. However, a dehydration avoidance strategy mainly based on maximizing water acquisition was not efficient enough to ensure plant survival and fast recovery in the case of F. arundinacea. This species had a deep root system and a high root mass, but was unable to maintain leaf and meristem water content, and therefore had a low survival rate (Table 1; Fig. 6B). All the species showed dehydration avoidance and tolerance mechanisms involving sucrose accumulation and/or fructan maintenance in plant organs. We have shown that the presence of storage organs having a high WSC content is a key clonal trait to resist and recover from extreme drought. However, to compare drought strategies of forbs with those of grasses on a level playing field, it will be necessary in the future to study more forb species. The Mediterranean cultivar of D. glomerata survived better than the ecotype of cocksfoot of upland origin, probably because of the higher initial fructan level in its leaf meristems, confirming previous results for this cultivar (Volaire, 1995; Volaire and Lelièvre, 2001). However, the recovery of D. glomerata and its Mediterranean cultivar 1 year after drought was similar, emphasizing the capacity for resilience of the native species after a severe drought. ",,Grouped,Survival (before drought),Survival,Root biomass,Rooting depth,,increase with root biomass and rooting depth,survival during moderate drought,Survival,NSC,Root biomass,Root dry matter content,,,"increase with DP fructan content in roots, root mass)","survival (severe drought) - increase with sucrose content in roots; survival negatively correlated with root dry matter content; Resilience index of sprin forage production positively coorelated with Rooting depth - Max, Rooting depth - 95%, RDMC, cell membrane stability of roots, carbohydrates in roots and sucrose content in the deepest root apices )after severe drought).",,Rooting depth - Max,,Root dry matter content,,Root biomass,,Root to shoot ratio,,Rooting depth - 95%,,,,,,,,,,,,,"specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content,",,,,,"45ç47_N, 03ç05_E",,,,Quantative,Forb,Graminoid,,Multiple,Potted - Outside,Experimental,,,,,Seedling,"Guderle, M; Bachmann, D; Milcu, A; Gockele, A; Bechmann, M; Fischer, C; Roscher, C; Landais, D; Ravel, O; Devidal, S; Roy, J; Gessler, A; Buchmann, N; Weigelt, A; Hildebrandt, A",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,English,Article,biodiversity-ecosystem functioning; evapotranspiration; niche partitioning; plant species richness; root water uptake; soil moisture,SPECIES RICHNESS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SEASONAL-VARIATION; DROUGHT STRESS; LENGTH DENSITY; SOIL-MOISTURE; RAIN-FOREST; LEAF-AREA; BIODIVERSITY; COMPLEMENTARITY,6,2018,10.1111/1365-2435.12948,Dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake facilitates efficient water use in more diverse grassland plant communities,Keep,Jonathan Bertram,yes,Effect - Community,,Drought,Niche partitioning,Independent (factor),"The aim of our study was to investigate characteristics of root water uptake profiles in grassland plant communities with different species richness and productivity to gain a deeper understanding of how plant species richness affects efficient use of available soil water. We hypothesized that increasing plant species richness leads to (1) increased evapotranspiration rates due to increased transpiring area, and (2) spatial and temporal complementarity in root water uptake, such that plants acquire more unexploited soil resources to cover the enhanced water demand. Specifically, we investigated how communities with 4 and 16 grassland species extracted from a long_term biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment; Roscher et al., 2004) differed in their water uptake profiles as estimated in a controlled environment facility for ecosystem research (the CNRS European Ecotron of Montpellier; Milcu et al., 2014).","The predicted root water uptake profiles were used to investigate whether differences in depth and quantity of water uptake between 4_species and 16_species mixtures occurred. Furthermore, we compared the normalized root water uptake profiles and the normalized root length density profiles. This gives insight into dynamic niche partitioning in the examined ecosystems, which is indicated when root water uptake profiles differ from root length density profiles.","Efficient extraction of soil water is essential for the productivity of plant communities. However, research on the complementary use of resources in mixed plant communities, and especially the impact of plant species richness on root water uptake, is limited. So far, these investigations have been hindered by a lack of methods allowing for the estimation of root water uptake profiles. The overarching aim of our study was to determine whether diverse grassland plant communities in general exploit soil water more deeply and whether this shift occurs all the time or only during times of enhanced water demand. Root water uptake was derived by analysing the diurnal decrease in soil water content separately at each measurement depth, thus yielding root water uptake profiles for 12 experimental grasslands communities with two different levels of species richness (4 and 16 sown species). Additional measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and root traits were used to identify differences in water relations between plant functional groups. Although the vertical root distribution did not differ between diversity levels, root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit. Our results indicate that the more diverse communities were able to adjust their root water uptake, resulting in increased water uptake per root area compared to less diverse communities (52% at 20cm, 118% at 30cm, and 570% at 60cm depth) and a more even distribution of water uptake over depth. Tall herbs, which had lower leaf water potential and higher stomatal conductance in more diverse mixtures, contributed disproportionately to dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake. This study underpins the role of diversity in stabilizing ecosystem function and mitigating drought stress effects during future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that root water uptake is not solely controlled by root length density distribution in communities with high plant diversity but also by spatial shifts in water acquisition. A is available for this article.","In general, the modelled community evapotranspiration explained measured evapotranspiration very well (R2 = 0.77, p < .001; Figure A4), thus giving confidence in the ability of the model to derive root water uptake profiles. On all investigated days, the measured ET of the 16_species mixtures was significantly higher than the ET of the 4_species mixtures (Figure 1). On average, ET was 18% higher in June and 27% higher in July in the 16_species mixtures compared to the 4_species mixtures. Leaf area index and ET (mean over all measurement days) were positively related (R2 = 0.73, p < .001; Figure 2), and the 16_species mixtures had significantly higher LAI than the 4_species mixtures (Figure 3b). In both June and July RWU decreased with depth (Table 1). The interaction between species richness and depth was significant in June, but not in July, indicating that uptake profiles were different between the 4_species and the 16_species mixtures in June (see also Figure 4). Separate analyses per depth showed that 16_species mixtures had a higher root water uptake at 20 cm depth (+86%) and 30 cm depth (+124%) compared to the 4_species mixtures in June (Table 2). In July when the VPD increased (Figure A5), we found a higher root water uptake at 20 cm depth (+52%), 30 cm (+118%) and 60 cm depth (+570%) in the 16_species compared to the 4_species mixtures (Table 2).","Briefly, our results indicate dynamic niche partitioning in diverse plots, likely involving primarily tall herbs, which decrease their leaf water potentials, thus maintaining high flow rates throughout the root system (Doussan et al., 2006), extract water from deeper soil layers, and contribute to enhanced transpiration.. Root length density good predictor of community water use in 4 species but not 16 species mixture. Here, proportional RWU is substantially smaller than the proportion of RLD at 10 cm depth (about 32%), whereas it is considerably higher than the proportion of RLD in deeper layers (about 17% at 20 cm and 10% at 30 cm). This difference strengthened on 17th July 2012, the day with the highest evapotranspiration among the considered days. Root area index, a measure of root surface per area soil surface, was not significantly different between diversity levels (Figure 3a, Table A2). In contrast, the RAI:LAI ratio was marginally significantly higher in 4_species mixtures than in 16_species mixtures (p = .084, Table A2), suggesting that the transpiring surface areas were higher in 16_species mixtures while the relative surface for water uptake, the RAI, was similar at both diversity levels. Hence, uptake velocity (flux per unit root area) probably increased in 16_species mixtures. Furthermore, we found a higher cover of tall herbs in 16_species mixtures than in 4_species mixtures as well as a significant effect of cover of tall herbs on root water uptake at 30 cm in June and in July (Table 2) for 16_species mixtures. At higher levels of plant species diversity, we found significantly higher root water uptake at 20 and 30 cm depths in June and at 20, 30 and 60 cm depths in July. This shift of root water uptake to deeper layers can be explained by the increased VPD in July, which leads to a higher evapotranspiration demand during this time, especially for the 16_species mixtures with their higher LAI values compared to the 4_species mixtures. Remarkably, in our study RLD was similar between the two diversity levels throughout most of the soil depths, and differed (slightly) only in the topmost soil (0_5 cm). The same applies for BGBM. Thus, there is no evidence for a spatial below_ground niche differentiation with regard to root abundance within the two considered species_richness levels. However, although we found no spatial root niche differentiation, water uptake shifted towards deeper, less densely rooted soil layers. This finding suggests a dynamic (functional) niche partitioning (shift in uptake patterns) in more diverse plant communities. In summary, the more diverse communities in this experiment consisted of more plants with the capacity to extend their root water uptake deeper into the soil, such that the water use of the entire community was more uniformly distributed over the depth profile (_sampling effectÓ). Presumably, plants with root systems structured in transport and uptake roots, like tall herbs, have an advantage because they can explore the soil water more dynamically. Furthermore, the comparison between June and July showed that some species in more diverse plant communities could escape possible competition for water by exploiting deeper water resources, especially if the evapotranspiration demand is increased (complementarity). This study underpins the idea that root water uptake is not solely characterized by root length distribution but is also affected by dynamic shifts in water uptake due to temporal changes in environmental conditions. A pre_requisite for such plasticity is the ability of specific plant species to explore deeper soil layers. This dynamic water uptake requires a low leaf water potential in combination with a particular plant root structure to transport the water from the soil to the atmosphere. In our experiment, such a shift in water uptake was enhanced in more diverse plant communities, likely evoked by specific plant species such as tall herbs, since their abundances were higher in the more diverse grassland plant communities.","Enhanced transpiration could be explained by more efficient water extraction (Kulmatiski & Beard, 2013), by which we mean the optimal acquisition of soil water within plant communities instead of the common ecophysiological concept of water use efficiency, which describes the productivity of plants depending on the volume of water that they use (Milcu et al., 2014; Stanhill, 1986). Furthermore, niche partitioning has been suggested as the basis for species complementarity in diverse communities (Hooper, 1998; Loreau & Hector, 2001; Schenk, 2006) and for the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Cardinale et al., 2007; Hooper et al., 2005). For example, plant communities containing species with different root distribution patterns might be able to occupy a larger niche space and thus can acquire more unexploited soil resources compared to communities containing species with similar root distributions (Berendse, 1982; De Kroon et al., 2012; Mommer et al., 2010; Mueller, Tilman, Fornara, & Hobbie, 2013). In this context, diversity in root traits such as root length density (RLD), maximum and minimum root depth, root foraging behaviour, and root system architecture possibly plays a key role in ecosystem functioning (Schenk, 2006). Furthermore, research shows that the diversity of root traits is even more important than the taxonomic richness, as it allows accounting for different spatial below_ground niches in diverse plant communities (Cody, 1986; Schenk, 2006; Silvertown, 2004; Stubbs & Wilson, 2004). Such niche differentiation in rooting patterns may result in community_specific root water uptake profiles, soil water fluxes, and storage, which are probably key to achieving more efficient water acquisition in diverse plant communities (Schwendenmann, Pendall, Sanchez_Bragado, Kunert, & H_lscher, 2014; Zea_Cabrera et al., 2006). Investigations of below_ground niche partitioning typically rely on assessing root length density at different depths, thus implying that root distribution reflects capacity for resource uptake. However, several studies show that root water uptake profiles may shift independently of root length distribution (Garrigues, Doussan, & Pierret, 2006; Hamblin & Tennant, 1987). This is because root water uptake is also related to root hydraulic properties (Kulmatiski & Beard, 2013; Kulmatiski, Beard, Verweij, & February, 2010; Nimah & Hanks, 1973), soil salinity, soil water distribution (Doussan, Pierret, Garrigues, & Pagès, 2006; Garrigues et al., 2006; Van der Ploeg, Gooren, Bakker, & de Rooij, 2008), the amount of fine roots, and the architecture of root systems (Javaux, Couvreur, Vanderborgth, & Vereecken, 2013; Nepstedt et al., 1994; Rosado et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2009; Williams et al., 1998) as well as the transpiration of leaves (Jackson, Sperry, & Dawson, 2000; Quijano, Kumar, Drewry, Goldstein, & Misson, 2012; Steudle, 2000). For example, Rossatto, Sternberg, and Franco (2012) found that herbs are able to adjust their water uptake in dry and wet seasons in a Neotropical savanna. Similarly, Volkmann, Haberer, Gessler, and Weiler (2016) observed that tree species, i.e. oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) and a mixed culture of oak and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), had the ability to shift water uptake towards deeper soil layers when needed and proved that RLD alone does not control water uptake distribution. Thus, plant species identity (Hamblin & Tennant, 1987), root architecture (Bechmann et al., 2014), and temporal and spatial plasticity in below_ground resource use could be major drivers of niche partitioning or competition for soil resources (Ashton, Miller, Bowman, & Suding, 2010; Callaway, Pennings, & Richards, 2003; Hildebrandt & Eltahir, 2007; Kulmatiski & Beard, 2013) and independent approaches are warranted to assess differences in root water uptake between ecosystems. However, how species_specific strategies interact to affect the community_level soil water uptake in species rich communities remains poorly understood. Although root water uptake profiles provide detailed information on resource uptake, plant growth, nutrient cycling, and species coexistence (Kulmatiski, Adler, Stark, & Tredennick, 2017), the majority of studies measured only total water fluxes, and did not differentiate it according to depth. We address this knowledge gap by using a data_driven method to estimate root water uptake profiles, such as by combining measurements of short_term fluctuations of soil water content (Guderle & Hildebrandt, 2015) with lysimeter_measured evapotranspiration.",,4 species mixture,Transpiration (water extraction),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, leaf area index, specific leaf area",Root length density,comp - no difference,Root biomass,comp - no difference,root water uptake,comp - lower,root area index,comp - no difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, leaf area index, specific leaf area",,,experimental,"root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60 cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit.

We hypothesized that increasing plant species richness leads to (1) increased evapotranspiration rates due to increased transpiring area, and (2) spatial and temporal complementarity in root water uptake, such that plants acquire more unexploited soil resources to cover the enhanced water demand. Specifically, we investigated how communities with 4 and 16 grassland species extracted from a long_term biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment; Roscher et al., 2004) differed in their water uptake profiles as estimated in a controlled environment facility for ecosystem research (the CNRS European Ecotron of Montpellier; Milcu et al., 2014).","The predicted root water uptake profiles were used to investigate whether differences in depth and quantity of water uptake between 4_species and 16_species mixtures occurred. Furthermore, we compared the normalized root water uptake profiles and the normalized root length density profiles. This gives insight into dynamic niche partitioning in the examined ecosystems, which is indicated when root water uptake profiles differ from root length density profiles.","Efficient extraction of soil water is essential for the productivity of plant communities. However, research on the complementary use of resources in mixed plant communities, and especially the impact of plant species richness on root water uptake, is limited. So far, these investigations have been hindered by a lack of methods allowing for the estimation of root water uptake profiles. The overarching aim of our study was to determine whether diverse grassland plant communities in general exploit soil water more deeply and whether this shift occurs all the time or only during times of enhanced water demand. Root water uptake was derived by analysing the diurnal decrease in soil water content separately at each measurement depth, thus yielding root water uptake profiles for 12 experimental grasslands communities with two different levels of species richness (4 and 16 sown species). Additional measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and root traits were used to identify differences in water relations between plant functional groups. Although the vertical root distribution did not differ between diversity levels, root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit. Our results indicate that the more diverse communities were able to adjust their root water uptake, resulting in increased water uptake per root area compared to less diverse communities (52% at 20cm, 118% at 30cm, and 570% at 60cm depth) and a more even distribution of water uptake over depth. Tall herbs, which had lower leaf water potential and higher stomatal conductance in more diverse mixtures, contributed disproportionately to dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake. This study underpins the role of diversity in stabilizing ecosystem function and mitigating drought stress effects during future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that root water uptake is not solely controlled by root length density distribution in communities with high plant diversity but also by spatial shifts in water acquisition. A is available for this article.","In general, the modelled community evapotranspiration explained measured evapotranspiration very well (R2 = 0.77, p < .001; Figure A4), thus giving confidence in the ability of the model to derive root water uptake profiles. On all investigated days, the measured ET of the 16_species mixtures was significantly higher than the ET of the 4_species mixtures (Figure 1). On average, ET was 18% higher in June and 27% higher in July in the 16_species mixtures compared to the 4_species mixtures. Leaf area index and ET (mean over all measurement days) were positively related (R2 = 0.73, p < .001; Figure 2), and the 16_species mixtures had significantly higher LAI than the 4_species mixtures (Figure 3b). In both June and July RWU decreased with depth (Table 1). The interaction between species richness and depth was significant in June, but not in July, indicating that uptake profiles were different between the 4_species and the 16_species mixtures in June (see also Figure 4). Separate analyses per depth showed that 16_species mixtures had a higher root water uptake at 20 cm depth (+86%) and 30 cm depth (+124%) compared to the 4_species mixtures in June (Table 2). In July when the VPD increased (Figure A5), we found a higher root water uptake at 20 cm depth (+52%), 30 cm (+118%) and 60 cm depth (+570%) in the 16_species compared to the 4_species mixtures (Table 2).","Briefly, our results indicate dynamic niche partitioning in diverse plots, likely involving primarily tall herbs, which decrease their leaf water potentials, thus maintaining high flow rates throughout the root system (Doussan et al., 2006), extract water from deeper soil layers, and contribute to enhanced transpiration.. Root length density good predictor of community water use in 4 species but not 16 species mixture. Here, proportional RWU is substantially smaller than the proportion of RLD at 10 cm depth (about 32%), whereas it is considerably higher than the proportion of RLD in deeper layers (about 17% at 20 cm and 10% at 30 cm). This difference strengthened on 17th July 2012, the day with the highest evapotranspiration among the considered days. Root area index, a measure of root surface per area soil surface, was not significantly different between diversity levels (Figure 3a, Table A2). In contrast, the RAI:LAI ratio was marginally significantly higher in 4_species mixtures than in 16_species mixtures (p = .084, Table A2), suggesting that the transpiring surface areas were higher in 16_species mixtures while the relative surface for water uptake, the RAI, was similar at both diversity levels. Hence, uptake velocity (flux per unit root area) probably increased in 16_species mixtures. Furthermore, we found a higher cover of tall herbs in 16_species mixtures than in 4_species mixtures as well as a significant effect of cover of tall herbs on root water uptake at 30 cm in June and in July (Table 2) for 16_species mixtures. At higher levels of plant species diversity, we found significantly higher root water uptake at 20 and 30 cm depths in June and at 20, 30 and 60 cm depths in July. This shift of root water uptake to deeper layers can be explained by the increased VPD in July, which leads to a higher evapotranspiration demand during this time, especially for the 16_species mixtures with their higher LAI values compared to the 4_species mixtures. Remarkably, in our study RLD was similar between the two diversity levels throughout most of the soil depths, and differed (slightly) only in the topmost soil (0_5 cm). The same applies for BGBM. Thus, there is no evidence for a spatial below_ground niche differentiation with regard to root abundance within the two considered species_richness levels. However, although we found no spatial root niche differentiation, water uptake shifted towards deeper, less densely rooted soil layers. This finding suggests a dynamic (functional) niche partitioning (shift in uptake patterns) in more diverse plant communities. In summary, the more diverse communities in this experiment consisted of more plants with the capacity to extend their root water uptake deeper into the soil, such that the water use of the entire community was more uniformly distributed over the depth profile (_sampling effectÓ). Presumably, plants with root systems structured in transport and uptake roots, like tall herbs, have an advantage because they can explore the soil water more dynamically. Furthermore, the comparison between June and July showed that some species in more diverse plant communities could escape possible competition for water by exploiting deeper water resources, especially if the evapotranspiration demand is increased (complementarity). This study underpins the idea that root water uptake is not solely characterized by root length distribution but is also affected by dynamic shifts in water uptake due to temporal changes in environmental conditions. A pre_requisite for such plasticity is the ability of specific plant species to explore deeper soil layers. This dynamic water uptake requires a low leaf water potential in combination with a particular plant root structure to transport the water from the soil to the atmosphere. In our experiment, such a shift in water uptake was enhanced in more diverse plant communities, likely evoked by specific plant species such as tall herbs, since their abundances were higher in the more diverse grassland plant communities.","Enhanced transpiration could be explained by more efficient water extraction (Kulmatiski & Beard, 2013), by which we mean the optimal acquisition of soil water within plant communities instead of the common ecophysiological concept of water use efficiency, which describes the productivity of plants depending on the volume of water that they use (Milcu et al., 2014; Stanhill, 1986). Furthermore, niche partitioning has been suggested as the basis for species complementarity in diverse communities (Hooper, 1998; Loreau & Hector, 2001; Schenk, 2006) and for the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Cardinale et al., 2007; Hooper et al., 2005). For example, plant communities containing species with different root distribution patterns might be able to occupy a larger niche space and thus can acquire more unexploited soil resources compared to communities containing species with similar root distributions (Berendse, 1982; De Kroon et al., 2012; Mommer et al., 2010; Mueller, Tilman, Fornara, & Hobbie, 2013). In this context, diversity in root traits such as root length density (RLD), maximum and minimum root depth, root foraging behaviour, and root system architecture possibly plays a key role in ecosystem functioning (Schenk, 2006). Furthermore, research shows that the diversity of root traits is even more important than the taxonomic richness, as it allows accounting for different spatial below_ground niches in diverse plant communities (Cody, 1986; Schenk, 2006; Silvertown, 2004; Stubbs & Wilson, 2004).

A second trade-off could arise between safety and construction cost. A good indicator of construction cost is wood density. If thicker vessel walls and more robust pit membranes translate into less air permeability, then cavitation resistance should be associated with higher wood densities. There are also potential interactions between conduit diameter and wood density: a xylem with small (more resistant?) conduits may tend to show a higher wood density than a xylem with wide (and more susceptible?) conduits. However, this relationship is complicated by the contribution of non-conducting xylem fibers and other cell types to wood density.","Stems segments 30_75 cm long were cut from the plants, were immediately wrapped in plastic bags and brought back to laboratory. Root segments 20_30 cm long were cut from roots of different diameter classes in 20_50 cm depth. Root segments were also tightly wrapped in plastic bags to minimize dehydration. In the laboratory, all segments were cut under water to a standard length of 14 cm. The cut ends were trimmed with a razor blade. Segments were then flushed with deionized and filtered (0.2 µm) water at a pressure of 50_70 kPa for 30 min to remove residual embolism. After flushing, the saturated, initial kh (kh_i) of a segment was measured using a balance with an accurracy to 0.00001 g (Sartorius BP 211 D, Sartorius AG, G_ttingen, Germany) connected with a computer. Hydraulic conductivity was calculated as the mass flow rate of water (kg s_1) through a segment divided by the pressure gradient along the segment (MPa m_1). Segments were then spun in a Sorvall RC 5C centrifuge (Sorvall, Newton, CT, USA) for _3 min at target pressure. The ends of the samples were held in _LÓ shaped plexiglass reservoirs and were immersed in water while spinning. Immediately after centrifuging, kh was remeasured. The percentage that kh was below kh_i gave the percent embolism induced while spinning. By plotting minimum xylem pressure vs. the corresponding embolism level, we obtained a _vulnerability curveÓ. Root curves were based on 8_15 segments per species, stem curves were based on 6_9 segments.","Shrubs of the Great Basin desert in Utah are subjected to a prolonged summer drought. One potential consequence of drought is a reduced water transport capability of the xylem. This is due to drought-induced cavitation. We used the centrifuge method to measure the vulnerability of root and stem xylem to cavitation in six native shrub species. The shrubs fall into three categories with regards to rooting depth, vegetative phenology and plant water status during drought. The ""summer green"" group (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex confertifolia) sustains summer drought with a relatively shallow root system (<2.5 m), but maintains leaf area. A ""drought deciduous"" group (Grayia spinosa, Tetradymia glabrata) has shallow roots but responds to drought by dropping leaves. A ""phreatophytic"" group (e.g. Chrysothamnus nauseosus) avoids low water potentials by developing a deep root system that gives them access to deeper soil moisture. We hypothesized that cavitation resistance across these groups was adjusted to the amount of drought stress a species experienced. Drought experience was quantified by measuring plant water potentials over two growing seasons. As expected, we found a significant relationship between the cavitation resistance of roots and stems of a species and the minimum seasonal water potential. Shallow rooted, drought deciduous species showed the lowest water potentials prior to leaf shedding and they had the most resistant xylem. The phreatophytic shrub Chrysothamnus nauseosus always maintained favourable water potentials and had the most susceptible xylem, and summer green species were intermediate. This correlation between cavitation resistance and water potential suggests that a safe xylem is associated with some ""cost"" for the plant. We could identify two costs or trade-offs. The first trade-off was between safety and transport efficiency as reflected by vessel diameter. In 5 out of 7 species, there was an intraspecific relationship between vessel diameter and cavitation resistance. Roots, having larger vessels than branches, were also more vulnerable to xylem dysfunction. There was also an interspecific correlation between vessel diameter and cavitation resistance, but only for combined root and stem data. A second trade-off was found between safety and construction cost. Resistant xylem was strongly correlated with high wood densities, suggesting that thicker cell walls and/or narrower conduits translate into lower air permeability. Air entry into the conduit is known to be the cause of cavitation.","In all species, roots (Fig. 2A) were clearly more vulnerable to cavitation than stems (Fig. 2B). Within roots, samples of the phreatophyte C. nauseosus were most susceptible (Fig. 2A, open circles), roots of the two drought deciduous species were most resistant (Fig. 2A, closed symbols), and roots of the summer green species were intermediate (Fig. 2A, gray symbols).","...we found a significant relationship between the cavitation resistance of roots and stems of a species and the minimum seasonal water potential.

This correlation between cavitation resistance and water potential suggests that a safe xylem is associated with some _costÓ for the plant....   roots more vulnerable than stems. Cavitation resistance is likely to be associated with other parameters that determine plant _, like rooting depth. C. nauseosus, a deep rooted species, showed the highest water potentials and the most susceptible xylem. Shallow rooted species had lower water potentials and were more resistant to cavitation. A caveat to this statement is that relative rooting depth was assessed from literature data (Table 1), and from predawn water potentials. We are planning excavations to measure root distribution at the site directly. ","Previous work has shown that plants differ widely in their susceptibility to cavitation (Tyree et al. 1994). Often, there are also large differences within a plant. Roots are usually more vulnerable to cavitation than stems (Sperry & Saliendra 1994, Hacke & Sauter 1996, Mencuccini & Comstock 1997). _Air seedingÓ (Zimmermann 1983) or drought-induced cavitation occurs when air is sucked from an embolized into a water-filled, functional conduit. Air enters the functional conduit through the largest pore of an intervessel pit membrane (Tyree et al. 1994, Jarbeau et al. 1995). According to the capillary equation, droughtinduced cavitation is a function of the pore diameter and of the pressure difference between embolized and functional conduits. The pressure in embolized conduits is atmospheric. In functional conduits, xylem pressure can be as low as _5 MPa or even lower (Pockman et al. 1995). Our main hypothesis was that a speciesê cavitation resistance would vary according to the degree of drought the species experienced. Generally, riparian species show a susceptible xylem whereas desert shrubs are more cavitation resistant (e.g., Pockman et al. 1995). We expected to see an adjustment of cavitation resistance even within co-occurring species that differ in their water status as a result of variation in rooting depth and vegetative phenology. Drought stress in each species was quantified by measuring plant _ over two growing seasons (1998 and 1999). If the hypothesis is right and cavitation resistance varies with drought experience, then this would indicate that a safe xylem is in some way costly for the plant. If a resistant xylem was not associated with some cost for the plant, then all plants should show an equally resistant xylem and should simply avoid cavitation. The nature of this potential penalty is not clear yet. One possible trade-off could be between cavitation resistance and hydraulic conductance (_efficiency versus safetyÓ, Zimmermann 1983). It follows from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation that wide vessels are much more efficient than smaller ones (Zimmermann 1983), but wide vessels may also be more prone to dysfunction than small conduits. As hypothesized, differences in drought experience resulting from the different water use strategies (Fig. 1) agreed with vulnerability to cavitation (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Species that experienced low water potentials during drought had resistant xylem, species with a more favourable water status were more susceptible to cavitation. This finding emphasizes that cavitation resistance is an important trait that _ among other traits _ defines drought tolerance and the _ range a species can sustain. Cavitation resistance is likely to be associated with other parameters that determine plant _, like rooting depth. C. nauseosus, a deep rooted species, showed the highest water potentials and the most susceptible xylem. Shallow rooted species had lower water potentials and were more resistant to cavitation. A caveat to this statement is that relative rooting depth was assessed from literature data (Table 1), and from predawn water potentials. We are planning excavations to measure root distribution at the site directly. In all plants, small roots were clearly more vulnerable than stems (Fig. 2). This pattern has also been found in trees (Sperry & Saliendra 1994, Hacke & Sauter 1996) and other desert shrubs (Mencuccini & Comstock 1997). Within roots of a species, small roots were more susceptible than large roots (Fig. 6B, _CNRÓ vs _CN LRÓ, _AcoRÓ vs _Aco LRÓ). Similar results were found in conifers (Sperry & Ikeda 1997, Hacke et al. in press). Root cavitation occurred well within the physiological _ range of our species (Figs. 1,2,4). Because of their great susceptibility, small roots may be called the _Achillesê heelÓ for water transportwithin the plant. A positive aspect of their susceptibility is that there is a clearly defined element along the flow path where hydraulic failure may occur under severe drought conditions, thus protecting or enhancing the performance of the remaining system.

There was also an interspecific correlation between vessel diameter and cavitation resistance, but only for combined root and stem data. A second trade-off was found between safety and construction cost. Resistant xylem was strongly correlated with high wood densities, suggesting that thicker cell walls and/or narrower conduits translate into lower air permeability. Air entry into the conduit is known to be the cause of cavitation.","In all species, roots (Fig. 2A) were clearly more vulnerable to cavitation than stems (Fig. 2B). Within roots, samples of the phreatophyte C. nauseosus were most susceptible (Fig. 2A, open circles), roots of the two drought deciduous species were most resistant (Fig. 2A, closed symbols), and roots of the summer green species were intermediate (Fig. 2A, gray symbols).","...we found a significant relationship between the cavitation resistance of roots and stems of a species and the minimum seasonal water potential. Shallow rooted, drought deciduous species showed the lowest water potentials prior to leaf shedding and they had the most resistant xylem. The phreatophytic shrub Chrysothamnus nauseosus always maintained favourable water potentials and had the most susceptible xylem, and summer green species were intermediate. This correlation between cavitation resistance and water potential suggests that a safe xylem is associated with some _costÓ for the plant....","Previous work has shown that plants differ widely in their susceptibility to cavitation (Tyree et al. 1994). Often, there are also large differences within a plant. Roots are usually more vulnerable to cavitation than stems (Sperry & Saliendra 1994, Hacke & Sauter 1996, Mencuccini & Comstock 1997). _Air seedingÓ (Zimmermann 1983) or drought-induced cavitation occurs when air is sucked from an embolized into a water-filled, functional conduit. Air enters the functional conduit through the largest pore of an intervessel pit membrane (Tyree et al. 1994, Jarbeau et al. 1995). According to the capillary equation, droughtinduced cavitation is a function of the pore diameter and of the pressure difference between embolized and functional conduits. The pressure in embolized conduits is atmospheric. In functional conduits, xylem pressure can be as low as _5 MPa or even lower (Pockman et al. 1995). Our main hypothesis was that a speciesê cavitation resistance would vary according to the degree of drought the species experienced. Generally, riparian species show a susceptible xylem whereas desert shrubs are more cavitation resistant (e.g., Pockman et al. 1995). We expected to see an adjustment of cavitation resistance even within co-occurring species that differ in their water status as a result of variation in rooting depth and vegetative phenology. Drought stress in each species was quantified by measuring plant _ over two growing seasons (1998 and 1999). If the hypothesis is right and cavitation resistance varies with drought experience, then this would indicate that a safe xylem is in some way costly for the plant. If a resistant xylem was not associated with some cost for the plant, then all plants should show an equally resistant xylem and should simply avoid cavitation. The nature of this potential penalty is not clear yet. One possible trade-off could be between cavitation resistance and hydraulic conductance (_efficiency versus safetyÓ, Zimmermann 1983). It follows from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation that wide vessels are much more efficient than smaller ones (Zimmermann 1983), but wide vessels may also be more prone to dysfunction than small conduits. As hypothesized, differences in drought experience resulting from the different water use strategies (Fig. 1) agreed with vulnerability to cavitation (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Species that experienced low water potentials during drought had resistant xylem, species with a more favourable water status were more susceptible to cavitation. This finding emphasizes that cavitation resistance is an important trait that _ among other traits _ defines drought tolerance and the _ range a species can sustain. Cavitation resistance is likely to be associated with other parameters that determine plant _, like rooting depth. C. nauseosus, a deep rooted species, showed the highest water potentials and the most susceptible xylem. Shallow rooted species had lower water potentials and were more resistant to cavitation. A caveat to this statement is that relative rooting depth was assessed from literature data (Table 1), and from predawn water potentials. We are planning excavations to measure root distribution at the site directly. In all plants, small roots were clearly more vulnerable than stems (Fig. 2). This pattern has also been found in trees (Sperry & Saliendra 1994, Hacke & Sauter 1996) and other desert shrubs (Mencuccini & Comstock 1997). Within roots of a species, small roots were more susceptible than large roots (Fig. 6B, _CNRÓ vs _CN LRÓ, _AcoRÓ vs _Aco LRÓ). Similar results were found in conifers (Sperry & Ikeda 1997, Hacke et al. in press). Root cavitation occurred well within the physiological _ range of our species (Figs. 1,2,4). Because of their great susceptibility, small roots may be called the _Achillesê heelÓ for water transportwithin the plant. A positive aspect of their susceptibility is that there is a clearly defined element along the flow path where hydraulic failure may occur under severe drought conditions, thus protecting or enhancing the performance of the remaining system. Confining cavitation to _cheapÓ organs like small roots may beadvantageous compared to a random distribution of cavitation within a plant.",,drought deciduous,na,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"vessel diameter, stem cavitation, leaf water potential, wood density",root cavitation,comp - least susceptible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"...we found a significant relationship between the cavitation resistance of roots and stems of a species and the minimum seasonal water potential.

We hypothesized that in Mediterranean plant communities seedling survival of different species during the drought period would be related to their ability to use below-ground resources, particularly water and nitrogen, 2. For 5 years we studied under field conditions the summer seedling survival of ii dominant species of a Spanish Mediterranean shrubland. We related seedling survival of the different species to their seed size and root allocation estimated as the slope of the function root biomass vs log shoot biomass. We used delta(13)C for the estimation of water-use efficiency and delta(15)N and nitrogen concentration to determine the sources of nitrogen utilized. We correlated these variables with root allocation. 3. Seedling survival of the different species was positively correlated with root allocation and seed size. Root allocation was also positively correlated with seed size. delta(15)N and nitrogen concentration were also positively correlated with root allocation, but delta(13)C was not. 4. Under the relatively moist conditions occurring during summer 1996, higher root allocation was associated with the use of nitrogen from more nitrogen saturated microsites.","Seedling survival of all species during summer showed positive significant correlations with the root/log shoot ratio in 1995 and 1996, the only years in which data on root and shoot masses were available (Fig. 2). The slope of the regression equation was higher in 1995 than in the wetter year 1996. Seedling survival also significantly increased with species seed mass in the 5 years of our observations (Fig. 3). The slope of the regressions were higher in 1994, an extremely dry year, and decreased in years with wet summers (1995 and 1996). Species R/logS ratio also showed significant positive correlations with species seed mass in 1995 and 1996 (Fig. 4).",Seedling survival during summer increased with allocation to below_ground organs and seed size.,"Species with large seed sizes tend to be more abundant in some drought_prone environments (25; 5), but there are no consistent explanations for this pattern (17). Larger seeds would enhance more resource allocation to roots vs shoots (5) and more independence from mineral soil resources (4; 13) but these hypotheses have not been sufficiently tested under dry field conditions (31; 17; 33). Seedling survival during summer increased with allocation to below_ground organs and seed size. As far as we know, this is the first report under field conditions showing that the survival of seedlings during the summer dry season in a Mediterranean community was related to the ability of the species to produce roots rather than shoots and leaves. Larger root systems may achieve deeper soil levels in which water remains available throughout the summer (7). This may not be relevant in the studied seedlings because their roots rarely are present below 10 cm. However, a greater allocation to root biomass may allow a more efficient use of superficial water (9; 16). We also report a positive relationship between seed size and root allocation in natural communities. 17) did not obtain this result in species from arid habitats in Australia, but they only considered early seedling development under standard conditions in a glasshouse. More resources from larger seeds may also enhance the ability of seedlings to minimize the effects of the limiting factors of a given environment (3). In Mediterranean ecosystems these limitations mainly lay in the soil and hence more allocation to roots is to be expected.",,Grouped,Survival,Survival,Root to shoot ratio,,,increase with root to shoot ratio,,,,,,,,,,"13C, 15N, Seed size",RSR or RMF,increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"13C, 15N, Seed size",,,Natural summer drought (annual occurence),"Seedling survival during summer drought increased with allocation to belowground organs, increasing shoot _15N values and higher shoot nitrogen concentrations associated with increasing R/logS ratios, positive relationship between seed size and root allocation.

In this area, among the driest in Europe with less than 250 mm year_1 (Capel-Molina 2000), rainfall timing and amount greatly influence germination and seedling establishment (Pugnaire and L_zaro 2000; L_zaro 2004; Pugnaire et al. 2006; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007), but there is little information about the effects of heterogeneity in water input on shrub performance. In a greenhouse experiment we modified water supply and analyzed the effects on plant functional traits, as surrogates of performance (Violle et al. 2007), and growth, expecting that pulses of water of different magnitude have different effects on plants, even if the amount of water provided was kept constant (Knapp et al. 2002; Reynolds et al. 2004).","Greenhouse. Control, 30% reduced water and frequecy (four and two waterings per week).","Rainfall and soil moisture variability have a strong effect on plant survival and seed germination in arid environments, yet very little is known about the effects on roots and growth of woody seedlings. Here we focused on the effects of variability in both amount and frequency of water supply on juvenile root and leaf functional traits and growth of seven Mediterranean shrub species occurring in arid SE Spain, Anthyllis cytisoides, Atriplex halimus, Ephedra fragilis, Genista umbellata, Lycium intricatum, Retama sphaerocarpa, and Salsola oppositifolia. In a 14-month greenhouse experiment we manipulated water supply expecting that reduced water amount and pulses of watering of different magnitude affected functional traits and seedling growth, even if the amount of water provided was the same. Different watering patterns altered soil drying dynamics, with reduced supply of water amount and frequent watering becoming the driest treatment. We found that roots of all species responded to alterations in water supply by changing biomass allocation patterns (i.e., higher root-to-shoot mass [R:S] ratio in droughted plants), and by altering fine roots diameter, measured in terms of specific root length. Indeed, differences in growth rate among species were significantly linked to fine roots diameter and biomass allocation, which relates to uptake capacity of roots. However, relative growth rate and leaf traits such as specific leaf area were insensitive, likely because prolonged droughts over longer periods of time seem necessary to constraint growth in all these arid shrubs.","We found a positive relationship between seedling growth rate (RGR) and SRL (R 2 = 0.50, P < 0.001). . Neither amount nor frequency of water supply consistently affected plant, shoot, and root mass at harvest in any species (P > 0.07). Leaf traits such as LA and SLA did not differ among watering treatments (P > 0.1, Fig. 3), and drought-deciduous shrubs did not shed leaves throughout the monitoring period. Species differences for most traits detected. We found a positive relationship between seedling growth rate (RGR) and SRL (R 2 = 0.50, P < 0.001). RGR was also positively related to a lesser extend to SLA (R 2 = 0.29, P < 0.01), leaf area (R 2 = 0.23, P < 0.02), and root-to-shoot mass ratio (R 2 = 0.12, P < 0.05, Fig. 4). In agreement with published data (Wright and Westoby 1999; Ant_nez et al. 2001), we found that summer-deciduous species, Anthyllis and Lycium, had in general greater SLA and SRL, and consequently faster RGR than evergreen species. Differences in growth rate among species were linked to differences in traits that maximize uptake capacity of roots and leaves such as SRL and SLA (Garnier 1991; Cornelissen et al. 1996; Reich et al. 1998; Comas and Eissenstat 2004), rather than to differences in biomass allocation to roots.","We found that roots of all species responded to alterations in water supply by changing biomass allocation patterns (i.e., higher root-to-shoot mass [R:S] ratio in droughted plants), and by altering fine roots diameter, measured in terms of specific root length.

Morphological characterisation, a root growth capacity test and stomatal conductance measurements during two controlled drought periods were used to investigate biomass allocation patterns, the root system morphology and gas exchange patterns of species, respectively.

Morphological variables are widely used to assess seedling field performance. They are relevant since imbalances in the performance of seedlings, such as changes in the shoot: root ratio (transpiration surface: root absorbing surface) can affect plantsê capacity to cope with drought periods (Baquedano and Castillo, 2007) or seedling survival after planting (Grossnickle, 2012). The variables related to root systems will determine water uptake capacity and contribute to a better seedling water status under drought stress conditions (Chirino et al., 2008; Trubat et al., 2012). Gas exchange variables as stomatal conductance, transpiration or photosynthetic rate have been commonly associated with plant shoot and root morphology and also with xylem resistance to cavitation. All of these variables have been used to assess plant responses to drought conditions (Vilagrosa et al., 2010; Vasques et al., 2013). Root allocation patterns and root morphology play a key role in species response to drought (Chirino et al., 2008). Fine root development has been related to intense soil exploration capacity, and sometimes to high gas exchange rates and water flow throughout the root system (Vilagrosa et al., 2003; Hern_ndez et al., 2009, 2010). SRL is considered a key plant trait as it has been related with other plant functional traits, such as water transport capacity, soil exploration capacity, gas exchange, etc. (Ostonen et al., 2007; Poorter and Ryser, 2015; Roumet et al., 2016). In relation to water dynamics, several studies have found correlations between SRL and the hydraulic conductivity of roots (Rieger and Litvin, 1999; Hern_ndez et al., 2010), which highlights the role of root architecture in plant water status. In fact Trubat et al.(2006, 2012) observed that low nutrient availability promoted thinner roots, higher SRL, and more root junctions.

Root allocation patterns and root morphology play a key role in species response to drought (Chirino et al., 2008). Fine root development has been related to intense soil exploration capacity, and sometimes to high gas exchange rates and water flow throughout the root system (Vilagrosa et al., 2003; Hern_ndez et al., 2009, 2010).

Under low SWC, stomatal conductance correlated positively with SRL.","Plant responses to drought have been associated with morphological and physiological traits (Hern_ndez et al., 2010; Vilagrosa et al., 2014). Morphological variables are widely used to assess seedling field performance. They are relevant since imbalances in the performance of seedlings, such as changes in the shoot: root ratio (transpiration surface: root absorbing surface) can affect plantsê capacity to cope with drought periods (Baquedano and Castillo, 2007) or seedling survival after planting (Grossnickle, 2012). The variables related to root systems will determine water uptake capacity and contribute to a better seedling water status under drought stress conditions (Chirino et al., 2008; Trubat et al., 2012). Gas exchange variables as stomatal conductance, transpiration or photosynthetic rate have been commonly associated with plant shoot and root morphology and also with xylem resistance to cavitation. All of these variables have been used to assess plant responses to drought conditions (Vilagrosa et al., 2010; Vasques et al., 2013). Root allocation patterns and root morphology play a key role in species response to drought (Chirino et al., 2008). Fine root development has been related to intense soil exploration capacity, and sometimes to high gas exchange rates and water flow throughout the root system (Vilagrosa et al., 2003; Hern_ndez et al., 2009, 2010). SRL is considered a key plant trait as it has been related with other plant functional traits, such as water transport capacity, soil exploration capacity, gas exchange, etc. (Ostonen et al., 2007; Poorter and Ryser, 2015; Roumet et al., 2016). In relation to water dynamics, several studies have found correlations between SRL and the hydraulic conductivity of roots (Rieger and Litvin, 1999; Hern_ndez et al., 2010), which highlights the role of root architecture in plant water status. In fact Trubat et al.(2006, 2012) observed that low nutrient availability promoted thinner roots, higher SRL, and more root junctions.

Alnus acuminata (semi-deciduous tree) and Cedrela montana (deciduous tree) which live in lower montane evergreen forest (wet ecosystem) are ecologically relevant for forest regeneration, and are used in pharmaceutical,food and forestindustries (Smith, 1960;Alonso-Amelot et al., 2005).","Tropical Andean ecosystems have been identified as very vulnerable to climate change. Changes in climatic conditions, especially drought as envisaged by climate change projections, could affect the establishment of new individuals that are responsible for ensuring the persistence of species and plant communities. The aim was to study the main morpho-functional traits related to water use and drought resistance of native plant species from Ecuadorian ecosystems during imposed drought periods. Seedlings of six native species representative of the Ecuadorian Andes were studied: lower montane evergreen forest (Alnus acuminata and Cedrela montana), montane cloud forest (Podocarpus sprucei and Aegiphila ferruginea) and montane dry shrubland (Schinus molle and Caesalpinia spinosa). Morphological characterisation, a root growth capacity test and stomatal conductance measurements during two controlled drought periods were used to investigate biomass allocation patterns, the root system morphology and gas exchange patterns of species, respectively. The main results indicated that species-specific differences in morpho-functional traits and allocation patterns determined responses to water availability and drought conditions. Low relative growth rate, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area, and high specific root length, were related to drought-resistant species as P. sprucei and C. spinosa. In contrast, a high or moderate relative growth rate, leaf area and root biomass, but low specific root length as in A. ferruginea, S. molle, C. montana, were related to lower resistance to drought conditions. Despite A. acuminata showed high specific root length, it was reported as a species sensitive to drought. Overall, patterns of stomatal conductance, linked to biomass allocation patterns and root system morphology, especially specific root length, seemed to be related to differences in vulnerability to drought in these species. Drought response was independent of species habitats. Unexpectedly, P. sprucei, belonging to montane cloud forest showed higher drought resistance than S. molle, belonging to montane dry shrubland.

A. ferruginea and S. molle obtained higher Gs given their larger surface area per volume of explored soil. Under a low soil water content, Gsmax correlated positively with SRL (Fig. 4B). Species such as C. spinosa and P. sprucei with a high SRL presented high Gs values under these SWC conditions. The analysis of the functional relationships showed that some morphological and functional variables were closely related, which indicates associations between form and function, with consequences on the drought resistance of species. Diameter RGR positively correlated with the colonisation of the root system in soil, expressed as root surface area (Fig. A1 Suppl. Mat.), and tended to positively correlate with the maximum stomatal conductance rates (Gsmax; Table A2; Suppl. Mat.). Gsmax (SWC 30_35%) was positively correlated to root surface) and showed a tendency to correlate positively with root length/seedling dry weight, and Gsmax (SWC 4_6%) correlated positively to SRL (Fig. 4 B). This indicates close connections between gas exchange patterns and root growth patterns. In fact root architecture and plant productivity have been related in previous studies (Lynch, 1995; Trubat et al., 2006).

C nepalensis seedlings were subjected to four drought cycles of 7, 14, 2 1, and 28-days, and to one control level (watered on alternate days) in a glasshouse. The seedlings failed to survive a 28-days drought during summer. Osmotic adjustment (defined as the decrease in osmotic potential at zero or full turgor in response to water deficit) was measured as the difference between the osmotic potential of seedlings watered on alternate days (control) and those subjected to 21-days drought cycle. Seedlings subjected to 21-days drought had a predawn water potential of -2.60MPa, and showed an osmotic adjustment of - 1.95 MPa at full turgor and -2.17 MPa at zero turgor. The growth of seedlings was positively related to moisture and with water potential. With decline in soil moisture the root:shoot ratio increased while leaf weight ratio decreased. Leaf characteristics, such as leaf number, leaf area, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and leaf drop, were also affected by moisture stress.

We carried out this growth trial under controlled conditions in the greenhouse and focused particularly on manipulating the capillary-bound water in a way that resulted in a realistic soil moisture distribution along the depth of the growth containers. To achieve this goal we did not vary the total amount of water added to the plants but only the depth at which the water was available. To meet these challenges, we here present an experimental approach with deep tubes that were watered laterally. In addition, the experimental set-up allowed to measure water contents and to observe root growth along the full length of the containers. We hypothesized that (1) drought conditions brought about by a dry top-soil result in decreased survival, stomatal conductance, aboveground growth rates and shoot-to-root ratio as well as in increased growth of fine roots of F. sylvatica, (2) the three provenances of F. sylvatica respond differently to the drought treatments, and in particular, that plants originating from drier regional climate cope better with drought than those from wetter climate.",,"Current climate change scenarios predict changes in precipitation patterns resulting in a longer and more intensive droughts. These changes pose a challenge for Fagus sylvatica as the most common European deciduous tree species. We asked how different genotypes respond to drought conditions and paid particular attention to how soil moisture availability can be manipulated. We established a tube technique that allowed to add water horizontally at different rooting depths, which allowed to measure water contents and to observe root growth along the full length of 1-m deep tubes. Three F. sylvatica provenances were compared in their response to different depth of water supply with respect to growth, leaf stomatal conductance as well as root and leaf traits. There were short-lasting differences between the watering regimes in soil water content and depth of soil moisture maxima. Adding water to depths of 30-60 cm resulted in reduced leaf stomatal conductance and lower survival but increased root tip growth rates compared to watering the tubes at 10-20 cm. There were differences between the three provenances for specific leaf area and stem dry mass, which however, were independent of the watering regime and did not support the idea of local adaptation to drought of populations from dry or moist origins.

Plant biomass and root traits were measured both under full irrigation and under severe experimental drought in order to investigate 1) the intraspecific variability in plant and root traits among populations from the three biogeographic origins, 2) the response of these traits to drought, 3) the relationships between traits and water use and finally 4) the relationship between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance. For the tubes that were not irrigated during 45 days, the total water used (Total WU; g H2O day_1 plant_1) during this period was used as a proxy of the _dehydration avoidanceê. This was calculated as the difference between the initial soil water content in the tube at field capacity (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density _ 24,1 g H20 per 100 g_1 dry soil which is soil moisture at field capacity) and the remaining water in the soil explored by the roots for each tube (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density x soil moisture measured once at the final sampling on day 159). Similarly, the _deep soil water useê (Deep soil WU; g H2O day_1 plant_1) was calculated as the difference between the initial soil water reserve at field capacity in the deep soil layers (100 cm- rooting depth) and the remaining water in this layer of soil explored by the roots measured on day 159. For each plant, root morphological traits were measured on deep roots from the last but one soil layer including roots (n-1; Fig. 1d). We thus focused on deep roots that are localized in the moistest soil layers and avoided the roots from the deepest soil layer (n) which were often not fully developed and composed of a single axis without branching. To test whether a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance existed, we used the data from a previous study which measured dehydration tolerance on the same D. glomerata populations grown in short pots by recording plant survival after a drought period (Bristiel et al. 2018). As roots were equally limited in depth for all the populations in short pots, plant drought survival mirrored plant dehydration tolerance under a similar soil water availability (Volaire 2008). It allowed us to discount the effect of rooting depth associated mainly with dehydration avoidance (Volaire & Lelievre 2001; P_rez-Ramos et al. 2013). This experiment is briefly described below.","Background and aimsUnderstanding plant adaptation to drought is a crucial challenge under climate change. This study aimed to investigate root traits and water use of grass populations exhibiting a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies to cope with drought.MethodsSixteen populations of the perennial grass Dactylis glomerata originating from three biogeographical origins (Northern, Temperate and Mediterranean) were grown in long tubes. Plant biomass, rooting depth and morphological traits of deep roots were measured both under full irrigation and under severe drought. Water uptake under drought was used as a proxy for dehydration avoidance. Plant survival after severe drought wasused as a measure of dehydration tolerance.ResultsAll populations had similar Rooting depth - Max and specific root length. Compared to Northern and Temperate populations, Mediterranean populations had half the total and deep root biomass, but thinner and denser deep roots. They were less affected by drought. These traits were associated with less water uptake (lower dehydration avoidance) but greater survival to severe drought (enhanced dehydration tolerance).ConclusionThe intraspecific variability in root traits revealed a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance which illustrates contrasting adaptive plant and root strategies associated with the biogeographical origins of populations.","Water deficit affected above-ground and root traits differently according to the population of D. glomerata considered (Fig. S1, S2) and to their origin as illustrated by the significant origin x treatment interactions detected for 7 of the eleven traits studied (Table 1). The Northern and Temperate populations were more affected by drought than Mediterranean populations (Fig. 4). In comparison to irrigated plants, the overall growth of plants of Temperate and Northern populations was reduced under drought. They showed a greater root: shoot ratio (Fig. 4c). Their above-ground biomass in summer was markedly reduced (26% on average; Fig. 4d); they also showed less rooting depth (minus 16 cm on average; Fig. 4f) than irrigated plants. Conversely, the root: shoot ratio, summer above-ground biomass and Rooting depth - 95% of Mediterranean populations were not affected by drought (Fig. 4c, d, f). Overall, the total and deep root biomass and the Rooting depth - Max of the three population origin groups were not affected by drought (Fig. 4b, e, g). Deep root morphological traits (root tissue density, specific root length as well as the root length density) were unaffected by drought across all origins except the mean root diameter of Temperate populations which was 0.04 mm less under drought (Fig. 4 h). The total water use (Fig. 5a), used here as a proxy for dehydration avoidance, as well as the deep soil water use (Fig. 5b) were significantly lower in Mediterranean populations which took up 12% less water during the drought period than the Northern and Temperate populations. The PCA performed on plant traits measured under irrigation and with total and deep soil water use under drought as supplementary variables (Fig. 6), captured 72.5% of the total variance in the first two axes (56.4% on the first axis). The first PC axis opposed Mediterranean populations with high root: shoot ratio and root tissue density to both Northern and Temperate populations, in which summer above-ground and root biomass were higher, along with higher root length density and larger root diameter which were associated with higher water consumption under drought (high water use). The second PC axis (PC2: 16.1%) which opposed the specific root length on one side and the maximum root depth on the other side, did not discriminate populations according to their origin. The total water use measured under drought was positively correlated with above-ground biomass, total and deep root biomass, mean deep root diameter, and root length density, and negatively correlated with the root: shoot ratio, maximum root depth and root tissue density, all measured under irrigation (Table S4). The relationships between the total water use and traits both measured under drought showed similar patterns but stronger relationships. Interestingly, the relationship between total water use measured under drought and maximum root depth was negative when maximum root depth was measured under irrigation (regarded as a potential root depth) but non-significant when measured under drought (Table S4). The dehydration tolerance measured by the plant survival after severe drought in short pots, was on average 3 fold higher for Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata than for both Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. S5; Bristiel et al. 2018). It was strongly negatively related (r_=__0.82, P_<_0.001) to the dehydration avoidance estimated by the total water use measured under drought in long tubes (Fig. 7). Also, Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used less water but had a higher dehydration tolerance after severe drought than Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. 7).","All populations had similar Rooting depth - Max and SRL. Compared to Northern and Temperate populations, Mediterranean populations had half the total and deep root biomass, but thinner and denser deep roots. They were less affected by drought. These traits were associated with less water uptake (lower dehydration avoidance) but greater survival to severe drought (enhanced dehydration tolerance). The intraspecific variability in root traits revealed a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance which illustrates contrasting adaptive plant and root strategies associated with the biogeographical origins of populations. Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata were characterized by a lower plant biomass, a higher root: shoot ratio, and thinner deep roots with a higher tissue density than Northern and Temperate populations. This suite of traits was associated with a lower water use and therefore a lower dehydration avoidance although Mediterranean populations were more dehydration tolerant when subjected to severe drought in short pots. In Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata, increasing the root: shoot ratio and decreasing the shoot transpiration requirements rather than foraging deeper underground appears to be the preferred strategy (not deeper rooting). Moreover, the clearest difference in deep root morphology between Mediterranean populations and Northern and Temperate populations of D. glomerata was in their higher root tissue density. Contrary to the conceptual root economics framework (Roumet et al. 2016; Weemstra et al. 2016) suggesting that a high rate of soil resource acquisition is associated with high SRL (fine roots with low tissue density) this study showed that at the intraspecific level, plants with coarser roots can take up more water than plants with thinner roots. In addition, SRL and Rooting depth - Max were unrelated to water use and independent from the water acquisition - conservation axis. This questions the role of SRL for water acquisition and suggests that root diameter and root tissue density can better predict plant water use than SRL or maximum root depth for D. glomerata at intraspecific level. Temperate populations of D. glomerata have developed a root strategy to uptake water, avoid dehydration and keep the plant growing under the moderate droughts they typically face. In contrast, within the same species, the Mediterranean populations have developed summer dormancy, dehydration tolerance and deep roots with high tissue density to maintain a minimum water uptake to sustain plant survival under chronic, intense and extended summer droughts. SRL and rooting deoth not indicative of strategies. Rather RTD and root diameter seperated population strategies.","To cope with drought, plants exhibit a range of physiological strategies that are defined as combinations of mechanistically linked responses and traits that lead to a particular type of behavior during a period of water deficit (Ludlow 1989, Volaire 2018). Under moderate drought, a _dehydration avoidanceê strategy is expected, with plants characterized by roots able to reach moisture, and thus sustain growth (Brown et al. 2005). In this case, the main mechanism to maintain sufficient tissue water content for turgor is based on the optimization of water uptake, notably through a deep and efficient root system (Garwood and Sinclair 1979; Comas et al. 2013). Under more severe drought, a _dehydration toleranceê strategy is linked to the maximization of the probability of survival rather than maintenance of growth rate (Levitt 1972; Levitt et al. 1980). As such, plants display low tissue water content and preserve cells of surviving organs such as meristems from critical dehydration consequences by osmotic adjustment (West and Wullschleger 1990). In addition, under chronic severe summer droughts (e.g., around the Mediterranean Basin: Volaire et al. 2009), some perennial herbaceous plants exhibit a summer dormancy strategy that enhances their dehydration tolerance (Volaire and Norton 2006; Gillepsie and Volaire 2017). However the role of root traits in regulating these strategies has been little examined (Zwicke et al. 2015). Measuring dehydration avoidance as the ability of plants to extract soil water during a drought and dehydration tolerance as the ability of plants to survive at a low soil water content (Volaire et al. 2014), the present study aims to investigate whether root traits and plant water use significantly differ among plants that exhibit a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance. This framework identified a tradeoff between root traits associated to water acquisition and those associated with water conservation (Prieto et al. 2015; Weemstra et al. 2016; Roumet et al. 2016; Fort et al. 2017). As a general rule, water acquisitive plants are expected to exhibit a deep root system with low carbon investment (i.e., high specific root length, low root tissue density, and small diameter; e.g., White and Snow 2012; Freschet et al. 2017) allowing extensive soil exploration. At the other extreme, water conservative plants are expected to exhibit _slower traitsê such as thicker roots with high root tissue density, associated with longer root life span (McCormack et al. 2012). Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata were characterized by a lower plant biomass, a higher root: shoot ratio, and thinner deep roots with a higher tissue density than Northern and Temperate populations. This suite of traits was associated with a lower water use and therefore a lower dehydration avoidance although Mediterranean populations were more dehydration tolerant when subjected to severe drought in short pots. In another perennial grass (Phalaris aquatica), which exhibits summer dormancy like the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used in this study, a deep root system was crucial for dehydration tolerance and plant survival since plants died when roots were severed (McWilliam and Kramer 1968). Higher root tissue density might be due to narrower, more numerous xylem vessels (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Hummel et al. 2007) and higher lignification conferring a greater longevity (Ryser 1996) and drought resistance (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Fitter 2002), although it might negatively impact their hydraulic conductivity (Mapfumo et al. 1993). In our study, the thinner roots of the Mediterranean populations might allow extensive soil exploration for water per unit of biomass invested, with low biomass investment, efficient hydraulic conductance (Hern_ndez et al. 2010; Comas et al. 2012) and a higher resistance to embolism of roots with smaller xylem vessel diameter (Fitter 1987; Alameda and Villar 2012). Although they were thinner and had a higher tissue density, deep roots of the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata had similar specific root length (SRL) than those of Northern and Temperate populations. The unforeseen association of thin but dense roots in Mediterranean populations and thick roots with low tissue density in Northern and Temperate populations blurred variations in SRL in this study. Surprisingly, drought did not affect the values of any deep root morphological traits. Two reviews (Ostonen et al. 2007; Olmo et al. 2014) also reported no clear effect of drought on specific root length (SRL), but rather a great variability in the SRL response across species due to the contrasting response of the two components of SRL, i.e. the root tissue density (RTD) and the mean root diameter. The total water use under drought was closely related to plant traits measured both under irrigation and under drought. In both cases, water use was positively correlated with the summer above-ground biomass and thus the evaporative demand during the drought period. Greater water use was also positively related to the capacity of roots to acquire water especially in deep soil layers (deep soil water use). Both total and deep water use increased with greater root biomass and root length densities in deep soil layers and with thicker deep roots but not with deeper root systems. Conversely, lower water use was associated with high root: shoot ratios and high root tissue density, two traits related to resistance to drought and root longevity and thus to resource conservation in long lived tissues. These relationships confirm those obtained on twelve Mediterranean rangeland species grown in a common garden experiment (Fort et al. 2017). The first PC axis thus opposed traits related to water acquisition and those related to resource conservation. Contrary to the conceptual root economics framework (Roumet et al. 2016; Weemstra et al. 2016) suggesting that a high rate of soil resource acquisition is associated with high SRL (fine roots with low tissue density) this study showed that at the intraspecific level, plants with coarser roots can take up more water than plants with thinner roots. In addition, SRL and Rooting depth - Max were unrelated to water use and independent from the water acquisition - conservation axis.

For the tubes that were not irrigated during 45 days, the total water used (Total WU; g H2O day_1 plant_1) during this period was used as a proxy of the _dehydration avoidanceê. This was calculated as the difference between the initial soil water content in the tube at field capacity (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density _ 24,1 g H20 per 100 g_1 dry soil which is soil moisture at field capacity) and the remaining water in the soil explored by the roots for each tube (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density x soil moisture measured once at the final sampling on day 159).

For each plant, root morphological traits were measured on deep roots from the last but one soil layer including roots (n-1; Fig. 1d).

To test whether a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance existed, we used the data from a previous study which measured dehydration tolerance on the same D. glomerata populations grown in short pots by recording plant survival after a drought period (Bristiel et al. 2018). As roots were equally limited in depth for all the populations in short pots, plant drought survival mirrored plant dehydration tolerance under a similar soil water availability (Volaire 2008). It allowed us to discount the effect of rooting depth associated mainly with dehydration avoidance (Volaire & Lelievre 2001; P_rez-Ramos et al. 2013).

Deep root morphological traits (root tissue density, specific root length as well as the root length density) were unaffected by drought across all origins except the mean root diameter of Temperate populations which was 0.04 mm less under drought (Fig. 4 h). The total water use (Fig. 5a), used here as a proxy for dehydration avoidance, as well as the deep soil water use (Fig. 5b) were significantly lower in Mediterranean populations which took up 12% less water during the drought period than the Northern and Temperate populations. The PCA performed on plant traits measured under irrigation and with total and deep soil water use under drought as supplementary variables (Fig. 6), captured 72.5% of the total variance in the first two axes (56.4% on the first axis). The first PC axis opposed Mediterranean populations with high root: shoot ratio and root tissue density to both Northern and Temperate populations, in which summer above-ground and root biomass were higher, along with higher root length density and larger root diameter which were associated with higher water consumption under drought (high water use). The second PC axis (PC2: 16.1%) which opposed the specific root length on one side and the maximum root depth on the other side, did not discriminate populations according to their origin. The total water use measured under drought was positively correlated with above-ground biomass, total and deep root biomass, mean deep root diameter, and root length density, and negatively correlated with the root: shoot ratio, maximum root depth and root tissue density, all measured under irrigation (Table S4). The relationships between the total water use and traits both measured under drought showed similar patterns but stronger relationships. Interestingly, the relationship between total water use measured under drought and maximum root depth was negative when maximum root depth was measured under irrigation (regarded as a potential root depth) but non-significant when measured under drought (Table S4). The dehydration tolerance measured by the plant survival after severe drought in short pots, was on average 3 fold higher for Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata than for both Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. S5; Bristiel et al. 2018). It was strongly negatively related (r_=__0.82, P_<_0.001) to the dehydration avoidance estimated by the total water use measured under drought in long tubes (Fig. 7). Also, Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used less water but had a higher dehydration tolerance after severe drought than Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. 7).","All populations had similar Rooting depth - Max and SRL.

Moreover, the clearest difference in deep root morphology between Mediterranean populations and Northern and Temperate populations of D. glomerata was in their higher root tissue density.

SRL and rooting deoth not indicative of strategies. Rather RTD and root diameter seperated population strategies.","To cope with drought, plants exhibit a range of physiological strategies that are defined as combinations of mechanistically linked responses and traits that lead to a particular type of behavior during a period of water deficit (Ludlow 1989, Volaire 2018). Under moderate drought, a _dehydration avoidanceê strategy is expected, with plants characterized by roots able to reach moisture, and thus sustain growth (Brown et al. 2005). In this case, the main mechanism to maintain sufficient tissue water content for turgor is based on the optimization of water uptake, notably through a deep and efficient root system (Garwood and Sinclair 1979; Comas et al. 2013). Under more severe drought, a _dehydration toleranceê strategy is linked to the maximization of the probability of survival rather than maintenance of growth rate (Levitt 1972; Levitt et al. 1980). As such, plants display low tissue water content and preserve cells of surviving organs such as meristems from critical dehydration consequences by osmotic adjustment (West and Wullschleger 1990). In addition, under chronic severe summer droughts (e.g., around the Mediterranean Basin: Volaire et al. 2009), some perennial herbaceous plants exhibit a summer dormancy strategy that enhances their dehydration tolerance (Volaire and Norton 2006; Gillepsie and Volaire 2017). However the role of root traits in regulating these strategies has been little examined (Zwicke et al. 2015). Measuring dehydration avoidance as the ability of plants to extract soil water during a drought and dehydration tolerance as the ability of plants to survive at a low soil water content (Volaire et al. 2014), the present study aims to investigate whether root traits and plant water use significantly differ among plants that exhibit a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance. This framework identified a tradeoff between root traits associated to water acquisition and those associated with water conservation (Prieto et al. 2015; Weemstra et al. 2016; Roumet et al. 2016; Fort et al. 2017). As a general rule, water acquisitive plants are expected to exhibit a deep root system with low carbon investment (i.e., high specific root length, low root tissue density, and small diameter; e.g., White and Snow 2012; Freschet et al. 2017) allowing extensive soil exploration. At the other extreme, water conservative plants are expected to exhibit _slower traitsê such as thicker roots with high root tissue density, associated with longer root life span (McCormack et al. 2012). Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata were characterized by a lower plant biomass, a higher root: shoot ratio, and thinner deep roots with a higher tissue density than Northern and Temperate populations. This suite of traits was associated with a lower water use and therefore a lower dehydration avoidance although Mediterranean populations were more dehydration tolerant when subjected to severe drought in short pots. In another perennial grass (Phalaris aquatica), which exhibits summer dormancy like the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used in this study, a deep root system was crucial for dehydration tolerance and plant survival since plants died when roots were severed (McWilliam and Kramer 1968). Higher root tissue density might be due to narrower, more numerous xylem vessels (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Hummel et al. 2007) and higher lignification conferring a greater longevity (Ryser 1996) and drought resistance (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Fitter 2002), although it might negatively impact their hydraulic conductivity (Mapfumo et al. 1993). In our study, the thinner roots of the Mediterranean populations might allow extensive soil exploration for water per unit of biomass invested, with low biomass investment, efficient hydraulic conductance (Hern_ndez et al. 2010; Comas et al. 2012) and a higher resistance to embolism of roots with smaller xylem vessel diameter (Fitter 1987; Alameda and Villar 2012). Although they were thinner and had a higher tissue density, deep roots of the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata had similar specific root length (SRL) than those of Northern and Temperate populations. The unforeseen association of thin but dense roots in Mediterranean populations and thick roots with low tissue density in Northern and Temperate populations blurred variations in SRL in this study. Surprisingly, drought did not affect the values of any deep root morphological traits. Two reviews (Ostonen et al. 2007; Olmo et al. 2014) also reported no clear effect of drought on specific root length (SRL), but rather a great variability in the SRL response across species due to the contrasting response of the two components of SRL, i.e. the root tissue density (RTD) and the mean root diameter.

As a general rule, water acquisitive plants are expected to exhibit a deep root system with low carbon investment (i.e., high specific root length, low root tissue density, and small diameter; e.g., White and Snow 2012; Freschet et al. 2017) allowing extensive soil exploration. At the other extreme, water conservative plants are expected to exhibit _slower traitsê such as thicker roots with high root tissue density, associated with longer root life span (McCormack et al. 2012). Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata were characterized by a lower plant biomass, a higher root: shoot ratio, and thinner deep roots with a higher tissue density than Northern and Temperate populations. This suite of traits was associated with a lower water use and therefore a lower dehydration avoidance although Mediterranean populations were more dehydration tolerant when subjected to severe drought in short pots. In another perennial grass (Phalaris aquatica), which exhibits summer dormancy like the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used in this study, a deep root system was crucial for dehydration tolerance and plant survival since plants died when roots were severed (McWilliam and Kramer 1968). Higher root tissue density might be due to narrower, more numerous xylem vessels (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Hummel et al. 2007) and higher lignification conferring a greater longevity (Ryser 1996) and drought resistance (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Fitter 2002), although it might negatively impact their hydraulic conductivity (Mapfumo et al. 1993). In our study, the thinner roots of the Mediterranean populations might allow extensive soil exploration for water per unit of biomass invested, with low biomass investment, efficient hydraulic conductance (Hern_ndez et al. 2010; Comas et al. 2012) and a higher resistance to embolism of roots with smaller xylem vessel diameter (Fitter 1987; Alameda and Villar 2012). Although they were thinner and had a higher tissue density, deep roots of the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata had similar specific root length (SRL) than those of Northern and Temperate populations. The unforeseen association of thin but dense roots in Mediterranean populations and thick roots with low tissue density in Northern and Temperate populations blurred variations in SRL in this study. Surprisingly, drought did not affect the values of any deep root morphological traits. Two reviews (Ostonen et al. 2007; Olmo et al. 2014) also reported no clear effect of drought on specific root length (SRL), but rather a great variability in the SRL response across species due to the contrasting response of the two components of SRL, i.e. the root tissue density (RTD) and the mean root diameter. The total water use under drought was closely related to plant traits measured both under irrigation and under drought. In both cases, water use was positively correlated with the summer above-ground biomass and thus the evaporative demand during the drought period. Greater water use was also positively related to the capacity of roots to acquire water especially in deep soil layers (deep soil water use). Both total and deep water use increased with greater root biomass and root length densities in deep soil layers and with thicker deep roots but not with deeper root systems. Conversely, lower water use was associated with high root: shoot ratios and high root tissue density, two traits related to resistance to drought and root longevity and thus to resource conservation in long lived tissues. These relationships confirm those obtained on twelve Mediterranean rangeland species grown in a common garden experiment (Fort et al. 2017). The first PC axis thus opposed traits related to water acquisition and those related to resource conservation. Contrary to the conceptual root economics framework (Roumet et al. 2016; Weemstra et al. 2016) suggesting that a high rate of soil resource acquisition is associated with high SRL (fine roots with low tissue density) this study showed that at the intraspecific level, plants with coarser roots can take up more water than plants with thinner roots. In addition, SRL and Rooting depth - Max were unrelated to water use and independent from the water acquisition - conservation axis.

Plant biomass and root traits were measured both under full irrigation and under severe experimental drought in order to investigate 1) the intraspecific variability in plant and root traits among populations from the three biogeographic origins, 2) the response of these traits to drought, 3) the relationships between traits and water use and finally 4) the relationship between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance. For the tubes that were not irrigated during 45 days, the total water used (Total WU; g H2O day_1 plant_1) during this period was used as a proxy of the _dehydration avoidanceê. This was calculated as the difference between the initial soil water content in the tube at field capacity (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density _ 24,1 g H20 per 100 g_1 dry soil which is soil moisture at field capacity) and the remaining water in the soil explored by the roots for each tube (soil volume exploited by roots x soil density x soil moisture measured once at the final sampling on day 159). Similarly, the _deep soil water useê (Deep soil WU; g H2O day_1 plant_1) was calculated as the difference between the initial soil water reserve at field capacity in the deep soil layers (100 cm- rooting depth) and the remaining water in this layer of soil explored by the roots measured on day 159. For each plant, root morphological traits were measured on deep roots from the last but one soil layer including roots (n-1; Fig. 1d). We thus focused on deep roots that are localized in the moistest soil layers and avoided the roots from the deepest soil layer (n) which were often not fully developed and composed of a single axis without branching. To test whether a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance existed, we used the data from a previous study which measured dehydration tolerance on the same D. glomerata populations grown in short pots by recording plant survival after a drought period (Bristiel et al. 2018). As roots were equally limited in depth for all the populations in short pots, plant drought survival mirrored plant dehydration tolerance under a similar soil water availability (Volaire 2008). It allowed us to discount the effect of rooting depth associated mainly with dehydration avoidance (Volaire & Lelievre 2001; P_rez-Ramos et al. 2013). This experiment is briefly described below.","Background and aimsUnderstanding plant adaptation to drought is a crucial challenge under climate change. This study aimed to investigate root traits and water use of grass populations exhibiting a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies to cope with drought.MethodsSixteen populations of the perennial grass Dactylis glomerata originating from three biogeographical origins (Northern, Temperate and Mediterranean) were grown in long tubes. Plant biomass, rooting depth and morphological traits of deep roots were measured both under full irrigation and under severe drought. Water uptake under drought was used as a proxy for dehydration avoidance. Plant survival after severe drought wasused as a measure of dehydration tolerance.ResultsAll populations had similar Rooting depth - Max and specific root length. Compared to Northern and Temperate populations, Mediterranean populations had half the total and deep root biomass, but thinner and denser deep roots. They were less affected by drought. These traits were associated with less water uptake (lower dehydration avoidance) but greater survival to severe drought (enhanced dehydration tolerance).ConclusionThe intraspecific variability in root traits revealed a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance which illustrates contrasting adaptive plant and root strategies associated with the biogeographical origins of populations.","Water deficit affected above-ground and root traits differently according to the population of D. glomerata considered (Fig. S1, S2) and to their origin as illustrated by the significant origin x treatment interactions detected for 7 of the eleven traits studied (Table 1). The Northern and Temperate populations were more affected by drought than Mediterranean populations (Fig. 4). In comparison to irrigated plants, the overall growth of plants of Temperate and Northern populations was reduced under drought. They showed a greater root: shoot ratio (Fig. 4c). Their above-ground biomass in summer was markedly reduced (26% on average; Fig. 4d); they also showed less rooting depth (minus 16 cm on average; Fig. 4f) than irrigated plants. Conversely, the root: shoot ratio, summer above-ground biomass and Rooting depth - 95% of Mediterranean populations were not affected by drought (Fig. 4c, d, f). Overall, the total and deep root biomass and the Rooting depth - Max of the three population origin groups were not affected by drought (Fig. 4b, e, g). Deep root morphological traits (root tissue density, specific root length as well as the root length density) were unaffected by drought across all origins except the mean root diameter of Temperate populations which was 0.04 mm less under drought (Fig. 4 h). The total water use (Fig. 5a), used here as a proxy for dehydration avoidance, as well as the deep soil water use (Fig. 5b) were significantly lower in Mediterranean populations which took up 12% less water during the drought period than the Northern and Temperate populations. The PCA performed on plant traits measured under irrigation and with total and deep soil water use under drought as supplementary variables (Fig. 6), captured 72.5% of the total variance in the first two axes (56.4% on the first axis). The first PC axis opposed Mediterranean populations with high root: shoot ratio and root tissue density to both Northern and Temperate populations, in which summer above-ground and root biomass were higher, along with higher root length density and larger root diameter which were associated with higher water consumption under drought (high water use). The second PC axis (PC2: 16.1%) which opposed the specific root length on one side and the maximum root depth on the other side, did not discriminate populations according to their origin. The total water use measured under drought was positively correlated with above-ground biomass, total and deep root biomass, mean deep root diameter, and root length density, and negatively correlated with the root: shoot ratio, maximum root depth and root tissue density, all measured under irrigation (Table S4). The relationships between the total water use and traits both measured under drought showed similar patterns but stronger relationships. Interestingly, the relationship between total water use measured under drought and maximum root depth was negative when maximum root depth was measured under irrigation (regarded as a potential root depth) but non-significant when measured under drought (Table S4). The dehydration tolerance measured by the plant survival after severe drought in short pots, was on average 3 fold higher for Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata than for both Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. S5; Bristiel et al. 2018). It was strongly negatively related (r_=__0.82, P_<_0.001) to the dehydration avoidance estimated by the total water use measured under drought in long tubes (Fig. 7). Also, Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used less water but had a higher dehydration tolerance after severe drought than Northern and Temperate populations (Fig. 7).","All populations had similar Rooting depth - Max and SRL. Compared to Northern and Temperate populations, Mediterranean populations had half the total and deep root biomass, but thinner and denser deep roots. They were less affected by drought. These traits were associated with less water uptake (lower dehydration avoidance) but greater survival to severe drought (enhanced dehydration tolerance). The intraspecific variability in root traits revealed a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance which illustrates contrasting adaptive plant and root strategies associated with the biogeographical origins of populations. Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata were characterized by a lower plant biomass, a higher root: shoot ratio, and thinner deep roots with a higher tissue density than Northern and Temperate populations. This suite of traits was associated with a lower water use and therefore a lower dehydration avoidance although Mediterranean populations were more dehydration tolerant when subjected to severe drought in short pots. In Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata, increasing the root: shoot ratio and decreasing the shoot transpiration requirements rather than foraging deeper underground appears to be the preferred strategy (not deeper rooting). Moreover, the clearest difference in deep root morphology between Mediterranean populations and Northern and Temperate populations of D. glomerata was in their higher root tissue density. Contrary to the conceptual root economics framework (Roumet et al. 2016; Weemstra et al. 2016) suggesting that a high rate of soil resource acquisition is associated with high SRL (fine roots with low tissue density) this study showed that at the intraspecific level, plants with coarser roots can take up more water than plants with thinner roots. In addition, SRL and Rooting depth - Max were unrelated to water use and independent from the water acquisition - conservation axis. This questions the role of SRL for water acquisition and suggests that root diameter and root tissue density can better predict plant water use than SRL or maximum root depth for D. glomerata at intraspecific level. Temperate populations of D. glomerata have developed a root strategy to uptake water, avoid dehydration and keep the plant growing under the moderate droughts they typically face. In contrast, within the same species, the Mediterranean populations have developed summer dormancy, dehydration tolerance and deep roots with high tissue density to maintain a minimum water uptake to sustain plant survival under chronic, intense and extended summer droughts. SRL and rooting deoth not indicative of strategies. Rather RTD and root diameter seperated population strategies.","To cope with drought, plants exhibit a range of physiological strategies that are defined as combinations of mechanistically linked responses and traits that lead to a particular type of behavior during a period of water deficit (Ludlow 1989, Volaire 2018). Under moderate drought, a _dehydration avoidanceê strategy is expected, with plants characterized by roots able to reach moisture, and thus sustain growth (Brown et al. 2005). In this case, the main mechanism to maintain sufficient tissue water content for turgor is based on the optimization of water uptake, notably through a deep and efficient root system (Garwood and Sinclair 1979; Comas et al. 2013). Under more severe drought, a _dehydration toleranceê strategy is linked to the maximization of the probability of survival rather than maintenance of growth rate (Levitt 1972; Levitt et al. 1980). As such, plants display low tissue water content and preserve cells of surviving organs such as meristems from critical dehydration consequences by osmotic adjustment (West and Wullschleger 1990). In addition, under chronic severe summer droughts (e.g., around the Mediterranean Basin: Volaire et al. 2009), some perennial herbaceous plants exhibit a summer dormancy strategy that enhances their dehydration tolerance (Volaire and Norton 2006; Gillepsie and Volaire 2017). However the role of root traits in regulating these strategies has been little examined (Zwicke et al. 2015). Measuring dehydration avoidance as the ability of plants to extract soil water during a drought and dehydration tolerance as the ability of plants to survive at a low soil water content (Volaire et al. 2014), the present study aims to investigate whether root traits and plant water use significantly differ among plants that exhibit a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance. This framework identified a tradeoff between root traits associated to water acquisition and those associated with water conservation (Prieto et al. 2015; Weemstra et al. 2016; Roumet et al. 2016; Fort et al. 2017). As a general rule, water acquisitive plants are expected to exhibit a deep root system with low carbon investment (i.e., high specific root length, low root tissue density, and small diameter; e.g., White and Snow 2012; Freschet et al. 2017) allowing extensive soil exploration. At the other extreme, water conservative plants are expected to exhibit _slower traitsê such as thicker roots with high root tissue density, associated with longer root life span (McCormack et al. 2012).

In another perennial grass (Phalaris aquatica), which exhibits summer dormancy like the Mediterranean populations of D. glomerata used in this study, a deep root system was crucial for dehydration tolerance and plant survival since plants died when roots were severed (McWilliam and Kramer 1968). Higher root tissue density might be due to narrower, more numerous xylem vessels (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Hummel et al. 2007) and higher lignification conferring a greater longevity (Ryser 1996) and drought resistance (Wahl and Ryser 2000; Fitter 2002), although it might negatively impact their hydraulic conductivity (Mapfumo et al. 1993). In our study, the thinner roots of the Mediterranean populations might allow extensive soil exploration for water per unit of biomass invested, with low biomass investment, efficient hydraulic conductance (Hern_ndez et al. 2010; Comas et al. 2012) and a higher resistance to embolism of roots with smaller xylem vessel diameter (Fitter 1987; Alameda and Villar 2012).

We experimentally altered the timing and quantity of growing season rainfall inputs by lengthening inter-rainfall dry intervals by 50%, reducing rainfall quantities by 30%, or both, compared to the ambient rainfall regime in a native tallgrass prairie ecosystem in northeastern Kansas. Over three growing seasons, increased rainfall variability caused by altered rainfall timing with no change in total rainfall quantity led to lower and more variable soil water content (0-30 cm depth), a similar to10% reduction in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), increased root to shoot ratios, and greater canopy photon flux density at 30 cm above the soil surface. Lower total ANPP primarily resulted from reduced growth, biomass and flowering of subdominant warm-season C-4 grasses while productivity of the dominant C-4 grass Andropogon gerardii was relatively unresponsive. In general, vegetation responses to increased soil water content variability were at least equal to those caused by imposing a 30% reduction in rainfall quantity without altering the timing of rainfall inputs. Reduced ANPP most likely resulted from direct effects of soil moisture deficits on root activity, plant water status, and photosynthesis.

In a preliminary study, we found that eight perennial C-4 grasses from the northern Chihuahuan Desert (Jornada del Muerto Basin, New Mexico, USA) have substantial differences in growth potential under well-watered conditions, despite presumably belonging to the same functional group (Table 1). Sustained growth at these rates would result in large differences in the length of time required for a species to double its biomass (<1 week for Eragrostis lehmanniana to 4 weeks for Scleropogon brevifolius), we examined the growth of these eight perennial grasses in response to simulated drought in a controlled environment. To elucidate mechanisms of response, we assessed both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth.","Drought was imposed using a modification of the method proposed by Haan and Barfield (1971), as described by Snow and Tingey (1985), which overcomes the first two experimental constraints of plant-soil water interactions described in the Introduction. The third constraint was overcome by our choice of eight species belonging to the same family and having the same perennial growth habit and photosynthetic pathway. We set open-bottom pots over a column of a uniform porous medium with a water table at different depths (Fig. 2). This procedure ensures a uniform and repeatable water potential in the pots (Wookey et al. 1991; Saulescu et al. 1995). Consequently, drought intensity becomes independent of plant size.","Eight perennial C-4 grasses from the Jornada del Muerto Basin in southern New Mexico show fivefold differences in relative growth rates under well-watered conditions (RGR(max)). In a controlled environment, we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship (trade-off) between RGR(max) and the capacity of these species to tolerate drought. We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible ""dry""/""wet"" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control. and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR(max), final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other. Based on these controlled-environment results, we hypothesize that the commonly reported correlation between plant growth potential and drought tolerance in the field may in some cases be explained by differential effects of plants on soil-water content rather than by differences in species responses to drought.","Drought levels were non-lethal but still had a marked effect on growth. Final biomass was reduced by an average of 50% (moderate drought) to 68% (severe drought) compared with the well-watered controls (Fig. 3). After factoring out initial size differences, we found that all species were affected by drought to a similar degree (non-significant interaction, Table 3). Drought effects on biomass were more pronounced above- than belowground (Table 3), causing an increase in the root:shoot ratio (Fig. 4a). Allometric analyses show that, within species, the proportion of biomass in roots, stems and blades was the result of the effect of drought on total biomass (_ontogenetic driftÓ), rather than a direct response to the treatments (Table 3). Drought affected the number of tillers per plant, but not biomass per tiller. Specific leaf area (SLA) was markedly reduced by drought Fig. 4b. SLA was the only variable that showed a species-specific response todrought (interaction in Table 3): Muhlenbergia porteri had a larger reduction (P<0.001), and Scleropogon brevifolius a smaller reduction (P=0.04) than the other species (Fig. 4b).","In stark contrast to this prediction, we found a similar proportional reduction in growth for all species when subjected to similar drought treatments. In other words, we failed to reject the null (no-trade-off) hypothesis in Fig. 1. As with any such _negativeÓ (lack-ofeffect) result, an important question is (Peters 1991): had a true effect existed, were our experimental protocol and analyses capable of detecting it? We are confident that they were, because of two partially related considerations: the intensity of the imposed drought, and the statistical power of our analyses.

Our controlledenvironment results do not support the commonly assumed negative correlation between growth potential and drought tolerance","Although general trends in plant architecture, leaf morphology, and gas-exchange characteristics along regional precipitation gradients are consistent with the trade-off hypothesis (Schulze and Hall 1982; Givnish 1986; Tilman 1988), there is limited direct evidence that such trends are attributable to ecophysiological tradeoffs. In part, progress has been hindered by three specific experimental constraints: (1) plant effects on soil-water availability are difficult to distinguish from plant responses to soil-water availability (Goldberg 1990): the larger the plant in relation to rooting volume, the larger this effect; (2) when measuring plant response to increasing drought over time, it is difficult to distinguish drought-induced changes in plant morphology and physiology from size-dependent (ontogenetic) changes; and (3) comparisons between plant functional groups are confounded because of differences in, e.g., phenology, temperature optima, or growth habit. The most parsimonious way of reconciling these apparently conflicting results from field and controlledenvironment studies is to consider the distinction between plant responses to, and plant effects on, soil resources (Goldberg 1990).

We set open-bottom pots over a column of a uniform porous medium with a water table at different depths (Fig. 2).

Consequently, drought intensity becomes independent of plant size.","Eight perennial C-4 grasses from the Jornada del Muerto Basin in southern New Mexico show fivefold differences in relative growth rates under well-watered conditions (RGR(max)). In a controlled environment, we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship (trade-off) between RGR(max) and the capacity of these species to tolerate drought. We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible ""dry""/""wet"" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control. and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR(max), final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other. Based on these controlled-environment results, we hypothesize that the commonly reported correlation between plant growth potential and drought tolerance in the field may in some cases be explained by differential effects of plants on soil-water content rather than by differences in species responses to drought.","Drought levels were non-lethal but still had a marked effect on growth. Final biomass was reduced by an average of 50% (moderate drought) to 68% (severe drought) compared with the well-watered controls (Fig. 3). After factoring out initial size differences, we found that all species were affected by drought to a similar degree (non-significant interaction, Table 3). Drought effects on biomass were more pronounced above- than belowground (Table 3), causing an increase in the root:shoot ratio (Fig. 4a). Allometric analyses show that, within species, the proportion of biomass in roots, stems and blades was the result of the effect of drought on total biomass (_ontogenetic driftÓ), rather than a direct response to the treatments (Table 3). Drought affected the number of tillers per plant, but not biomass per tiller. Specific leaf area (SLA) was markedly reduced by drought Fig. 4b. SLA was the only variable that showed a species-specific response todrought (interaction in Table 3): Muhlenbergia porteri had a larger reduction (P<0.001), and Scleropogon brevifolius a smaller reduction (P=0.04) than the other species (Fig. 4b).","In stark contrast to this prediction, we found a similar proportional reduction in growth for all species when subjected to similar drought treatments.

We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible ""dry""/""wet"" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control. and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR(max), final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other. Based on these controlled-environment results, we hypothesize that the commonly reported correlation between plant growth potential and drought tolerance in the field may in some cases be explained by differential effects of plants on soil-water content rather than by differences in species responses to drought.","Drought levels were non-lethal but still had a marked effect on growth. Final biomass was reduced by an average of 50% (moderate drought) to 68% (severe drought) compared with the well-watered controls (Fig. 3). After factoring out initial size differences, we found that all species were affected by drought to a similar degree (non-significant interaction, Table 3). Drought effects on biomass were more pronounced above- than belowground (Table 3), causing an increase in the root:shoot ratio (Fig. 4a). Allometric analyses show that, within species, the proportion of biomass in roots, stems and blades was the result of the effect of drought on total biomass (_ontogenetic driftÓ), rather than a direct response to the treatments (Table 3). Drought affected the number of tillers per plant, but not biomass per tiller. Specific leaf area (SLA) was markedly reduced by drought Fig. 4b. SLA was the only variable that showed a species-specific response todrought (interaction in Table 3): Muhlenbergia porteri had a larger reduction (P<0.001), and Scleropogon brevifolius a smaller reduction (P=0.04) than the other species (Fig. 4b).","In stark contrast to this prediction, we found a similar proportional reduction in growth for all species when subjected to similar drought treatments. In other words, we failed to reject the null (no-trade-off) hypothesis in Fig. 1. As with any such _negativeÓ (lack-ofeffect) result, an important question is (Peters 1991): had a true effect existed, were our experimental protocol and analyses capable of detecting it? We are confident that they were, because of two partially related considerations: the intensity of the imposed drought, and the statistical power of our analyses. Still, regardless of their photosyntheticphysiology, all eight species apparently responded to drought via the same mechanisms, with morphological (e.g., SLA) and allocation (e.g., root:shoot) adjustments that reduce water loss _ and are likely to increase field survival _ at the cost of reduced growth. Our controlledenvironment results do not support the commonly assumed negative correlation between growth potential and drought tolerance","Although general trends in plant architecture, leaf morphology, and gas-exchange characteristics along regional precipitation gradients are consistent with the trade-off hypothesis (Schulze and Hall 1982; Givnish 1986; Tilman 1988), there is limited direct evidence that such trends are attributable to ecophysiological tradeoffs. In part, progress has been hindered by three specific experimental constraints: (1) plant effects on soil-water availability are difficult to distinguish from plant responses to soil-water availability (Goldberg 1990): the larger the plant in relation to rooting volume, the larger this effect; (2) when measuring plant response to increasing drought over time, it is difficult to distinguish drought-induced changes in plant morphology and physiology from size-dependent (ontogenetic) changes; and (3) comparisons between plant functional groups are confounded because of differences in, e.g., phenology, temperature optima, or growth habit. The most parsimonious way of reconciling these apparently conflicting results from field and controlledenvironment studies is to consider the distinction between plant responses to, and plant effects on, soil resources (Goldberg 1990). Field studies, unlike controlled environment experiments, are usually unable toseparate these effects. We argue that interspecific differences observed in the field are not necessarily a manifestation of different physiological tolerance to drought, and that not even differences in potential transpiration rates per unit leaf area have to be invoked. Green-grass biomass is one of the most dynamic attributes of semiarid landscapes (Peters et al. 1993). It may be that, following a precipitation event, rhizosphere soil water potential drops faster in patches dominated by fast-growing species than in patches dominated by slow-growing ones, owing mainly to a difference in green biomass and leaf area between the patches (greater in patches dominated by fast-growing species as a result of fast growth). This would result in the observed interspecific differences in growth and mortality. Acknowledging the differences between water and other soil resources, the slow growth of some of these grasses under non-limiting water conditions resembles what was first proposed as an adaptation to cope with nutrient shortages (Chapin 1980; Poorter 1990): that a low potential growth rate would be advantageous under stress because it reduces resource requirements.",,Panicum obtusum Kunth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"aboveground biomass, specific leaf area, tissue density",Root biomass,decrease,Root to shoot ratio,increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[specific leaf area, tissue density",,,"[severe drought, moderate drought, control]","...When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks.

In a preliminary study, we found that eight perennial C-4 grasses from the northern Chihuahuan Desert (Jornada del Muerto Basin, New Mexico, USA) have substantial differences in growth potential under well-watered conditions, despite presumably belonging to the same functional group (Table 1). Sustained growth at these rates would result in large differences in the length of time required for a species to double its biomass (<1 week for Eragrostis lehmanniana to 4 weeks for Scleropogon brevifolius), we examined the growth of these eight perennial grasses in response to simulated drought in a controlled environment. To elucidate mechanisms of response, we assessed both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth.","Drought was imposed using a modification of the method proposed by Haan and Barfield (1971), as described by Snow and Tingey (1985), which overcomes the first two experimental constraints of plant-soil water interactions described in the Introduction. The third constraint was overcome by our choice of eight species belonging to the same family and having the same perennial growth habit and photosynthetic pathway. We set open-bottom pots over a column of a uniform porous medium with a water table at different depths (Fig. 2). This procedure ensures a uniform and repeatable water potential in the pots (Wookey et al. 1991; Saulescu et al. 1995). Consequently, drought intensity becomes independent of plant size.","Eight perennial C-4 grasses from the Jornada del Muerto Basin in southern New Mexico show fivefold differences in relative growth rates under well-watered conditions (RGR(max)). In a controlled environment, we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship (trade-off) between RGR(max) and the capacity of these species to tolerate drought. We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible ""dry""/""wet"" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control. and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR(max), final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other. Based on these controlled-environment results, we hypothesize that the commonly reported correlation between plant growth potential and drought tolerance in the field may in some cases be explained by differential effects of plants on soil-water content rather than by differences in species responses to drought.","Drought levels were non-lethal but still had a marked effect on growth. Final biomass was reduced by an average of 50% (moderate drought) to 68% (severe drought) compared with the well-watered controls (Fig. 3). After factoring out initial size differences, we found that all species were affected by drought to a similar degree (non-significant interaction, Table 3). Drought effects on biomass were more pronounced above- than belowground (Table 3), causing an increase in the root:shoot ratio (Fig. 4a). Allometric analyses show that, within species, the proportion of biomass in roots, stems and blades was the result of the effect of drought on total biomass (_ontogenetic driftÓ), rather than a direct response to the treatments (Table 3). Drought affected the number of tillers per plant, but not biomass per tiller. Specific leaf area (SLA) was markedly reduced by drought Fig. 4b. SLA was the only variable that showed a species-specific response todrought (interaction in Table 3): Muhlenbergia porteri had a larger reduction (P<0.001), and Scleropogon brevifolius a smaller reduction (P=0.04) than the other species (Fig. 4b).","In stark contrast to this prediction, we found a similar proportional reduction in growth for all species when subjected to similar drought treatments. In other words, we failed to reject the null (no-trade-off) hypothesis in Fig. 1. As with any such _negativeÓ (lack-ofeffect) result, an important question is (Peters 1991): had a true effect existed, were our experimental protocol and analyses capable of detecting it? We are confident that they were, because of two partially related considerations: the intensity of the imposed drought, and the statistical power of our analyses. Still, regardless of their photosyntheticphysiology, all eight species apparently responded to drought via the same mechanisms, with morphological (e.g., SLA) and allocation (e.g., root:shoot) adjustments that reduce water loss _ and are likely to increase field survival _ at the cost of reduced growth. Our controlledenvironment results do not support the commonly assumed negative correlation between growth potential and drought tolerance","Although general trends in plant architecture, leaf morphology, and gas-exchange characteristics along regional precipitation gradients are consistent with the trade-off hypothesis (Schulze and Hall 1982; Givnish 1986; Tilman 1988), there is limited direct evidence that such trends are attributable to ecophysiological tradeoffs. In part, progress has been hindered by three specific experimental constraints: (1) plant effects on soil-water availability are difficult to distinguish from plant responses to soil-water availability (Goldberg 1990): the larger the plant in relation to rooting volume, the larger this effect; (2) when measuring plant response to increasing drought over time, it is difficult to distinguish drought-induced changes in plant morphology and physiology from size-dependent (ontogenetic) changes; and (3) comparisons between plant functional groups are confounded because of differences in, e.g., phenology, temperature optima, or growth habit. The most parsimonious way of reconciling these apparently conflicting results from field and controlledenvironment studies is to consider the distinction between plant responses to, and plant effects on, soil resources (Goldberg 1990). Field studies, unlike controlled environment experiments, are usually unable toseparate these effects. We argue that interspecific differences observed in the field are not necessarily a manifestation of different physiological tolerance to drought, and that not even differences in potential transpiration rates per unit leaf area have to be invoked. Green-grass biomass is one of the most dynamic attributes of semiarid landscapes (Peters et al. 1993). It may be that, following a precipitation event, rhizosphere soil water potential drops faster in patches dominated by fast-growing species than in patches dominated by slow-growing ones, owing mainly to a difference in green biomass and leaf area between the patches (greater in patches dominated by fast-growing species as a result of fast growth). This would result in the observed interspecific differences in growth and mortality. Acknowledging the differences between water and other soil resources, the slow growth of some of these grasses under non-limiting water conditions resembles what was first proposed as an adaptation to cope with nutrient shortages (Chapin 1980; Poorter 1990): that a low potential growth rate would be advantageous under stress because it reduces resource requirements.",,Bouteloua eriopoda (Torr.)

Quercus ilex decreased stomatal conductance even before severe water stress occurred, thereby avoiding dessication during drought. Quercus pubescens had the highest water potential despite a high stomatal conductance, indicating that its leaf water status was independent of stomatal activity.

(Pterocarpus indicus Willd.), one of the most valuable native reforestation species in the Philippines. RGP was determined in response to three different soil moisture regimes (50, 75 and 100% of field capacity). Effects of these treatments on height, root-collar diameter, stem diameter, length of taproot, shoot biomass, root biomass, total biomass, root:shoot ratio and seedling quality index were also investigated. Measurements were made on 7, 14 and 21 days after transplanting. The experiment was laid out using a completely randomized design. RGP and length of taproot were significantly affected by moisture treatment at 7 days. High RGP and longer taproots were observed in soil at 50% of field capacity. Increased stem diameter, shoot biomass, total biomass and quality index were observed in the reduced soil moisture condition at 7 and 14 days. Results confirm that narra is capable of producing new roots in response to reduced soil moisture on a relatively short period of time.

Conclusion Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained.","There was a significant effect of drought on the allometric relationships between root and shoot biomass in Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina and seedlings that experience drought had less root biomass relative to shoot biomass compared to seedlings in the watered control (Table 1). Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina also showed a decrease in biomass allocation to roots under drought but differences were only marginally significant (P = 0.055 and P = 0.069, respectively). In the watered control columns, the slope of the root:shoot biomass curve was equal to 1 in all species except Avenella flexuosa, which allocated less biomass to roots than to shoots even under well-watered conditions (Table 1). There were no differences in the total root length per unit shoot biomass between drought and watered control columns in any of the five species (Table 1). Rooting depth was, however, more responsive to water availability than total root length (Fig. 3, Table 1). Plants experiencing drought had deeper roots at a given shoot size than control plants in all species. The effect got stronger as drought intensified throughout the experiment. A complete lack of secondary root formation under drought was a common response for all species. Secondary roots were not initiated and seedlings relied solely on their primary roots for water supply under drought. Under control conditions, however, the species exhibited different root growth strategies and secondary roots started to appear 22_24 days after germination in Agrostis mertensii, Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina, at 28 days in Festuca ovina and at about 40 days in Avenella flexuosa. Seedlings of the latter species showed great differences between individuals, with a few individuals producing secondary roots earlier and at smaller size. The sampling strategy did not allow for tests of species effects on time until emergence. Threshold shoot size for initiation of secondary roots varied from 2 mg in F. ovina and P. alpina to 3 mg in A. mertensii, 5 mg in P. alpinum and 20 mg in A. flexuosa (not shown). The allometric coefficient for the relationship between length and biomass of primary roots (SRL?) was consistently higher than 1 under drought conditions in all species, but only Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina displayed a significant response to drought. These species showed significantly higher investment in root length per unit root biomass of the primary roots under drought conditions than the control (Table 1). Agrostis mertensii, Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina displayed less flexible strategies, with relatively more root length per unit root biomass under both sets of growing conditions. Secondary roots had a lower SRL than the primary roots (Table 2), causing a considerably lower total root length per unit root biomass for the whole root system under control conditions compared to the drought conditions where the root system only consisted of primary roots. Specific root length (SRL) of the whole seedling root system increased with time and plant size under drought in all species, while it showed no response or a slow decline in the control (regressions not shown). Correcting for plant size, the drought treatment gave higher SRL than the control in Festuca ovina only (Table S2). Avenella flexuosa had a lower SRL than the other species under both sets of conditions (Table S3, Fig. 2). Primary roots had a much higher SRL than secondary roots in the control columns (Tables 2, S3), causing the differences in SRL observed between drought and control treatments. Except for a weak declining trend in root tissue density (RTD) with time in the drought treatment, there were no clear patterns in RTD with respect to plant size and time. Avenella flexuosa had a higher RTD than the other species in both control and drought conditions (Tables 2, S2), explaining the lower SRL observed in this species. Festuca ovina also had a higher RTD than the remaining three species but only under drought. RTD was higher in the drought treatment in A. flexuosa, F. ovina and Phleum alpinum compared to the control because of an increasing proportion of secondary roots with a considerably lower RTD than primary roots (range 0.025_0.042 g cm_3 across species) in the control treatment. However, the response to drought differed between species (species by treatment interaction: F_=_3.92, P_<_0.004) and for A. mertensii and P. alpina no effect of drought on RTD was observed. For the primary roots alone, the five species had a similar increase in RTD under drought. Interestingly, the mean root diameter did not differ between species and was not responsive to drought (Table 3). Seedlings experiencing drought had fewer and shorter higher-order roots and a higher topological index than seedlings in the control treatment (Fig. 4, Table 3). These responses indicated a change towards a more herringbone-like structure of the (primary) root system under drought, an effect that was most pronounced in A. flexuosa and F. ovina (Fig. 4). A plot of the log altitude - log magnitude relationship also illustrated seedling root systems of these species to be closer to a herringbone than to a dichotomous branching pattern (Fig. 6) also apparent in the root-scan pictures (Fig. 5). The effect of drought on the formation of lateral and higher order roots, the topological index, root system magnitude, root diameter and segment length did not differ between species (i.e. no species by drought interaction, Table 3). Rooting depth and root system magnitude had the most plastic response to drought, while the topological index was the least plastic (Table 4).","Young grass seedlings were able to track soil moisture during progressive drought through deeper rooting, although phenotypic plasticity of biomass allocation, root morphology and root system architecture were only low or moderate. Drought resulted in deeper roots with shorter and fewer higher-order roots and a higher topological index indicating a change towards a more herringbone-like structure of the primary root system in all five species, although Agrostis mertensii showed some deviating patterns. These changes were sufficient to provide shoots with water over an eight-week period of progressing drought. Surprisingly, biomass allocation to roots decreased or was unaffected by drought. As development of secondary roots was arrested in all five species under drought, this plasticity of the primary root system may well be one of the key features for seedling survival in grasses under drought. Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained. Seedling rooting depth was one of the most plastic responses and increased with drought, while total root length per unit shoot biomass was not affected. This supports the prediction that seedlings of similar size produce deeper roots under drought, but not the prediction that seedlings would invest in more root length per shoot biomass under drought. These responses reflect the relative importance of rooting depth versus root length under drought. Although there was a positive relationship between total root length and water uptake when water was available, a deeper root system is more important for dehydration avoidance than total root length and root biomass (Huang et al. 2014). Surprisingly, Hoekstra et al. (2014) found no clear link between depth of water uptake and resistance to drought in a set of grassland species. This observation was supported by Bristiel et al. (2019) who found that characteristics of deep roots (diameter and root tissue density) better explained drought tolerance in Dactylis glomerata than rooting depth. Plants often have a suite of traits that provide a combination of dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance (Ludlow 1989; Johnson and Asay 1993; Volaire et al. 2014; Volaire 2018). Deeper roots provided a mechanism of dehydration avoidance for the seedlings and was, together with stomatal regulation of water loss, sufficient to maintain leaf turgor. Drought prevented the development of secondary roots in all species. The primary root system had only a moderate plasticity in SLR and RTD in response to drought and root diameter was not affected. These differences in SRL and RTD between primary and secondary roots caused a considerable difference in average SRL and RTD between drought and control conditions for the whole root systems. Major components of root system architecture were affected by drought, but the phenotypic plasticity of most traits was low to moderate (RDPI values around 0.2 and below). The changes were towards a deeper, simpler, more herringbone-like root system (with a higher topological index) under drought.","Seedling survival is critical for plant establishment, but is severely constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors (Moles and Westoby 2004; James et al. 2012). Water availability is one of these critical factors for seedling performance in many systems, typically where seasonal droughts are common (Lloret et al. 2005; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007; Gaviria and Engelbrecht 2015). Hence, drought may impose a high selection pressure on seedlings (Moles and Leishman 2008), driving adaptations in root growth strategies to acquire water. As the soil is a complex heterogeneous matrix, plastic root traits involving morphology, physiology and allocation patterns are fundamental to the growth of functional root systems (Fitter 2002; Forde 2009). Nevertheless, less plastic root growth strategies are often observed in species adapted to drier conditions (Nicotra et al. 2002; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007) and studies have found a negative relationship between drought tolerance and root plasticity (e.g. Couso and Fern_ndez 2012) indicating trade-offs along humidity gradients. Traits for tissue morphology, architecture and physiology may be even more plastic than biomass allocation (Comas et al. 2013). Plastic responses to water availability have been observed for physiological traits such as abscisic acid and proline content (Davies and Bacon 2003) and morphological traits and phene aggregates such as specific root length (Padilla et al. 2009, 2013), rooting depth (Reader et al. 1993; Alvarez-Flores et al. 2014), root length (Bell and Sultan 1999), root:shoot ratios (Padilla et al. 2009) and root surface area (Saidi et al. 2010). The adaptive value of trait plasticity for seedling performance under drought is, however, highly dependent on the intensity and duration of drought episodes and interactions with other environmental conditions (Tardieu 2012). It is evident that root growth strategies are linked to whole-plant strategies (Reich 2014) through trait covariation suites or syndromes (Chapin et al. 1993; Freschet et al. 2018). Such syndromes affect both dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance in grasses (Bristiel et al. 2019) and relate to seedling growth forms and productivity in a wider set of species (Larson and Funk 2016).",Primary and secondary roots measured seperately,Combined,Shoot biomass,Biomass (AG),,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf turgor, FvFm (Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII), leaf water content",Root biomass,na,Rooting depth,increase,RSR or RMF,na,Root length,no effect,Specific root length,increase,Root tissue density,na,topological index,increase,,,,,,,,"Shoot biomass, leaf turgor, FvFm (Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII), leaf water content",,,No water for 8 weeks (vs. watered to runoff 4 times each week in control),"Drought increased rooting depth and either decreased (in Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina) or did not change (in Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina) relative biomass allocation to roots.

These changes were sufficient to provide shoots with water over an eight-week period of progressing drought. Surprisingly, biomass allocation to roots decreased or was unaffected by drought. As development of secondary roots was arrested in all five species under drought, this plasticity of the primary root system may well be one of the key features for seedling survival in grasses under drought. Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained. Seedling rooting depth was one of the most plastic responses and increased with drought, while total root length per unit shoot biomass was not affected. This supports the prediction that seedlings of similar size produce deeper roots under drought, but not the prediction that seedlings would invest in more root length per shoot biomass under drought. These responses reflect the relative importance of rooting depth versus root length under drought. Although there was a positive relationship between total root length and water uptake when water was available, a deeper root system is more important for dehydration avoidance than total root length and root biomass (Huang et al. 2014). Surprisingly, Hoekstra et al. (2014) found no clear link between depth of water uptake and resistance to drought in a set of grassland species. This observation was supported by Bristiel et al. (2019) who found that characteristics of deep roots (diameter and root tissue density) better explained drought tolerance in Dactylis glomerata than rooting depth. Plants often have a suite of traits that provide a combination of dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance (Ludlow 1989; Johnson and Asay 1993; Volaire et al. 2014; Volaire 2018). Deeper roots provided a mechanism of dehydration avoidance for the seedlings and was, together with stomatal regulation of water loss, sufficient to maintain leaf turgor. Drought prevented the development of secondary roots in all species. The primary root system had only a moderate plasticity in SLR and RTD in response to drought and root diameter was not affected. These differences in SRL and RTD between primary and secondary roots caused a considerable difference in average SRL and RTD between drought and control conditions for the whole root systems. Major components of root system architecture were affected by drought, but the phenotypic plasticity of most traits was low to moderate (RDPI values around 0.2 and below). The changes were towards a deeper, simpler, more herringbone-like root system (with a higher topological index) under drought.","Seedling survival is critical for plant establishment, but is severely constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors (Moles and Westoby 2004; James et al. 2012). Water availability is one of these critical factors for seedling performance in many systems, typically where seasonal droughts are common (Lloret et al. 2005; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007; Gaviria and Engelbrecht 2015). Hence, drought may impose a high selection pressure on seedlings (Moles and Leishman 2008), driving adaptations in root growth strategies to acquire water. As the soil is a complex heterogeneous matrix, plastic root traits involving morphology, physiology and allocation patterns are fundamental to the growth of functional root systems (Fitter 2002; Forde 2009). Nevertheless, less plastic root growth strategies are often observed in species adapted to drier conditions (Nicotra et al. 2002; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007) and studies have found a negative relationship between drought tolerance and root plasticity (e.g. Couso and Fern_ndez 2012) indicating trade-offs along humidity gradients. Traits for tissue morphology, architecture and physiology may be even more plastic than biomass allocation (Comas et al. 2013). Plastic responses to water availability have been observed for physiological traits such as abscisic acid and proline content (Davies and Bacon 2003) and morphological traits and phene aggregates such as specific root length (Padilla et al. 2009, 2013), rooting depth (Reader et al. 1993; Alvarez-Flores et al. 2014), root length (Bell and Sultan 1999), root:shoot ratios (Padilla et al. 2009) and root surface area (Saidi et al. 2010). The adaptive value of trait plasticity for seedling performance under drought is, however, highly dependent on the intensity and duration of drought episodes and interactions with other environmental conditions (Tardieu 2012). It is evident that root growth strategies are linked to whole-plant strategies (Reich 2014) through trait covariation suites or syndromes (Chapin et al. 1993; Freschet et al. 2018). Such syndromes affect both dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance in grasses (Bristiel et al. 2019) and relate to seedling growth forms and productivity in a wider set of species (Larson and Funk 2016).",Primary and secondary roots measured seperately,Avenella flexuosa (L.)

Allometric scaling exponents and standardised major axis regression were used to investigate allocation patterns.

Conclusion Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained.","There was a significant effect of drought on the allometric relationships between root and shoot biomass in Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina and seedlings that experience drought had less root biomass relative to shoot biomass compared to seedlings in the watered control (Table 1). Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina also showed a decrease in biomass allocation to roots under drought but differences were only marginally significant (P = 0.055 and P = 0.069, respectively). In the watered control columns, the slope of the root:shoot biomass curve was equal to 1 in all species except Avenella flexuosa, which allocated less biomass to roots than to shoots even under well-watered conditions (Table 1). There were no differences in the total root length per unit shoot biomass between drought and watered control columns in any of the five species (Table 1). Rooting depth was, however, more responsive to water availability than total root length (Fig. 3, Table 1). Plants experiencing drought had deeper roots at a given shoot size than control plants in all species. The effect got stronger as drought intensified throughout the experiment. A complete lack of secondary root formation under drought was a common response for all species. Secondary roots were not initiated and seedlings relied solely on their primary roots for water supply under drought. Under control conditions, however, the species exhibited different root growth strategies and secondary roots started to appear 22_24 days after germination in Agrostis mertensii, Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina, at 28 days in Festuca ovina and at about 40 days in Avenella flexuosa. Seedlings of the latter species showed great differences between individuals, with a few individuals producing secondary roots earlier and at smaller size. The sampling strategy did not allow for tests of species effects on time until emergence. Threshold shoot size for initiation of secondary roots varied from 2 mg in F. ovina and P. alpina to 3 mg in A. mertensii, 5 mg in P. alpinum and 20 mg in A. flexuosa (not shown). The allometric coefficient for the relationship between length and biomass of primary roots (SRL?) was consistently higher than 1 under drought conditions in all species, but only Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina displayed a significant response to drought. These species showed significantly higher investment in root length per unit root biomass of the primary roots under drought conditions than the control (Table 1). Agrostis mertensii, Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina displayed less flexible strategies, with relatively more root length per unit root biomass under both sets of growing conditions. Secondary roots had a lower SRL than the primary roots (Table 2), causing a considerably lower total root length per unit root biomass for the whole root system under control conditions compared to the drought conditions where the root system only consisted of primary roots. Specific root length (SRL) of the whole seedling root system increased with time and plant size under drought in all species, while it showed no response or a slow decline in the control (regressions not shown). Correcting for plant size, the drought treatment gave higher SRL than the control in Festuca ovina only (Table S2). Avenella flexuosa had a lower SRL than the other species under both sets of conditions (Table S3, Fig. 2). Primary roots had a much higher SRL than secondary roots in the control columns (Tables 2, S3), causing the differences in SRL observed between drought and control treatments. Except for a weak declining trend in root tissue density (RTD) with time in the drought treatment, there were no clear patterns in RTD with respect to plant size and time. Avenella flexuosa had a higher RTD than the other species in both control and drought conditions (Tables 2, S2), explaining the lower SRL observed in this species. Festuca ovina also had a higher RTD than the remaining three species but only under drought. RTD was higher in the drought treatment in A. flexuosa, F. ovina and Phleum alpinum compared to the control because of an increasing proportion of secondary roots with a considerably lower RTD than primary roots (range 0.025_0.042 g cm_3 across species) in the control treatment. However, the response to drought differed between species (species by treatment interaction: F_=_3.92, P_<_0.004) and for A. mertensii and P. alpina no effect of drought on RTD was observed. For the primary roots alone, the five species had a similar increase in RTD under drought. Interestingly, the mean root diameter did not differ between species and was not responsive to drought (Table 3). Seedlings experiencing drought had fewer and shorter higher-order roots and a higher topological index than seedlings in the control treatment (Fig. 4, Table 3). These responses indicated a change towards a more herringbone-like structure of the (primary) root system under drought, an effect that was most pronounced in A. flexuosa and F. ovina (Fig. 4). A plot of the log altitude - log magnitude relationship also illustrated seedling root systems of these species to be closer to a herringbone than to a dichotomous branching pattern (Fig. 6) also apparent in the root-scan pictures (Fig. 5). The effect of drought on the formation of lateral and higher order roots, the topological index, root system magnitude, root diameter and segment length did not differ between species (i.e. no species by drought interaction, Table 3). Rooting depth and root system magnitude had the most plastic response to drought, while the topological index was the least plastic (Table 4).","Young grass seedlings were able to track soil moisture during progressive drought through deeper rooting, although phenotypic plasticity of biomass allocation, root morphology and root system architecture were only low or moderate.

We aim to document the ability of young grass seedlings to adjust their root system architecture, root morphology and biomass allocation to roots to promote water uptake and survival under progressive drought.

Allometric scaling exponents and standardised major axis regression were used to investigate allocation patterns. Results Young seedlings were able to sustain leaf turgor and functions during eight weeks of progressive drought through phenotypic plasticity of the primary root system producing deeper and simpler roots.

Conclusion Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained.","There was a significant effect of drought on the allometric relationships between root and shoot biomass in Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina and seedlings that experience drought had less root biomass relative to shoot biomass compared to seedlings in the watered control (Table 1). Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina also showed a decrease in biomass allocation to roots under drought but differences were only marginally significant (P = 0.055 and P = 0.069, respectively). In the watered control columns, the slope of the root:shoot biomass curve was equal to 1 in all species except Avenella flexuosa, which allocated less biomass to roots than to shoots even under well-watered conditions (Table 1). There were no differences in the total root length per unit shoot biomass between drought and watered control columns in any of the five species (Table 1). Rooting depth was, however, more responsive to water availability than total root length (Fig. 3, Table 1). Plants experiencing drought had deeper roots at a given shoot size than control plants in all species. The effect got stronger as drought intensified throughout the experiment. A complete lack of secondary root formation under drought was a common response for all species. Secondary roots were not initiated and seedlings relied solely on their primary roots for water supply under drought. Under control conditions, however, the species exhibited different root growth strategies and secondary roots started to appear 22_24 days after germination in Agrostis mertensii, Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina, at 28 days in Festuca ovina and at about 40 days in Avenella flexuosa. Seedlings of the latter species showed great differences between individuals, with a few individuals producing secondary roots earlier and at smaller size. The sampling strategy did not allow for tests of species effects on time until emergence. Threshold shoot size for initiation of secondary roots varied from 2 mg in F. ovina and P. alpina to 3 mg in A. mertensii, 5 mg in P. alpinum and 20 mg in A. flexuosa (not shown). The allometric coefficient for the relationship between length and biomass of primary roots (SRL?) was consistently higher than 1 under drought conditions in all species, but only Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina displayed a significant response to drought. These species showed significantly higher investment in root length per unit root biomass of the primary roots under drought conditions than the control (Table 1). Agrostis mertensii, Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina displayed less flexible strategies, with relatively more root length per unit root biomass under both sets of growing conditions. Secondary roots had a lower SRL than the primary roots (Table 2), causing a considerably lower total root length per unit root biomass for the whole root system under control conditions compared to the drought conditions where the root system only consisted of primary roots. Specific root length (SRL) of the whole seedling root system increased with time and plant size under drought in all species, while it showed no response or a slow decline in the control (regressions not shown). Correcting for plant size, the drought treatment gave higher SRL than the control in Festuca ovina only (Table S2). Avenella flexuosa had a lower SRL than the other species under both sets of conditions (Table S3, Fig. 2). Primary roots had a much higher SRL than secondary roots in the control columns (Tables 2, S3), causing the differences in SRL observed between drought and control treatments. Except for a weak declining trend in root tissue density (RTD) with time in the drought treatment, there were no clear patterns in RTD with respect to plant size and time. Avenella flexuosa had a higher RTD than the other species in both control and drought conditions (Tables 2, S2), explaining the lower SRL observed in this species. Festuca ovina also had a higher RTD than the remaining three species but only under drought. RTD was higher in the drought treatment in A. flexuosa, F. ovina and Phleum alpinum compared to the control because of an increasing proportion of secondary roots with a considerably lower RTD than primary roots (range 0.025_0.042 g cm_3 across species) in the control treatment. However, the response to drought differed between species (species by treatment interaction: F_=_3.92, P_<_0.004) and for A. mertensii and P. alpina no effect of drought on RTD was observed. For the primary roots alone, the five species had a similar increase in RTD under drought. Interestingly, the mean root diameter did not differ between species and was not responsive to drought (Table 3). Seedlings experiencing drought had fewer and shorter higher-order roots and a higher topological index than seedlings in the control treatment (Fig. 4, Table 3). These responses indicated a change towards a more herringbone-like structure of the (primary) root system under drought, an effect that was most pronounced in A. flexuosa and F. ovina (Fig. 4). A plot of the log altitude - log magnitude relationship also illustrated seedling root systems of these species to be closer to a herringbone than to a dichotomous branching pattern (Fig. 6) also apparent in the root-scan pictures (Fig. 5). The effect of drought on the formation of lateral and higher order roots, the topological index, root system magnitude, root diameter and segment length did not differ between species (i.e. no species by drought interaction, Table 3). Rooting depth and root system magnitude had the most plastic response to drought, while the topological index was the least plastic (Table 4).","Young grass seedlings were able to track soil moisture during progressive drought through deeper rooting, although phenotypic plasticity of biomass allocation, root morphology and root system architecture were only low or moderate. Drought resulted in deeper roots with shorter and fewer higher-order roots and a higher topological index indicating a change towards a more herringbone-like structure of the primary root system in all five species, although Agrostis mertensii showed some deviating patterns. These changes were sufficient to provide shoots with water over an eight-week period of progressing drought. Surprisingly, biomass allocation to roots decreased or was unaffected by drought. As development of secondary roots was arrested in all five species under drought, this plasticity of the primary root system may well be one of the key features for seedling survival in grasses under drought. Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained. Seedling rooting depth was one of the most plastic responses and increased with drought, while total root length per unit shoot biomass was not affected. This supports the prediction that seedlings of similar size produce deeper roots under drought, but not the prediction that seedlings would invest in more root length per shoot biomass under drought. These responses reflect the relative importance of rooting depth versus root length under drought. Although there was a positive relationship between total root length and water uptake when water was available, a deeper root system is more important for dehydration avoidance than total root length and root biomass (Huang et al. 2014). Surprisingly, Hoekstra et al. (2014) found no clear link between depth of water uptake and resistance to drought in a set of grassland species. This observation was supported by Bristiel et al. (2019) who found that characteristics of deep roots (diameter and root tissue density) better explained drought tolerance in Dactylis glomerata than rooting depth. Plants often have a suite of traits that provide a combination of dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance (Ludlow 1989; Johnson and Asay 1993; Volaire et al. 2014; Volaire 2018). Deeper roots provided a mechanism of dehydration avoidance for the seedlings and was, together with stomatal regulation of water loss, sufficient to maintain leaf turgor. Drought prevented the development of secondary roots in all species. The primary root system had only a moderate plasticity in SLR and RTD in response to drought and root diameter was not affected. These differences in SRL and RTD between primary and secondary roots caused a considerable difference in average SRL and RTD between drought and control conditions for the whole root systems. Major components of root system architecture were affected by drought, but the phenotypic plasticity of most traits was low to moderate (RDPI values around 0.2 and below). The changes were towards a deeper, simpler, more herringbone-like root system (with a higher topological index) under drought.","Seedling survival is critical for plant establishment, but is severely constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors (Moles and Westoby 2004; James et al. 2012). Water availability is one of these critical factors for seedling performance in many systems, typically where seasonal droughts are common (Lloret et al. 2005; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007; Gaviria and Engelbrecht 2015). Hence, drought may impose a high selection pressure on seedlings (Moles and Leishman 2008), driving adaptations in root growth strategies to acquire water. As the soil is a complex heterogeneous matrix, plastic root traits involving morphology, physiology and allocation patterns are fundamental to the growth of functional root systems (Fitter 2002; Forde 2009). Nevertheless, less plastic root growth strategies are often observed in species adapted to drier conditions (Nicotra et al. 2002; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007) and studies have found a negative relationship between drought tolerance and root plasticity (e.g. Couso and Fern_ndez 2012) indicating trade-offs along humidity gradients. Traits for tissue morphology, architecture and physiology may be even more plastic than biomass allocation (Comas et al. 2013). Plastic responses to water availability have been observed for physiological traits such as abscisic acid and proline content (Davies and Bacon 2003) and morphological traits and phene aggregates such as specific root length (Padilla et al. 2009, 2013), rooting depth (Reader et al. 1993; Alvarez-Flores et al. 2014), root length (Bell and Sultan 1999), root:shoot ratios (Padilla et al. 2009) and root surface area (Saidi et al. 2010). The adaptive value of trait plasticity for seedling performance under drought is, however, highly dependent on the intensity and duration of drought episodes and interactions with other environmental conditions (Tardieu 2012). It is evident that root growth strategies are linked to whole-plant strategies (Reich 2014) through trait covariation suites or syndromes (Chapin et al. 1993; Freschet et al. 2018). Such syndromes affect both dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance in grasses (Bristiel et al. 2019) and relate to seedling growth forms and productivity in a wider set of species (Larson and Funk 2016).",Primary and secondary roots measured seperately,Phleum alpinum L.,Shoot biomass,Biomass (AG),Rooting depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf turgor, FvFm (Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII), leaf water content",Root biomass,no effect,Rooting depth,,RSR or RMF,decrease,Root length,,Specific root length,increase,Root tissue density,increase,topological index,,,,,,,,,"Shoot biomass, leaf turgor, FvFm (Maximum quantum efficiency of PSII), leaf water content",,,No water for 8 weeks (vs. watered to runoff 4 times each week in control),"Drought increased rooting depth and either decreased (in Avenella flexuosa and Festuca ovina) or did not change (in Phleum alpinum and Poa alpina) relative biomass allocation to roots.

Treatments involved a 33% decrease (DRY), 33% increase (WET), and ambient (AMB) levels of throughfall to the forest floor, begun in July, 1993. Video images of roots appearing on minirhizotron faces installed on both upper and lower slopes were recorded biweekly to a depth of 90 cm from April through October of 1994 and of 1996. Comparisons were made between treatments in amounts of new root elongation, root mortality, and calculated net root production. Minirhizotron observations during 1994 growing season, immediately following winter 1994 installation, revealed a strong effect of installation disturbance and were therefore not considered valid reflections of the response of the stand to the treatments. The 1996 data, on the other hand, exhibited absence of installation biases inherent in 1994 data because of a longer period since treatment initiation (2 2/3 yr vs. 8 mths), and favorable root growth conditions in all treatments during a greater portion of the year. The 1996 data were, therefore, considered realistic measures of below ground treatment responses. During 1996, net root production at 0-30 cm depth, at the upper slope positions, was significantly greater in DRY than in WET and AMB. Net root production was also greater at the lower slope position, but not significantly so. Treatment differences were the result of gross root production, as patterns of mortality did not differ across treatments. Nor were there significant treatment differences at depths below 30 cm.

Three rain shelters were constructed in the stand to prevent the rainfall from reaching the soil and to reduce water availability in the rhizosphere. Fine root biomass and necromass were repeatedly measured throughout a growing season by soil coring. We established the quantities of fine root biomass (live) and necromass (dead) at soil depths of 05, 515, 1525 and 2535cm. Significant differences in soil moisture contents between control and drought plots were found in the top 15cm of soil after 20weeks of rainfall manipulation (lasting from early June to late October). Our observations show that even relatively light drought decreased total fine root biomass from 272.0 to 242.8gm2 and increased the amount of necromass from 79.2 to 101.2gm2 in the top 35cm of soil. Very fine roots (VFR), that is, those with diameter up to 1mm, were more affected than total fine roots defined as 02mm.

However, water manipulation and root measurements are rarely coupled empirically across growth forms to identify whether belowground strategies are generalizable across species. We measured seedling root traits across three moisture levels in 18 Mediterranean forbs, grasses, and woody species. Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spectrum. We demonstrate that general patterns of root morphology and plasticity are identifiable across diverse species. Root trait measurements should enhance our understanding of below- ground strategy and performance across growth forms, but it will be critical to incorporate plasticity and additional aspects of root function into these efforts.","PC1 represented a spectrum of root investment and growth rate, with positive scores associated with smaller root diameter and RMF, and higher root growth rate, root elongation rate, SRL, and plant N uptake rate. Root elongation rate and plant N uptake rate shared significant correlations with every trait measured. Root traits were more often correlated with plant growth rate and with each other under low or moderate water treatments, or when species means were pooled across treatments.SRL and RMF _ two commonly used indicators of root function _ may not consistently represent this root trait spectrum because their relationships with other root traits vary with soil water availability; by contrast, root elongation rate was associated with growth and root traits across all water treatments. Despite absolute declines in rates of root mass growth, root elongation, and plant growth, species tended to allocate proportionately more biomass to roots (RMF) with increasing soil moisture stress across growth forms, suggesting an even greater loss in aboveground investment in response to drought. Short-term drought also elicited an overall decrease in SRL and increase in average root diameter (as measured across the entire root system), suggesting that a common response is to decrease the relative proportion of thin roots, thereby reducing root length per unit mass. This response could have many functional implications. For example, shifts to wider root diameter may promote penetrative ability in dry soils (Clark et al., 2003), while lower SRL of the root system may minimize plant water loss through lower specific hydraulic conductivity (Hernandez et al. 2012). ","Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spec- trum.","While species may be able to adjust the diameters of individual roots in response to drought, this response could also be related to root system architecture through a shift in the relative investment in primary and lateral roots. For example, one study found lower SRL to result from greater investment in the thicker primary axis relative to fine lateral roots in low-rainfall environments, perhaps as a strategy to reach water in deeper soil layers (Nicotra et al., 2002). Shifts to lower SRL could also be attributable to the construction of denser roots (Eissenstat, 1991), which can be an important mechanism associated with conservative strategies in resource-limited environments (Roumet et al., 2006). Studies that combine root morphological and architectural responses (e.g. quantifying root densities and length distributions across root orders) will more clearly differentiate response strategies across a range of life forms. Seedlings of these woody species grew more slowly and displayed the lowest rates of root growth/elongation and N uptake despite allocating more biomass to roots. A reasonable explanation for this pattern could be that woody species invest in thicker roots with low SRL, promoting longevity over rapid resource acquisition and growth (as has been found in fine roots of mature plants; Craine et al., 2002; Laughlin et al., 2010). Although woody seedlings did appear to invest less in very fine roots (< 0.2 mm; Fig S3), the lack of significant group differences in average root diameter and SRL observed here suggests that, in young seedlings, root morphology can be just as variable within as among growth forms. We found that much of the observed variation across six root traits could be captured by a single axis highlighting a belowground trade-off between resource conservation (high root diameter and RMF) and acquisition (rapid root elongation/growth, high N uptake rates and high SRL), analogous to that observed among leaf traits (Wright et al., 2004). Emerging studies have identified similar patterns (e.g. associations between SRL and root diameter or RMF) and suggest that these trade-offs may also reflect aspects of root construction, root cross-sectional anatomy, branching intensity, and mycorrhizal associations (Comas & Eissenstat, 2009; Markesteijn & Poorter, 2009; Holdaway etal., 2011; Kong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). High SRL and thin roots have also been associated with physiological indicators of rapid resource acquisition such as high root respiration rate (Tjoelker etal., 2005) and specific hydraulic conductance (Hernandez et al., 2010; Comas et al., 2013). Of these root traits, we found that SRL and root diameter were strongly and consistently associated with rapid root elongation, but not necessarily root mass or whole-plant growth rate. Thus, while they probably influence performance as part of a broader strategy, they may be poor direct predictors of growth. The utility of both RMF and plant N uptake as indicators of growth and belowground strategy was context-dependent; RMF was only a significant predictor of growth under low water availability (suggesting that it may have a larger response to and effect on water stress than previously thought; Poorter etal., 2012b), while plant N uptake was correlated with fewer root morphological traits as water became more available. By contrast, root elongation rate was consistently a strong predictor of plant growth rate and was frequently related to all other traits across our water gradient. We thus recommend that this trait be used as an indicator of root function and performance in future studies. As this trait is relatively difficult to measure in the field, it will be important to determine whether root elongation rates measured in more easily accessible glasshouse studies are comparable to those measured in field-grown individuals (e.g. using minirhizotrons or whole-plant extractions) and whether species means are sufficient to capture responses under variable field conditions.",,Grouped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Plant growth rate,Root biomass,decrease,RSR or RMF,increase,Root tips,decrease,Specific root length,decrease,Root elongation rate,decrease,Diameter,increase,,,,,,,,,,Plant growth rate,,,Three different water regimes,"Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion ofthin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)),rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth.

In this study we evaluated how water use strategies can influence the establishment phase of three coexisting species in forests where harvesting intensity and silvicultural interventions have been reduced over recent decades. We conducted a greenhouse experiment between February and July, applying two watering regimes (moist and dry) to current year seedlings in 1.5 m high pots to avoid root growth constraint. At the same time, the physiological performance of seedlings of the same species was monitored under natural conditions in the field over a period of decreasing soil moisture. Our results indicated that resprouter species allocated more than 40% of total biomass to roots whereas the non-resprouter P. pinea allocated only 26%. The plasticity index for the root traits was highest in Q ilex, in which the highest stomatal conductance was measured in early summer. The slowest growth and lowest root plasticity, root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential were measured in J. oxycedrus. The three species exhibited a positive carbon balance under low water availability. Coexisting species displayed a continuum in the water use strategies adopted. P. pinea would be the least competitive species under the forecasted increasing drought conditions in contrast to J. oxycedrus, which presents traits more suited to coping with droughts.

P. pinea allocated significantly more biomass to the aerial part than the other species (see ratio SDM/RDM, Table 2). There were no statistical differences between watering regimes in SDM and RDM (Table 2), however a treatment effect was found in the ratio SDM/RDM. The covariate tree size, measured as the shoot length at the beginning of the treatment application, showed a significant positive effect on the biomass fractions. In order to compare species traits and the effects of different watering regimes, we classified the root morphology according to diameter. We found differences among species in the root length (RL) corresponding to each diameter class, represented by the ratios of coarse roots to total roots (RLD>2/RL) and fine roots to total roots (RL0.5<D_2/RL) (Table 2). However, there were no differences between species in the most dynamic root fraction, expressed by the ratio between very fine roots and total roots (RLD<0.5/RL), whereas there was a treatment effect on this root fraction, being higher in low-irrigated plants than in well-irrigated plants (Table 2).Our results indicated statistically significant differences between species in AD, RV, RMD and SRL (Table 2). Differences between watering regimes in AD (avg. diameter) were observed in P. pinea and Q. ilex, where the low-irrigated plants decreased in AD. Differences between watering regimes in RV were shown for Q. ilex, in which RV also decreased with low water availability. RMD increased with low water availability in J. oxycedrus and Q. ilex. There was no watering regime effect on SRL. The plasticity indexes estimated for the root traits (where most differences between watering regime were found) AD, RV, RMD and SRL (which vary from 0 to 1, closer to 0 indicates less plasticity), placed AD as the trait with a value closest to 0, and the only trait with an index lower than 0.5 for the three species; whereas the index of RV was higher than 0.8 for all species.","Although structural root traits were modified by the low-watered treatment we found no substantial differences in growth between watering regimes, which indicates that the three species are able to withstand a dry spring season without altering their biomass fractions. This result may also be explained by the roots reaching the lowest third of the pot where the water content remained high and stable throughout the experiment (Fig. S1). The low-watered treatment for both P. pinea and Q. ilex, as previously reported in other woody species (Meier and Leuschner, 2008, Hern_ndez et al., 2010, Comas et al., 2013). This effect on root diameter was not found in J. oxycedrus, probably because of the extremely low rate of growth of this species and the low root plasticity. Our findings revealed that even at such an early stage of the establishment phase, resprouters had a greater root allocation than the obligate seeder P. pinea, with 45% and 40% of the total biomass allocated to roots in Q. ilex and J. oxycedrus, whereas P. pinea allocated only 26%. Furthermore, when plants are subjected to drought, the ratio of very fine roots (the most dynamic fraction of roots) to total roots increases (Moser et al., 2014), changing faster with environmental changes (Olmo et al., 2014). Both P. pinea and Q. ilex increased this fraction of roots in the low-watered treatment.","In addition to root allocation, low water availability can also modify morphological traits such as root surface area, root volume, root tissue density or specific root length. The latter allows the economic aspects of root systems to be characterized (Ostonen et al., 2007). Maximisation of the specific root length increases the root-soil interface and thus the root absorption capacity (Larcher, 2003). Moreover, low water availability can affect both the root diametric distribution pattern (Hern_ndez et al., 2010) and the average root diameter, which tends to decrease with low water availability. Several studies have suggested that fine roots reflect responses of plants to stress conditions that may not be perceptible in aerial parts (Vogt et al., 1993), exhibiting shorter lifespan (McCormack and Guo, 2014) and more rapid and intense responses to stress than roots from other diametrical classes (Ostonen et al., 2007, Brunner et al., 2015). On the other hand, the absorption capability of roots not only depends on the soil-root interface but also on the resistance of the root system to water flow defined by the hydraulic conductance of roots (Doussan et al., 1998). Some species form new roots sooner than others and those that form roots more quickly usually have higher hydraulic conductance (Carlson and Miller, 1990). Root traits are strongly correlated with the physiological traits responsible for the water status of the plant (Hern_ndez et al., 2010). For instance, stomatal conductance tends to increase with whole root hydraulic conductance (Perrone et al., 2012), which in turn is dependent on the average root diameter. Moreover, those plants with higher water use efficiency (higher ratio between net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance) tend to show decreased growth (Wang et al., 2012, Olano et al., 2014). In addition to water availability in the soil, plant water status is controlled by environmental factors (such as vapour pressure deficit) and the xylem hydraulic properties of the plant.",,Combined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf water potential, height, stomatal conductance",RSR or RMF,,Diameter,,Fine root to root biomass,,Coarse root ratio,no effect,Root biomass,,Root volume,,Root mass diameter,,Specific root length,,Hydraulic conductivity of roots,,,,,"leaf water potential, height, stomatal conductance",,,wet and dry water regimes,"n order to compare species traits and the effects of different watering regimes, we classified the root morphology according to diameter.

In this study we evaluated how water use strategies can influence the establishment phase of three coexisting species in forests where harvesting intensity and silvicultural interventions have been reduced over recent decades. We conducted a greenhouse experiment between February and July, applying two watering regimes (moist and dry) to current year seedlings in 1.5 m high pots to avoid root growth constraint. At the same time, the physiological performance of seedlings of the same species was monitored under natural conditions in the field over a period of decreasing soil moisture. Our results indicated that resprouter species allocated more than 40% of total biomass to roots whereas the non-resprouter P. pinea allocated only 26%. The plasticity index for the root traits was highest in Q ilex, in which the highest stomatal conductance was measured in early summer. The slowest growth and lowest root plasticity, root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential were measured in J. oxycedrus. The three species exhibited a positive carbon balance under low water availability. Coexisting species displayed a continuum in the water use strategies adopted. P. pinea would be the least competitive species under the forecasted increasing drought conditions in contrast to J. oxycedrus, which presents traits more suited to coping with droughts.

P. pinea allocated significantly more biomass to the aerial part than the other species (see ratio SDM/RDM, Table 2). There were no statistical differences between watering regimes in SDM and RDM (Table 2), however a treatment effect was found in the ratio SDM/RDM. The covariate tree size, measured as the shoot length at the beginning of the treatment application, showed a significant positive effect on the biomass fractions. In order to compare species traits and the effects of different watering regimes, we classified the root morphology according to diameter. We found differences among species in the root length (RL) corresponding to each diameter class, represented by the ratios of coarse roots to total roots (RLD>2/RL) and fine roots to total roots (RL0.5<D_2/RL) (Table 2). However, there were no differences between species in the most dynamic root fraction, expressed by the ratio between very fine roots and total roots (RLD<0.5/RL), whereas there was a treatment effect on this root fraction, being higher in low-irrigated plants than in well-irrigated plants (Table 2).Our results indicated statistically significant differences between species in AD, RV, RMD and SRL (Table 2). Differences between watering regimes in AD (avg. diameter) were observed in P. pinea and Q. ilex, where the low-irrigated plants decreased in AD. Differences between watering regimes in RV were shown for Q. ilex, in which RV also decreased with low water availability. RMD increased with low water availability in J. oxycedrus and Q. ilex. There was no watering regime effect on SRL. The plasticity indexes estimated for the root traits (where most differences between watering regime were found) AD, RV, RMD and SRL (which vary from 0 to 1, closer to 0 indicates less plasticity), placed AD as the trait with a value closest to 0, and the only trait with an index lower than 0.5 for the three species; whereas the index of RV was higher than 0.8 for all species.","Although structural root traits were modified by the low-watered treatment we found no substantial differences in growth between watering regimes, which indicates that the three species are able to withstand a dry spring season without altering their biomass fractions. This result may also be explained by the roots reaching the lowest third of the pot where the water content remained high and stable throughout the experiment (Fig. S1). The low-watered treatment for both P. pinea and Q. ilex, as previously reported in other woody species (Meier and Leuschner, 2008, Hern_ndez et al., 2010, Comas et al., 2013). This effect on root diameter was not found in J. oxycedrus, probably because of the extremely low rate of growth of this species and the low root plasticity. Our findings revealed that even at such an early stage of the establishment phase, resprouters had a greater root allocation than the obligate seeder P. pinea, with 45% and 40% of the total biomass allocated to roots in Q. ilex and J. oxycedrus, whereas P. pinea allocated only 26%. Furthermore, when plants are subjected to drought, the ratio of very fine roots (the most dynamic fraction of roots) to total roots increases (Moser et al., 2014), changing faster with environmental changes (Olmo et al., 2014). Both P. pinea and Q. ilex increased this fraction of roots in the low-watered treatment.","In addition to root allocation, low water availability can also modify morphological traits such as root surface area, root volume, root tissue density or specific root length. The latter allows the economic aspects of root systems to be characterized (Ostonen et al., 2007). Maximisation of the specific root length increases the root-soil interface and thus the root absorption capacity (Larcher, 2003). Moreover, low water availability can affect both the root diametric distribution pattern (Hern_ndez et al., 2010) and the average root diameter, which tends to decrease with low water availability. Several studies have suggested that fine roots reflect responses of plants to stress conditions that may not be perceptible in aerial parts (Vogt et al., 1993), exhibiting shorter lifespan (McCormack and Guo, 2014) and more rapid and intense responses to stress than roots from other diametrical classes (Ostonen et al., 2007, Brunner et al., 2015). On the other hand, the absorption capability of roots not only depends on the soil-root interface but also on the resistance of the root system to water flow defined by the hydraulic conductance of roots (Doussan et al., 1998). Some species form new roots sooner than others and those that form roots more quickly usually have higher hydraulic conductance (Carlson and Miller, 1990). Root traits are strongly correlated with the physiological traits responsible for the water status of the plant (Hern_ndez et al., 2010). For instance, stomatal conductance tends to increase with whole root hydraulic conductance (Perrone et al., 2012), which in turn is dependent on the average root diameter. Moreover, those plants with higher water use efficiency (higher ratio between net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance) tend to show decreased growth (Wang et al., 2012, Olano et al., 2014). In addition to water availability in the soil, plant water status is controlled by environmental factors (such as vapour pressure deficit) and the xylem hydraulic properties of the plant.",,Quercus ilex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"leaf water potential, height, stomatal conductance",RSR or RMF,,Diameter,decrease,Fine root to root biomass,increase,Coarse root ratio,no effect,Root biomass,no effect,Root volume,decrease,Root mass diameter,increase,Specific root length,no effect,Hydraulic conductivity of roots,no effect,,,,"leaf water potential, height, stomatal conductance",,,wet and dry water regimes,"n order to compare species traits and the effects of different watering regimes, we classified the root morphology according to diameter.

However, tests of OPT applied to the root system of mature trees or stands exposed to long-term drying show mixed, partly contradicting, results, indicating an overly simplistic understanding of how moisture affects plant-internal carbon allocation. We investigated the response of the root system (0-240 cm depth) of European beech to long-term decrease in water supply in six mature forests located across a precipitation gradient (855-576 mm mean annual precipitation, MAP). With reference to OPT, we hypothesized that declining precipitation across this gradient would: (H1) cause the profile total of fine root biomass (FRB; roots < 2 mm) to increase relative to total leaf mass; (H2) trigger a shift to a shallower root system; and (H3) induce different responses in the depth distributions of different root diameter classes. In contradiction to H1, neither total FRB (0-240 cm) nor the FRB:leaf mass ratio changed significantly with the MAP decrease. The support for H2 was only weak: the Rooting depth - 95% of fine roots decreased with decreasing MAP, whereas the maximum extension of small coarse roots (2-5 mm) increased, indicating contrasting responses of different root diameter classes. We conclude that long-term decline in water supply leads to only minor adaptive modification with respect to the size and structure of the beech root system, with notable change in the depth extension of some root diameter classes but limited capacity to alter the fine root:leaf mass ratio.

As a result, water in the lowest soil segment was used to maintain plant turgor, which in turn sustains the leaf and root growth during the water-stress treatment. The influence of soil water content and soil water potential upon soil water uptake rate was also evaluated on soil profile basis. Rates of extraction began to decline in all soil segments as soon as soil water potential fell below -0.06 MPa, presumably as a result of vapour gaps between the root and soil (root: soil interface resistance).

Water potential and solute potential measurements were made both on young expanding and on fully expanded leaves. During the experimental period, root growth of C. siliqua was not much affected by soil drying, and roots in both the watered and the unwatered columns penetrated to the bottom of the soil tubes by the end of the drying treatment. Expanded leaves showed significant limitation in stomatal conductance as soil drying progressed. Leaf water potential of fully expanded leaves of unwatered plants declined substantially. In contrast, water potential of young expanding leaves on unwatered plants declined to only a limited extent and turgor was sustained. As the soil dried, stomatal conductance of young leaves was always higher than that of mature leaves; also, placticity and elasticity of young leaves slowly decreased whereas mature leaves became stiff.

The higher carbon availability may account for the higher root nitrogen concentration in terra rossa-grown seedlings, which could favor their later field growth. Low-watered seedlings showed a certain degree of hardening, since after 18 months, they showed higher A, E, g(s) and lower photoinhibition than well-watered seedlings, likely attributable to the sharp leaf-to-root biomass ratio reduction.

Deep roots had 40% more large xylem vessels (diameters -20 ,tm) than shallow roots in the plants growing in the field during the normal summer dry season. This may result in lower axial resistance to water flow in the xylem conduits in deep roots, but theoretical axial resistances calculated with the Poiseuille- Hagen equation could only explain 23% of the difference in hydraulic conductivity between deep and shallow roots. Apparently, increased radial resistance in the suberized shallow roots was mainly responsible for the low hydraulic conductivity observed during the dry season.

The plant functional traits of roots and leaves were measured, and their phenotypic plasticity was determined to address the following questions: (a) How does drought affect both root and leaf traits of S. canadensis from different populations? (b) Can drought affect the coordination between root and leaf traits of S. canadensis? (c) What is the selection direction of water availability on the root and leaf traits of S. canadensis?","Quantifying patterns of variation and coordination of plant functional traits can help to understand the mechanisms underlying both invasiveness and adaptation of plants. Little is known about the coordinated variations of performance and functional traits of different organs in invasive plants, especially in response to their adaptation to environmental stressors. To identify the responses of the invasive species Solidago canadensis to drought, 180 individuals were randomly collected from 15 populations and 212 ramets were replanted in a greenhouse to investigate both the response and coordination between root and leaf functional traits. Drought significantly decreased plant growth and most of the root and leaf functional traits, that is, root length, surface area, volume and leaf size, number, and mass fraction, except for the root length ratio and root mass fraction. Phenotypic plasticity was higher in root traits than in leaf traits in response to drought, and populations did not differ significantly. The plasticity of most root functional traits, that is, root length (RL), root surface area (RSA), root volume (RV), and root mass fraction (RMF), were significantly positively correlated with biomass between control and drought. However, the opposite was found for leaf functional traits, that is, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), and leaf mass fraction (LMF). Drought enhanced the relationship between root and leaf, that is, 26 pairwise root-leaf traits were significantly correlated under drought, while only 15 pairwise root-leaf traits were significantly correlated under control conditions. Significant correlations were found between biomass and all measured functional traits except for leaf size. RV, root length ratio, RMF, total area of leaves, and LMF responded differently to water availability. These responses enable S. canadensis to cope with drought conditions and may help to explain the reason of the vast ecological amplitude of this species.","Drought treatment significantly decreased the rate of plant growth in height (paired t test = 31.243, p < .001, Figure _Figure2).2). All root and leaf functional traits (except SRL) were significantly influenced by drought treatment (all p < .001 except p = .189 for SRL, Figure _Figure3d),3d), with higher RL, RSA, RV, LA, LS, LN, SLA, LAR, and LMF, but lower RLR and RMF in control than in drought treatments (Figures _(Figures33 and _and4).4). Population had little effect on most traits. The phenotypic plasticity index of S. canadensis in response to drought treatment differed, with an average root PPI of _1.775, ranging from _6.459 (RV) to 0.323 (RMF), and an average leaf PPI of _1.637, ranging from _4.629 (LA) to _0.708 (SLA; Table _Table1).1). ANOVA showed that the difference was nonsignificant among different geographic populations. The PPI of RL, RSA, RV, and RMF were significantly positively correlated with change in biomass between drought and control treatment (p < .05, Table _Table1),1), while the opposite was true for the PPI of SRL, RLR, SLA, LAR, and LMF (p < .05, Table _Table1).1). LA, LS, and LN showed nonsignificant correlation with change in biomass (p > .05, Table _Table11). When comparing pairwise root_leaf functional traits of different water availability treatments, Pearson's correlation indicated significant correlations. In the drought treatment, 26 pairwise root_leaf traits correlated significantly, of which, 16 pairwise correlations were significantly negative, and 10 pairwise root_leaf correlations were significantly positive (p < .05, Table _Table2).2). However, only 15 pairwise root_leaf traits significantly correlated within the control treatment, four of which showed significantly negative correlations (p < .05, Table _Table22). the phenotypic plasticity index of S. canadensis in response to drought treatment differed, with an average root PPI of _1.775, ranging from _6.459 (RV) to 0.323 (RMF), and an average leaf PPI of _1.637, ranging from _4.629 (LA) to _0.708 (SLA). This variation of plasticity may lower the cost of phenotypic plasticity (Sergei, 2010) and help the plant to maintain adaptation across a range of environments, which further influences their distribution and ecological breadth. Moreover, change in biomass between drought and control treatments correlated positively with most PPI of root traits (RL, RSA, RV, and RMF), but correlated negatively with most PPI of leaf traits (SLA, LAR, and LMF),","Drought enhances the coordination between root and leaf traits. Different traits correlated in drought and control treatment. Drought significantly decreased plant growth and most of the root and leaf functional traits, that is, root length, surface area, volume and leaf size, number, and mass fraction, except for the root length ratio and root mass fraction. Phenotypic plasticity was higher in root traits than in leaf traits in response to drought, and populations did not differ significantly.

These responses enable S. canadensis to cope with drought conditions and may help to explain the reason of the vast ecological amplitude of this species. Nested ANOVA using a general linear model showed that drought significantly affected plant functional traits, while population, genotype, and the interaction of population _ drought exerted little effects on most root and leaf functional traits, with the exception that LS was significantly affected by populations. Change in biomass between drought and control treatments correlated positively with most PPI of root traits (RL, RSA, RV, and RMF), but correlated negatively with most PPI of leaf traits (SLA, LAR, and LMF). Besides, drought treatment significantly enhanced the coordination of the relationship between LA and RL, as well as SLA:SRL (ANCOVA, p < .05), which was related to root and leaf morphologies and the resource capture ability of plants. The relationship between above_ and belowground traits was strengthened in combination with the resource shortage. In summary, drought enhanced the leaf_root trait coordination, and this coordinated performance was essential for the faster resource acquisition of S. canadensis in response to water shortage (Freschet et al., 2015; Laughlin, Leppert, Moore, & Sieg, 2010).","To date, the coordination between root and leaf traits to cope with the shortage of a single resource, especially with regard to water shortage, has not been reported in detail. Relationships between pairwise leaf_root morphology traits, such as the specific leaf area (SLA)/the specific root length (SRL), tissue density, and tissue thickness varied among different plants and in different ecosystems (Freschet, Cornelissen, Van Logtestijn, & Aerts, 2010). For example, the relationship between leaf and root tissues was previously either reported as positive (Craine et al., 2010), negative (Ryser, 1996), nonsignificant (Birouste, Kazakou, Blanchard, & Roumet, 2012; Holdaway, Richardson, Dickie, Peltzer, & Coomes, 2011), or environment_dependent (Geng, Wang, Jin, Liu, & He, 2014).",,Solidago canadensis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aboveground biomass/productivity,RSR or RMF,no effect,Specific root length,increase,Root length,decrease,Root surface area,,Root volume,,root length ratio,,,,,,,,,,,"Leaf number, leaf height, leaf length & width, leaf area,leaf size (mean area per leaf), SLA, leaf mass fraction,",,,Well-watered (75-80% WHC) and droughted (20-25% WHC) for 2 months,"Drought significantly decreased plant growth and most of the root and leaf functional traits, that is, root length, surface area, volume and leaf size, number, and mass fraction, except for the root length ratio and root mass fraction (*basically R:S ratio).Phenotypic plasticity was higher in root traits than in leaf traits in response to drought, and populations did not differ significantly.

Because carbon in the BGB is difficult to measure, it is often estimated using BGB to AGB ratios. However, this ratio can change markedly along resource gradients, such as water availability, which can lead to substantial errors in BGB estimates. In this study, BGB and AGB sampling was carried out in Eucalyptus populnea-dominated woodland communities of northeast Australia to examine patterns of BGB to AGB ratio and vertical root distribution at three sites along a rainfall gradient (367, 602, and 1,101 mm). At each site, a vegetation inventory was undertaken on five transects (100 x 4 m), and trees representing the E. populnea vegetation structure were harvested and excavated to measure aboveground and coarse-root (diameter of at least 15 mm) biomass. Biomass of fine and small roots (diameter less than 15 mm) at each site was estimated from 40 cores sampled to 1 m depth. The BGB to AGB ratio of E. populnea-dominated woodland plant communities declined from 0.58 at the xeric end to 0.36 at the mesic end of the rainfall gradient. This was due to a marked decline in AGB with increased aridity whereas the BGB was relatively stable. The vertical distribution of fine roots in the top 1 m of soil varied along the rainfall gradient. The mesic sites had more fine-root biomass (FRB) in the upper soil profile and less at depth than the xeric site. Accordingly, at the xeric site, a much larger proportion of FRB was found at depth compared to the mesic sites. The vertical distribution patterns of small roots of the E. populnea woodland plant communities were consistently )-shaped, with the highest biomass occurring at 15-30-cm depth. The potential significance of such a rooting pattern for grass-tree and shrub-tree co-existence in these ecosystems is discussed. Overall, our results revealed marked changes in BGB to AGB ratio of E. populnea woodland communities along a rainfall gradient. Because E. populnea woodlands cover a large area (96 M ha), their contribution to continental-scale carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission can be substantial. Use of the rainfall-zone-specific ratios found in this study, in lieu of a single generic ratio for the entire region, will significantly improve estimates of BGB carbon stocks in these woodlands. In the absence of more specific data, our results will also be relevant in other regions with similar vegetation and rainfall gradients (that is, arid and semiarid woodland ecosystems).",,"The BGB to AGB ratio of E. populnea-dominated woodland plant communities declined from 0.58 at the xeric end to 0.36 at the mesic end of the rainfall gradient.

Few studies have addressed whether a single species can exhibit both drought avoidance and drought tolerance strategies along an aridity gradient, and none have evaluated the role of ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in shaping such strategies. In the desert shrub Encelia canescens, distributed along an aridity gradient in the Atacama Desert, we hypothesized that populations located in sites with lower and more variable rainfall (northern populations) would exhibit patterns of trait means and plasticity reflecting a water-conservative strategy, while populations in less arid and less variable environments (southern populations) would exhibit a water-acquisitive strategy. We also tested the hypothesis that functional variation in trait means and plasticity are not alternative mechanisms of adaptation to the environment. In a common garden experiment using plants from seeds collected from six populations spanning the species distribution range we found that plants from the northern populations were smaller, had fewer leaves, lower photosynthetic rates and had higher plasticity for root: shoot ratios and lower plasticity for leaf shedding, suggesting a resource-conservative strategy compared to plants from the southern populations, which showed a resource-acquisitive strategy. We found no association between variation in trait means and plasticity, which indicates that these are not alternative mechanisms of plant adaptation to environmental variation.

Thus, in response to experimental drought, plants from the northern populations exhibited a significantly greater increase in root:shoot ratio (a typical evergreen feature), while plants from the southern populations shed more leaves (a deciduous-like syndrome). These results agree with inter-specific patterns of plant strategies to avoid the effects of drought. For example, Ackerly (2004) showed that plants could avoid drought periods by having deep root systems, which allow them to avoid water tissue deficit. In fact, another desert shrub from the study area, Senna candolleana, also showed higher root:shoot ratios and greater plasticity to drought for this trait in populations from drier sites (L_zaro-Nogal et al., 2015).","In a common garden experiment using plants from seeds collected from six populations spanning the species distribution range we found that plants from the northern populations (more arid) were smaller, had fewer leaves, lower photosynthetic rates and had higher plasticity for root:shoot ratios and lower plasticity for leaf shedding, suggesting a resource-conservative strategy compared to plants from the southern populations, which showed a resource-acquisitive strategy.

Typically, plants deal with reduced soil moisture by showing less, smaller, and thicker leaves, reduced photosynthesis and increased water-use efficiency, which reduces evaporative water losses, and increased biomass allocation to roots, which enhances water uptake; plants are also of smaller size, which reduces overall photosynthetic carbon demand (Lambers et al., 2008, Larcher, 2003, Schulze et al., 2005).

Indicators of seedling performance were aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB), root: shoot ratio, tillering, and mortality. The effect size statistic, Hedge's g, allowed for comparisons between performance measures. Water stress induced reductions inmost performance measures: BGB (g=ND: -1.3; D: -1.6), root: shoot ratio (g=ND: n. s.; D: -0.2), and tillering (g=ND: -1.7; D: -1.2), though not significantly for all species. For ABG, water stress interacted with defoliation, reducing performance less at an intensity of 70% (g = -2.0) as opposed to 30% (g = -3.0), but not always significantly in the former. Water stress also caused less reduction in AGB when no defoliation occurred (ND: -0.8; g=D: -2.5). Intensity and frequency of defoliation interacted; seedlings were generally resistant to reductions in performance except at high frequency, 70% defoliation. Agropyron cristatum and P. spicata displayed similar sensitivity to treatments, mostly in terms of changes in AGB and BGB, while P. secunda also experienced increased mortality and reduced tillering.

We reciprocally transplanted 14 congeneric pairs of herbaceous perennial species originating from mid and high elevation sites in the Swiss Alps to common gardens differing c. 1000 m in elevation to mimic changes in temperature, and installed rain shelters to control soil water availability. Our factorial design allows to quantify the effects of simultaneous warming and drought on key plant functional traits and to test for differences in direction and magnitude of plastic responses between mid and high elevation species.","Effects of climate change, especially changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns, are particularly pronounced in alpine regions. In response, plants may exhibit phenotypic plasticity in key functional traits allowing short-term adjustment to novel conditions. However, little is known about the degree of phenotypic plasticity of high elevation species relative to mid elevation congeners. We transplanted 14 herbaceous perennial species from high elevation into two common gardens (1050 and 2000 m.a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps, and we examined plastic responses in key functional traits to changes in temperature and soil water availability. This design was replicated with 14 congeneric species from mid elevation to assess if the degree of phenotypic plasticity differs between mid and high elevation species. Survival was assessed across two growing seasons, while aboveground biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured after the first growing season, and biomass allocation to belowground and reproductive structures after the second. Moreover, a phenotypic plasticity index was calculated for the functional traits to compare the degree of plasticity between mid and high elevation species. Aboveground biomass was higher in mid elevation species relative to high elevation congeners in all treatments, yet decreased for both with elevation and drought. Similarly, SLA decreased with elevation and drought. Root mass fraction (RMF) was generally higher in high elevation species, and decreased with drought at the lower site. Drought increased the allocation to reproductive structures, especially when plants were grown at their elevation of origin. Interestingly, no difference was found in the degree of phenotypic plasticity averaged across mid and high elevation species for any of the studied functional traits. These results indicate that phenotypic plasticity in the focal traits did not depend on the elevation of origin of the species. Plasticity was not related to environmental heterogeneity, nor constrained by selective pressures at high elevation. However, both species groups showed a remarkable capacity for short-term acclimation to a prospective climate through rapid adjustments in key functional traits.","The proportion of total biomass allocated to belowground structures (RMF, Fig. 2b) differed significantly between mid and high elevation species, as indicated by a significant origin effect (Table 3; F = 9.89, P = 0.01). Indeed, RMF of high elevation species was significantly higher compared to mid elevation species when grown under control conditions at the lower site, and marginally higher compared to their mid elevation congeners in all other treatment combinations (Fig. 2b; See online supplementary Table S1). For both speciesê groups, RMF was surprisingly highest when grown at the lower site under control conditions, but drought had opposite effects at both sites, as revealed by the significant interaction between elevation and drought (Table 3; F = 38.8, P < 10_4). For both mid and high elevation species, drought significantly decreased the allocation to roots at the lower site relative to the control treatment, while allocation to roots was only marginally increased at the higher site (Fig. 2b). The phenotypic plasticity index did not significantly differ between mid and high elevation species for the measured plant functional traits (Table 4). RMF was the only trait for which a marginally lower Piv was found for high elevation species (Table 4; P < 0.10). The phenotypic plasticity indices were however highly species and trait specific (see ranges Table 4).","Shift to higher root to shoot ratio marginal at higher elevations site. Shift to LOWER root to shoot ratio at the lower elevation site. Counter to predictions. Should have measured proportion fine roots, diameter or other traits. Both mid and high elevation species invested more into reproductive structures when growing under drought at home site.","Indeed, K_rner et al. (1987) showed in an extensive study on 49 perennial herbaceous species, that high elevation plants allocate more dry matter to roots, especially fine roots, than typical lowland plants, and these results were generally corroborated since (Ma et al. 2010; Prock et al. 1996; Poorter et al. 2012a). Similarly, in the context of drought stress, greater proportional root biomass presumably increases the uptake surface area and thus the water acquisition potential (Heschel et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2013; Pang et al. 2011). However, increased allocation to belowground structures may come at the expense of allocation to reproductive structures and/or photosynthetic organs such as leaves, and a trade-off between these structures has been found in several studies (K_rner et al. 1987; Ma et al. 2010; Prock et al. 1996). Furthermore, when comparing high and low elevation species, it was found that high elevation species allocated three times more of their aboveground biomass specifically to floral structures (Fabbro et al. 2004), indicating a clear prioritization of reproduction over growth. Similarly, under drought stress, trade-offs at the expense of reproductive structures have also been found (Huang et al. 2013). However, another study showed that two out of 11 alpine species had a higher reproductive biomass when grown under drought (Peterson et al. 1982), indicating that investment in sexual reproduction can be favored in some species under drought stress or competition (Rautiainen et al. 2004). The proportion of total biomass allocated to belowground structures, measured as the RMF, only decreased under drought stress at the mid elevation site, and was unaffected by site elevation in general. This result is counter to predictions, as investment in roots usually increases with elevation (K_rner 2003) and under limited soil water availability (Bell et al. 1999; Heschel et al. 2004; Larcher et al. 2010). Similarly to our results, Kreyling et al. (2008), Gilgen et al. (2009), and Backhaus et al. (2014) found small increases or no alterations in plant belowground biomass in response to limited soil water availability. While we cannot exclude that some root material was lost during sampling or cleaning, leading to biases in our data, we rather hypothesize that the similar values in RMF are due to the fact that root morphology differed between treatment combinations. K_rner et al. (1987) showed that with increasing elevation, investment in fine roots increases, and a similar result was found in response to low water potential (Fraser et al. 1990). Fine roots, which have a thinner diameter and are less lignified and suberised than coarse roots (Lavelle et al. 2005), probably result in less dry weight than thicker roots and we argue that this morphological difference could potentially explain that changes in RMF between site elevations and soil water availability were relatively small. In accordance with literature, our results however showed that high elevation species generally invested more biomass in belowground structures relative to their mid elevation congeners (Billings et al. 1968; K_rner 2003). Additionally, among the studied functional traits, RMF was the least plastic trait (Piv c. 0.265) and showed particularly little variation in high relative to mid elevation species, and lesser variation when mid elevation species were grown at the higher site, indicating the constraints acting on allocation patterns at high elevation.'",,Combined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"specific leaf area, aboveground biomass",Root to shoot ratio (RSR) or Root Mass Fraction (RMF) or Root Mass Ratio - high elevation,,Root to shoot ratio (RSR) or Root Mass Fraction (RMF) or Root Mass Ratio - low elevation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"specific leaf area, aboveground biomass",,,"control, drought, increased temperature","...Aboveground biomass was higher in mid elevation species relative to high elevation congeners in all treatments, yet decreased for both with elevation and drought...Root mass fraction (RMF) was generally higher in high elevation species, and decreased with drought at the lower site. ...",the same mountain of the Bernese Highland in Switzerland,congeneric perennial herbs naturally growing in the region and originating from mid and high elevations,"Samen und Pflanzen AG Schutz, Filisur; UFA-Samen, fenaco Genossenschaft, Winterthur; Wildstaudeng_rtnerei, Eschenbach",low-nutrient soil,Quantitative,Forb,Graminoid,,Multiple,Field,Experimental,,,,,Seedling,"Hamann, E; Kesselring, H; Stocklin, J",JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,English,Article,biomass allocation; common garden; climate change; perennial herbaceous species; phenotypic plasticity; SLA; Swiss Alps; transplant experiment,PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; SUMMER DROUGHT; ALPINE PLANT; LEAF-AREA; EVOLUTION; TRAITS; GROWTH,5,2018,10.1093/jpe/rtx023,Plant responses to simulated warming and drought: a comparative study of functional plasticity between congeneric mid and high elevation species,Keep,Jonathan Bertram,yes,Response - Comparison,,Drought,Plasticity,Dependent (response),,"Here, we examine the combined effects of warming and drought on specific plant traits, known to be particularly plastic to these environmental factors (i.e. SLA, biomass allocation).

RMF was the only trait for which a marginally lower Piv was found for high elevation species (Table 4; P < 0.10). The phenotypic plasticity indices were however highly species and trait specific (see ranges Table 4).","Shift to higher root to shoot ratio marginal at higher elevations site. Shift to LOWER root to shoot ratio at the lower elevation site. Counter to predictions. Should have measured proportion fine roots, diameter or other traits. Both mid and high elevation species invested more into reproductive structures when growing under drought at home site.","Indeed, K_rner et al. (1987) showed in an extensive study on 49 perennial herbaceous species, that high elevation plants allocate more dry matter to roots, especially fine roots, than typical lowland plants, and these results were generally corroborated since (Ma et al. 2010; Prock et al. 1996; Poorter et al. 2012a). Similarly, in the context of drought stress, greater proportional root biomass presumably increases the uptake surface area and thus the water acquisition potential (Heschel et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2013; Pang et al. 2011). However, increased allocation to belowground structures may come at the expense of allocation to reproductive structures and/or photosynthetic organs such as leaves, and a trade-off between these structures has been found in several studies (K_rner et al. 1987; Ma et al. 2010; Prock et al. 1996). Furthermore, when comparing high and low elevation species, it was found that high elevation species allocated three times more of their aboveground biomass specifically to floral structures (Fabbro et al. 2004), indicating a clear prioritization of reproduction over growth. Similarly, under drought stress, trade-offs at the expense of reproductive structures have also been found (Huang et al. 2013). However, another study showed that two out of 11 alpine species had a higher reproductive biomass when grown under drought (Peterson et al. 1982), indicating that investment in sexual reproduction can be favored in some species under drought stress or competition (Rautiainen et al. 2004). The proportion of total biomass allocated to belowground structures, measured as the RMF, only decreased under drought stress at the mid elevation site, and was unaffected by site elevation in general. This result is counter to predictions, as investment in roots usually increases with elevation (K_rner 2003) and under limited soil water availability (Bell et al. 1999; Heschel et al. 2004; Larcher et al. 2010). Similarly to our results, Kreyling et al. (2008), Gilgen et al. (2009), and Backhaus et al. (2014) found small increases or no alterations in plant belowground biomass in response to limited soil water availability. While we cannot exclude that some root material was lost during sampling or cleaning, leading to biases in our data, we rather hypothesize that the similar values in RMF are due to the fact that root morphology differed between treatment combinations. K_rner et al. (1987) showed that with increasing elevation, investment in fine roots increases, and a similar result was found in response to low water potential (Fraser et al. 1990). Fine roots, which have a thinner diameter and are less lignified and suberised than coarse roots (Lavelle et al. 2005), probably result in less dry weight than thicker roots and we argue that this morphological difference could potentially explain that changes in RMF between site elevations and soil water availability were relatively small. In accordance with literature, our results however showed that high elevation species generally invested more biomass in belowground structures relative to their mid elevation congeners (Billings et al. 1968; K_rner 2003). Additionally, among the studied functional traits, RMF was the least plastic trait (Piv c. 0.265) and showed particularly little variation in high relative to mid elevation species, and lesser variation when mid elevation species were grown at the higher site, indicating the constraints acting on allocation patterns at high elevation.'",,Low elevation plants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"specific leaf area, aboveground biomass",Root to shoot ratio (RSR) or Root Mass Fraction (RMF) or Root Mass Ratio - high elevation,no effect,Root to shoot ratio (RSR) or Root Mass Fraction (RMF) or Root Mass Ratio - low elevation,decrease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"specific leaf area, aboveground biomass",,,"control, drought, increased temperature","...Aboveground biomass was higher in mid elevation species relative to high elevation congeners in all treatments, yet decreased for both with elevation and drought...Root mass fraction (RMF) was generally higher in high elevation species, and decreased with drought at the lower site. ...",the same mountain of the Bernese Highland in Switzerland,congeneric perennial herbs naturally growing in the region and originating from mid and high elevations,"Samen und Pflanzen AG Schutz, Filisur; UFA-Samen, fenaco Genossenschaft, Winterthur; Wildstaudeng_rtnerei, Eschenbach",low-nutrient soil,Quantitative,Forb,Graminoid,,Multiple,Field,Experimental,,,,,Seedling,"Harfouche, A",ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,English,Article,Pinus pinaster; retrospective test; water stress; juvenile-mature correlation,JUVENILE-MATURE CORRELATIONS; LOBLOLLY-PINE; HEIGHT GROWTH; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; GENETIC CORRELATION; AIT.

Since survival strategies are adaptations to the environmental conditions in which the seedlings have evolved (Gibson et al., 1995, Tuomela, 1997), the detected differences in physiological and morphological responses may explain specific adaptation mechanisms within the species under water deficit. The northwestern and central populations which grow under a natural habitat of prolonged annual drought grew slowly under three watering regimes, produced greater root/shoot ratios, foliage area/stem cross-sectional area ratios and specific leaf area densities than the southeastern population. All these responses enabled the seedlings to overcome prolonged drought.

Seeds from two annual grass species (Avena barbata and Bromus madritensis) were collected from experimental plots and grown in a common environment over two generations. We measured 14 physiological, morphological, phenological and reproductive traits. Both species displayed phenotypic differences depending on the water treatment from which they were collected, but not depending on the nitrogen treatment. Both species displayed trait values characteristic of drought escape (e.g. earlier flowering in A. barbata and B. madritensis, lower water_use efficiency in B. madritensis) when grown from the seeds collected from plots that experienced five years of reduced precipitation. Furthermore, A. barbata individuals grown from the seeds collected from drought plots had higher reproductive output and higher photosynthetic performance than individuals grown from water addition plots, with individuals grown from ambient plots displaying intermediate trait values. Notably, we found no phenotypic variation among treatments for six root traits. Synthesis. Trait differences were observed following two generations in a common garden, suggesting that treatment differences were genetically based. This suggests that populations were responding to selection over the 5 years of water manipulations, a remarkably short time period. The rapid evolutionary responses observed here may help these two widespread invasive grass species thrive under reduced precipitation scenarios, which could have important implications for fire dynamics, invasive species management and native plant restoration in communities invaded by annual grasses.",,,"Studies using congeneric and conspecific pairs occurring in high and low rainfall sites suggest that low specific root length (SRL, m g_1), large root diameter or slow root elongation rates may be favoured under drier conditions, reflecting an investment in thick, longer_lived roots that more efficiently transport water (Wright & Westoby 1999; Nicotra, Babicka & Westoby 2002; Heschel et al. 2004). Notably, we found that field manipulations did not alter root traits, which is largely unstudied outside of model organisms (reviewed in Comas et al. 2013). Previous studies of root adaptation in natural systems have focused on conspecific or congeneric comparisons of species from different rainfall environments, which reflect evolution over potentially long time_scales (Wright & Westoby 1999; Nicotra, Babicka & Westoby 2002; Heschel et al. 2004). It is possible that our five_year experiment was too short to observe the differences in root traits. In the absence of rapid genetic responses, plasticity in root traits may be an important mechanism for responding to environmental changes on short time_scales. In response to the reductions in water availability, individual plants can increase root biomass, root elongation rate and SRL to maximize water acquisition (e.g. Williams & Black 1994; Padilla et al. 2009; Drenovsky, Khasanova & James 2012; Larson & Funk 2016). Several of these responses (rapid elongation, high SRL) are contrary to strategies found in species adapted to low rainfall environments (Wright & Westoby 1999; Nicotra, Babicka & Westoby 2002). More data are needed to understand the relative role of plasticity and genetic adaptation in below_ground trait responses to the variation in water availability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Root length,no effect,Root growth rate,no effect,Root length density,no effect,Fine root ratio,no effect,Root to shoot ratio,no effect,Specific root length,no effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,California,"Avena barbata, Bromus madritensis",,,,Graminoid,,,Multiple,Greenhouse,Experimental,,,,,Seedling,"Andivia, E; Zuccarini, P; Grau, B; de Herralde, F; Villar-Salvador, P; Save, R",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,English,Article,Drought resistance; Pinus; Rhizotron; Root growth; Root structure; Rooting depth; Specific root length,GROWTH-RATE; DROUGHT; SEEDLINGS; ESTABLISHMENT; CLIMATE; TRAITS; REGENERATION; VEGETATION; FORESTS; LENGTH,1,2019,10.1007/s00468-018-1777-x,Rooting big and deep rapidly: the ecological roots of pine species distribution in southern Europe,Keep,Alison Post,yes,Effect / Response - Comparison,,Drought,Comparison - Intraspecific,Independent,"Root structure strongly varies across biomes partly as a result of phylogeny.

Mediterranean pines were also able to grow faster despite they reduced soil moisture more than the mountain and boreo-alpine pines (Figure S1).","The rapid production of a large, deep root system during seedling establishment is critical for pines to colonize dry Mediterranean locations.","The proportion of root mass relative to either shoot mass (R/S) or entire plant mass (root mass fraction, RMF) are indicators of the potential balance between water uptake and evaporative capacity of a plant (Grossnickle 2012). Globally, R/S (Mokany et al. 2006), RMF (Poorter et al. 2012b) and the relative distribution of root mass in depth (Schenk and Jackson 2002) usually increase with aridity. In addition, plants species differ substantially in fine-root production (Ostonen et al. 2007; Valverde-Barrantes et al. 2017). Fine-root growth is often studied using the proxy variable of specific root length (SRL), defined as the length of roots per root mass unit (Ostonen et al. 2007). High-SRL root systems have a large root surface and consequently high capacity to take up soil resources (Comas et al. 2013). In a global review of fine-root traits, SRL was greater in plants from cold and temperate climatic areas than in plants from arid and tropical areas (Freschet et al. 2017). Fast growing woody plants, which have high nutrient demand, grow more high-SRL roots than slow growing plants (Reich et al. 1998; Comas and Eissenstat 2004; Hern_ndez et al. 2010). In water-limited ecosystems, seedling mortality due to water stress during the first dry season is a bottleneck for forest regeneration (Castro et al. 2004; Pulido et al. 2010). Resistance of seedlings to drought relies on adaptations that increase water uptake and/or reduce water loss during dry periods (De Micco and Aronne 2012; Brunner et al. 2015). In the present study, Mediterranean pines colonized through soil depth more rapidly, as evidenced by shorter time to reach a depth of 40 cm (Fig. 5) and showed the fastest aboveground growth, growing larger than mountain pines at the end of the experiment. This indicates that seedling establishment under Mediterranean climate conditions depends on how rapidly the root system colonizes the soil profile. Similar to our findings, Climent et al. (2011) observed that P. pinaster, P. pinea and P. halepensis grew faster than P. nigra and P. sylvestris after 32 weeks of growth in 7-L containers. Higher shoot growth rate leads to greater foliage biomass and higher photosynthesis (Cuesta et al. 2010). This greater C assimilation will support the growth of new organs during the wet season, triggering a positive feedback loop in which shoot and root growth support each other (Burdett 1990; Villar-Salvador et al. 2012). In addition, Mediterranean pines, especially P. halepensis achieved maximum root growth potential at lower air temperature than mountain and boreo-alpine pines (Fig. 4). Maximizing root elongation during the cool and wet season can facilitate seedling establishment before the summer drought, the most limiting season for seedling life in Mediterranean climates (Castro et al. 2004; Pulido et al. 2010). Mediterranean pines were also able to grow faster despite they reduced soil moisture more than the mountain and boreo-alpine pines (Figure S1). Taken all together, our results indicate that Mediterranean pines avoid summer drought maximizing their growth during the wet and cool season, accessing rapidly deep water reserves and exploring a large soil volume (Jackson et al. 1996; Schulze et al. 1996; Padilla and Pugnaire 2007). Differences in SRL allows for coping with changes in soil resources. SRL variability reflects a trade-off between stress tolerance and resource exploitation (Comas and Eissenstat 2004; de la Riva et al. 2017): fast growing species, which usually thrive in rich resource environments, are expected to have higher SRL, whereas slow growing, stress-tolerant species are expected to have lower SRL. However, whether root traits are primarily aligned along the acquisition_conservation axis is under debate (de la Riva et al. 2016, 2017; Kramer-Walter et al. 2016). Our data show that although Mediterranean pines inhabit drier locations they have lower SRL but higher growth rates than mountain and boreo-alpine pines. The high SRL in mountain and boreo-alpine pines is consistent with the idea from recent global reviews that plants inhabiting low-temperature ecosystems tend to have higher SRL (Freschet et al. 2017; Valverde-Barrantes et al. 2017). High SRL in cold-climate plants may be an adaptation to enhance soil nutrient exploitation, counteracting the negative effects of low temperature on organic matter mineralization (Comas et al. 2012).",,Mediterranean pines,Shoot biomass,Biomass (AG),Root biomass,,,increased with root biomass,,,,,,,,,,,RSR or RMF,no effect,Specific root length,no effect,Root biomass,comp-higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Location,,Iberian peninsula,"Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster, pinue pinea, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris",,,Quantitative,Tree,,,Multiple,Potted (Outside),Experimental,,,"No drought vs control treatment.

Drought had significant effects on P. pinaster hydraulic conductance (Kh, KL, KS), root morphology (root surface and tip number) and WUE (Table 2) and there was a genotype by treatment interaction for these traits (Pop___treatment, Fam (Pop)___treatment, Table 2). The treatment variation (control/drought) was higher than the genetic variation for the hydraulic conductance (KL, KS, Table 3). However, the genetic variation (Pop, Fam) was more important for the remaining traits (Table 3). There was a reduction in the whole-plant hydraulic conductance (KL and KS, Figure 1), which was positively associated with the maximum conductance of the non-stressed/control plants (Figure 2). The root surface was reduced, and the root tip number and WUE were increased in response to water deficit (Figure 3; _13C increased from _32.64_±_0.05 to _32.49_±_0.05, data not shown). As expected, the organs related to the CO2 assimilation (LDW) and water uptake (RDW) were highly and positively correlated with biomass production in both treatments (Table 8). The positive relationship between the whole-plant hydraulic _conductance and growth/biomass production was not observed under drought, as the reduction in the hydraulic conductance was not accompanied by a reduction in biomass. Moreover, the negative correlation between biomass production and both KL (leaf conductancee) and WUE increased under drought due to the preservation of the biomass. For the same reason, the positive relationship between root surface and biomass production was not observed under drought. In the drought treatment, a positive correlation between the number of root tips and biomass production was observed.","The relationships among the growth, morphological, anatomical and physiological traits changed with the scale of study: within the species, among/within populations. The populations showed a highly significant relationship between the percentage reduction in whole-plant hydraulic conductance and WUE. The differences among the populations in root morphology, whole-plant conductance, carbon allocation, plant growth and WUE were significant and consistent with dryness of the site of seed origin. The xeric populations exhibited lower growth and a conservative water use, as opposed to the fast-growing, less water-use-efficient populations from mesic habitats. The xeric and mesic populations, Tamrabta and San Cipriano, respectively, showed the most contrasting traits and were clustered in opposite directions along the main axis in the canonical discriminant analysis under both the control and drought treatments. The results suggest the possibility of selecting the Arenas population, which presents a combination of traits that confer increased growth and drought resistance. The populations from xeric origins, Oria and Tamrabta, showed an increased carbon allocation to the roots and a reduced carbon allocation to the stem and leaves (Table 6). Moreover, both populations did not reduce their root surface area in response to drought (Figure 3). On the contrary, the mesic populations allocated a larger proportion of dry matter to the aboveground tissues and a lower proportion of dry matter to the belowground tissues. We did not find a potential trade-off between hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency among all individuals within the species nor among populations in P. pinaster. In conclusion, the adjustment of the P. pinaster hydraulic system to intense drought occurred primarily through reductions in hydraulic conductance and modifications in root morphology. Among populations, the reductions in hydraulic conductance were proportional to the hydraulic conductance reached with no water restrictions and negatively related to the WUE. There was a large effect of the scale of study (within the species, among/within populations) on the relationships among traits, which highlights the importance of intraspecific studies. In addition, we found higher intra- than inter-population variation for most traits, especially for the conduit implosion resistance index, hydraulic conductance, WUE and root tip number, which requires further study on the family variation.","Drought did not affect P. pinaster dry biomass partitioning. The severe water stress applied during the experiment did not cause shifts in carbon allocation towards belowground biomass, consistent with the results obtained from a previous study in P. pinaster populations (Aranda et al. 2010). It has been suggested that the absence of changes to biomass allocation in plants exposed to drought might be a consequence of similar levels of osmotic adjustment in the leaves and roots (Sobrado and Turner 1986) and carbohydrate storage in both aboveground and belowground tissues (Bacelar et al. 2007). We observed a reduction in the total root surface area and an increase in the number of tips in response to drought. There were significant differences between the mesic and xeric populations in the hydraulic architecture, consistent with their original climate, and therefore might be the result of physiological adaptations to the population place of origin. The xeric Oria population presented a higher carbon allocation to the roots, a lower carbon allocation to leaf and stem, a lower leaf to sapwood area ratio and a higher whole-plant leaf-specific conductance under the control and drought treatments, consistent with an adaptation to soil water deficits, as higher hydraulic conductance allows Oria to maintain an increased water supply to foliage at similar water potentials, and lower leaf area facilitates reduced transpiration and avoids excessive desiccation. These traits might provide the Oria population with a competitive advantage under dry conditions. The mesic San Cipriano population displayed contrasting traits under watered and severe drought conditions: higher aboveground carbon allocation, higher leaf to sapwood area ratio and low whole-plant leaf-specific conductance. The higher responsiveness to drought in the P. pinaster populations from wet sites than in the populations from dry sites was previously reported for stem-specific conductivity, vulnerability to xylem cavitation (Corcuera et al. 2011) and WUE (Aranda et al. 2010). The Arenas population maximizes its water use when soil water is available and is more efficient in conducting water to the leaves than the Tamrabta population when there is no water restriction. The lower hydraulic conductance of the Tamrabta population can be considered a drought tolerance feature (Martênez-Vilalta et al. 2002), as low hydraulic conductance limits sap flow from the roots to leaves, promoting conservative water use, as confirmed by the _13C values in both populations; the Tamrabta population showed a higher WUE (higher _13C, Table 7, Figure 2d), consistent with an increase in stomatal control over water loss, and the Arenas population showed the lowest WUE. Dry biomass partitioning was under genetic control, and the populations showed contrasting patterns of carbon allocation, as described in Aranda et al. (2010). The differences among populations were related to drought adaptations.

Drought had significant effects on P. pinaster hydraulic conductance (Kh, KL, KS), root morphology (root surface and tip number) and WUE (Table 2) and there was a genotype by treatment interaction for these traits (Pop___treatment, Fam (Pop)___treatment, Table 2). The treatment variation (control/drought) was higher than the genetic variation for the hydraulic conductance (KL, KS, Table 3). However, the genetic variation (Pop, Fam) was more important for the remaining traits (Table 3). There was a reduction in the whole-plant hydraulic conductance (KL and KS, Figure 1), which was positively associated with the maximum conductance of the non-stressed/control plants (Figure 2). The root surface was reduced, and the root tip number and WUE were increased in response to water deficit (Figure 3; _13C increased from _32.64_±_0.05 to _32.49_±_0.05, data not shown). As expected, the organs related to the CO2 assimilation (LDW) and water uptake (RDW) were highly and positively correlated with biomass production in both treatments (Table 8). The positive relationship between the whole-plant hydraulic _conductance and growth/biomass production was not observed under drought, as the reduction in the hydraulic conductance was not accompanied by a reduction in biomass. Moreover, the negative correlation between biomass production and both KL (leaf conductancee) and WUE increased under drought due to the preservation of the biomass.

More favourable water and carbon states allowed relatively stable maintenance of stem hydraulic conductivity (k) throughout the growing season.",,,,Ostrya carpinifolia,na,,,,,,na,,,,,,,,na,,Rooting depth,comp - lower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quercus pubescens, Ostrya carpinifolia, Prunus mahaleb",,,,Tree,,,Multiple,Field,Observational,,,,,Adult,"Zapater, M; Breda, N; Bonal, D; Pardonnet, S; Granier, A",ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,English,Article,Broad-leaved species; Leaf water potential; Mixed forest; Phenology; Root distribution; Sap flow; Soil drought sensitivity; Vulnerability to cavitation,QUERCUS-PETRAEA; WATER RELATIONS; FOREST MANAGEMENT; FINE ROOTS; SAP FLUX; VULNERABILITY; CAVITATION; XYLEM; GROWTH; PLANT,16,2013,10.1007/s13595-012-0233-0,Differential response to soil drought among co-occurring broad-leaved tree species growing in a 15-to 25-year-old mixed stand,Keep,Alison Post,yes,Effect / Response - Comparison,,Drought,Trait correlations,Both,,,"In the context of global environmental changes, better understanding of tree response to soil drought in young mixed species stands is needed to anticipate forest adaptation and management practices for the future. We investigated the functional response of five co-occurring broad-leaved tree species growing in a 15- to 25-year-old mixed stand in northeastern France during the 2006 summer drought. We measured functional traits related to water acquisition (phenology, rooting pattern and vulnerability of xylem to cavitation) and the ecophysiological response (sap flux density, leaf water potential) of these species to soil water shortage. Our study highlights contrasted drought response strategies among these species and a trade-off between leaf phenology, resistance of xylem to cavitation and root system depth. At this site, a deep root system seemed to be a key functional trait for the species to cope with drought. Quercus robur and Salix capreae can be characterised as drought-avoidance species as they possess a deep root system and therefore did not strongly experience soil drought. Despite deep rooting capacity, Betula pendula did not really avoid soil drought and strongly regulated transpiration during dry periods. Nevertheless, the earliness of budburst of this species contributes to high annual growth rate. In contrast, Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica both displayed typical characteristics of drought-sensitive species.",,"- With the exception of B. pendula, we confirmed that for this broad-leaved mixed stand the species that develop deep rooting systems efficiently postpone, or even avoid, the effects of reduced upper soil water availability...whereas the strong decrease in transpiration for C. betulus and F. sylvatica was consistent with a shallow rooting system. - We observed that _50 (the water potential inducing a 50 % loss in hydraulic conductivity) and the depth of the root system were located close together on the principal component analysis plane, thus indicating for the studied species that the deeper the fine roots, the less negative _50.",,,Grouped,Water potential,Water potential,Rooting depth,,,positively correlated with deep roots,,,,,,,,,,"Sap flow, leaf water potential, phenology (leaf unfolding, leaf fall, bud development), xylem vulnerability/cavitation",Rooting depth,increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sap flow, leaf water potential, phenology (leaf unfolding, leaf fall, bud development), xylem vulnerability/cavitation",,,Natural summer drought (annual occurence),"- With the exception of B. pendula, we confirmed that for this broad-leaved mixed stand the species that develop deep rooting systems efficiently postpone, or even avoid, the effects of reduced upper soil water availability...whereas the strong decrease in transpiration for C. betulus and F. sylvatica was consistent with a shallow rooting system. - We observed that _50 (the water potential inducing a 50 % loss in hydraulic conductivity) and the depth of the root system were located close together on the principal component analysis plane, thus indicating for the studied species that the deeper the fine roots, the less negative _50.",48ç40_27_N; 7ç03_53_E,"European beech (F. sylvatica), hornbeam (C. betulus), oaks (Q. robur), goat willow (S. capreae), silver birch (B. pendula), aspen (Populus tremula) and wild cherry (Prunus avium)",NA,NA,Quantitative,Tree,,,Multiple,Field,Observational,,,,,Adult,"P_rez-Ramos IM, Roumet C, Cruz P et al (2012) Evidence for a _plant community economics spectrumÓ driven by nutrient and water limitations in a Mediterranean rangeland of southern France.

We also found multiple relationships with better empirical support than the null model when we compared leaf and root parameters (Table 4). First, SLAcwm was correlated with all the below_ground parameters considered in this study. As an example, SLAcwm was positively and linearly related with its equivalent below_ground parameter, the specific root area (Fig. 2a). Second, LDMCcwm and leaf thicknesscwm, two leaf parameters commonly associated to a conservative resource_use strategy, were positively correlated with RDMCwsp (Fig. 2b) and biomass allocation to roots (Table 4). Finally, models including _13Ccwm and most of the below_ground parameters had strong empirical support; thus, communities with high water use efficiency (high _13Ccwm) allocated more biomass to shallow roots, which showed low SRAwsp and high RDMCwsp (Table 4). Communities were adapted to water shortage through a conservative resource_use strategy. As expected, drier conditions promoted the predominance of plant communities with low SLAcwm and higher values of _13Ccwm, indicating a more efficient use of water (Farquhar, O'Leary & Berry 1982), consistent with other previous studies (e.g. Cunningham, Summerhayes & Westoby 1999; De Bello et al. 2009).Regarding the below_ground component, communities developing in moister sites were deeply rooted. Similarly, Schenk & Jackson (2002) reported that Rooting depth - Maxs tend to increase with soil water availability. In our system, this could be partially explained by the scarcity of deep soils in drier microsites, as indicated by the strong positive correlation between both environmental factors (soil depth and SWS). Rooting depth was better related to soil water availability than to the nutrition index. This may be because nutrient uptake usually takes place in upper soil layers (Jobb_gy & Jackson 2001), whereas a relatively small proportion of roots in deeper soil layers can contribute substantially to water uptake (Jackson et al. 1996).",Deeper roots in moister sites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rooting depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tree,,,,,Observational,,,,,,"Pineda_Garcia, F., Paz, H., Meinzer, F.
