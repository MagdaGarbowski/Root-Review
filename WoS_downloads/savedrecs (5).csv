In present investigation, the morphological variability of forest violets (Viola reichenbachiana and V. riviniana), their degree of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their reproduction properties were studied using samples from ore-bearing areas with soils rich in heavy metals. In these habitats, individuals with typical morphological characters of V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana were not identified but populations were intermediate between these two species. Three ore-bearing areas with soils of a high content but low extractable amounts of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd) were covered by anthropogenic pine or beech forests, contrary to typical calamine heaps with metallophyte floras. Violets growing on ore-bearing areas were fully fertile, deposited Pb and Zn mainly in roots and had low Cd levels both in shoots and roots. Plants differed in AMF colonization with the degrees varying from nil to moderate. The violets growing in these areas were not affected id their reproduction and can be considered as stabilized introgressive forms or ecotypes of parental species on these soil conditions.

The aim of this study was to test how subordinate plant species influence the functioning of a species-rich semi-natural grasslands. A plant removal experiment was set-up in the mountain grasslands of the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) to test the impact of subordinate plant species on soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The experiment included three treatments: removal of all subordinate species, partial biomass removal of dominant species, and a no biomass removal control. After 2 years of treatments, we determined soil microbial community (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi) by T-RFLP analysis and measured litter decomposition, soil respiration, soil inorganic nitrogen (DIN) availability and throughout aboveground biomass production as measures of ecosystem function. The removal of subordinate plant species strongly affected bacterial and weakly influenced mycorrhizal fungi communities and decreased rates of plant litter decomposition, soil respiration and DIN availability with larger effects than the partial loss of dominant biomass. The removal of subordinate plant species did not modify plant community structure, but it did reduce total above-ground biomass production compared to the control plots. Collectively, our findings indicate that the loss of subordinate species can have significant consequences for soil microbial communities and ecosystem functions, suggesting that subordinate species are important drivers of ecosystem properties.

However, the impact of geomorphic processes on nitrogen budgets remains poorly constrained. We have used the elemental and isotopic composition of soil and plant organic matter to investigate nitrogen cycling in the mountain forest of Taiwan, from 24 sites with distinct geomorphic (topographic slope) and climatic (precipitation, temperature) characteristics. The organic carbon to nitrogen ratio of soil organic matter decreased with soil C-14 age, providing constraint on average rates of nitrogen loss using a mass balance model. Model predictions suggest that present day estimates of nitrogen deposition exceed contemporary and historic nitrogen losses. We found similar to 6% variability in the stable isotopic composition (delta N-15) of soil and plants which was not related to soil C-14 age or climatic conditions. Instead, delta N-15 was significantly, negatively correlated with topographic slope. Using the mass balance model, we demonstrate that the correlation can be explained by an increase in nitrogen loss by non-fractioning pathways on steeper slopes, where physical erosion most effectively removes particulate nitrogen. Published data from forests on steep slopes are consistent with the correlation. Based on our dataset and these observations, we hypothesise that variable physical erosion rates can significantly influence soil delta N-15, and suggest particulate nitrogen export is a major, yet underappreciated, loss term in the nitrogen budget of mountain forests.","[Hilton, R.

Don. Area of study: Seedlings of 69 families of P. radiata belonging to five different sites in Central Chile, ranging from coastal range to fothills of the Andes, were grown in controlled conditions to evaluate differences in response to watering. Material and methods: The seedlings were subjected to two watering regimes: well-watered treatment, in which seedlings were watered daily, and water stress treatment in which seedlings were subjected to three cyclic water deficits by watering to container capacity on 12 days cycles each. After twenty-eight weeks root collar diameter, height, shoot dry weight (stem + needles), root dry weight, total dry weight, height/diameter ratio and root/shoot ratio were recorded. Patterns and amounts of phenotypic changes, including changes in biomass allocation, were analyzed. Main results: Families from coastal sites presented high divergence for phenotypic changes, allocating more biomass to shoots, and those families from interior sites presented low phenotypic plasticity, allocating more biomass to roots at the expense of shoots. These changes are interpreted as a plastic response and leads to the conclusion that the local landrace of P. radiata in Chile originating from contrasting environments possess distinct morphological responses to water deficit which in turn leads to phenotypic plasticity. Research highlights: Families belonging to sandy soil sites must be considered for tree breeding in dry areas, selecting those with high root: shoot ratio.","[Espinoza, S.

In this study we compared the abundance and diversity of nitrogen fixing microbes based on the functional marker gene nifH, which codes for a subunit of the Fe-protein of the dinitrogenase reductase, in nodules of different size classes of Trifolium arvense (L.). Additionally, carbon and nitrogen contents of the bulk soil and plant material were measured. Plants were harvested from different sites, reflecting 2 (2a) and 5 (5a) yr of ecosystem development, of an opencast lignite mining area in the south of Cottbus, Lower Lusatia (Germany) where the artificial catchment ""Chicken Creek"" was constructed to study the development of terrestrial ecosystems. Plants from the 5a site revealed higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen, although nifH gene abundances in the nodules and carbon and nitrogen contents between the two soils did not differ significantly. Analysis of the nifH clone libraries showed a significant effect of the nodule size on the community composition of nitrogen fixing microbes. Medium sized nodules (2-5 mm) contained a uniform community composed of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, whereas the small nodules (<2 mm) consisted of a diverse community including clones with non-Rhizobium nifH gene sequences. Regarding the impact of the soil age on the community composition a clear distinction between the small and the medium nodules can be made. While clone libraries from the medium nodules were pretty similar at both soil ages, soil age had a significant effect on the community compositions of the small nodules, where the proportion of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii increased with soil age.","[Schulz, S.; Engel, M.; Fischer, D.; Welzl, G.; Schloter, M.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Res Unit Environm Genom, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Buegger, F.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Soil Ecol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Elmer, M.] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Res Ctr Landscape Dev & Min Landscapes, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany","Schulz, S (reprint author), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Res Unit Environm Genom, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",stefanie.schulz@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Fischer, Doreen/H-8980-2013","Schulz, Stefanie/0000-0001-5520-8106","Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 38 by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bonn) [SFB/TRR38]; Brandenburg Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK, Potsdam)","This study is part of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 38 (SFB/TRR38) which is financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bonn) and the Brandenburg Ministry of Science, Research and Culture (MWFK, Potsdam).

Biotic interactions, both antagonist and mutualistic, have been proposed to influence this transition which is generally accompanied by the evolution of sexual dimorphism in secondary sexual traits. While some researchers have studied sex-specific patterns in herbivory and pollination, less attention has been paid to pathogens/parasites and a limited number of studies have revised sex-specific patterns in mycorrhizal symbiosis. In this article, we explore sex-specific interactions in dioecious and gynodioecious plants, examining the interrelationships among the incidence and/or frequency of herbivory, pathogen/parasite infestation, pollination and mycorrhizal symbioses. We review how multiple interactions (both above and belowground) act synergistically or antagonistically to shape the ecological and evolutionary results of pairwise interactions. Finally, we identify gaps in the knowledge of sex-specific patterns in multiple interactions in dioecious and gynodioecious plants, as well as future and promising lines of research.

Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using parsimony, likelihood (RAxML and likelihood ratchet PAUP*), and Bayesian inference to determine the placement of these additional taxa within Schismatoglottideae. The resulting tree topology supports, 1) a monophyletic West Sarawak clade comprising three genera: Aridarum, Bakoa, and Piptospatha; and 2) a supra-Lupar Line (the boundary between two of the known Bornean biochores) clade comprising the 'Schismatoglottis' josefii complex. Nineteen morphological, ecological, and geographical characters were coded and mapped using parsimony (unordered model) onto the Bayesian tree to investigate incidents of homoplasy or apomorphic status of morphologies presumed significant in the evolution of rheophytism. The morphologies proposed here as the primary mechanisms adaptive for rheophytism in Bornean Schismatoglottideae are: root/shoot disarticulation; a free ligular sheath; and marcescent senescence of the ligule.

Mycotrophic strategy of 13 common neotropical trees and shrubs. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using common Puerto Rican trees and shrubs that span the spectrum of neotropic life histories. Our working hypothesis was that species had a higher colonisation rate of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as they established further and further after a disturbance (quantified as increasing seed size). Results suggested that (1) Cecropia schreberiana and Schefflera morototoni were weakly-facultative mycorrhizal, (2) Casearia arborea, Inga laurina and Guarea guidonia were strongly-facultative mycorrhizal and (3) Piper glabrescens, Tabebuia heterophylla, Palicourea riparia, Buchenaria capitata and Dacryodes excelsa were obligately mycorrhizal with (4) Psychotria berteriana, Prestoea montana and Manilkara bidentata also obligate but at a reduced level. In general, these species were adapted to low inorganic phosphorus, colonised well with AMY and agreed with our working hypothesis; however, three shrub species (Piper, Palicourea, Psychotria) did not. Finally, we also found that shade tolerance of the test species corresponded with the AMF results better than their wood density or drought tolerance.","[Myster, R.

In order to resist osmotic stress, rhizobia accumulate a number of osmolytes including a potent osmoprotectant, glycine-betaine (GB). S. meliloti is able to synthesize GB from choline via a pathway encoded by the chromosomal betICBA operon. The last enzyme in the biochemical pathway, BetB, encodes a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, which converts betaine aldehyde to GB. Deletion of betB in S. meliloti strain Rm2011 leads to loss of detectable BADH activity. A second betB-related gene, betB2, is present on the S. meliloti pSymA megaplasmid and deletion of this gene has no effect on the observed level of BADH. However, an Rm2011 deletion mutant with only 144 aa from the N-terminal domain of BetB2 has lost the ability to tolerate high osmolarity, no longer accumulates GB under osmotic stress, has high levels of NAD-BADH, and has gained the ability to utilize GB for growth. These results suggest that truncated BetB2-144 stimulates GB catabolism, preventing it from being used as an osmoprotectant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However the loss of grass roots associated with woody encroachment can lead to a decrease in below-ground carbon storage which is not compensated for by an increase in above-ground carbon. To investigate how the extent of total woody cover affected ecosystem carbon, soil and above-ground carbon storage along eight thicket-savanna and five forest-grassland boundaries were measured. To investigate whether changes in soil carbon concentrations were related to the percentage of C4 (grass) roots to total roots and root quantity and quality, we measured fine-root biomass, root C : N ratios, root N, and % C4 roots at three different depths across thicket patches of different ages (n = 189). Forests contained significantly more carbon than adjacent grasslands in both above-ground carbon (mean difference 12.1 kgm(-2)) and in the top 100 cm of the soil (mean difference 4.54 kgm(-2)). Thickets contained significantly more above-ground carbon than adjacent savannas (3.33 kg m(-2)) but no significant differences in soil carbon were evident. Total fine-root biomass appeared to be more important than root quality (root C : N) in determining soil carbon concentrations during the encroachment process (i.e. in thicket of different ages). Similarly for thickets, the % C4 roots had no significant effect on soil carbon concentrations. In conclusion, thicket invading into open savanna vegetation did not lead to significant gains in ecosystem carbon at this study site. Significant gains were only evident in mature forest, suggesting that the process may take place very slowly.","[Coetsee, Corli] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, ZA-6530 George, South Africa; [Gray, Emma F.; Wakeling, Julia; Wigley, Benjamin J.; Bond, William J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Coetsee, C (reprint author), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, P Bag 6531, ZA-6530 George, South Africa.",Corli.Coetsee@nmmu.ac.za,"Wigley, Benjamin/K-6870-2019","Wigley, Benjamin/0000-0002-6964-3624; Bond, William/0000-0002-3441-2084",Andrew Mellon Foundation,"The authors extend their thanks to: Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife for allowing us to work in HiP; staff and students of the Zululand Tree Project for assistance in the field, staff of the Archaeometry laboratory at the Archaeology Department, UCT.

However, microbialplant interactions are known to influence the relative success of native versus invasive plants. Therefore, the abundance and composition of soil microorganisms may affect restoration efforts. We assessed the effect of herbicide treatment on phytosymbiotic pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic (PPFM) bacteria and the potential consequences of native and invasive species establishment post-herbicide treatment in the lab and in a coastal sage scrub (CSS)/grassland restoration site. Lab tests showed that 4% glyphosate reduced PPFM abundance. PPFM addition to seeds increased seedling length of a native plant (Artemisia californica) but not an invasive plant (Hirschfeldia incana). At the restoration site, methanol addition (a PPFM substrate) improved native bunchgrass (Nassella pulchra) germination and size by 35% over controls. In a separate multispecies field experiment, PPFM addition stimulated the germination of N. pulchra, but not that of three invasive species. Neither PPFM nor methanol addition strongly affected the growth of any plant species. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that PPFMs have a greater benefit to native than invasive species. Together, these experiments suggest that methanol or PPFM addition could be useful in improving CSS/grassland restorations. Future work should test PPFM effects on additional species and determine how these results vary under different environmental conditions.","[Irvine, Irina C.; Witter, Marti S.; Brigham, Christy A.] Natl Pk Serv, Santa Monica Mt Natl Recreat Area, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA; [Irvine, Irina C.; Martiny, Jennifer B.

We calibrated current wood delta N-15 of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), an ectomycorrhizal tree species, against a productivity gradient of contrasting coastal forests of southern Vancouver Island (Canada). We then examined historical delta N-15 via increment cores, and tested whether wood delta N-15 corresponded with climatic fluctuations. Extractable soil N ranged from 11 to 43 kg N ha(-1) along the productivity gradient, and was characterized by a progressive replacement of N forms (amino acids, NH4 (+) and NO3 (-)). Current wood delta N-15 was significantly less depleted (-5.0 to -2.6 aEuro degrees) with increasing productivity, although linear correlations were stronger with Delta delta N-15 (the difference between wood and soil delta N-15) to standardize the extent of isotopic fractionation by ectomycorrhizal fungi. An overall decline in wood delta N-15 of 0.9 aEuro degrees over the years 1900-2009 was detected, but trends diverged widely among plots, including positive, negative and no trend with time. We did not detect significant correlations in detrended wood delta N-15 with mean annual temperature or precipitation. The contemporary patterns in stand productivity, soil N supply and wood delta N-15 were moderately strong, but interpreting historical patterns in delta N-15 was challenging because of potential variations in N uptake related to stand dynamics. The lack of wood delta N-15 correlations with climate may be partly due to methodological limitations, but might also reflect the relative stability in N supply due to the overriding constraints of soil organic matter quantity and quality.","[Kranabetter, J.

In this study, we modified this method by adopting mini ingrowth cores (diameter 1.2 cm), extending sample intervals to a growing season, and developing new models to quantify the concurrent production, mortality and decomposition, and applied them to a secondary Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour) forest. Annual fine root production, mortality and decomposition estimated by our method were 2.10 +/- 0.23, 1.78 +/- 0.20 and 0.85 +/- 0.13 t ha(-1), respectively, and 33.3% of the production was decomposed in the growing season. The production estimate using our method was significantly higher than those using two long-term ingrowth core (sample interval > 2 months) methods. However, it was significantly lower than that using the short-term ingrowth core (sample interval < 2 months) method, presumably due to the lower root competition and less decomposition occurring in the short-term cores. The fine root estimates using our method in the growing season were generally higher than those using the forward and continuous inflow methods but lower than those using the backward method. Our method reduces the disturbances in roots and soil, minimizes the sampling frequency and improves the quantification of fine root decomposition during the sample intervals. These modifications overcome the limitations associated with the previous ingrowth core methods. Our method provides an improved alternative for estimating fine root production, mortality and decomposition.","[Li, Xuefeng; Zhu, Jiang; Han, Shijie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lange, Holger] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, NO-1431 As, Norway","Han, SJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",hansj@iae.ac.cn,"Lange, Holger/A-2458-2012",,"China's Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2011CB403206]; Chinese Academy of ScienceChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-GJ01]",This study was supported by the 973 Research Project of China's Ministry of Science and Technology (2011CB403206) and research fund from Chinese Academy of Science (KZCX2-YW-GJ01).,,29,16,17,0,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2013,33,1,,,,,18,25,,10.1093/treephys/tps124,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,078UY,WOS:000314126400003,23274718,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Li, J; Yu, B; Zhao, C; Nowak, RS; Zhao, Z; Sheng, Y; Li, J",,,,"Li, J.; Yu, B.; Zhao, C.; Nowak, Robert S.; Zhao, Z.; Sheng, Y.; Li, J.",,,Physiological and morphological responses of Tamarix ramosissima and Populus euphratica to altered groundwater availability,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,groundwater use; net CO2 assimilation; riparian; root distribution; plant growth; Tarim River,SOUTHWESTERN UNITED-STATES; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; SAN PEDRO RIVER; RIPARIAN COTTONWOODS; NATIVE POPULUS; LOWER REACHES; TARIM RIVER; SEEDLING COMPETITION; COLORADO RIVER; TABLE DECLINE,"Riparian plants in arid areas are subject to frequent hydrological fluctuations induced through natural flow variation and water use by humans. Although many studies have focused on the success of Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. in its invaded ranges, its major competitor in its home range, Populus euphratica Oliv., historically has dominated riparian forests where both species occur naturally. Thus, identifying ecophysiological differences between T. ramosissima and its co-evolved competitor under varying hydrological conditions may help us understand how flow regimes affect dominance in its home range and promote invasion in new ranges. We examined ecophysiological responses of T. ramosissima and P. euphratica, which are both native to the Tarim River Basin, northwest China, to experimental alterations in groundwater. Seedlings of both species were grown in lysimeters, first under well-watered conditions and then exposed to different groundwater treatments: inundation, drought, and relatively shallow, moderate and deep groundwater. Under inundation, T. ramosissima showed little growth whereas P. euphratica died after similar to 45 days. Droughted seedlings of both species suffered from considerable water stress evidenced by slow growth, decreased total leaf area and specific leaf area, and decreased xylem water potential (epsilon), maximum photosynthetic rate and carboxylation efficiency. Both species had better ecophysiological performances under shallow and moderate groundwater conditions. When groundwater declined below rooting depth, seedlings of both species initially experienced decreased epsilon, but epsilon of T. ramosissima recovered late in the experiment whereas P. euphratica maintained decreased epsilon. This ability of T. ramosissima to recover from water deficit might result from its rapid root elongation and subsequent ability to acquire groundwater, which in turn likely provides ecophysiological advantages over P. euphratica. Our results suggest that recent groundwater declines along the Tarim River could facilitate T. ramosissima more due to its rapid response to changed groundwater availability. This trait may also help the success of T. ramosissima as it invaded riparian ecosystems in southwestern USA.","[Li, J.; Yu, B.; Zhao, C.; Zhao, Z.; Sheng, Y.; Li, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, B.; Li, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Nowak, Robert S.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Li, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",lijun@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41171037, 40830640]; Western Light Foundation of the CAS [XBBS200807]; Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1047575]","This research was financially supported by grants from the National Natural Science of China (41171037 and 40830640), Western Light Foundation of the CAS (XBBS200807) with additional support to R.S.N. by the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station and the US National Science Foundation (OISE-1047575).",,55,23,28,1,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2013,33,1,,,,,57,68,,10.1093/treephys/tps120,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,078UY,WOS:000314126400007,23243028,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Wang, QK; Liu, SP; Wang, SL",,,,"Wang, Qingkui; Liu, Suping; Wang, Silong",,,Debris manipulation alters soil CO2 efflux in a subtropical plantation forest,GEODERMA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chinese fir plantation; Soil CO2 efflux; Debris exclusion; Debris addition; Priming effect,BELOW-GROUND LITTER; ORGANIC-CARBON; ABOVEGROUND LITTER; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ROOT RESPIRATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ELEVATED CO2; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS,"Potential changes in the quality and quantity of C inputs in soil during environmental changes may affect soil CO2 efflux in forest ecosystems. Therefore, a field debris exclusion experiment and a laboratory debris addition experiment were conducted to assess the response of soil CO2 efflux to C input manipulation. Our experiments were the first to be conducted in a subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation. The field debris exclusion experiment included the following treatments: leaf litter exclusion (NL), leaf litter and root exclusion (NLR), and control (CT). in the laboratory experiment, leaf litter and fine and coarse roots were added to soils collected from the same site and incubated for 100 days at 15.0 degrees C using the isotopic partitioning approach to determine the priming effect on soil C. The field-experimental results showed that soil CO2 efflux decreased significantly by 22.9% and 49.1% in the NL and NLR plots, respectively, compared with the CT plots. However, debris exclusion did not affect the diurnal and seasonal patterns of soil CO2 efflux. The contributions of leaf litter and roots to total soil CO2 efflux were 22.9% and 26.2%, respectively, which were positively related to soil temperature and moisture. In the laboratory experiment, the cumulative amount of soil CO2 efflux increased 1.25, 0.51, and 0.43 times in the soils with leaf litter, fine root, and coarse root additions, respectively, compared with the control soil (without debris addition) at the end of the incubation period. The amount of CO2 derived from leaf litter, fine root, and coarse root additions accounted for 44.0%, 31.1%, and 27.9% of the total amount of soil CO2 efflux, respectively. During the experimental period, the priming effect induced by fast-decomposing leaf litter (25.9%) was significantly higher than the priming effect induced by slow-decomposing fine roots (3.8%) and coarse roots (2.9%). The priming effect was negatively correlated with the initial lignin content and the lignin:N ratios of the added debris. The similar contributions of leaf litter and roots to soil CO2 efflux from the field experiment and the greater contributions of the priming of leaf litters to the fluxes from the laboratory experiment suggest that root inputs are more important than litter inputs in regulating soil C storage in Chinese fir forests.

With no evidence of sexual reproduction, their evolutionary success is inconsistent with the prediction that asexual taxa are vulnerable to extinction due to accumulation of deleterious mutations. To explore why Glomeromycota defy this prediction, we studied ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene evolution in the Claroideoglomus lineage and estimated effective population size, Ne, in C. etunicatum. We found that rRNA genes of these fungi exhibit unusual and complex patterns of molecular evolution. In C. etunicatum, these patterns can be collectively explained by an unexpectedly large Ne combined with imperfect genome-wide and population-level rRNA gene repeat homogenization. The mutations accumulated in rRNA gene sequences indicate that natural selection is effective at purging deleterious mutations in the Claroideoglomus lineage, which is also consistent with the large Ne of C. etunicatum. We propose that in the near absence of recombination, asexual reproduction involving massively multinucleate spores typical for Glomeromycota is responsible for the improved efficacy of selection relative to drift. We postulate that large effective population sizes contribute to the evolutionary longevity of Glomeromycota.","[VanKuren, Nicholas W.; den Bakker, Henk C.; Pawlowska, Teresa E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [VanKuren, Nicholas W.] Univ Chicago, Comm Genet Genom & Syst Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Morton, Joseph B.] W Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","VanKuren, NW (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tep8@cornell.edu,"den Bakker, Hendrik/A-8136-2010","den Bakker, Hendrik/0000-0002-4086-1580",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0538363]; S.

Although beneficial effects have been reported on soil stabilization, there still remains a lack of information about their impact on soil microorganisms. Our investigation has been carried out in exotic and native tree plantations of 28 years and aimed to survey and compare the abundance and genetic diversity of natural legume-nodulating rhizobia (LNR). The study of LNR is supported by the phylogenetic analysis which clustered the isolates into three genera: Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Sinorhizobium. The results showed close positive correlations between the sizes of LNR populations estimated both in the dry and rainy seasons and the presence of legume tree hosts. There were significant increases in Rhizobium spp. population densities in response to planting with Acacia spp., and high genetic diversities and richness of genotypes were fittest in these tree plantations. This suggests that enrichment of soil Rhizobium spp. populations is host specific. The results indicated also that species of genera Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium were lacking in plantations of non-host species. By contrast, there was a widespread distribution of Bradyrhizobium spp. strains across the tree plantations, with no evident specialization in regard to plantation type. Finally, the study provides information about the LNR communities associated with a range of old tree plantations and some aspects of their relationships to soil factors, which may facilitate the management of man-made forest systems that target ecosystem rehabilitation and preservation of soil biota.","[Sene, Godar; Thiao, Mansour; Samba-Mbaye, Ramatoulaye; Kane, Aboubacry; Sylla, Samba Ndao] UCAD, ISRA, IRD, LCM, Dakar 18524, Senegal; [Thiao, Mansour; Samba-Mbaye, Ramatoulaye; Kane, Aboubacry; Mbaye, Mame Samba; Sylla, Samba Ndao] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Biol Vegetale, Dakar, Senegal; [Sene, Godar] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Dakar, Senegal; [Manga, Anicet] Univ Gaston Berger, St Louis, Senegal; [Khasa, Damase; Beaulieu, Marie-Eve] Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Khasa, Damase; Beaulieu, Marie-Eve] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Foret, Chaire Rech, Canada Genom Forestiere & Environm, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Sene, G (reprint author), Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Dakar, Senegal.",senegodar@yahoo.fr,,"Manga, Anicet/0000-0002-3821-2493",Fonds National de Recherche Agricole et Agroalimentaire [02AP06SS020407]; Sud Expert Plantes [306 F]; Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie,"This work was funded by the Fonds National de Recherche Agricole et Agroalimentaire (02AP06SS020407), Sud Expert Plantes (306 F), and the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie.

In addition, to investigate the molecular basis of acid tolerance, the expression of chaperone genes groEL and dnaKJ was analyzed using acid-tolerant and sensitive mesorhizobia. Tolerance to pH 5 and 9 was evaluated in liquid medium for 98 Portuguese chickpea mesorhizobia belonging to four species clusters. All isolates showed high sensitivity to pH 9. In contrast, mesorhizobia revealed high diversity in terms of tolerance to acid stress: 35 % of the isolates were acid sensitive and 45 % were highly tolerant to pH 5 or moderately acidophilic. An association between mesorhizobia tolerance to acid conditions and the origin soil pH was found. Furthermore, significant differences between species clusters regarding tolerance to acidity were obtained. Ten isolates were used to investigate the expression levels of the chaperone genes by northern hybridization. Interestingly, most acid-tolerant isolates displayed induction of the dnaK and groESL genes upon acid shock while the sensitive ones showed repression. This study suggests that acid tolerance in mesorhizobia is related to the pH of the origin soil and to the species cluster of the isolates. Additionally, the transcriptional analysis suggests a relationship between induction of major chaperone genes and higher tolerance to acid pH in mesorhizobia. This is the first report on transcriptional analysis of the major chaperones genes in mesorhizobia under acidity, contributing to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rhizobia acidity tolerance.","[Brigido, Clarisse; Oliveira, Solange] Univ Evora, ICAAM, Lab Microbiol Solo, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Oliveira, Solange] Univ Evora, Dept Biol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal","Oliveira, S (reprint author), Univ Evora, Dept Biol, Apartado 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ismo@uevora.pt,"Brigido, Clarisse/M-2784-2016","Brigido, Clarisse/0000-0002-4167-5253; Oliveira, Solange/0000-0003-4984-4805",FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); EU-FEDEREuropean Union (EU) [PTDC/BIO/80932/2006]; FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BD/30680/2006],This work has received funding from FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) and co-financed by EU-FEDER (PTDC/BIO/80932/2006).

It is generally accepted that microsporidia are capable of sexual reproduction, and that some species have switched to obligate asexuality, but such process had never been supported with population genetic evidence. We examine the mode of reproduction of Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis and Hamiltosporidium magnivora, two closely related microsporidian parasites of the widespread freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, based on a set of 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distributed across 16 genes. We analyse 20 H. tvaerminnensis isolates from localities representative of the entire species' geographic distribution along the Skerry Island belt of the Baltic Sea. Five isolates of the sister species H. magnivora were used for comparison. We estimate the recombination rates in H. tvaerminnensis to be at least eight orders of magnitude lower than in H. magnivora and not significantly different from zero. This is corroborated by the higher divergence between H. tvaerminnensis alleles (including fixed heterozygosity), as compared to H. magnivora. Our study confirms that sexual recombination is present in microsporidia, that it can be lost, and that asexuals may become epidemic.","[Haag, Karen L.; Ebert, Dieter] Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Traunecker, Emmanuel] Univ Basel, Dept Biomed, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland","Haag, KL (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Zool, Vesalgasse 1, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",karen.haag@unibas.ch,"Ebert, Dieter/P-6134-2019; Ebert, Dieter/B-5502-2009; Haag, Karen/R-1382-2016","Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772; Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772; Haag, Karen/0000-0003-1162-0152",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"Thanks to Dita Vizoso and Thomas Zumbrunn for their help with the illustrations and to David Duneau for his help with sorting spores.

HPLC assays of ergosterol (fungal biomass) and amplicon pyrosequencing of the ITS2 region of rDNA were used to investigate how the fungal communities associated with four bryophyte species changed across an elevational gradient transitioning from conifer forest to the low-alpine. Fungal biomass and OTU richness associated with the four moss hosts did not vary significantly across the gradient (P > 0.05), and both were more strongly affected by host and tissue type. Despite largely constant levels of fungal biomass, distinct shifts in community composition of fungi associated with Hylocomium, Pleurozium and Polytrichum occurred between the elevation zones of the gradient. This likely is a result of influence on fungal communities by major environmental factors such as temperature, directly or indirectly mediated by, or interacting with, the response of other components of the vegetation (i.e. the dominant trees). Fungal communities associated with Dicranum were an exception, exhibiting spatial autocorrelation between plots, and no significant structuring by elevation. Nevertheless, the detection of distinct fungal assemblages associated with a single host growing in different elevation zones along an elevational gradient is of particular relevance in the light of the ongoing changes in vegetation patterns in boreal and alpine systems due to global climate warming.","[Davey, Marie L.; Ohlson, Mikael] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Davey, Marie L.; Kauserud, Havard] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, MERG, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Heegaard, Einar] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, NO-5244 Fana, Norway; [Halvorsen, Rune] Univ Oslo, Dept Bot, Nat Hist Museum, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway","Davey, ML (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",marie.davey@umb.no,,"Davey, Marie/0000-0003-3911-8770; Ohlson, Mikael/0000-0003-0237-149X",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [Miljo-2015]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This research was supported by a Miljo-2015 grant from the Research Council of Norway to MO, and by a post-doctoral fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to MLD.

Traditional excavation methods are labor intensive and destructive, with limited quantification and repeatability of measurements over time. As a nondestructive geophysical tool for delineating buried features in shallow subsurface, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied for coarse root detection since 1999. This article reviews the state-of-knowledge of coarse root detection and quantification using GPR, and discusses its potentials, constraints, possible solutions, and future outlooks. Some useful suggestions are provided that can guide future studies in this field. The feasibility and accuracy of coarse root investigation by GPR have been tested in various site conditions (mostly in controlled conditions or within plantations) and for different plant species (mostly tree root systems). Thus far, single coarse root identification and coarse root system mapping have been conducted using GPR, including roots under pavements in urban environment. Coarse root diameter and biomass have been estimated from indexes extracted from root GPR radargrams. Coarse root development can be observed by repeated GPR scanning over time. Successful GPR-based coarse root investigation is site specific, and only under suitable conditions can reliable measurements be accomplished. The best quality of root detection by GPR is achieved in well-drained and electrically-resistive soils (such as sands) under dry conditions. Numerous factors such as local soil conditions, root electromagnetic properties, and GPR antenna frequency can impact the reliability and accuracy of GPR detection and quantification of coarse roots. As GPR design, data processing software, field data collection protocols, and root parameters estimation methods are continuously improved, this noninvasive technique could offer greater potential to study coarse roots.","[Lin, Henry] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Guo, Li; Chen, Jin; Cui, Xihong; Fan, Bihang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Lin, H (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",henrylin@psu.edu,"Guo, Li/B-7820-2016; Lin, Henry/E-8234-2011; cui, xihong/E-8735-2015; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; Guo, Li/P-2690-2014","Guo, Li/0000-0003-3821-4058; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41001239]; Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology at Beijing Normal University","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41001239), the research fund of Jin Chen from the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China, and the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology at Beijing Normal University.

When fertilized with complex protein N we found increases in N-degrading enzyme concentrations only when root in-growth was allowed. No response was observed when complex N was added to root-free treatments. Expanding on economic rules of microbial element limitation theory developed from lab incubation data, we suggest this is due to active transport of labile carbon (C) from roots to associated microbial communities in root bags.

We investigated the functional response of five co-occurring broad-leaved tree species growing in a 15- to 25-year-old mixed stand in northeastern France during the 2006 summer drought. We measured functional traits related to water acquisition (phenology, rooting pattern and vulnerability of xylem to cavitation) and the ecophysiological response (sap flux density, leaf water potential) of these species to soil water shortage. Our study highlights contrasted drought response strategies among these species and a trade-off between leaf phenology, resistance of xylem to cavitation and root system depth. At this site, a deep root system seemed to be a key functional trait for the species to cope with drought. Quercus robur and Salix capreae can be characterised as drought-avoidance species as they possess a deep root system and therefore did not strongly experience soil drought. Despite deep rooting capacity, Betula pendula did not really avoid soil drought and strongly regulated transpiration during dry periods. Nevertheless, the earliness of budburst of this species contributes to high annual growth rate.

The introduction of exotic species to a new biogeographical range may alter the plant herbivore interactions and induce selection pressures for new plant defence strategies with a modified resource allocation. To detect evolution in tolerance to herbivory in common ragweed, we compared 3 native (North America) and 3 introduced (France) populations, grown in a common garden environment. We explored the effect of leaf herbivory on plant vegetative and reproductive traits. Plants were defoliated by hand, simulating different degrees of insect grazing by removing 0%, 50% or 90% of each leaf blade. Total and shoot dry biomasses were not affected by increasing defoliation, whereas root dry biomass and root:shoot ratio decreased significantly for native and introduced populations. Furthermore, defoliation treatments did not affect any of the plant reproductive traits measured. Hence, common ragweed displayed an efficient reallocation of resources in shoot biomass at the expense of roots following defoliation, which allows the species to tolerate herbivory without obvious costs for fitness. We did not detect any difference in herbivory tolerance between introduced and native populations, but significant differences were found in reproduction with invasive populations producing more seeds than native populations. As a result, tolerance to herbivory has been maintained in the introduced plant populations. We discuss some implications of these preliminary results for biological control strategies dedicated to common ragweed.","[Gard, B.; Laitung, B.] Univ Bourgogne, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bretagnolle, F.] Univ Bourgogne, Biogeosci UMR6282, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Dessaint, F.] INRA, Agroecol UMR1347, F-21000 Dijon, France","Laitung, B (reprint author), Univ Bourgogne, Agroecol UMR1347, BP 86510, F-21000 Dijon, France.",beryl.laitung@u-bourgogne.fr,"DESSAINT, Fabrice/F-1102-2014","DESSAINT, Fabrice/0000-0001-9135-598X",Conseil Regional de BourgogneRegion Bourgogne-Franche-Comte; University of Burgundy,"The authors would like to thank Francois Dugue and Florence Strbick for technical assistance, Dr. Xavier Verge (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) and Pr.

However, they can also exhibit large values of belowground NPP that can contribute significantly to the total annual inputs of organic matter into the soil. These hydromorphic Podzol soils also exhibit a horizon rich in organic matter at around 1-2m depth, presumably as a result of eluviation of dissolved organic matter and sesquioxides of Fe and Al. Therefore, it is likely that these ecosystems store large quantities of carbon by (1) large amounts of C inputs to soils dominated by their high levels of fine-root production, (2) stabilization of organic matter in an illuviation horizon due to significant vertical transfers of C. To assess these ideas we studied soil carbon dynamics using radiocarbon in two adjacent Amazon forests growing on contrasting soils: a hydromorphic Podzol and a well-drained Alisol supporting a high-stature terra firme forest. Our measurements showed similar concentrations of C and radiocarbon in the litter layer and the first 5 cm of the mineral soil for both sites. This result is consistent with the idea that the hydromorphic Podzol soil has similar soil C storage and cycling rates compared to the well-drained Alisol that supports a more opulent vegetation. However, we found important differences in carbon dynamics and transfers along the vertical profile. At both soils, we found similar radiocarbon concentrations in the subsoil, but the carbon released after incubating soil samples presented radiocarbon concentrations of recent origin in the Alisol, but not in the Podzol. There were no indications of incorporation of C fixed after 1950 in the illuvial horizon of the Podzol. With the aid of a simulation model, we predicted that only a minor fraction (1.7 %) of the labile carbon decomposed in the topsoil is transferred to the subsoil of the Podzol, while this proportional transfer is about 30% in the Alisol. Furthermore, our estimates were 8 times lower than previous estimations of vertical C transfers in Amazon Podzols, and question the validity of these previous estimations for all Podzols within the Amazon Basin. Our results also challenge our previous ideas about the genesis of these particular soils and suggest that either they are not true Podzols or the podzolization processes had already stopped.","[Sierra, C.

However, the effects of these changes on forest soil carbon (C) sequestration remain largely unclear. Here, we used urban-to-rural environmental gradients in Guangdong Province, southern China, to address the potential effects of these environmental changes on soil C sequestration in Pinus massoniana forests. In contrast to our expectations and earlier observations, soil C content in urban sites was significantly lower than that in suburban and rural sites. Lower soil C pools in urban sites were correlated with a significant decrease in fine root biomass and a potential increase in soil organic C decomposition. Variation of soil C pools was also a function of change in soil C fractions. Heavy fraction C content in urban sites was significantly lower than that in suburban and rural sites. By contrast, light fraction C content did not vary significantly along the urban-to-rural gradient. Our results suggest that urbanization-induced environmental changes may have a negative effect on forest soil C in the studied region.","[Chen, H.; Zhang, W.; Liu, L.; Huang, J.; Zhang, T.; Wang, W.; Mo, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gilliam, F.] Marshall Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Huntington, WV 25755 USA; [Chen, H.] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Mo, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mojm@scib.ac.cn,"Lei, Liu/J-7929-2017; Gilliam, Frank S./M-9767-2019; Chen, Hao/U-4752-2017","Lei, Liu/0000-0002-8063-610X; Gilliam, Frank S./0000-0002-5525-0766; Chen, Hao/0000-0003-3577-2345","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41273143, 31000236]; National Key Basic Research 973 ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2010CB833502]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41273143 and 31000236) and the National Key Basic Research 973 Program (2010CB833502).

Increased stand productivity with resource availability has been reported, but the relationship between soil microbial community structure and stand productivity remains unclear. To examine soil microbial composition of 4 aspen stand productivity classes, we assessed soil properties, microbial biomass and respiration, and bacterial and ectomycorrhizal diversity. Most variables showed no significant differences between productivity classes. However, mean values for basal respiration (0.05 to 27.99 mu g CO2-C.g(-1) soil.h(-1)), bacterial biomass, and metabolic quotient (0.08 to 5.22 CO2-C.mg(-1) C-mic.h(-1)) were lowest in low productivity (Class 1) sites. Bacteria to fungi ratios were significantly lower (P = 0.05) in Class 1 compared to other classes. Microbial biomass ranged from 1.39 to 8.11 mg C-mic.g(-1) soil. Thirty-seven distinct aspen ectomycorrhizas (ECM) were characterized, 21 were considered rare (from <= 3 trees). ECM richness did not differ significantly between classes, although relative abundance for some types did. Canonical correspondence analysis showed productivity class explained most microbial community variation, e. g., ECM fungi (80% explained) and soil bacteria (46%). Despite some differences, we could not identify statistically significant bacterial or ECM assemblages linked to stand productivity. Results may reflect a strong association between microbial processes and the dominant host, aspen. Aspen associated with widely distributed fungi common to all classes, possibly facilitating its survival and growth, including on sites exhibiting low pH and low soil fertility.","[Fox, Mark D.] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Les Forets, Quebec City, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Tackaberry, Linda E.; Bergeron, Yves; Massicotte, Hugues B.] Univ British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Coll Sci & Management, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Drouin, Pascal] Private Consultant, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Bradley, Robert] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Chen, Han Y.

Although multiple co-occurring stressors are present in many ecosystems, relatively little is understood as to how communities are shaped by interacting stressors at multiple scales. We use a regression design to test the effects of two environmental stress gradients, flooding and shade, as well as herbivore activity, mechanical damage, on first-year transplanted seedling survival and growth in twenty-one common garden plots in secondary Amazonian floodplain forests. Among ten woody species varying in flood and shade tolerance, half of the seedlings were clipped at 5 cm aboveground, removing; similar to 50% of plant biomass. Damage reduced seedling survival by; similar to 50% and aboveground biomass by 94% of undamaged seedlings. Despite declines in relative growth rates with increasing flood duration, the survival of most flood-tolerant species was unaffected by variation in prolonged submergence of 3-6 months. Meanwhile, low-flood-tolerant species displayed clear thresholds in survival of flood duration <150d. The effects of all three stressors were largely independent, with the exception of two species whereby light availability interacted with flood duration to enhance seedling survival during prolonged floods and one species whereby flood duration interacted with damage. Trade-offs in stress tolerance among species were not apparent. Rather, damage, shade, and flood tolerance among species were all positively correlated, suggesting that combined stresses favor the persistence of a few highly stress-tolerant species-characterized by slow growth rates, high root: shoot ratios, and short stems-in this disturbed ecosystem. This study highlights the importance of dry season stressors (e. g., light availability, herbivore activity, and drought) as strong selective forces for the establishment and persistence of tropical floodplain communities. Furthermore, in an ecosystem where relatively little is known as to how seedlings persist in forest understories, we demonstrate how biotic and abiotic stressors ultimately shape woody species composition and richness.","[Lucas, Christine M.; Bruna, Emilio M.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bruna, Emilio M.] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Nascimento, Cristiane M.

However, root water uptake by plants and the soil water flux are interrelated. Thus, the simultaneous estimation of root water uptake parameters and soil hydraulic parameters from macroscopic state observations is a challenge. In this study we investigated the possibility of simultaneously estimating root water uptake and soil hydraulic parameters by inverse simulation of soil water flow in monolithic lysimeters under atmospheric boundary conditions. We used the Richards equation and a macroscopic root water uptake model to simulate the processes. The amount of information needed for the unique identification of parameters was analyzed and the magnitude of their uncertainties was investigated. To check the principal feasibility of our approach, we first examined synthetic data sets for different scenarios and instrumentation campaigns that differed in their information content and complexity of soil properties. The investigations of synthetic data showed that for homogeneous profiles, cumulative outflow and profile-averaged water content data contained enough system information to allow the simultaneous estimation of soil hydraulic properties and root-distribution parameters. In contrast, for soil profiles consisting of two layers, unique soil hydraulic parameters and the correct rooting depth could only be estimated if matric potential measurements from both layers were included in the objective function. To test the procedure with real data, soil hydraulic properties of the grass-reference lysimeter at Wagna (Austria) were estimated using actual measurements. Water dynamics in the lysimeter could be described well by an effective parameterization assuming a homogeneous soil profile. Furthermore, the system behavior under different boundary conditions could be predicted adequately with the estimated parameters. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AMF mitochondrial (mt) genomes are homogeneous within isolates, and their intergenic regions harbor numerous mobile elements that have rapidly diverged, including homing endonuclease genes, small inverted repeats, and plasmid-related DNA polymerase genes (dpo), making them suitable targets for the development of reliable strain-specific markers. However, these elements may also lead to genome rearrangements through homologous recombination, although this has never previously been reported in this group of obligate symbiotic fungi. To investigate whether such rearrangements are present and caused by mobile elements in AMF, the mitochondrial genomes from two Glomeraceae members (i.e., Glomus cerebriforme and Glomus sp.) with substantial mtDNA synteny divergence, were sequenced and compared with available glomeromycotan mitochondrial genomes. We used an extensive nucleotide/protein similarity network-based approach to investigate dpo diversity in AMF as well as in other organisms for which sequences are publicly available. We provide strong evidence of dpo-induced inter-haplotype recombination, leading to a reshuffled mitochondrial genome in Glomus sp. These findings raise questions as to whether AMF single spore cultivations artificially underestimate mtDNA genetic diversity. We assessed potential dpo dispersal mechanisms in AMF and inferred a robust phylogenetic relationship with plant mitochondrial plasmids. Along with other indirect evidence, our analyses indicate that members of the Glomeromycota phylum are potential donors of mitochondrial plasmids to plants.","[Beaudet, Denis; Terraty, Yves; Halary, Sebastien; de la Providencia, Ivan Enrique; Hijri, Mohamed] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Beaudet, D (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, CP 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",denis.beaudet@umontreal.ca; mohamed.hijri@umontreal.ca,,"Hijri, Mohamed/0000-0001-6112-8372",NSERC Cooperative Research and Development grant [RDCPJ 395241-09]; Premier Tech; CRIBIQ,"The authors thank Biopterre centre du developpement des bioproduits and CRBM.

In a number of studies using single tree species, fine root biomass has been shown to be strongly increased by elevated CO2. However, natural forests are often intimate mixtures of a number of co-occurring species. To investigate the interaction between tree mixture and elevated CO2, Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula and Fagus sylvatica were planted in areas of single species and a three species polyculture in a free-air CO2 enrichment study (BangorFACE). The trees were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 (580 mu mol mol(-1)) for 4 years. Fine and coarse root biomass, together with fine root turnover and fine root morphological characteristics were measured. Fine root biomass and morphology responded differentially to the elevated CO2 at different soil depths in the three species when grown in monocultures. In polyculture, a greater response to elevated CO2 was observed in coarse roots to a depth of 20 cm, and fine root area index to a depth of 30 cm. Total fine root biomass was positively affected by elevated CO2 at the end of the experiment, but not by species diversity. Our data suggest that existing biogeochemical cycling models parameterized with data from species grown in monoculture may be underestimating the belowground response to global change.","[Smith, Andrew R.; Bambrick, Michael] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Smith, Andrew R.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Lukac, Martin] Environm Ctr Wales, Ctr Ecol Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Miglietta, Franco] Natl Res Council IBIMET CNR, Inst Biometeorol, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Miglietta, Franco] Fdn E Mach, FoxLab, I-38010 San Michele A Adige, TN, Italy; [Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Bodenkultur BOKU, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Smith, AR (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",a.r.smith@ceh.ac.uk,"Lukac, Martin/A-4379-2013; Smith, Andy R/A-7512-2011; Miglietta, Franco/B-6137-2008","Lukac, Martin/0000-0002-8535-6334; Smith, Andy R/0000-0001-8580-278X; Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143",SRIF; Aberystwyth and Bangor Universities Partnership Centre for Integrated Research in the Rural Environment; Forestry Commission Wales; Sir Williams Roberts PhD Scholarship match; Drapers' Company; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021],The development of BangorFACE site infrastructure was funded by SRIF.

An understanding of the microbial ecology controlling nitrogen, carbon and sulfur cycles in constructed wetlands has been identified as the greatest gap for optimizing performance of these promising treatment systems. It is suspected that operational factors such as plant types and hydraulic operation influence the subsurface wetland environment, especially redox, and that the observed variation in effluent quality is due to shifts in the microbial populations and/or their activity. This study investigated the biofilm associated sulfate reducing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (using the dsrB and amoA genes, respectively) by examining a variety of surfaces within a model wetland (gravel, thick roots, fine roots, effluent), and the changes in activity (gene abundance) of these functional groups as influenced by plant species and season. Molecular techniques were used including quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), both with and without propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. PMA treatment is a method for excluding from further analysis those cells with compromised membranes. Rigorous statistical analysis showed an interaction between the abundance of these two functional groups with the type of plant and season (p < 0.05). The richness of the sulfate reducing bacterial community, as indicated by DGGE profiles, increased in planted vs. unplanted microcosms. For ammonia oxidizing bacteria, season had the greatest impact on gene abundance and diversity (higher in summer than in winter). Overall, the primary influence of plant presence is believed to be related to root oxygen loss and its effect on rhizosphere redox.","[Faulwetter, Jennifer L.; Burr, Mark D.; Parker, Albert E.; Stein, Otto R.; Camper, Anne K.] Montana State Univ, Ctr Biofilm Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Stein, Otto R.; Camper, Anne K.] Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Camper, AK (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Ctr Biofilm Engn, 366 EPS, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",anne_c@erc.montana.edu,,,USDA-NRI Competitive Grants Program [2004-35102-14832]; Montana Board of Research and Commercialization Technology (MBRCT) [09-26]; Society of Wetland Scientists through the Student Research Grant Program,"This study was supported by: USDA-NRI Competitive Grants Program, Award 2004-35102-14832, the Montana Board of Research and Commercialization Technology (MBRCT), Grant Agreement #09-26, and the Society of Wetland Scientists through the Student Research Grant Program.

Disruptions to these associations consequently can have significant impacts on native plant communities. We examined how invasion by Vincetoxicum rossicum, a plant native to Europe, can alter both the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, as well as the general fungal communities associating with native plant roots in both field and woodland sites in Southern Ontario. In two different sites in the Greater Toronto Area, we took advantage of invasion by V. rossicum and neighbouring uninvaded sites to investigate the fungal communities associating with local plant roots, including goldenrod (Solidago spp.), wild red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), Canada anemone (Anemone canadensis), meadow rue (Thalictrum dioicum), and wild ginger (Asarum canadense). Fungi colonizing roots were characterized with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of amplified total fungal (TF) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) ribosomal fragments. We saw a significant effect of the presence of this invader on the diversity of TF phylotypes colonizing native plant roots, and a composition shift of both the TF and AMF community in native roots in both sites. In native communities invaded by V. rossicum, a significant increase in richness and colonization density of TF suggests that invaders such as V. rossicum may be able to influence the composition of soil fungi available to natives, possibly via mechanisms such as increased carbon provision or antibiosis attributable to unique root exudates.","[Bongard, Cindy L.; Fulthorpe, Roberta] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Butler, Ken] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Comp & Math Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada","Bongard, CL (reprint author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",bongard@utsc.utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank the Toronto Zoo for providing site access for plant collections, as well as two reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments.

This work aims to i) detect the effect of elevated CO2 on soil respiration during the second rotation of a short rotation forest, at two levels of N availability; and ii) identify the main drivers behind any changes in soil respiration. A poplar plantation (POP-EUROFACE) was grown for two rotations of 3 years under elevated CO2 maintained by a FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) technique. Root biomass, litter production and soil respiration were followed for two consecutive years after coppice. In the plantation, the stimulation of fine root and litter production under elevated CO2 observed at the beginning of the rotation declined over time. Soil respiration (SR) was continuously stimulated by elevated CO2, with a much larger enhancement during the growing (up to 111 %) than in the dormant season (40 %). The SR increase at first appeared to be due to the increase in fine root biomass, but at the end of the 2nd rotation was supported by litter decomposition and the availability of labile C. Soil respiration increase under elevated CO2 was not affected by N availability. The stimulation of SR by elevated CO2 was sustained by the decomposition of above and belowground litter and by the greater availability of easily decomposable substrates into the soil. In the final year as elevated CO2 did not increase C allocation to roots, the higher SR suggests greater C losses from the soil, thus reducing the potential for C accumulation.","[Lagomarsino, Alessandra] Res Ctr Agrobiol & Pedol CRA ABP, Agr Res Council, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Lukac, Martin] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Bodenkultur Wien, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Marinari, Sara; De Angelis, Paolo] Univ Tuscia, DIBAF Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy","Lagomarsino, A (reprint author), Res Ctr Agrobiol & Pedol CRA ABP, Agr Res Council, Piazza M DAzeglio 30, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",alessandra.lagomarsino@entecra.it,"De Angelis, Paolo/A-6863-2012; Lukac, Martin/A-4379-2013","De Angelis, Paolo/0000-0001-8310-8831; Lukac, Martin/0000-0002-8535-6334; Lagomarsino, Alessandra/0000-0003-3325-0084; Marinari, Sara/0000-0003-0187-8264",,,,50,4,8,2,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2013,362,2-Jan,,,,,93,106,,10.1007/s11104-012-1261-0,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,059TW,WOS:000312729400008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Brunner, I; Bakker, MR; Bjork, RG; Hirano, Y; Lukac, M; Aranda, X; Borja, I; Eldhuset, TD; Helmisaari, HS; Jourdan, C; Konopka, B; Lopez, BC; Perez, CM; Persson, H; Ostonen, I",,,,"Brunner, I.; Bakker, M.

In this study we aimed to calculate root turnover rates of common European forest tree species and to compare them with most frequently published values. We compiled available European data and applied various turnover rate calculation methods to the resulting database. We used Decision Matrix and Maximum-Minimum formula as suggested in the literature. Mean turnover rates obtained by the combination of sequential coring and Decision Matrix were 0.86 yr(-1) for Fagus sylvatica and 0.88 yr(-1) for Picea abies when maximum biomass data were used for the calculation, and 1.11 yr(-1) for both species when mean biomass data were used. Using mean biomass rather than maximum resulted in about 30 % higher values of root turnover. Using the Decision Matrix to calculate turnover rate doubled the rates when compared to the Maximum-Minimum formula. The Decision Matrix, however, makes use of more input information than the Maximum-Minimum formula. We propose that calculations using the Decision Matrix with mean biomass give the most reliable estimates of root turnover rates in European forests and should preferentially be used in models and C reporting.","[Brunner, I.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Bakker, M.

The results of fine root analysis showed that the fine roots of both black locust and velvet ash were mainly distributed in the soil layer at 0-20 cm depth and 50-150 cm from trees. The fine root distribution of both species suggests a strategy of avoiding salinity rather than salt-tolerance. The horizontal spread distance of fine roots of velvet ash was evidently longer than that of black locust. The fine root biomass, specific root length, specific root area, specific root volume and root activity were significantly higher for velvet ash in comparison with black locust. The results of soil analysis showed that rhizosphere soil pH of black locust and velvet ash were significantly lower compared with non-rhizosphere soil. The available N content in rhizosphere soil of black locust was higher than that of velvet ash. However, the contents of soluble salt, organic matter, available P and available K in rhizosphere soil of velvet ash were higher than those of black locust.

The cypress and pine plantations were about 30-years-old and eucalyptus plantations about 50-years-old. Biomass C densities were estimated from breast height diameter and wood density using allometric functions developed for tropical species and an assumed C content of 50%. Belowground biomass C densities were estimated using root: shoot biomass ratios. Soil organic C (SOC) densities were calculated from measured organic carbon contents (0-20 and 20-50 cm layers) and modelled bulk density values. Mean total biomass C and SOC densities for indigenous forest were greater than those of the plantations, and the difference was significant (p<0.05) in the cases of cypress and pine biomass and pine SOC. The correlation between biomass C and SOC densities was nearly significant in the case of indigenous forest, but negative. Biomass C densities were not significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature or potential evapotranspiration, but pine biomass C densities were significantly correlated to actual evapotranspiration. SOC densities were more strongly correlated to mean annual precipitation than biomass C densities, but only significantly so in the case of pine. Neither biomass C nor SOC densities were correlated to plant available water capacity of the soil. Indigenous forest SOC densities were significantly correlated to soil clay contents, but negatively. Indigenous forests sequester more C in biomass and soil than do 30 to 50-year-old plantations of exotics, but it remains unclear if this is an intrinsic difference between indigenous forest and plantations of exotics or because of insufficient time for SOC levels in plantations to recover after clearance of original indigenous forest.","[Omoro, Loice M.

Our field experiments with mature trees demonstrate intensification of this weathering engine as tree lineages diversified in concert with their symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. Preferential hyphal colonization of the calcium silicate-bearing rock, basalt, progressively increased with advancement from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) to later, independently evolved ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, and from gymnosperm to angiosperm hosts with both fungal groups. This led to 'trenching' of silicate mineral surfaces by AM and EM fungi, with EM gymnosperms and angiosperms releasing calcium from basalt at twice the rate of AM gymnosperms. Our findings indicate mycorrhiza-driven weathering may have originated hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously recognized and subsequently intensified with the evolution of trees and mycorrhizas to affect the Earth's long-term CO2 and climate history.","[Quirk, Joe; Beerling, David J.; Leake, Jonathan R.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Banwart, Steve A.; Kakonyi, Gabriella; Romero-Gonzalez, Maria E.] Univ Sheffield, Kroto Res Inst, Sheffield S3 7HQ, S Yorkshire, England","Quirk, J (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.quirk@sheffield.ac.uk,"Quirk, Joe/R-7942-2017; Banwart, Steven/B-3915-2016; Beerling, David J/C-2840-2009","Quirk, Joe/0000-0002-0625-8323; Banwart, Steven/0000-0001-7223-6678; Beerling, David J/0000-0003-1869-4314; Leake, Jonathan/0000-0001-8364-7616; Romero-Gonzalez, Maria/0000-0001-5808-5383","NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E015190/1]; NERC/World Universities Network Weathering Consortium award [NE/C521001/1]; University of Sheffield; Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit AwardRoyal Society of London; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C521044/1, NE/E015190/1, NE/C521001/1, NE/C004566/1]","We thank Simon Toomer for permission to use Westonbirt Arboretum, and CEMEX UK Materials Ltd for providing pink Shap granite.

As they arrive at new sites, migrant plant species may be released from their natural soil pathogens and/or deprived of key symbiotic organisms. Under such scenarios plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) will likely have an impact on plant species' ability to establish in new areas. In this study we evaluated the role that PSF may play on the migratory potential of dominant temperate tree species at the northern limit of their distributional range in the Great Lakes region of North America. To test their ability to expand their current range, we assessed seedling establishment, i.e., survival, of local and potential migrant tree species in a field transplant experiment. To test for the presence and strength of PSF, we also assessed seedling survival during establishment in a greenhouse experiment, where the potential migrant species were grown in soils collected within and beyond their distributional ranges. The combination of experiments provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the role of PSF in seedling establishment in new areas. In the field, we found that survival for most migrant species was similar to those of the local community, ensuring that these species could establish in areas beyond their current range. In the greenhouse, we found that the majority of species experienced strong negative conspecific feedbacks mediated by soil biota, but these responses occurred for most species only in low light conditions. Lastly, our combined results indicate that migrant tree species can colonize and may even have enhanced short-term recruitment beyond their ranges due to a lack of conspecific adults (and the resulting negative PSF from these adults).","[McCarthy-Neumann, Sarah; Ibanez, Ines] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","McCarthy-Neumann, S (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sneumann@msu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-EAGER 0947783]; USDA McIntire-Stennis Program [USDA MICY000706],"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers, Kurt Reinhart, and the PEDG and GCEL groups for helpful comments on the manuscript.

We examined the soil legacy of Cytisus scoparius, a nitrogen-fixing, putatively allelopathic shrub invading the western US. We tested the hypothesis that allelopathy plays a critical role in the depressive effect of Cytisus on the key native Douglas-fir, both directly on tree growth and indirectly via effects on its ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). In a greenhouse factorial experiment, we used activated carbon to inhibit Cytisus-produced allelochemicals and sucrose to reduce elevated nitrogen (N). We found that: (1) Cytisus-invaded soils depressed Douglas-fir growth compared to uninvaded forest soils. The effect of adding Cytisus litter was positive (possibly reflecting an N fertilization effect) only in the presence of activated carbon, providing evidence for a role of allelopathic compounds. Activated carbon did not increase growth in the absence of Cytisus litter. Finally, sucrose addition provided weak support for a nitrogen effect of Cytisus litter. (2) Seedlings grown in Cytisus soils had lower EMF abundance compared to those in uninvaded forest soils. In forest soil from one site, adding Cytisus litter also decreased EMF abundance. Douglas-fir growth increased significantly with EMF across sites and soils suggesting that changes in EMF were linked to tree growth. The fungal taxon Cenococcum geophilum was significantly depressed in Cytisus soils compared to forest soils, while Rhizopogon rogersii abundance was similar across soil types. These results together suggest an overall negative effect of Cytisus on the growth of a dominant native tree and its fungal symbionts. Our study suggests how the role of allelopathy in ecological restoration may play out on two time scales: through immediate, direct impacts on native plants as well as through long-term, persistent impacts mediated by the collapse or transformation of microbial communities.","[Grove, Sara; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Haubensak, Karen A.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Grove, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",sgrove@ucsc.edu,,,Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense; Nature Conservancy; Jean H.

However, it has also been noticed that these pioneer species may sometimes have an encroaching effect and arrest succession for several decades. We investigated in this study whether allelopathy can play a role in limiting seedling establishment of co-occurring tree species under the canopy of Acacia pennatula by means of lab bioassays and field experiments in north-west Nicaragua. Leaf extracts of A. pennatula did not affect seed germination but reduced the general growth and especially the development of the root compartment in seedlings, shifting their biomass allocation model to a reduced root/shoot ratio. Survival of planted seedlings under the canopy of A. pennatula was about 20-30% lower than outside, and this reduction was particularly pronounced as the dry season progressed, despite the milder conditions (e.g. higher soil moisture) being experienced in the inner positions under the canopy. Altogether, our results suggest that, rather than facilitating, A. pennatula may inhibit the establishment of seedlings under its canopy probably by means of an allelopathic interference in the development of the root system with critical negative consequences for young seedlings in terms of overcoming the dry season. This article warns about overemphasizing the nucleation effect that remnant and isolated trees may have to facilitate secondary succession in these highly disturbed savannah-like tropical dry forests.","[Peguero, Guille; Espelta, Josep M.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Lanuza, Oscar R.] Natl Autonomous Univ Nicaragua Managua, Reg Multidisciplinary Fac FAREM, Abril, Esteli, Nicaragua; [Save, Robert] IRTA, Torre Marimon 08140, Caldes De Montb, Spain","Peguero, G (reprint author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",guille.peguero@creaf.uab.es; rafa.artesano@gmail.com; robert.save@irta.cat; josep.espelta@uab.cat,"Espelta, Josep M/I-3891-2016; Peguero, Guille/B-9362-2014","Espelta, Josep M/0000-0002-0242-4988; Peguero, Guille/0000-0002-6464-1486",Spanish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (AECID) [D/026276/09]; FI Grant from the Generalitat de Catalunya,"The authors wish to thank Jasser Antonio Obando Arteaga for his valuable field and lab assistance, and the two anonymous reviewers for their providing valuable comments.

Rhizopogon vesiculosus and Rhizopogon vinicolor (Basidiomycota) are morphologically and genetically related species. They are dominant members of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) EMF communities, but mechanisms leading to their coexistence are unknown. We investigated the microsite associations and foraging strategy of individual R. vesiculosus and R. vinicolor genets. Mycelia spatial patterns, pervasiveness and root colonization patterns of fungal genets were compared between Rhizopogon species and between xeric and mesic soil moisture regimes. Rhizopogon spp. mycelia were systematically excavated from the soil and identified using microsatellite DNA markers. Rhizopogon vesiculosus mycelia occurred at greater depth, were more spatially pervasive, and colonized more tree roots than R. vinicolor mycelia. Both species were frequently encountered in organic layers and between the interface of organic and mineral horizons. They were particularly abundant within microsites associated with soil moisture retention. The occurrence of R. vesiculosus shifted in the presence of R. vinicolor towards mineral soil horizons, where R. vinicolor was mostly absent. This suggests that competition and foraging strategy may contribute towards the vertical partitioning observed between these species. Rhizopogon vesiculosus and R. vinicolor mycelia systems occurred at greater mean depths and were more pervasive in mesic plots compared with xeric plots. The spatial continuity and number of trees colonized by genets of each species did not significantly differ between soil moisture regimes.","[Beiler, Kevin J.; Simard, Suzanne W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Beiler, Kevin J.; Durall, Daniel M.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Lemay, Valerie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Beiler, KJ (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",kevin.beiler@gmail.com,"LeMay, Valerie/V-7731-2019",,Forest Investment Account - Forest Science Program from the B.C.

While uninoculated control plants showed no colonization, the percentage of ECM colonization of root tips attained 35% with P. tinctorius and about 86% with the other three ECM species. Similar to ECM root colonization, the photosynthetic as well as the root-respiration rates were higher in seedlings with S. citrinum, L. amethystea, and A. hygrometricus than that in the control and those with P. tinctorius. Both the photosynthetic and root-respiration rates were positively correlated with ECM-fungal colonization. Similar trends were observed for the N concentration, specific leaf area, and specific root length, which differed significantly among ECM-fungal species and were related with ECM-fungal colonization. The results suggest that both physiological and morphological traits are specific to ECM-fungal species. As Q. serrata seedlings with high colonization can exhibit better resource-acquisition ability, the identification of strongly colonizing ECM-fungal species is essential. Comparisons with high- and low-colonizing ECM-fungal species improve our understanding of sourcesink relationships in carbon allocation of forest tree species.","[Makita, Naoki; Kosugi, Yoshiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yamanaka, Takashi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Yoshimura, Kenichi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Makita, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",makita701@gmail.com,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014; Demartini, Gianluca/G-4635-2012","Demartini, Gianluca/0000-0002-7311-3693","Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sports, and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [(DC1) 22-2100]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery [1904]","The authors sincerely thank Dr. Yosuke Matsuda of Mie University for valuable and helpful comments on the draft of this manuscript.

To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits. The results of this study demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific symbiotic interactions varies with partner identity such that the effects of simultaneous symbioses can not be generalized.","[Larimer, Anna L.; Bever, James D.; Clay, Keith] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Larimer, AL (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Jordan Hall,1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",allarime@indiana.edu,,,Indiana Academy of Sciences,"We thank members of the Bever-Schultz and Clay lab groups for helpful discussions and comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

We measured leaf water potential (I-L), osmotic potential, tissue elasticity, stem hydraulic characteristics, and stomatal conductance (g (S)) across species throughout the year, and assessed tissue damage by subzero temperatures during winter. Species behavior was highly dependent on rooting depth. Substantial osmotic adjustment (up to 1.2 MPa) was observed in deep-rooted species exhibiting relatively small seasonal variations in I-L and with access to a more stable water source, but having a large difference between predawn and midday I-L. On the other hand, shallow-rooted species exposed to large seasonal changes in I-L showed limited osmotic adjustment and incomplete stomatal closure, resulting in turgor loss during periods of drought. The bulk leaf tissue elastic modulus (epsilon) was lower in species with relatively shallow roots. Daily variation in g (S) was larger in shallow-rooted species (more than 50 % of its maximum) and was negatively associated with the difference between I-L at the turgor loss point and minimum I-L (safety margin for turgor maintenance). All species increased epsilon by about 10 MPa during winter. Species with rigid tissue walls exhibited low leaf tissue damage at -20 A degrees C. Our results suggest that osmotic adjustment was the main water relationship adaptation to cope with drought during summer and spring, particularly in deep-rooted plants, and that adjustments in cell wall rigidity during the winter helped to enhance freezing tolerance.","[Scholz, Fabian G.; Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia; Goldstein, Guillermo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Scholz, Fabian G.; Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Fac Ciencias Nat, GEBEF, Dept Biol, Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Meinzer, Frederick C.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Forestry Sci Lab, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Buenos Aires, FCEyN, LEF, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Scholz, FG (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",fgscholz@yahoo.com,"Meinzer, Frederick/C-3496-2012; Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019","Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031; Bucci, Sandra Janet/0000-0003-1079-9277",CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 112-200801-01703],This study was supported by CONICET grant (PIP 112-200801-01703).

We investigated the root growth dynamics of two Banksia species accessing a seasonally dynamic water table and hypothesized that root growth phenology varied with depth, i.e. root growth closest to the water table would be influenced by water table dynamics rather than surface micro-climate. Root in-growth bags were used to observe the dynamics of root growth at different soil depths and above-ground growth was also assessed to identify whole-plant growth phenology. Root growth at shallow depths was found to be in synchrony with above-ground growth phenophases, following increases in ambient temperature and soil water content. In contrast, root growth at depth was either constant or suppressed by saturation. Root growth above the water table and within the capillary fringe occurred in all seasons, corresponding with consistent water availability and aerobic conditions. However, at the water table, a seasonal cycle of root elongation with drawdown in summer followed by trimming in response to water table rise and saturation in winter, was observed. The ability to grow roots year-round at the capillary fringe and redistribute fine root biomass in response to groundwater drawdown is considered critical in allowing phreatophytes, in seasonally water-limited environments, to maintain access to groundwater throughout the year.","[Canham, Caroline A.; Froend, Raymond H.; Stock, William D.; Davies, Muriel] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Management, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia","Froend, RH (reprint author), Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Management, 270 Joondalup Dr, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia.",r.froend@ecu.edu.au,"Davies, Muriel/D-7321-2013; Stock, William/B-8858-2008","Stock, William/0000-0003-2475-2963",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0669240]; Water Corporation of Western Australia; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government,This research was conducted under an Australian Postgraduate Award associated with Australian Research Council Linkage Project LP0669240.

We tested the hypothesis that these ecological differences were reflected in higher nitrogen (N) use efficiency in HA than in BC and that HA would allocate more resources belowground than BC in the presence of high and low N availability. We expected that responses of wood properties to elevated N would be more pronounced in the species with higher wood formation in response to N supply. HA showed higher belowground biomass partitioning than BC in the presence of low (0.2 mM) and high (2 mM) N supply, but in contrast to our expectation whole-plant nitrogen use efficiency and the stem carbon-to-nitrogen balance were lower than in BC. In response to elevated N, HA exhibited stronger stimulation of biomass production than BC, especially of the stem, which showed significant increases in biomass and volume but decreases in density. Lignification, especially the production of guaiacyl (G)-compared to syringyl (S)-lignin, was delayed in HA compared with BC wood. Since G lignin leads to stronger crosslinking than S lignin, its delayed formation may have enabled stronger expansion and higher volume increment of HA than of BC stems. Our results suggest that BC, a poplar species adapted to fluctuating N supply, is less responsive to differences in N availability than aspen that occurs in low N environments.","[Euring, Dejuan; Polle, Andrea] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Abt Forstbot & Baumphysiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Loefke, Christian; Teichmann, Thomas] Univ Gottingen, Abt Zellbiol Pflanze, Albrecht von Haller Inst Pflanzenwissensch, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Polle, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Abt Forstbot & Baumphysiol, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",apolle@gwdg.de,,"Polle, Andrea/0000-0001-8697-6394; Lofke, Christian/0000-0001-9580-6530","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Fachagentur fur nachwachsende Rohstoffe (BMVEL, Germany) [FKZ 22004105]; BMBF (project BEST, Nachhaltige Landnutzung); European Commission within the Seventh Framework Program for Research, Project Energypoplar [FP7-211917]","We are grateful to the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for a PhD scholarship to D.

However, these negative effects have been found in studies that applied relatively high levels of N, whereas the responses to ambient atmospheric N deposition rates are still not clear. Here, we compared an unfertilized control boreal forest with a fertilized forest (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and a forest subject to N-deposition rates comparable to those in Central Europe (20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) to investigate the effects of N addition rate on different components of forest floor respiration and the production of ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarps. Soil collars were used to partition heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic (R-a) respiration, which was further separated into respiration by tree roots (R-tr) and mycorrhizal hyphae (R-m). Total forest floor respiration was twice as high in the low N plot compared to the control, whereas there were no differences between the control and high N plot. There were no differences in R-h respiration among plots. The enhanced forest floor respiration in the low N plot was, therefore, the result of increased R-a respiration, with an increase in R-tr respiration, and a doubling of R-m respiration. The latter was corroborated by a slightly greater ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal sporocarp production in the low N plot as compared to the control plot. In contrast, EM fungal sporocarp production was nearly eliminated, and R-m respiration severely reduced, in the high N plot, which resulted in significantly lower R-a respiration. We thus found a nonlinear response of the R-a components to N addition rate, which calls for further studies of the quantitative relations among N addition rate, plant photosynthesis and carbon allocation, and the function of EM fungi.","[Hasselquist, Niles J.; Metcalfe, Daniel B.; Hogberg, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hasselquist, NJ (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",niles.hasselquist@slu.se,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719",research council VRSwedish Research Council; research council FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; MISTRA foundation; Kempe foundation,"We are grateful to Richard Lucas, Axel Hogberg, and Benjamin Eisele for assistance in the field and Kjell Olofsson for help with fungal sporocarp identification.

Location Pair-wise greenhouse experiment based on field data from a semi-natural grassland community in the Swiss Jura Mountains (Col du Marchairuz, Switzerland). Methods The dominance hierarchy from a mountain wood-pasture ecosystem was used to identify five dominant and three subordinate species. These species were grown in pair-wise combinations under full competition and in the absence of root competition, enabling us to calculate indices of competitive effect and response and overall asymmetry. Results Root competition exclusion led to a decrease in the competitive abilities of dominants, whereas subordinates became overall more competitive. Total asymmetry also decreased, indicating reduced competition between the two species groups. The exclusion of root competition increased both below-ground and above-ground growth of subordinates, whereas for dominants below-ground growth was unaffected and above-ground growth decreased. Conclusions We demonstrate that root competition through rootshoot competition interactions is an important factor driving the competitive dominance of species and the structure of grazed grassland communities. Locally, reduction of root competition involved in gap creation might explain persistence of subordinate species within the vegetation community and lead to an aggregated spatial pattern of subordinates involved in species co-existence in grasslands.","[Mariotte, P.; Buttler, A.; Thebault, A.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mariotte, P.; Buttler, A.; Vandenberghe, C.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Buttler, A.] Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci & Tech, UMR CNRS 6249, Lab Chronoenvironm, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Johnson, D.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Mariotte, P (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",pierre.mariotte@epfl.ch; alexandre.buttler@epfl.ch; d.johnson@abdn.ac.uk; aurelie.thebault@epfl.ch; charlotte.vandenberghe@epfl.ch,"Mariotte, Pierre/G-4798-2011; Buttler, Alexandre AB/K-1137-2012; Johnson, David/N-3193-2013","Mariotte, Pierre/0000-0001-8570-8742; Johnson, David/0000-0002-6724-1648; Johnson, David/0000-0003-2299-2525",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A-114139],"We thank PRIMPLANTS SA for the greenhouse facilities.

The overarching aim of this study was to investigate top-down control processes of PPN in these natural ecosystems through comparative analyses of the diversity and dynamics of PPN and their microbial enemies. Our specific aims were, first, to identify and quantify PPN microbial enemies in European sand dunes; second, to assess their life history traits, their spatial and temporal variation in these ecosystems, and third, to evaluate their control potential of PPN populations. This was done by seasonal sampling of a range of sites and making observations on both the nematode and the microbial enemy communities in rhizosphere sand. Nine different nematode microbial enemies belonging to different functional groups were detected in European sand dunes. Their high diversity in these low productivity ecosystems could both result from or lead to the lack of dominance of a particular nematode genus. The distribution of microbial enemies was spatially and temporally variable, both among and within sampling sites. Obligate parasites, either with low host-specificity or having the ability to form an environmentally resistant propagule, are favoured in these ecosystems and are more frequent and abundant than facultative parasites. Three microbial enemies correlated, either positively or negatively, with PPN population size: Catenaria spp., Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Pasteuria penetrans. Microbial-enemy supported links in the food-web may be involved in the control of PPN populations through indirect effects. The endospore-forming P. penetrans was the most successful top-down control agent, and was implicated in the direct control of Meloidogyne spp. and indirect facilitation of Pratylenchus spp. Overall, our findings suggest strong and diverse top-down control effects on the nematode community in these natural ecosystems.","[Costa, Sofia R.; Kerry, Brian R.; Davies, Keith G.] Rothamsted Res, Plant Pathol & Microbiol Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Costa, Sofia R.; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Costa, SR (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Dept Life Sci, POB 3046, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",sofia.costa@ci.uc.pt,"Costa, Sofia R/E-8028-2017","Costa, Sofia R/0000-0003-0100-1518",Marie Curie European Research Training Network Ecotrain [HPRN-CT 2002-00210]; Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council of the UK,"The authors would like to thank Richard Webster, Rothamsted Research, UK, for advice on the statistical analyses.

Based on the well-known temperature response of respiration in plant tissue and microbes, R (s) is often assumed to increase in a warmer climate. Yet, we assume that substrate availability (labile C input) is the dominant influence on R (s) rather than temperature. We present an analysis of NPP components and concurrent R (s) in temperate deciduous forests across an elevational gradient in Switzerland corresponding to a 6 K difference in mean annual temperature and a considerable difference in the length of the growing season (174 vs. 262 days). The sum of the short-lived NPP fractions (""canopy leaf litter,"" ""understory litter,"" and ""fine root litter"") did not differ across this thermal gradient (+6 % from cold to warm sites, n.s.), irrespective of the fact that estimated annual forest wood production was more than twice as high at low compared to high elevations (largely explained by the length of the growing season). Cumulative annual R (s) did not differ significantly between elevations (836 +/- A 5 g C m(-2) a(-1) and 933 +/- A 40 g C m(-2) a(-1) at cold and warm sites, +12 %). Annual soil CO2 release thus largely reflected the input of labile C and not temperature, despite the fact that R (s) showed the well-known short-term temperature response within each site. However, at any given temperature, R (s) was lower at the warm sites (downregulation). These results caution against assuming strong positive effects of climatic warming on R (s), but support a close substrate relatedness of R (s).","[Caprez, Riccarda; Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Caprez, R (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",riccarda.caprez@unibas.ch,"Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; ",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (BAFU);  [COST-639],"We are grateful to Franz Conen for soil C and N analysis, Eva Spehn for comments on the manuscrift draft, Erika Hiltbrunner for practical advice (all from the University of Basel), and to several volunteers for field assistance.

The drought-stressed seedlings demonstrated a decrease in hydraulic conductance and root surface area and increased WUE and root tip number. The relationships among the growth, morphological, anatomical and physiological traits changed with the scale of study: within the species, among/within populations. The populations showed a highly significant relationship between the percentage reduction in whole-plant hydraulic conductance and WUE. The differences among the populations in root morphology, whole-plant conductance, carbon allocation, plant growth and WUE were significant and consistent with dryness of the site of seed origin. The xeric populations exhibited lower growth and a conservative water use, as opposed to the fast-growing, less water-use-efficient populations from mesic habitats. The xeric and mesic populations, Tamrabta and San Cipriano, respectively, showed the most contrasting traits and were clustered in opposite directions along the main axis in the canonical discriminant analysis under both the control and drought treatments. The results suggest the possibility of selecting the Arenas population, which presents a combination of traits that confer increased growth and drought resistance.","[Corcuera, Leyre; Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio; Notivol, Eduardo] Govt Aragon, Forest Resources Unit, Res & Technol Agr Ctr CITA, Zaragoza 50059, Spain","Corcuera, L (reprint author), Govt Aragon, Forest Resources Unit, Res & Technol Agr Ctr CITA, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",lcorcuera@aragon.es,"Notivol, Eduardo/D-3045-2011; Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/M-5129-2014","Notivol, Eduardo/0000-0003-4272-4536; Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/0000-0002-4053-6681","Spanish INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria) [RTA2005-00131-00-00]; MCI (Ministeriode Ciencia e Innovacion)Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN) [AGL-2010-21153-CO2-02]",This research was sponsored by the Spanish INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria) project RTA2005-00131-00-00 and MCI (Ministeriode Ciencia e Innovacion) project AGL-2010-21153-CO2-02.,,55,22,22,0,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2012,32,12,,,,,1442,1457,,10.1093/treephys/tps103,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,058NN,WOS:000312640900003,23148035,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Krause, K; Cherubini, P; Bugmann, H; Schleppi, P",,,,"Krause, Kim; Cherubini, Paolo; Bugmann, Harald; Schleppi, Patrick",,,"Growth enhancement of Picea abies trees under long-term, low-dose N addition is due to morphological more than to physiological changes",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,basal area increment; carbon isotope; leaf area dynamics; long-term nitrogen addition; nitrogen deposition; Norway spruce; oxygen isotope; tree rings,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; INCREASED NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FOREST ECOSYSTEM; DOUGLAS-FIR; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; STABLE-ISOTOPES; TEMPERATE,"Human activities have drastically increased nitrogen (N) inputs into natural and near-natural terrestrial ecosystems such that critical loads are now being exceeded in many regions of the world. This implies that these ecosystems are shifting from natural N limitation to eutrophication or even N saturation. This process is expected to modify the growth of forests and thus, along with management, to affect their carbon (C) sequestration. However, knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying tree response to N inputs, especially in the long term, is still lacking. In this study, we used tree-ring patterns and a dual stable isotope approach (delta C-13 and delta O-18) to investigate tree growth responses and the underlying physiological reactions in a long-term, low-dose N addition experiment (+23 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)). This experiment has been conducted for 14 years in a mountain Picea abies (L.) Karst. forest in Alptal, Switzerland, using a paired-catchment design. Tree stem C sequestration increased by similar to 22%, with an N use efficiency (NUE) of ca. 8 kg additional C in tree stems per kg of N added. Neither earlywood nor latewood delta C-13 values changed significantly compared with the control, indicating that the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) (A/g(s)) did not change due to N addition. Further, the isotopic signal of delta O-18 in early- and latewood showed no significant response to the treatment, indicating that neither stomatal conductance nor leaf-level photosynthesis changed significantly. Foliar analyses showed that needle N concentration significantly increased in the fourth to seventh treatment year, accompanied by increased dry mass and area per needle, and by increased tree height growth. Later, N concentration and height growth returned to nearly background values, while dry mass and area per needle remained high. Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced stem growth caused by N addition is mainly due to an increased leaf area index (LAI). Higher LAI implies that more photosynthetically active radiation is absorbed and therefore canopy-level photosynthesis is increased. We conclude that models assuming that N deposition increases tree growth through higher leaf-level photosynthesis may be mechanistically inaccurate, at least in forest canopies that are not (yet) completely closed.","[Krause, Kim; Cherubini, Paolo; Schleppi, Patrick] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Krause, Kim; Bugmann, Harald] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Schleppi, P (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",patrick.schleppi@wsl.ch,"Schleppi, Patrick/E-6751-2011; Bugmann, Harald/A-1252-2008; Cherubini, Paolo/N-9702-2013","Schleppi, Patrick/0000-0002-3578-6563; Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X; Bugmann, Harald/0000-0003-4233-0094","Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research within the European COST Action FP 0601, Forest Management and the Water cycle (FORMAN) [C07.0119]","The present study was partly financed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research (grant C07.0119) within the European COST Action FP 0601, Forest Management and the Water cycle (FORMAN).",,94,12,14,2,112,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2012,32,12,,,,,1471,1481,,10.1093/treephys/tps109,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,058NN,WOS:000312640900005,23135740,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Whiteside, MD; Digman, MA; Gratton, E; Treseder, KK",,,,"Whiteside, Matthew D.; Digman, Michelle A.; Gratton, Enrico; Treseder, Kathleen K.",,,Organic nitrogen uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a boreal forest,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Boreal forest; Chitosan; Emission fingerprinting; Glycine; Organic nitrogen; Quantitative confocal microscopy; Quantum dots; Raster image correlation spectroscopy,QUANTUM DOTS; HYMENOSCYPHUS-ERICAE; PLANTS; NANOCRYSTALS; ECOSYSTEMS; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; ROOTS; MINERALIZATION; COLONIZATION,"The breakdown of organic nitrogen in soil is a potential rate-limiting step in nitrogen cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that might improve the ability of plants to compete for organic nitrogen products against other decomposer microbes. However, AM uptake of organic nitrogen, especially in natural systems, has traditionally been difficult to test. We developed a novel quantitative nanotechnological technique to determine in situ that organic nitrogen uptake by AM fungi can occur to a greater extent than has previously been assumed. Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Live roots provide C sources for microbial metabolism via exudation, allocation to fungal associates, sloughed-off cells, and secretions such as mucilage production, suggesting a coupling between the activity of roots and heterotrophs. We addressed the strength of root effects on the activity of microbes and exo-enzymes by removing live-root-C inputs to areas of soil with a trenching experiment. We examined the extent to which trenching affected metrics of soil heterotrophic activity (proteolytic enzyme activity, microbial respiration, potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and exo-enzyme activities) in a forest exposed to elevated atmospheric [CO2] and N fertilization, and used automated measurements of R-soil in trenched and un-trenched plots to estimate R-root and R-het components. Trenching decreased many metrics of heterotrophic activity and increased net N mineralization and nitrification, suggesting that the removal of root-C inputs reduced R-het by exacerbating microbial C limitation and stimulating waste-N excretion. This trenching effect was muted by N fertilization alone but not when N fertilization was combined with elevated CO2, consistent with known patterns of below-ground C allocation at this site. Live-root-C inputs to soils and heterotrophic activity are tightly coupled, so root severing techniques like trenching are not likely to achieve robust quantitative estimates of Rroot or R-het.

This association occurs on the roots of most plants, promoting improvements in plant growth and development and increasing tolerance and/or plant resistance to several adverse environmental agents. In addition, AMF can be a potential biological control agent of plant diseases. These fungi produce glomalin, a protein that plays a key role in soil stability and in the biostabilization, of contaminated soils. The different responses of plants to this symbiosis can be assigned to the functional diversity of AM, depending of the interaction between AMF, plants and environmental conditions. The establishment and functioning of AMs under stress conditions involves a complex process of recognition and development, accompanied by physiological, biochemical and molecular changes in both symbionts. In, addition, the mycorrhizal colonization of roots has a significant impact on the gene expression of several plants that encode proteins presumably involved in stress tolerance. In this context, since the AMF are essential for the establishment and adaptation of plants on disturbed sites, this review covers the molecular and physiological mechanisms of the AM association, responsible for this adaptation and greater stress tolerance of plants.","[Folli-Pereira, Muriel da Silva; Meira-Haddad, Lydice Sant'Anna; Soares Bazzolli, Denise Mara; Megumi Kasuya, Maria Catarina] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Folli-Pereira, MD (reprint author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",mfolli@gmail.com; lydicemeira@yahoo.com.br; dbazzolli@ufv.br; mkasuya@ufv.br,"Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/E-1123-2013","Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/0000-0002-9539-9370; Bazzolli, Denise Mara Soares/0000-0002-0371-6966",,,,147,11,11,3,134,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

However, little is known about how to apply this knowledge to vegetation management. Here, we examined if soil organisms may promote plant species of characteristic habitats, and suppress plant species of disturbed habitats. We classified nineteen fields into four types: characteristic and disturbed matgrass swards and successfully and unsuccessfully restored fields. We recorded the vegetation composition and measured biotic and abiotic soil characteristics of the sites. In a pot experiment, we mixed non-sterilized (with soil organisms) or sterilized (without soil organisms) soil inoculum from each field with a common sterilized background soil. We planted seedlings of characteristic matgrass species Antennaria dioica and Nardus stricta, of disturbance indicators Deschampsia flexuosa and Agrostis capillaris, or a combination of the four species. At harvest, we measured root and shoot dry mass of all plants. The vegetation composition of characteristic matgrass swards differed from the disturbed and unsuccessfully restored fields. The successfully restored fields were intermediate. The composition of the nematode community tended to follow the same pattern. In the pot experiment, addition of soil organisms increased the biomass of A. dioica, N. stricta and D. flexuosa, but decreased the biomass of A. capillaris. However, the effect of soil organisms on plant biomass was not related to field type. A. dioica showed a large variation in biomass in non-sterilized, but not in sterilized soil. Soil organisms from some sites increased plant biomass, whereas soil organisms from other sites did not. The biomass of characteristic matgrass plants was lower in the presence of plants from disturbed swards, irrespective of the presence of soil organisms. Probably A. capillaris was so much larger than the other species, that this overruled effects of added soil organisms. Soil organisms promoted growth of plant species characteristic of matgrass swards, whereas they reduced growth of a plant species characteristic of disturbed fields. Soil organisms did not change the outcome of plant interactions, which was won by a disturbance indicator. Nevertheless, measurement of the growth stimulating capacity of a soil may be used to assess opportunities for reintroduction of characteristic plant species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Weighable lysimeters are powerful test systems for this purpose because the boundary fluxes (precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, and seepage across the bottom) can be determined very precisely. We analyzed the amount of information needed for the unique identification of parameters and investigated the magnitude of their uncertainties. First, we examined synthetic data sets for different scenarios and instrumentation campaigns that differed in their information content and complexity of soil properties. Atmospheric boundary conditions as measured at the lysimeter station in Wagna, Austria, were used as forcing data. The results show that for homogeneous profiles, cumulative outflow and profile-averaged water content data contain enough system information to allow the simultaneous estimation of soil hydraulic properties and root-distribution parameters. In contrast, for soil profiles consisting of two layers, unique soil hydraulic parameters and the correct rooting depth could only be estimated if matric potential measurements from both layers were included in the objective function. Finally, soil hydraulic properties of the grass-reference lysimeter in Wagna were estimated using real measurements. Water dynamics in the lysimeter could be described well by an effective parameterization assuming a homogeneous soil profile. Furthermore, the system behavior under different boundary conditions could be predicted adequately with the estimated parameters. This demonstrates the usefulness of the identified system properties for predictive modeling.","[Schelle, Henrike] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geookol, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; Joanneum Res, Resources Inst Water Energy & Sustainabil, Water Resources Management, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Schelle, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geookol, Langer Kamp 19C, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",h.schelle@tu-bs.de,"Durner, Wolfgang/A-6223-2013; Mielenz, Henrike/J-2434-2013","Mielenz, Henrike/0000-0002-8828-0419; Durner, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9543-1318; Iden, Sascha/0000-0001-8292-9048",Initiative and Networking Fund from the Helmholtz Association (Virtual Institute: INVEST),This study was financially supported by the Initiative and Networking Fund from the Helmholtz Association (Virtual Institute: INVEST).,,53,16,16,1,37,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1539-1663,,,VADOSE ZONE J,Vadose Zone J.,NOV,2012,11,4,,,,,,,,10.2136/vzj2011.0169,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Soil Science; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,050VI,WOS:000312082000019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kohlpaintner, M; Huber, C; Matejek, B; Gottlein, A",,,,"Kohlpaintner, Michael; Huber, Christian; Matejek, Boris; Goettlein, Axel",,,Causes for the small scale variability of nitrate concentration in seepage water of an N saturated mature spruce stand,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nitrate leaching; Spatial variability; N turnover; Net N mineralization; Hoglwald; N saturation; Fine root biomass,ABIES L KARST; SOIL SOLUTION CHEMISTRY; NORWAY-SPRUCE; PICEA-ABIES; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; SOUTHERN BAVARIA; EUROPEAN FORESTS; DEPOSITION,"In N-saturated forests nitrate concentrations in seepage water () regularly show high spatial variability even within homogeneous stands.

We investigated a multitude of parameters (e.g. N turnover, root biomass, soil chemistry, soil physics, stand parameters) and related them to , measured in 40 cm depth with suction cups. A small number of biological parameters (net N mineralization, root distribution, and stand density) explained up to 93 % of the variability of in linear regression models. Net N-mineralization rates in the humus layer and fine root biomass in the upper mineral soil influenced positively. Fine root biomass in deeper soil layers (30-40 cm depth) and stand density had a negative influence.

To identify traits conferring an advantage to Norway maple, we grew both species through an entire growing season under simulated light regimes mimicking a closed forest understorey vs. a canopy disturbance (gap). Dynamic shade-houses providing a succession of high-intensity direct-light events between longer periods of low, diffuse light were used to simulate the light regimes. We assessed seedling height growth three times in the season, as well as stem diameter, maximum photosynthetic capacity, biomass allocation above- and below-ground, seasonal phenology and phenotypic plasticity. Given the north European provenance of Norway maple, we also investigated the possibility that its growth in North America might be increased by delayed fall senescence. We found that Norway maple had significantly greater photosynthetic capacity in both light regimes and grew larger in stem diameter than sugar maple. The differences in below- and above-ground biomass, stem diameter, height and maximum photosynthesis were especially important in the simulated gap where Norway maple continued extension growth during the late fall. In the gap regime sugar maple had a significantly higher root : shoot ratio that could confer an advantage in the deepest shade of closed understorey and under water stress or browsing pressure. Norway maple is especially invasive following canopy disturbance where the opposite (low root : shoot ratio) could confer a competitive advantage. Considering the effects of global change in extending the potential growing season, we anticipate that the invasiveness of Norway maple will increase in the future.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Paquette, Alain; Berninger, Frank; Lechowicz, Martin J.; Messier, Christian; Brisson, Jacques] Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Fontaine, Bastien; Dubois, Karine; Brisson, Jacques] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Berninger, Frank] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Fac Agr & Forestry, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lechowicz, Martin J.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Posada, Juan M.] Univ Rosario, Fac Ciencias Nat & Matemat, Bogota 111221, DC, Colombia; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Paquette, A (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,"Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019; Berninger, Frank/A-8891-2010; Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014; Posada, Juan/G-3616-2016","Berninger, Frank/0000-0001-7718-1661; Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682; Posada, Juan/0000-0001-7794-9300; Brisson, Jacques/0000-0003-0046-7551; Lechowicz, Martin/0000-0003-2562-7136",National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [261578-2008]; Center for Forest Research,"This work was supported by National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (261578-2008 to J.B.), and Center for Forest Research.",,61,22,22,2,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2012,32,11,,,,,1339,1347,,10.1093/treephys/tps092,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,035TN,WOS:000310972100003,23076822,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Olajuyigbe, S; Tobin, B; Hawkins, M; Nieuwenhuis, M",,,,"Olajuyigbe, Samuel; Tobin, Brian; Hawkins, Michael; Nieuwenhuis, Maarten",,,The measurement of woody root decomposition using two methodologies in a Sitka spruce forest ecosystem,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trenched plots; Root diameter; Root decomposition; Decomposition bags; C:N ratio; Decomposition rate-constant,SITCHENSIS BONG.

The early stage decomposition rate of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) roots was determined using trenched plots and decomposition bags. Stumps of known age were trenched and quadrants (50 cm by 50 cm) excavated from randomly selected stumps every 6 months over 4 years, while the mass loss from buried roots in decomposition bags, divided among four diameter categories (ranging from fine roots < 2 mm to large roots > 50 mm), was monitored for 27 months. The C and N concentrations of excavated samples at different time points were analysed. The change in total root necromass per quadrant showed a higher decomposition rate-constant (k) of 0.24 +/- 0.068 year(-1) than the k-value of roots in decomposition bags (0.07 +/- 0.005 year(-1)). The C concentration (47.24 +/- 0.609 %) did not significantly change with decomposition. There was a significant increase in the C:N ratio of roots in all diameter categories (fine: 48.92 %, small: 38.53 %, medium 11.71 %, large: 76.25 %) after 4 years of decomposition, driven by N loss. Root diameter accounted for 78 % of the variation in the N concentration of roots as decomposition progressed. Though the trenched plot approach offered an alternative to the more common decomposition bag method for estimating root decomposition, high spatial variation and sampling difficulties may lead to an overestimation of the mass loss from trenched roots, thus, the decomposition bag method gives a more reliable decomposition rate-constant.","[Olajuyigbe, Samuel; Tobin, Brian; Hawkins, Michael; Nieuwenhuis, Maarten] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin 2, Ireland","Olajuyigbe, S (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin 2, Ireland.",lekito2001@yahoo.com,,,National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) as part of the CARBiFOR II project,"This research was funded by the National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) as part of the CARBiFOR II project.

However, few studies have investigated root detection frequency; i.e., how many and which roots are identified in a radar profile out of the total quantity of roots present in a forest stand. The objective of this study was to quantify root detection frequency and uncertainty, including relationships between root detection and radar parameters using 1.5 GHz GPR in a Pinus thunbergii forest on sandy soils. We compared the vertical distribution of 829 excavated roots with distributions identified visually in radar profiles using GPR on 17 transects. The detection frequency for number of roots less than 1.0 cm in diameter was only 6.6 %, but 54 % of roots that were larger than 1.0 cm were detected. Roots larger than 2.0 cm were identified with less frequency by GPR at deeper depths (20-30 cm) than were shallower roots. Our study indicates that GPR methods estimate root biomass to be 68 % of the excavated root biomass and that the detection frequency for number of roots in radar profiles using GPR is related to root biomass, although there is uncertainty in the attenuation of radar waves with depth, soil water condition and root orientation.","[Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst FFPRI, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Yamamoto, Rika; Dannoura, Masako; Makita, Naoki; Kanazawa, Yoichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako; Makita, Naoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Aono, Kenji; Igarashi, Tetsurou; Ishii, Masahiro] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd KANSO TECHNOS, Osaka 5410052, Japan; [Yamase, Keitarou] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, Shiso 6712515, Japan","Hirano, Y (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yhirano@nagoya-u.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014","Yamase, Keitaro/0000-0002-2689-0633","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [18380095, 22380090]","We greatly acknowledge the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

We compared four growth-related traits (total biomass, relative growth rate RGR, specific leaf area SLA, and root to shoot ratio R:S) of five invasive Fabaceae species (Acacia cyclops, A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon, A. saligna, Paraserianthes lophantha), grown in a common garden experiment using seeds from introduced and native ranges across Australia. Chloroplast microsatellite loci were used to compare genetic diversity of native and introduced populations to determine standing genetic diversity and infer introduction history. We asked whether shifts in traits associated with faster growth due to enemy release in the introduced range were associated with levels of genetic diversity associated with introduction history. We found differences in traits between ranges, although these traits varied among the species. Compared to native-range populations, introduced-range Acacia longifolia had greater biomass and larger SLA; A. cyclops had greater RGR; and A. melanoxylon displayed lower R:S. Genetic diversity in the introduced range was lower for one of those species, A. longifolia, and two others that did not show differences in traits, A. saligna and P. lophantha. Diversity was higher in the introduced range for A. melanoxylon and did not differ among ranges for A. cyclops. These patterns of genetic diversity suggest that a genetic bottleneck may have occurred following the introduction of A. longifolia, A. saligna and P. lophantha. In contrast greater or comparable genetic diversity in the introduced range for A. melanoxylon and A. cyclops suggests introductions from multiple sources. This study has shown that a reduction in genetic diversity in the introduced range is not necessarily associated with a reduced capacity for adaptive responses or invasion potential in the novel range.","[Harris, Carla J.; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Dormontt, Eleanor E.; Lowe, Andrew] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Evolutionary Biol & Biodivers, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Le Roux, Johannes J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Lowe, Andrew] State Herbarium S Australia, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Sci Resource Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Leishman, MR (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",michelle.leishman@mq.edu.au,"Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012","Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Le Roux, Johannes/0000-0001-7911-9810; Lowe, Andrew/0000-0003-1139-2516",ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [DP0879494],We thank Ian Davidson and Anthony Manea for assistance with carrying out the common garden experiment.

The influence of soil mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi is thought to be an important feedback component, yet they have shown benefits to both early and late successional plants that could either retard or accelerate succession. Here we first determine if arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi differ among three stages of primary sand dune succession and then if they alter growth of plants from particular successional stages. We isolated AM fungal inoculum from early, intermediate or late stages of a primary dune succession and compared them using cloning and sequencing. We then grew eight plant species that dominate within each of these successional stages with each AM fungal inoculum. We measured fungal growth to assess potential AM functional differences and plant growth to determine if AM fungi positively or negatively affect plants. AM fungi isolated from early succession were more phylogenetically diverse relative to intermediate and late succession while late successional fungi consistently produced more soil hyphae and arbuscules. Despite these differences, inocula from different successional stages had similar effects on the growth of all plant species. Host plant biomass was not affected by mycorrhizal inoculation relative to un-inoculated controls. Although mycorrhizal communities differ among primary dune successional stages and formed different fungal structures, these differences did not directly affect the growth of plants from different dune successional stages in our experiment and therefore may be less likely to directly contribute to plant succession in sand dunes.","[Sikes, Benjamin A.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Maherali, Hafi Z.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol & Phys Geog Unit, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Sikes, BA (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",bensikes@mail.utexas.edu,"Sikes, Benjamin/G-8895-2018","Sikes, Benjamin/0000-0003-0774-2624",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Cedar Tree Foundation,The authors are grateful for funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to JNK and HM as well as a David H.

To better understand ecosystem processes when the surface layers of the soil are disturbed, we investigated the effects of disturbance on different functional microbial groups by the use of signature fatty acid analysis. Four levels of disturbance were investigated in local disturbance gradients in an area with semi-natural sandy grassland. Festuca brevipila Tracey (Poaceae) was used as the study plant to investigate the response of plant and microbial biomass to disturbance. The plant was chosen since it dominated the site and was present at all levels of disturbance. The amount of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the roots of the study plant was not affected by soil disturbance. The amount of AM fungi, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria in the soil was significantly reduced by increasing level of soil disturbance, coinciding with a reduced vegetation cover and decreasing soil organic matter content. Increasing levels of soil disturbance resulted in elevated soil pH and concentration of inorganic N, whereas the water content and organic matter content was reduced. The shoot N:P ratios of the grass investigated increased with the level of disturbance. We conclude that soil disturbance disfavours fungi due to mechanical interruption of hyphae and through reduced plant biomass. We also conclude that soil disturbance disfavours bacteria in the long run due to reduced organic matter content.

Recently, ecologists have emphasized that plant diversity effects on plant productivity increase with time; however, the mechanisms responsible for delayed ecosystem responses to diversity manipulations are poorly understood. The present paper briefly reviews temporal changes in grassland biodiversity experiments and proposes antagonistic and facilitative soil effects on plant performance as a mechanistic explanation for increasing plant diversity effects on plant productivity with time. We show that the mechanisms previously proposed to be responsible for the increasing influence of plant diversity effects with time rely in part or entirely on soil biota. Moreover, we show that significant plant diversity effects on soil organisms increase considerably with experimental duration and that the number of respective long-term studies is extremely low. We posit that in the long-term species-rich plant communities experience predominantly facilitative net effects by soil biota promoting plant community growth, such as decomposers, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, whereas species-poor plant communities are subject to antagonistic net soil effects due to the accumulation of pathogens, such as nematodes. We therefore suggest that soil biota and their net effect on plants need to be considered in biodiversity experiments to understand changes in time of the effects of plant diversity on the productivity and functioning of plant communities.","[Eisenhauer, Nico] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico; Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Eisenhauer, N (reprint author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",nico.eisenhauer@web.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1451/1, Ei 862/1, Ei 862/2]","We acknowledge funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; FOR 1451/1, Ei 862/1 and Ei 862/2).

Finally, we hypothesized that L. bojeriana could act as a natural provider for ectomycorrhizal propagules. Soil bioassays were conducted with U. bojeri seedlings grown in soils collected under the native tree species (U. bojeri and L. bojeriana) and two exotic tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Pinus patula) and in the same soils but previously cultured by L. bojeriana seedlings. This study clearly shows that (1) the introduction of exotic tree species induces significant changes in soil biotic and abiotic characteristics, (2) exotic-invaded soil significantly reduces the early growth and ectomycorrhization of U. bojeri seedlings and (3) L. bojeriana decreased these negative effects of the exotic tree species by facilitating ectomycorrhizal establishment and consequently improved the U. bojeri early growth. This study provides evidence that L. bojeriana can facilitate the ectomycorrhizal infection of U. bojeri and mitigates the negative effects of the introduction of exotic tree species on the early growth of the native tree species. From a practical point of view, the use of ectotrophic early-successional shrub species should be considered to improve forest resaturation after exotic invasion.","[Baohanta, R.; Ramanankierana, H.; Rasolomampianina, R.; Rakotoarimanga, N.; Randriambanona, H.] Ctr Natl Rech Environm, Lab Microbiol Environm, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Thioulouse, J.] Univ Lyon 1, UMR 5558, CNRS, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Prin, Y.; Galiana, A.] IRD SupAgro UM2, CIRAD, LSTM, UMR CIRAD INRA 113, Montpellier, France; [Baudoin, E.; Lebrun, M.; Duponnois, R.] IRD SupAgro UM2, IRD, LSTM, UMR CIRAD INRA 113, Montpellier, France","Duponnois, R (reprint author), Univ Cadi Ayyad, Lab Ecol & Environm, Unite Assoc CNRST, URAC 32,Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco.",Robin.Duponnois@ird.fr,"Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016","Thioulouse, Jean/0000-0001-7664-0598; BAOHANTA, Rondro Harinisainana/0000-0001-9134-2580",,,,69,8,8,0,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Resource partitioning (in particular, nitrogen [N] partitioning) has been proposed as one possible mechanism to explain this pattern. There is evidence for interspecific differences in chemical form, soil depth, and timing of N uptake. However, it has rarely been tested whether such differences result in increased N exploitation at the plant community level. Using N-15-labeled litter that was mixed into different soil layers, we tested whether eight common grasses and forbs grown in communities of one, two, or four species differ with respect to the proportions of N taken up from different soil depths (N niche), and how this affects the total N uptake of plant communities. We calculated proportional similarity between species (niche overlap) with regard to N uptake from the labeled soil layers; we further calculated an a priori measure of community N uptake based on species N uptake in monoculture (community niche). Interestingly, however, plant community N uptake was not affected by species richness, possibly because community-level N uptake was determined by (diversity-independent) soil N mineralization rates. We nevertheless observed a positive effect of species richness on productivity due to increased aboveground biomass : N ratios. This may indicate increased competition for light, resulting in increased amounts of comparably N-poor stem tissue. However, community N content and biomass were positively correlated with the community niche, a measure which is strongly linked to species composition. Thus, our results suggest that the studied species are generalists rather than specialists regarding N uptake depth, and that species composition was more important than species richness in determining community N uptake. Overall, N partitioning may be a less important driver of positive biodiversity-productivity effects in temperate grasslands than previously assumed.","[von Felten, Stefanie; Niklaus, Pascal A.; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [von Felten, Stefanie; Niklaus, Pascal A.; Hector, Andrew] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [von Felten, Stefanie] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","von Felten, S (reprint author), Univ Basel Hosp, Clin Trial Unit, Schanzenstr 55, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.",vonfeltens@uhbs.ch,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; von Felten, Stefanie/L-3514-2019; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; von Felten, Stefanie/D-2701-2009","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; von Felten, Stefanie/0000-0002-5264-6394; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; ",PSC-Syngenta Graduate Research Fellowship from the Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center; ETH ZurichETH Zurich; University of Zurich,"We thank Bernhard Schmid for his invaluable support while planning and conducting the experiment, Karin Sorgel and Annika Ackermann for taking the IRMS measurements, all students who helped setting up the experiment, harvesting plants, or processing samples, and Luisa Vogt for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Despite their importance, the identity, abundance and distribution of EMF in the Arctic, as well as the key drivers controlling their community composition are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the diversity and structure of EMF communities across a bioclimatic gradient spanning much of the North American Arctic. We collected roots from two principal arctic ectomycorrhizal host plants, Salix arctica and Dryas integrifolia, typically growing intermingled, at 23 locations stratified across the five bioclimatic subzones of the Arctic. DNA was extracted from ectomycorrhizal root tips and the ITS region was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. A total of 242 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were documented, with 203 OTUs belonging to the Basidiomycota and 39 to the Ascomycota, exceeding the number of previously morphologically described EMF in the Arctic. EMF communities were dominated by a few common and species-rich families such as Thelephoraceae, Inocybaceae, Sebacinaceae, Cortinariaceae, and Pyronemataceae. Both host plants showed similar species richness, with 176 OTUs on Salix arctica and 154 OTUs on Dryas integrifolia. Host plant identity did not affect EMF community composition. The ten most abundant OTUs had a wide geographic distribution throughout the Arctic, and were also found in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean regions, where they were associated with a variety of hosts. Species richness did not decline with increasing latitude. However, EMF community structure changed gradually across the bioclimatic gradient with the greatest similarity between neighboring bioclimatic subzones and locations. EMF community structure was correlated with environmental factors at a regional scale, corresponding to a complex of glaciation history, geology, soil properties, plant productivity and climate. This is the first large-scale study of EMF communities across all five bioclimatic subzones of the North American Arctic, accompanied by an extensive set of environmental factors analyzed to date. While our study provides baseline data to assess shifts of plant and fungi distribution in response to climate change, it also suggests that with ongoing climate warming, EMF community composition may be affected by northward shifts of some taxa.","[Timling, I.; Walker, D.

Understanding the many factors that affect community composition and coexistence of species in natural environments is one of the central goals in ecology. As germination and establishment of seedlings in orchids are crucially dependent on mycorrhizal availability, the diversity and spatial distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi are likely factors that contribute to orchid coexistence. 2. In this study, we combined molecular identification techniques with seed germination experiments and spatial point pattern analyses to investigate to what extent differences in mycorrhizal association patterns affected spatial variation in seed germination and the above-ground distribution of three co-occurring terrestrial orchid species (Anacamptis morio, Gymnadenia conopsea and Orchis mascula). 3. The three species associated with a different set of mycorrhizal fungi, except A. morio and G. conopsea, which shared one fungal associate. The number of fungal lineages detected associating with each species also differed between species, being highest in G. conopsea, which associated with five lineages, and restricted to a single lineage in O. mascula. 4. Seed germination experiments showed that below-ground seed germination was restricted to locations where orchid individuals were most abundant, and quickly declined with increasing distance from the nearest above-ground congener. Spatial point pattern analyses indicated significant fine-scale spatial clustering that was highest in O. mascula and lowest in G. conopsea. Moreover, the spatial distributions of the three species were independent from each other, except for A. morio and G. conopsea. 5. Synthesis. Our results support previous findings that co-occurring orchid species tend to use different mycorrhizal partners. Although the possibility that variation in local environmental conditions affected seed germination could not be completely ruled out, our results suggest that the presence of specific mycorrhizal fungi contributed, at least partly, to the spatial distribution and coexistence of the investigated orchid species.","[Jacquemyn, Hans; Brys, Rein] KULeuven, Dept Biol, Div Plant Ecol & Systemat, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Lievens, Bart] Scientia Terrae Res Inst, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Lievens, Bart] KULeuven Assoc, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, Lessius Univ Coll,CIMB, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Wiegand, Thorsten] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, DE-04301 Leipzig, Germany","Jacquemyn, H (reprint author), KULeuven, Dept Biol, Div Plant Ecol & Systemat, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",hans.jacquemyn@bio.kuleuven.be,"Lievens, Bart/B-3339-2019; Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Wiegand, Thorsten/H-5877-2016","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248","European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [260601 - MYCASOR, 233066 - SPATIODIVERSITY]",This research was funded by the European Research Council (ERC starting grant 260601 - MYCASOR and ERC advanced grant 233066 - SPATIODIVERSITY).

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.","[Thomas, Peter A.] Keele Univ, Sch Life Sci, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Packham, John R.] Wolverhampton Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Wolverhampton WV1 1SB, England; [Degen, Thomas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Forestry Unit, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Thomas, PA (reprint author), Keele Univ, Sch Life Sci, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",p.a.thomas@keele.ac.uk,"Atkinson, Mark D/K-1813-2013","Atkinson, Mark D/0000-0003-4237-3588",,,,468,69,70,2,171,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We compared the growth, tissue nitrogen contents, and stable nitrogen isotope ratios of P. contorta growing in gravel pits to the same species growing on adjacent intact soil. Trees growing in severely nitrogen deficient gravel pits had virtually identical growth rates and tissue nitrogen contents to those growing on intact soil that had nitrogen levels typical for the area. delta N-15 values for trees in the gravel pits were substantially lower than delta N-15 values for trees on intact soil, and isotope ratios in vegetation were lower than the isotope ratios of the soil. The form of soil nitrogen in the gravel pits was almost exclusively nitrate, while ammonium predominated in the intact soil. Discrimination against N-15 during plant uptake of soil nitrate in the highly N-deficient soil should be weak or nonexistent. Therefore, the low delta N-15 in the gravel pit trees suggests that trees growing in gravel pits were using another nitrogen source in addition to the soil. Precipitation-borne nitrogen in the study area is extremely low. In conjunction with our other work, these findings strongly suggests that P. contorta and its microbial symbionts or associates fix nitrogen in sufficient amounts to sustain vigorous tree growth on the most nitrogen-deficient soils.","[Chapman, William Kenneth] BC Minist Forests LNRO, Res Sect, Williams Lake, BC, Canada; [Paul, Leslie] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Chapman, WK (reprint author), BC Minist Forests LNRO, Res Sect, 200-640 Borland St, Williams Lake, BC, Canada.",Bill.Chapman@gov.bc.ca; Les.Paul@mykopat.slu.se,,,,,,29,11,11,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Rs in three poplar forests (5, 10, and 15 years old) were measured using an LI-6400-09 soil chamber connected to an LI-6400 portable infrared gas analyzer during the growing seasons in 2007 and 2008. Root respiration was measured using the root excision method. The soil micro-organisms were quantified using the dilution-plate method. The results show that Rs was the highest in the 5-year-old forest and lowest in 15-year-old forest. The contribution of Rr to Rs ranged from 29.4 to 81.0%. Rr/Rs tended to be significantly higher in the 15-year-old forest than that in the younger forests; but Rr was the highest in the 5-year-old forest. Temporal variation in Rs can be largely accounted by fine-root biomass (R = 0.718), while soil N was significantly negatively correlated with Rs (R = -0.646). Rs, Rr and Rr/Rs vary significantly with the forest age. The lower Rs in the older forests increased their carbon use efficiency. Underground factors, dominated by fine-root biomass, affect Rs, Rr and Rr/Rs substantially. Soil microbial community structure is a particularly important underground factor.","[Gong, Jirui; An, Ran; Duan, Qingwei; You, Xin; Huang, Yongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ge, Zhiwei] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Resource & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Gong, JR (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jrgong@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40771069, 41030535]","We thank the staff of the Plain Forest Farm Nursery of the State Forestry Bureau of Ili Autonomous Prefecture in China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region for field assistance.

We investigated the relationship between soil biochemical characteristics and enzymatic responses in a series of sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated forests that have been subjected to 16 yrs of chronic N deposition (ambient + 3 g NO3--N m(-2) yr(-1)), in which litter decay has slowed and soil organic matter has accumulated in sandy spodosols. Cupric-oxide-extractable lignin-derived phenols were quantified to determine the presence, source, and relative oxidation state of lignin-like compounds under ambient and experimental N deposition. Pools of respired C and mineralized N, along with rate constants for these processes, were used to quantify biochemically labile substrate pools during a 16-week laboratory incubation. Extracellular enzymes mediating cellulose and lignin metabolism also were measured under ambient and experimental N deposition, and these values were compared with proxies for the relative oxidation of lignin in forest floor and surface mineral soil. Chronic N deposition had no influence on the pools or rate constants for respired C and mineralized N. Moreover, neither the total amount of extractable lignin (forest floor, P = 0.260; mineral soil, P = 0.479), nor the relative degree of lignin oxidation in the forest floor or mineral soil (forest floor P = 0.680; mineral soil P = 0.934) was influenced by experimental N deposition. Given their biochemical attributes, lignin-derived molecules in forest floor and mineral soil appear to originate from fine roots, rather than leaf litter. Under none of the studied circumstances was the presence or relative oxidation of lignin correlated with the activity of cellulolytic and lignolytic extracellular enzymes. Although chronic atmospheric N deposition has slowed litter decay and increased organic matter in our experiment, it had little effect on biochemical composition of lignin-derived molecules in forest floor and surface mineral soil suggesting organic matter has accumulated by other means. Moreover, the specific dynamics of lignin phenol decay is decoupled from short-term organic matter accumulation under chronic N deposition in this ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The collembolan communities involved in root and leaf litter decomposition were compared in a litterbag experiment in a coniferous forest of Chamaecyparis obtusa. A two-factor experiment (litter type x litter position) was conducted to evaluate the relative effects of litter quality and position. Litterbags of roots and leaves were each placed at two positions (on the soil surface and in the soil), and were collected at seven different times over three years. Abundance and biomass of Collembola involved in root decomposition in the soil were higher than those involved in leaf decomposition on the soil surface, and the collembolan community composition largely differed between these two types of litterbag. Differences between root and leaf decomposition were mainly caused by litter position, but effects of litter type were also detected at species-level. Species that preferred roots were abundant at an early stage of litter decomposition in the soil. Because the early stage of decomposition in the soil is naturally achieved only by root litter initially deposited in the soil, root litter may function as an essential resource for certain species. The results of this study indicate that root litter contributes to collembolan community organization as a spatially and qualitatively different resource than leaf litter. This also suggests that root litter is decomposed via different soil faunal processes than leaf litter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695 km(2)) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647 km(2)) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219 km(2)) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052 km(2)) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395 km(2)) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g = 1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project. Leakage must be accounted for in REDD projects because the deforestation resulting from this effect could generate ""hot air"" (carbon credit with no additionality). Over longer time horizons the benefits of reserves are greater and leakage losses are recovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental design used was randomized complete block with four treatments (pure stands Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Acacia mangium; mixed Eucalyptus camaldulensis + Acacia mangium; and covered with spontaneous vegetation - ADVE) and three replications. Soil samples were collected at 0-5 cm soil layer in each plot. The spores were extracted and taxonomically identified. Relative density, frequency of each species and the Shannon-Wiener, Pielou and Simpson indexes were analyzed. The GRSP (total glomalin - TG and easily extractable glomalin - EEG) was extracted with sodium citrate and quantified by the Bradford method. Abundance of AMF was higher in the degraded areas covered by weeds (spontaneous vegetation) compared to plantations; however, it showed lower species diversity. The areas of eucalypt monoculture showed a lower level of AMF diversity in relation to areas of eucalypt intercropped with Acacia. The genera Glomus and Acaulospora were the AMF, with the largest number of species. The GRSP was closely correlated with soil C and N, which observed in greater amounts in plantations in relation to the sites covered with spontaneous vegetation. Revegetation of clay extraction site promoted the reduction of AMF sporulation, while the diversity and amount GRSP increased.","[da Silva, Cristiane Figueira] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Curso Posgrad Agron Ciencia Solo, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Simoes-Araujo, Jean Luiz; Ribeiro da Silva, Eliane Maria; Saggin Junior, Orivaldo Jose] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Pereira, Marcos Gervasio] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Solos, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Mendonca Freitas, Marta Simone; Martins, Marco Antonio] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil","da Silva, CF (reprint author), Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Curso Posgrad Agron Ciencia Solo, BR 465,Km 7, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil.",cfigueirasilva@yahoo.com.br; jean@cnpab.embrapa.br; eliane@cnpab.embrapa.br; gervasio@ufrrj.br; msimone@uenf.br; marco@uenf.br,"Pereira, Marcos/F-1585-2018","Pereira, Marcos/0000-0002-1402-3612",,,,57,0,0,0,13,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

A comparative analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC), easily extractable Bradford-reactive soil protein (EE-BRSP) and Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP) was carried out at monthly intervals in a land-use sequence including cultivated soils, forest soils, shrubs and pasture in northeast Spain. In general, greater seasonal variations of both EE-BRSP and BRSP were found in soils with less carbon storage capacity. Turnover of glomalin into more stable C forms was associated with a small EE-BRSP:BRSP ratio in better structured soils and BRSP was related to organic carbon, suggesting positive contributions to both the recalcitrant carbon pool and soil structure. This effect seemed to be more pronounced in August when more BRSP was found, probably because of high temperature and dry soils in which glomalin may react to preserve residual adsorbed water and provide better protection in soil microsites. The role of glomalin was further enhanced by the structural stability of aggregates (WSA) investigated in two aggregate fractions (0.252.00 and 2.005.60 mm), indicating its beneficial effect in aggregation and carbon storage potential. BRSP, SOC and WSA increased significantly (P < 0.001) along the transect and abandonment sequence; the largest WSA values were generally greater in summer in both aggregate fractions. However, values in cultivated soils were always smaller than in soils under shrubs and pasture. Similarly, soils with a smaller carbon pool had the largest proportion of carbon loss as CO2-C when land use changes from vines to pasture. The role of aggregates in protecting organic carbon against mineralization was therefore postulated and highlighted the importance of soil monitoring after land abandonment.","[Emran, M.; Gispert, M.; Pardini, G.] Univ Girona, High Polytech Sch, Dept Chem Engn Agr & Food Technol, Soil Sci Unit, Girona 17003, Spain","Pardini, G (reprint author), Univ Girona, High Polytech Sch, Dept Chem Engn Agr & Food Technol, Soil Sci Unit, Campus Montilivi S-N, Girona 17003, Spain.",giovanni.pardini@udg.edu,"PARDINI, GIOVANNI/L-2226-2014; Gispert, Maria/L-1205-2014; Emran, Mohamed/G-6731-2015","PARDINI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-4559-2631; Gispert, Maria/0000-0002-5074-2307; Emran, Mohamed/0000-0001-7828-1322","Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovacion (MCI) [CGL2007-66644-C04-02, BES-2008-010099]","This work was supported by a national research project funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia y Innovacion (MCI): CGL2007-66644-C04-02 (Estudio integrado de los procesos hidrologicos y erosivos, a escala de ladera, en ambientes mediterraneos con diferente uso del suelo) and associated predoctoral grant: BES-2008-010099.",,30,24,26,2,104,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

This has raised important questions about the roles of plant and fungal phylogenetics, and their habitat preferences, in controlling which fungi associate with which plants. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Martos et al. (2012) report the largest network analysis to date for orchids and their mycorrhizal fungi, sampling a total of over 450 plants from nearly half the 150 tropical orchid species on Reunion Island, encompassing its main terrestrial and epiphytic orchid genera. The authors found a total of 95 operational taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi and investigated the architecture and nestedness of their bipartite networks with 73 orchid species. The most striking finding was a major ecological barrier between above- and belowground mycorrhizal fungal networks, despite both epiphytic and terrestrial orchids often associating with closely related taxa across all three major lineages of rhizoctonia fungi. The fungal partnerships of the epiphytes and terrestrial species involved a diversity of fungal taxa in a modular network architecture, with only about one in ten mycorrhizal fungi partnering orchids in both groups. In contrast, plant and fungal phylogenetics had weak or no effects on the network. This highlights the power of recently developed ecological network analyses to give new insights into controls on plantfungal symbioses and raises exciting new hypotheses about the differences in properties and functioning of mycorrhiza in epiphytic and terrestrial orchids.","[Leake, J.

However, determining the ecological patterns and processes taking place in communities of microbes remains a significant challenge. Are communities randomly assembled through dispersal and priority effects, or do species interact with each other leading to positive and negative associations? For mycorrhizal fungi, evidence is accumulating that stochastic and competitive interactions between species may both have a role in shaping community structure. Could the methodological approach, which is often incidence based, impact the outcomes detected? Here, we applied an incidence-based Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) database approach to examine species diversity and ecological interactions within a community of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the ECM community colonizing root tips was strongly structured by competitive interactions, or ecological processes generating a similar spatial pattern, rather than neutral processes. Analysis of beta-diversity indicated that community structure was significantly more similar (spatially autocorrelated) at distances equal to or <3.41 m. The eight most frequently encountered species in the root tip community of ECM fungi displayed significant competitive interactions with at least one other species, showing that the incidence-based approach was capable of detecting this sort of ecological information.","[Pickles, Brian J.; Genney, David R.; Alexander, Ian J.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Pickles, Brian J.; Genney, David R.; Anderson, Ian C.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Anderson, Ian C.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Genney, David R.] Scottish Nat Heritage, Inverness IV4 8NW, Scotland","Pickles, BJ (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Irving K Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Okanagan Campus,SCI 103,3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",brian.pickles@ubc.ca,"Anderson, Ian/G-4129-2014; Genney, David R/J-8895-2012","Pickles, Brian/0000-0002-9809-6455; Anderson, Ian/0000-0002-3507-163X",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/A/S/2002/00861]; Scottish Government (Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate),"We thank four anonymous reviewers for their comments, Pamela Parkin for her technical assistance, Marianne Pickles for root sorting, Sietse van der Linde for sample collection, Hironari Izumi for allowing us to include his data in the TRF database, the Forestry Commission for access to Culbin Forest and Liz Holden and members of the UNITE group for sporocarp identification.

Such extended regeneration periods, however, may lead to undesirable development of advance regeneration, specifically in species such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) where root growth is strongly curtailed under competition. We hypothesized that root systems of naturally regenerated Douglas-fir that had grown under closed canopy for prolonged periods would be inhibited in their capacity to develop adequate structural root systems following release through removal of the canopy. Complete root systems of six approximately 25-year-old Douglas-fir that had grown for at least 12 years underneath a closed canopy before overstory removal were excavated using subterranean explosives. Root elongation, radial increment of primary lateral and vertical roots, and aboveground stem growth were investigated using retrospective analysis of growth rings. Structural roots of the previously suppressed Douglas-fir were capable of strongly responding to release from competition relative to growth prior to removal, but this response, particularly in the form of root elongation, was delayed. However, since the growth response of roots was not stronger than that above ground, an imbalanced root to shoot ratio, likely developed in trees when grown under the canopy, was not reverted. Generalizing interpretation of the derived findings of this study is limited because of the small sample size and the lack of freely grown control trees. Whether or not previously suppressed trees can develop the same physical stability as open-grown individuals therefore deserves further investigation.","[Briggs, Nathan A.; Kuehne, Christian; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, Fac Forest & Environm Sci, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Kohnle, Ulrich] Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Briggs, NA (reprint author), 1532 Tolma Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA.",nathan.a.briggs16@gmail.com,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",Gesellschaft zur Forderung der forst- und holzwirtschaftlichen Forschung an der Universitat Freiburg e.V.

We used a stable isotope approach in which root systems were labeled with C-13 and root structural C sequentially sampled for C-13 enrichment. Turnover of first- and second-order roots was apparently rapid with only about 5% of the C-13 retained in living roots after two growing seasons. Although third-to fifth-order roots appeared to persist longer, differences among root orders were not statistically significant, probably mostly because of highly nonuniform initial labeling. This nonuniform labeling constrains the precision of root turnover quantification using this approach.","[Fahey, Timothy J.; Jacobs, Kayla R.; Sherman, Ruth E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Fahey, TJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Bruckner Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjf5@cornell.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); DEB; Ecosystem Studies Program,"For their assistance with this research, the authors wish to thank C.

Rhizosphere parameters were monitored in natural sediment substrate by means of a dual-access floodable rhizobox, which allows monitoring of oxygen and pH dynamics noninvasively with planar optodes in high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as simultaneous low-invasive soil-solution sampling. Analysis of samples for low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA) was done by capillary electrophoresis. Roots could be observed easily in situ during growth and exposure to flooding. The floodable rhizobox is therefore considered a valuable tool for root-reaction monitoring also under flooding conditions. During waterlogging, both species exuded oxygen into their rhizosphere and showed diurnal rhythms of rhizospheric acidification. The pH of the rhizosphere of growing root tips decreased up to 0.8 units corresponding to higher LMWOA concentrations. These rhythms weakened during flooding, but gained maximum amplitude again rapidly after resurfacing. We conclude that the root system was still fully functioning during and after flooding, and that flooding poses no threat to the physiology of the root system of the study species.","[Schreiber, Christina M.; Blossfeld, Stephan; Rascher, Uwe; Schurr, Ulrich; Kuhn, Arnd J.] Res Ctr Julich GmbH, Inst Bio & Geosci IBG Plant Sci 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Schreiber, Christina M.; Zeng, Bo] SW China Univ, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Minist Educ, Sch Life Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Schreiber, Christina M.] INRA Supagro, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Kazda, Marian] Univ Ulm, Inst Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Hoeltkemeier, Agnes] Res Ctr Julich GmbH, Inst Bio & Geosci IBG Agrosphere 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Schreiber, CM (reprint author), Res Ctr Julich GmbH, Inst Bio & Geosci IBG Plant Sci 2, Leo Brandt Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",christina.schreiber@supagro.inra.fr,"Rascher, Uwe/D-5457-2009","Rascher, Uwe/0000-0002-9993-4588","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [332 4 00 580, D/07/40075]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30770406]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-06-0773]","This study was supported by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD, grant 332 4 00 580, D/07/40075), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 30770406), and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (grant NCET-06-0773).

Observations using a camera or scanner embedded in the soil enabled us to obtain continuous images of fine-root-growth dynamics. However, these methods are still labor-intensive because the image analysis has to be conducted manually. We developed an automated method for tracking movement or elongation of fine roots using a sequence of scanner images. We also show how data obtained with these methods can be used for calculating fine-root behavior. Two A4-size scanners were buried in a mixed forest in Japan and images were taken continuously from within the soil. We preprocessed these images by extracting the fine-root area from the images and developed an automated calculation plug-in we named A-root for tracking growth movement of the tips of fine roots. A-root and manual-tracking results were compared using the same images. The results show the A-root and manual-tracking methods yielded similar levels of accuracy. The average growth rate of 17 fine roots tracked using the program was 0.16?mm h1. The observation of the direction of growth in fine roots showed the direction may be influenced by the original root's growth where the fine roots branched, distribution of soil particles, other roots, and the force of gravity. The A-root analysis also suggested there may be an interaction between speed of growth and changes in direction of growing fine roots.","[Nakano, Aiko; Sakamoto, Hiromichi] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Human Sci & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Ikeno, Hidetoshi; Kimura, Toshifumi; Ohashi, Mizue] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako; Makita, Naoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Finer, Leena] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Joensuu Res Unit, Joensuu 80101, Finland","Nakano, A (reprint author), Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Human Sci & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6700092, Japan.",nd10d020@stshse.u-hyogo.ac.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014",,"Japan Science Society; Hyogo Science and Technology Association, Japan; University of Hyogo, Japan; Japanese Society for Root Research","The research was financially supported by a Sasagawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society.

The objectives of the present work were to study the effects of double (B + A and B + M) and triple (B + A + M) microbial combinations on soybean yield (Glycine max [L..] Merr), nodulation, mycorrhization and plant metabolites concentrations, as compared to Bradyrhizobium alone, after 28 and 56 days of growth under controlled conditions. All microbial combinations increased soybean root biomass, but not shoot biomass. The highest total biomass of soybean (root + shoot) was observed with the double association Azospirillum and Bradyrhizobium (B + A). This treatment reduced the total number of nodules but seems to increase their capacity to fix nitrogen, as shown by their high starch concentration during establishment. The presence of mycorrhizae (B + M) had a transitory adverse effect on depth of nodulation as compared to Bradyrhizobium alone, which could indicate competition between these two symbionts during establishment (day 28). The triple association (B + A + M) reduced shoot growth, as well as the number of small nodules. The higher concentration of the stress-induced amino acid proline in nodules and leaves in response to B + A + M indicates that soybean plants are under stress when in presence of the combination of three symbionts. During establishment, the concentration of coumestrol in soybean roots was lower with microbial combinations than with Bradyrhizobium alone, which could indicate a common regulating signal between soybean and both Azospirillum and mycorrhiza. Our results show that complex interactions and competition between the three microorganisms induced differential growth and nodulation responses, which can be linked to metabolic changes.

Today, it is accepted that movement through aquaporins represents a quite faster pathway of water movement across biological membranes.

During disease surveys, dieback and decline symptoms were observed on trees without apparent blight and ink disease symptoms. Black necroses, similar to those caused by Phytophthora infections, were noted on some of the chestnut coppices and saplings in one nursery in Ordu and led to an investigation into this disease complex. Only symptomatic plants showing dieback symptoms were investigated. Soil samples together with fine roots were collected from two directions, north and north-east, approximately 150 cm away from the main stems. Phytophthora spp. were baited with young chestnut leaves. Three Phytophthora spp., P.similar to cambivora, P.similar to cinnamomi and P.similar to plurivora, were identified from 12 soil samples collected from 73 locations, while from the nurseries, only P.similar to cinnamomi was obtained. Phytophthora cinnamomi was the most common species, obtained from seven locations in five provinces and from four nurseries having similar symptoms mentioned above in different locations. Phytophthora cambivora and P.similar to plurivora were less frequently obtained, from three to two stands, respectively. Phytophthora cinnamomi and P.similar to cambivora were the most aggressive species when inoculated at the stem base on 3-year-old chestnut saplings, killing six saplings of eight inoculated in 2 months. The three Phytophthora species were first recorded on chestnut in Black sea region of Turkey with the limited samples investigated in a large area about 150 000 ha chestnut forest.","[Akilli, S.] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, TR-18200 Cankiri, Turkey; [Serce, C.

Testing and separating the different factors that affect root tensile strength are important. In the present study, the effects of four factors, namely, gauge length, strain rate, species, and root diameter, on root tensile strength were studied. Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted to acquire the root tensile strength of five tree species commonly growing in the mountains of northern China, namely, Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.), Larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr.), White birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolicus Fisch.), and Elm (Ulmus pumila L.). Based on the results, Elm and White birch roots were the most resistant to tension, followed by Mongolian oak and Chinese pine roots. Larch roots were found to be the least resistant to tension. A power relationship was established between root diameter and root tensile strength. Based on linear regression analysis, gauge length was negatively correlated with root tensile strength. Tensile strength decreased with increasing gauge length. In addition, an unexpected variation of tensile strength was observed between two strain rates (10 and 400 mm min(-1)). The present study can serve as a basis for further studies on mechanical properties of root system and root reinforcement under different test circumstances, although this should be done with caution.","[Zhang, Chaobo; Jiang, Jing] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources Sci & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lihua] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Water & Soil Conservat, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Combating Desert, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuo] Capital Engn & Res Inc Ltd, MCC Grp, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China","Zhang, CB (reprint author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources Sci & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",zhangchaobo@tyut.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Chaobo/0000-0001-9196-2341",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30872067],"We thank X.

Most of our understanding of dynamic biomass allocation comes from seedling studies, but plasticity may be different in mature trees. We used stem analysis to reconstruct whole-tree growth and biomass allocation patterns in Quercus pubescens trees harvested from a dry woodland in Valais, Switzerland. We identified three distinct growth phases. In phase I, a primary root developed but the aboveground structure did not persist. In phase II, height growth occurred and secondary roots developed. In phase III, height growth ceased and stems and roots only grew radially. Reference trees harvested from a less dry site nearby only showed phase II-type growth. In line with our hypothesis, drought-stressed trees maintained more biomass in roots and less in aboveground woody parts than reference trees. Contrary to our expectation, stressed trees allocated proportionally more resources to leaves and less to roots in the growing season before harvest than reference trees. It appears that sub-seasonal wood anatomical adjustments to water availability minimize hydraulic failure, thus enabling these dry woodland trees to invest preferentially in leaves. Wet years did not see preferential investment in aboveground tissues, suggesting more restricted plasticity in biomass allocation in these mature trees than in seedlings. It is concluded that trees beyond seedling stage show different responses to variation in drought than the better-studied seedlings.","[Slot, Martijn; Janse-ten Klooster, Stijntje H.; Zweifel, Roman] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Janse-ten Klooster, Stijntje H.; Sterck, Frank J.; Sass-Klaassen, Ute] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Slot, M (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",mslot@ufl.edu,"slot, martijn/H-3179-2019; Zweifel, Roman/C-2852-2009","slot, martijn/0000-0002-5558-1792; Zweifel, Roman/0000-0001-9438-0582",NWO/MEERVOUD program [NWO/AWL 836.05.030],"We thank Simone de Brock, Alfred Chitiki, Qumruzzaman Chowdhury and Marijn de Zwart for conducting fieldwork.

ECM fungal species vary significantly in traits that likely influence C sequestration, such that forest C sequestration potential may be driven in part by the existing community composition of ECM fungi. Moreover, accumulating experimental data show that tree genotypes differ in their compatibility with particular ECM fungal species, i.e. mycorrhizal traits of forest trees are heritable. Those traits are genetically correlated with other traits for which tree breeders commonly select, suggesting that selection for traits of interest, such as disease resistance or growth rate, could lead to indirect selection for or against particular mycorrhizal traits of trees in forest plantations. Altogether, these observations suggest that selection of particular tree genotypes could alter the community composition of symbiotic ECM fungi in managed forests, with cascading effects on soil functioning and soil C sequestration.","[Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Hoeksema, JD (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",hoeksema@olemiss.edu; aclassen@utk.edu,"Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470",,,,64,10,10,2,72,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2012,359,2-Jan,,,,,197,204,,10.1007/s11104-012-1201-z,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,008MJ,WOS:000308960800015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Birnbaum, C; Barrett, LG; Thrall, PH; Leishman, MR",,,,"Birnbaum, Christina; Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.; Leishman, Michelle R.",,,Mutualisms are not constraining cross-continental invasion success of Acacia species within Australia,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biological invasions; nifD; nodA; plant-soil interactions; rhizobia; symbionts,ROOT-NODULE BACTERIA; SOIL BIOTA; SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; PLANT INVASIONS; NATIVE RHIZOBIA; DIVERSITY; LEGUMES; LONGIFOLIA; IMPACTS,"Aim Studying plantsoil interactions of introduced species in different parts of their global range could assist in managing biological invasions by elucidating the level of host specificity of key mutualists. We assessed the role of the soil microbial community (with an emphasis on symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, collectively termed rhizobia) in determining cross-continental invasion success of five woody legume species. Location Australia. Methods For each species, we compared growth of plants in soils from their native and non-native ranges using a glasshouse study, a soil dilution method (most probable number) and T-RFLP to assess rhizobial abundance and community composition, respectively. Results Acacia longifolia was the only species that had significantly larger above-ground biomass when grown in soils from its non-native range. Rhizobial abundance was equally high across species and ranges, indicating plants are unlikely to be limited by soil rhizobial abundance in non-native ranges. Acacia cyclops, A.similar to saligna and Paraserianthes lophantha formed associations with different rhizobial communities in non-native vs. native range soils. Acacia longifolia and A.similar to melanoxylon associated with similar rhizobial communities in their native and non-native ranges, suggesting that rhizobia may have been accidentally introduced into their novel range with seeds or seedlings. Main conclusions Invasive success of these five legume species is not constrained by the abundance of rhizobia in novel ranges for established legume populations, at least within Australia. Although differences in rhizobial community composition were evident between the native and non-native ranges for three of the five species, these were not associated with differences in plant growth. Increased above-ground biomass of A.similar to longifolia when grown in soil from its non-native range suggests that invasive success of this species may be associated with differences in the non-rhizobial components of soil microbial communities in the novel range. This information could assist in management practises by facilitating a more instructive and effective screening for invasiveness.","[Birnbaum, Christina; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Birnbaum, C (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",christina.birnbaum@mq.edu.au,"Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015; Thrall, Peter/J-6672-2013; Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731; Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Birnbaum, Christina/0000-0002-2511-1845","Macquarie University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0879494, DP1097256]","We thank three anonymous referees for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

Though numerous studies have examined the joint effects of herbivores and competitors on plant performance, these interactive effects are seldom considered in the context of plant invasions. Here, we examined variation in plant performance within a competitive environment in response to both specialist and generalist herbivores using Chinese tallow as a model species. We combined tallow plants from native and invasive populations to form all possible pairwise combinations, and designated invasive populations as stronger neighbours and native populations as weaker neighbours. We found that when no herbivory was imposed, invasive populations always had higher total biomass than natives, regardless of their neighbours, which is consistent with our assumption of increased competitive ability. Defoliation by either generalist or specialist herbivores suppressed plant growth but the effects of specialists were generally stronger for invasive populations. Invasive populations had their lowest biomass when fed upon by specialists while simultaneously competing with stronger neighbours. The root/shoot ratios of invasive populations were lower than those of native populations under almost all conditions, and invasive plants were taller than native plants overall, especially when herbivores were present, suggesting that invasive populations may adopt an ""aboveground first"" strategy to cope with herbivory and competition. These results suggest that release from herbivores, especially specialists, improves an invader's performance and helps to increase its competitive ability. Therefore, increasing interspecific competition intensity by planting a stronger neighbour while simultaneously releasing a specialist herbivore may be an especially effective method of managing invasive plants.","[Huang, Wei; Ding, Jianqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Carrillo, Juli; Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Ding, JQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",dingjianqing@yahoo.com,"Ding, Jianqing/C-2751-2009",,100 Talent Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences,"We thank Hongjun Dai, Yi Wang and Shunliang Feng for their field assistance.

As a control, the same varieties were established on an adjacent piece of land without established trees (conventional willow system). This study investigated the magnitude of carbon pools, fine root and leaf biomass inputs and clone yields in both the tree-based intercropping (agroforestry) and conventional monocropping systems.

Rhizobium-legume symbioses represent an interesting potential tool in soil bioremediation. Besides their nitrogen-fixing capacity, they have the advantage of integrating microorganisms that may influence metal bioavailability and legume plants that may act as phytoextractors or phytostabilizers. Herbaceous forage legumes present additional advantages in that they grow rapidly, producing a high biomass, and they are easy to harvest. Analysing legume endosymbiont tolerance is essential to successfully manage these symbiotic associations in metal-polluted areas, although little information is as yet available regarding Hg-tolerant rhizobia. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize rhizobia from nodules of Medicago spp. and Trifolium spp. plants that grow in Hg-contaminated soils. Fifty-nine bacterial strains were genetically characterized and identified as belonging to the Ensifer medicae and Rhizobium leguminosarum by. mfolii species. Rhizobial strains highly tolerant to Hg and strains displaying multiple metal tolerances were identified. The bacteria showed important phenotypic diversity in terms of salt and pH tolerance, phosphate solubilization and tolerance to different heavy metals. Significant correlations were found between metal tolerance responses. The influences of the site of origin, the host plant and bacterial species on metal tolerance were analysed.

To better understand C fluxes in longleaf pine, soil CO2 efflux (SR) and forest C pools were measured in 50-year-old stands varying in basal area from 7 to 36 m(2) ha(-1). Soil CO2 efflux measured monthly ranged from 1.6 to 6.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and was strongly related to soil temperature and only weakly related to basal area and forest characteristics associated with varying basal area. The annual sum of SR ranged from 11.0 to 17.9 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Litter mass explained the majority (38%) of the variation in annual SR among plots varying in basal area.

Whether different soil fractions and carbon (C) complexes have different temperature sensitivities is still a matter of debate. To measure the temperature sensitivity of tropical forest soils with ongoing decomposition, we collected soil cores from three sites along an altitudinal gradient with a difference in mean annual soil temperature of about 8 degrees C. The intact soil cores were incubated at 5, 15, 25 and 35 degrees C, respiration rates quantified, and the soil cores reinstalled at the collection sites. This procedure was repeated after six months and after one year to quantify the impact of ongoing decomposition on the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of respiration. Changes in chemical composition were determined by infra-red spectroscopy, and C distribution was partitioned by fractionation into fine roots, particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MOM) from soil sub-samples at the start of the experiment and after one year of decomposition. Despite the different provenances, the soils revealed the same respiration patterns with Q(10) values of 1.43-1.58 at the start of the experiment and 2.02-2.21 after one year. Carbon use efficiencies were lower for more stable SOM. Chemical composition of bulk SOM did not change to a measureable extent after one year, and SOM dynamics could not be related to changes in Q(10) values. Of the analysed properties, the largest impact seems to have been on the decomposition of organic matter from the POM fractions, which might have been responsible for the observed increases in Q(10) values.

However, in most cases, the dynamics of these variation patterns are poorly understood. In this work, we compared richness, diversity, and composition between assemblages of endophytic and rhizospheric fungi associated to roots of two plants with different lifestyles: the halophyte Inula crithmoides and the non-halophyte I. viscosa (syn. Dittrichia viscosa L.), along a spatially short salinity gradient. Roots and rhizospheric soil from these plants were collected at three points between a salt marsh and a sand dune, and fungi were isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing. Isolates were classified in a total of 90 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), belonging to 17 fungal orders within Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Species composition of endophytic and soil communities significantly differed across samples. Endophyte communities of I. crithmoides and I. viscosa were only similar in the intermediate zone between the salt marsh and the dune, and while the latter displayed a single, generalist association of endophytes, I. crithmoides harbored different assemblages along the gradient, adapted to the specific soil conditions. In the lower salt marsh, root assemblages were strongly dominated by a single dark septate sterile fungus, also prevalent in other neighboring salt marshes.

Orchid mycorrhizal symbioses are particularly interesting as they are viewed as more beneficial for plants than for fungi, a situation expected to result in an asymmetry of biological constraint. This study addressed the architecture and phylogenetic constraint in these associations in tropical context. We identified a bipartite network including 73 orchid species and 95 taxonomic units of mycorrhizal fungi across the natural habitats of Reunion Island. Unlike some recent evidence for nestedness in mycorrhizal symbioses, we found a highly modular architecture that largely reflected an ecological barrier between epiphytic and terrestrial subnetworks. By testing for phylogenetic signal, the overall signal was stronger for both partners in the epiphytic subnetwork. Moreover, in the subnetwork of epiphytic angraecoid orchids, the signal in orchid phylogeny was stronger than the signal in fungal phylogeny. Epiphytic associations are therefore more conservative and may co-evolve more than terrestrial ones. We suggest that such tighter phylogenetic specialization may have been driven by stressful life conditions in the epiphytic niches. In addition to paralleling recent insights into mycorrhizal networks, this study furthermore provides support for epiphytism as a major factor affecting ecological assemblage and evolutionary constraint in tropical mycorrhizal symbioses.","[Martos, Florent; Pailler, Thierry; Gonneau, Cedric] Univ La Reunion, Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseurs Milieu Trop, Equipe Dynam Ecol Sein Ecosyst Nat, F-97715 St Denis 9, France; [Martos, Florent; Selosse, Marc-Andre] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, Dept Interact Biol & Soc, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Montpellier 2, Bot & BioinforMat Architecture Plantes UMR AMAP, Equipe Org & Dynam Peuplements & Paysages, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Kottke, Ingrid] Univ Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Martos, F (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",florentmartos@gmail.com,"Munoz, Francois/C-4239-2015; Florent, Martos/B-5151-2014","Munoz, Francois/0000-0001-8776-4705; Florent, Martos/0000-0003-1213-5466",Region Reunion; Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Societe Francaise d'Orchidophilie,"The authors warmly thank R.

Improved techniques are needed for such studies. This study used in situ and destructive sampling techniques and compared two exudate extraction methods [anion exchange membrane (AEM) capturing and water extraction] from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere samples of genetically modified (GM) and control Pinus radiata D. Don trees grown in large-scale rhizotrons for 10 months. Metabolically active soil microbial communities were analysed using rRNA-DGGE. Recovery of eight out of 12 anions was influenced by extraction methods, and in situ sampling using AEM was shown to be the most efficient method. Only minor differences were detected in OAs in root exudates collected from the GM and control trees. Significant differences in alpha-Proteobacterial and Pseudomonas communities were associated with the two tree lines in the topsoil at both sampling events. Additional differences in beta-Proteobacterial and fungal communities between tree lines were detected in the rhizosphere using destructive sampling. This study demonstrated that in situ sampling was superior to destructive sampling for the efficient collection of root exudates and analysis of associated rhizosphere microbial communities.","[Shi, Shengjing; Stewart, Alison; Condron, Leo] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand; [O'Callaghan, Maureen] AgResearch, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Richardson, Alan E.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Jones, E.

Only recently, the GH61 glycosyl hydrolases have been demonstrated to be copper-containing enzymes - polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) - internally cleaving cellulose molecules in an oxidative way in synergy with cellobiose dehydrogenase and other cellulolytic enzymes. PMOs can be found in most genomes of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi, including plant pathogens, litter decomposers, white-rot and brown-rot fungi and mycorrhizal fungi. Although their real importance in lignocellulose decomposition is still unknown, their high expression level in the presence of lignocelluloses and substantial synergistic enhancement of cellulose hydrolysis in cooperation with other cellulolytic enzymes seems to indicate their active involvement in cellulose hydrolysis. In a recent report, polysaccharide monooxygenase genes have been reported from litter metatranscriptomes, and their involvement in litter decomposition thus seems likely.

Ratio estimators were based on biomass sample trees, and utilized density data from outerwood basic density surveys which were available for 35 tree species sampled throughout New Zealand. Foliage and branch (<10 cm in diameter over bark) dry matter were estimated directly from tree DBH. Tree fern above ground dry matter was estimated using allometric equations based on DBH and H.

Although benefic effects have been reported on soil stabilization, a lack of information about their impact on soil symbiotic microorganisms still remains. This investigation has been carried out in a semiarid Sahel region and aimed to survey the abundance and diversity of natural legume-nodulating rhizobia (LNR) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities in soil samples from deforested and man-made forest systems. A genetically diverse LNR population is supported by the phylogenetic analysis, which clustered the isolates into three genera: Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium. The results showed that the man-made forest systems increased the LNR abundance and genetic diversity as well as the soil phosphorus and nitrogen contents. By contrast, strong modifications have been recorded in the characteristics of the AM fungal communities. The number of AM fungus taxa as well as the mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) of soils decreased drastically in the man-made forest systems in comparison with the deforested land. In addition, the larger-spored AM fungi (Scutellospora and Gigaspora) were specifically found in soil samples from the deforested land. The displacement of larger-spored species was associated with a concomitant proliferation of small spored (Glomus) species. We conclude that man-made forestry can modify the soil symbiotic microorganisms and the results support the need for further adoption of management practices that could improve or sustain the development of herbaceous layers to promote the soil AM fungal communities.

We appraised the AM infection intensity of root cortex and spore density in the soil in sites over tropical successional gradients (grassland. secondary forest and mature forest) for several years in Araucaria. Atlantic and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. The intensity of AM infection decreased with advancing successional stages in all ecosystems and it was around 60-80% in early stages of succession, 37-56% in secondary forests and 19-29% in mature forests. Similarly, the AM spore number also decreased with advancing succession and was the highest in early stages (73-123 g(-1)). intermediate in secondary forests (32-54 g(-1)) and lowest in the mature forests (10-23 g(-1)). To verify whether such reductions influenced the potential of AM inoculum in soil, seedlings of Heliocarpus popayanensis (Malvaceae) were grown as test plants in soils obtained from five grasslands. five young secondary forests, and live mature forests in the Atlantic ecosystem. The soil inocula from the grasslands and secondary forests were 7.6 and 5.7 times more effective in stimulating seedling growth than inocula from the mature forests, respectively. Our results show that plant species in grasslands and young secondary forests stimulate the multiplication of AM fungi. leading to a higher potential of the AM inoculum.

To allow for a better understanding of Glomeromycota, we have sequenced the mitochondrial DNA of G. rosea. A comparison with Glomus mitochondrial genomes reveals that Glomeromycota undergo insertion and loss of mitochondrial plasmid-related sequences and exhibit considerable variation in introns. The gene order between the two species is almost completely reshuffled. Furthermore, Gigaspora has fragmented cox1 and ms genes, and an unorthodox initiator tRNA that is tailored to decoding frequent UUG initiation codons. For the fragmented cox1 gene, we provide evidence that its RNA is joined via group I mediated trans-splicing, whereas ms RNA remains in pieces. According to our model, the two cox1 precursor RNA pieces are brought together by flanking cox1 exon sequences that form a group I intron structure, potentially in conjunction with the nad5 intron 3 sequence. Finally, we present analyses that address the controversial phylogenetic association of Glomeromycota within fungi.

This study assessed the diversity and the nodulation ability of a collection of Lessertia root nodule bacteria isolated from different agro-climatic areas of the Eastern and Western Capes of South Africa. The diversity and phylogeny of 43 strains was determined via the partial sequencing of the dnaK, 16srRNA and nodA genes. A glasshouse experiment was undertaken to evaluate symbiotic relationships between six Lessertia species and 17 rhizobia strains. The dnaK and 16S rRNA genes of the majority of the strains clustered with the genus Mesorhizobium. The position of the strains at the intra-genus level was incongruent between phylogenies with few exceptions. The nodA genes from Lessertia spp. formed a cluster on their own, separate from the previously known Mesorhizobium nodA sequences. Strains showed differences in their nodulation and nitrogen fixation patterns that could be correlated with nodA gene phylogeny. L. diffusa, L. herbacea and L. excisa nodulated with nearly all the strains examined while L. capitata, L. incana and L. pauciflora were more stringent. Root nodule bacteria from Lessertia spp. were identified mainly as Mesorhizobium spp. Their nodA genes were unique and correlated with the nodulation and nitrogen fixation patterns of the strains. There were marked differences in promiscuity within Lessertia spp. and within strains of root nodule bacteria.","[Gerding, Macarena] Univ Concepcion, Fac Agron, Chillan, Chile; [O'Hara, Graham William; Nandasena, Kemanthie; Howieson, John Gregory] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Rhizobium Studies, Perth, WA, Australia; [Braeu, Lambert] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Australia","Gerding, M (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Agron, Chillan, Chile.",mgerding@udec.cl,"Brau, Lambert/J-3214-2018","Brau, Lambert/0000-0001-7105-8339",,,,92,15,16,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2012,358,2-Jan,,,,,385,401,,10.1007/s11104-012-1153-3,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,997TW,WOS:000308190400030,,,,,10/31/19J,"Vergani, C; Chiaradia, EA; Bischetti, GB",,,,"Vergani, C.; Chiaradia, E.

Data on root tensile resistance in combination with root density allow for the estimation of additional root cohesion, a parameter that is essential to account for the presence of vegetation on hillslopes and embankments. In this study, root resistance was investigated to expand our knowledge of the values typical of the Alpine environment and to assess the variability among species and within a given species. Seven tree species that are common in the Alpine environment (spruce fir, European larch, European beech, sweet chestnut, maple, ash and hornbeam) were sampled in various sites of Lombardia (northern Italy), and their force-diameter relationships were calculated and statistically compared. The values obtained fall within the same range as results from previous studies and confirm the power law relationships between root diameter and both breaking force and breaking stress, as commonly adopted. As a result of genetic factors, there is a statistically significant difference in resistance among the species studied, with a clear ranking order. The European beech is approximately two times more resistant than are ash, larch, sweet chestnut and spruce (the mean corrected breaking forces are 84 N and 47-40 N, respectively); the values for maple (65 N) and hornbeam (56 N) are intermediate. By comparing the force-diameter relationships obtained for a given species at different sampling sites, statistically significant differences have been observed in some cases but not in all, as a result of environmental constraints. A multiple regression analysis between force values and the main environmental factors was not able to explain such variability (except in a very partial way for site elevation), besides the effect of root diameter. By introducing the Forest District (which represents areas of fairly homogeneous growing conditions) as a criterion of discrimination, an explanation of within-species variability was obtained in most cases. Although the present data do not permit definitive conclusions, such an approach is viewed as promising for describing plant reinforcement variability, and Forest District appears to be a landscape criterion useful for assessing the stability of forested hillslopes.

The mature stand with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is located in the north-eastern German lowlands (Brandenburg). Soil carbon fluxes of the trenched and non-trenched plots were measured once a week with a closed chamber method to separate heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration. Annual wood increments were continuously measured by dendrometer bands. A strong correlation was found between observed and predicted soil respiration fluxes calculated on the basis of the measured soil temperatures and soil water contents. Carbon sequestration by accumulation in the aboveground biomass accounted for 1.67 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Including the C-sequestration in coarse roots the net primary production (NPP) increased to 2.0 Mg C per ha and year. Carbon release from soil by apparent heterotrophic respiration was overestimated due to higher soil moisture in the rootless trenching plots. Therefore we adjusted the apparent heterotrophic respiration by means of predicted water contents of the trenched plots, using a SVAT model. Accordingly the apparent heterotrophic respiration rate was 0.94 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) resulting in a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 1.06 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The net C loss from the soil carbon pool may be caused by higher temperatures, which were increased by 1.5 A degrees C during the observation period compared to the long-term temperature average (1961-1990). These short-term changes have to be regarded carefully interpreting measured carbon sequestration rates of forest ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.","[Schulte-Bisping, H.] Busgen Inst Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Beese, F.] Busgen Inst, Forest Ecosyst Res Ctr, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Dieffenbach-Fries, H.] German Fed Environm Agcy, D-63225 Langen, Germany","Schulte-Bisping, H (reprint author), Busgen Inst Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hschult1@gwdg.de,,,German Federal Environment Agency (UBA)University of Buenos Aires [FKZ 351 01 040],"This study was funded by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) under grant FKZ 351 01 040.

We examined root anatomical and hydraulic traits in five broad-leaved tree species with different drought tolerance, analyzed the relation between root anatomy and hydraulic conductivity and root embolism, and investigated the relation of these traits to the species' drought tolerance. In small-diameter roots (2-6 mm), we measured vessel diameters and vessel density, specific hydraulic conductivity, and the percental loss of conductivity (""native"" embolism) during summer in a mixed forest. Specific conductivity was positively related to vessel diameter but not to vessel density. Drought-tolerant Fraxinus showed the smallest mean vessel diameters and drought-sensitive Fagus the largest. Specific conductivity was highly variable among different similar-sized roots of the same species with a few roots apparently functioning as ""high-conductivity roots"". The results show that coexisting tree species can differ largely in root hydraulic traits with more drought-sensitive trees apparently having larger mean vessel diameters in their roots than tolerant species.

Because decaying wood is a remnant of the original forest and an important habitat for ECM fungal species, we examined ECM spruce roots and hyphae in 1-ha coarse woody debris (CWD) retention and removal plots (N =3) at a high elevation spruce forest 12 and 13 years after clearcut harvesting to test for a medium-term effect of CWD retention. Root tips from ten Picea engelmannii (Parry ex. Engelm.) saplings per plot were grouped morphologically, and the ECM fungal symbiont identified by Sanger sequencing. Sand-filled hyphae-trapping mesh bags were buried amongst the roots of saplings for one year. PCR product from all bags per plot was pooled and submitted for GS-FLX Titanium sequencing. Forty-six of 89 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from root tips and 50 OTUs from hyphae were identified as ECM taxa. The most abundant taxa amongst root tip OTUs were Thelephora terrestris, Alloclavaria purpurea, Amphinema byssoides, and Tylospora as terophora. The most abundant OTUs from mesh bags were ectomycorrhizal taxa, and the most abundant of these were A. byssoides,T. terrestris, Wilcoxina mikolae, and T. asterophora. The retention of CWD had no detectable effect on taxon richness, evenness or diversity of ECM fungi on root tips or in mesh bags; however, there was a detectable shift in species composition. The relative abundance of A. byssoides root tips was significantly higher at removal plots while A. purpurea was a significant indicator species for CWD removal. Our results suggest that the retention of CWD at the time of harvest has affected ECM habitat at this site, and has resulted in altered ECM species composition, even though the logs are still hard and intact.

However, soil C losses may also result from the accelerated turnover of young microbial tissues that are rich in nitrogen (N) relative to bulk SOM. We measured root-induced changes in soil C dynamics in a pine forest exposed to elevated CO2 and N enrichment by combining stable isotope analyses, molecular characterisations of SOM and microbial assays. We find strong evidence that the accelerated turnover of root-derived C under elevated CO2 is sufficient in magnitude to offset increased belowground inputs. In addition, the C losses were associated with accelerated N cycling, suggesting that trees exposed to elevated CO2 not only enhance N availability by stimulating microbial decomposition of SOM via priming but also increase the rate at which N cycles through microbial pools.","[Phillips, Richard P.; Meier, Ina C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47403 USA; [Meier, Ina C.] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Grandy, A.

To address the urgent need for increased understanding of responses in multifactorial experiments, this article synthesizes how ecosystem productivity and soil processes respond to combined warming and [ CO2 ] manipulation, and compares it with those obtained in single factor [ CO2 ] and temperature manipulation experiments. Across all combined elevated [ CO2 ] and warming experiments, biomass production and soil respiration were typically enhanced. Responses to the combined treatment were more similar to those in the [ CO2 ]-only treatment than to those in the warming-only treatment. In contrast to warming-only experiments, both the combined and the [ CO2 ]-only treatments elicited larger stimulation of fine root biomass than of aboveground biomass, consistently stimulated soil respiration, and decreased foliar nitrogen (N) concentration. Nonetheless, mineral N availability declined less in the combined treatment than in the [ CO2 ]-only treatment, possibly due to the warming-induced acceleration of decomposition, implying that progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) may not occur as commonly as anticipated from single factor [ CO2 ] treatment studies. Responses of total plant biomass, especially of aboveground biomass, revealed antagonistic interactions between elevated [ CO2 ] and warming, i.e. the response to the combined treatment was usually less-than-additive. This implies that productivity projections might be overestimated when models are parameterized based on single factor responses. Our results highlight the need for more (and especially more long-term) multifactor manipulation experiments. Because single factor CO2 responses often dominated over warming responses in the combined treatments, our results also suggest that projected responses to future global warming in Earth System models should not be parameterized using single factor warming experiments.","[Dieleman, Wouter I.

Many ecosystems are gaining some species and losing others, leading to large shifts in community composition. Plants that support nitrogen (N)-fixing symbionts (hereafter N-fixers) are major ecosystem drivers but human-induced environmental changes can lead to their loss; the impacts of this loss have seldom been studied. In New Zealand, the gain of some invasive herbivorous mammals leads to the loss of N-fixing shrubs that are pioneers during primary succession. 2. We studied primary successional surfaces caused by river floods and landslides in a remote valley in New Zealand's South Island. We set up and maintained a removal experiment over 10 years, with N-fixing Carmichaelia odorata (hereafter Carmichaelia) either left intact or removed to represent the effects that invasive herbivorous mammals could cause under high densities. 3. Above-ground effects of 10 years of Carmichaelia removal included a 7-fold reduction of woody plant biomass, but had no effect on the shorter non-woody vegetation. Foliar N concentrations of two woody species were also reduced. Carmichaelia removal reduced local or a-diversity but enhanced beta-diversity of the remaining vegetation at the functional group but not the species level. 4. Below-ground effects of 10 years of Carmichaelia removal included large reductions in soil carbon (C) and N levels, and biomass or abundance of several groups of soil biota occupying three consumer trophic levels as well as the root-, bacterial- and fungal-based energy channels. Invertebrate bacterial consumers were more adversely affected than were fungal consumers. Carmichaelia loss reduced a-diversity of some below-ground groups, while beta-diversity was unresponsive or enhanced. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal that loss of a single functionally distinct plant species, such as occurs through herbivore invasion, can cause substantial effects both above-ground and below-ground. This may affect the trajectory of the ecosystem over successional time, especially in primary seres that otherwise have very low soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) reservoirs. More generally, our results support the view that the simultaneous gains of some organisms (e.g. invasive herbivorous mammals) and resultant losses of others (e.g. palatable N-fixing plants) are a major element of human-induced global change that may be transforming many communities and ecosystems world-wide.","[St John, Mark G.; Bellingham, Peter J.; Bonner, Karen I.; Dickie, Ian A.; Morse, Chris W.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, NE, New Zealand; [Walker, Lawrence R.] Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Orwin, Kate H.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Soil & Ecosyst Ecol Lab, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Bellingham, PJ (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 40, Lincoln 7640, NE, New Zealand.",bellinghamp@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; , Kate/0000-0003-0906-728X",New Zealand Ministry of Science and Innovation (Ecosystem Resilience OBI); Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New Zealand,"Assistance in the field and laboratory was provided by M.

These fungi are supposedly ubiquitous in nature, infecting plants through airborne spores. As many foliar endophytes can also exist in soil, we hypothesized that there would be a strong similarity between root and shoot endophytes in any given plant species and that differences between plant species would be greater than those between organs within a species. 2. Leaf and root fungal endophyte communities were assessed in field-collected plants of three co-occurring grassland forbs (Cirsium arvense, Plantago lanceolata and Rumex acetosa) in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). The former two species are mycorrhizal, whilst the latter species is not so. 3. The highest fungal species richness was recorded from P. lanceolata with R. acetosa hosting the least endophyte diversity. Endophyte communities were more diverse in root than leaf tissues and in summer than in winter. Similarity of endophyte communities between different host plant species and organs within an individual host was very low. Negative correlations were found between mycorrhizal colonization and endophyte presence in the roots of C. arvense and P. lanceolata, suggesting some degree of antagonism or competition between the fungi. Consistent positive associations were found between the number of endophyte species in roots and shoots of plants. 4. Synthesis. In contrast to previous studies, the results show that many endophytes do not occur ubiquitously, but instead exhibit both plant and tissue specificity. There is a strong seasonal change in endophyte communities, but the differences between roots and shoots at any one time can be just as large. This dissimilarity suggests a lack of systemic growth by the fungi from one tissue to another. Mycorrhizas may interact negatively with other root endophytes, indicating that the latter should not be ignored in future mycorrhizal studies. We should begin to think of individual plants as ecosystems of interacting microbes, whose community is structured by plant genetics and environmental conditions, coupled with interactions between the microbes themselves.","[Wearn, James A.; Sutton, Brian C.; Morley, Neil J.; Gange, Alan C.] Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Wearn, JA (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Herbarium, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England.",j.wearn@kew.org,"Morley, Neil/E-4307-2010",,University of London; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council,We are grateful to the University of London Central Research Fund and the Natural Environment Research Council for funding this work and to Paul Kirk at CABI Bioscience and Hans de Gruyter at the Netherlands Plant Protection Service for aiding fungal identification and confirmation.,,48,55,58,1,110,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Land use history is an important factor when choosing suitable habitat, and lands with non-ectomycorrhizal host species are recommended when introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in order to reduce competition from native, soil-borne ectomycorrhizal (ECM) inoculum. Nearly every year Mediterranean wildfires cause the loss of forested lands where soil and climatic characteristics are suitable for truffle cultivation. Introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in these sites could promote reforestation with a native ECM fungus and, in addition, may provide economic incentives. We tested the viability of burnt forest lands for truffle cultivation by introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated Quercus ilex seedlings in burnt forest sites with and without resprouting forest species which act as repositories for native ECM fungi. We also evaluated the role of the ECM host plants, which resprout after a forest fire, in the maintenance and dynamic processes of the ECM fungal community. The study followed a factorial design with two levels: (1) T. melanosporum-inoculated and non-inoculated Q. ilex seedlings and (2) presence and absence of ECM host plants resprouting after the fire. We established 10 experimental plots with 360 holm oaks. After four and a half years, the truffle-inoculated holm oaks maintained 36 % of their root tips colonized with T. melanosporum, and 10 years after plantations, 26.2 % of the surviving inoculated holm oaks displayed a ""truffle burn"" area. A greater ECM morphotype richness was associated with seedlings planted in plots with the presence of ECM host plants, whereas the T. melanosporum mycorrhizal ratio was constant. These results suggest that reforestation with T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings can be successful following forest fires and highlights the competitiveness of this fungus within the ECM community in these soils.","[Martinez de Aragon, Juan; Fischer, Christine; Antonio Bonet, Jose; Olivera, Antoni; Oliach, Daniel; Colinas, Carlos] Ctr Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Antonio Bonet, Jose; Colinas, Carlos] Univ Lleida, Dept Prod Vegetal & Ciencia Forestal, Lleida 25198, Spain","de Aragon, JM (reprint author), Ctr Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Ctra St Llorenc Morunys,Km 2, Solsona 25280, Spain.",mtzda@ctfc.es; christine.fischer@ctfc.es; jantonio.bonet@ctfc.es; antoni.olivera@ctfc.es; daniel.oliach@ctfc.es; carlos.colinas@pvcf.udl.cat,"Bonet, Jose-Antonio/G-7951-2015; de Aragon, Juan Martinez/K-2631-2014; Colinas, Carlos/P-5457-2014; Olivera, Antoni/P-5818-2014","de Aragon, Juan Martinez/0000-0001-5663-2080; Colinas, Carlos/0000-0002-9113-8747; Olivera, Antoni/0000-0003-3220-9696; Bonet Lledos, Jose Antonio/0000-0003-2209-9374","Department of Agricultura, Ramaderia, Pesca, Alimentacio i Medi Natural de la Generalitat de Catalunya; Diputacio de Lleida","This research was funded by the Department of Agricultura, Ramaderia, Pesca, Alimentacio i Medi Natural de la Generalitat de Catalunya and by the Diputacio de Lleida.",,63,11,12,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,SEP,2012,43,6-May,,,SI,,615,630,,10.1007/s11056-012-9316-x,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,992YY,WOS:000307819000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, S; Fajardo, S; Ruiz-Diez, B; Fernandez-Pascual, M",,,,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana; Fajardo, Susana; Ruiz-Diez, Beatriz; Fernandez-Pascual, Mercedes",,,Differential effectiveness of novel and old legume-rhizobia mutualisms: implications for invasion by exotic legumes,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia; Bradyrhizobium; Cytisus; Nitrogen; Ulex,AUSTRALIAN ACACIA; SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DIFFUSION RESISTANCE; NATIVE RHIZOBIA; DIVERSITY; NODULES; BRADYRHIZOBIUM; MESORHIZOBIUM; COEVOLUTION,"The degree of specialization in the legume-rhizobium mutualism and the variation in the response to different potential symbionts are crucial factors for understanding the process of invasion by exotic legumes and the consequences for the native resident plants and bacteria. The enhanced novel mutualism hypothesis predicts that exotic invasive legumes would take advantage of native rhizobia present in the invaded soils. However, recent studies have shown that exotic legumes might become invasive by using exotic introduced microsymbionts, and that they could be a source of exotic bacteria for native legumes. To unravel the role of novel and old symbioses in the progress of invasion, nodulation and symbiotic effectiveness were analyzed for exotic invasive plants and native co-occurring legumes in a Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystem. Although most of the studied species nodulated with bacteria from distant origins these novel mutualisms were less effective in terms of nodulation, nitrogenase activity and plant growth than the interactions of plants and bacteria from the same origin. The relative effect of exotic bradyrhizobia was strongly positive for exotic invasive legumes and detrimental for native shrubs. We conclude that (1) the studied invasive legumes do not rely on novel mutualisms but rather need the co-introduction of compatible symbionts, and (2) since exotic rhizobia colonize native legumes in invaded areas, the lack of effectiveness of these novel symbiosis demonstrated here suggests that invasion can disrupt native belowground mutualisms and reduce native legumes fitness.","[Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana] Univ Coimbra, CFE, Dept Ciencias Vida, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Fajardo, Susana; Ruiz-Diez, Beatriz; Fernandez-Pascual, Mercedes] CSIC, ICA, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Rodriguez-Echeverria, S (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, CFE, Dept Ciencias Vida, Apartado 3046, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",susanare@ci.uc.pt,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/I-1730-2015","Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/0000-0002-2058-3229","European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, SpainJunta de Castilla y Leon [POII10-0211-5015]","This work was supported by the project MU-TUALNET (PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008), from the European Union and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, and the project POII10-0211-5015 from the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, Spain.

Yet little is known about the relationships between the amounts of resources stored in the roots and resprouting ability when the total aboveground part of plants/trees was fully removed or destroyed, and about the resprouting ability in relation to increasing elevation associated with decreasing site productivity. The present study investigated the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations and its pool size in roots of Quercus aquifolioides clumps grown at 3000 m, 3500 m, and 3950 m a.s.l. on Zheduo Mt., southwestern China, to test two competing hypotheses that (1) decreases in net primary productivity and growing season length with increasing elevation result in less allocation to storage of belowground NSC reserves, so that after coppicing, shrubs at higher elevations produce fewer resprouts and less total biomass than those at lower elevations, vs. (2) the shrubs growing at high-elevation sites with low-productivity produce more resprouts and biomass than those at low-elevation sites after coppicing, as it is expected that resprouting is favored in low-productivity environments. Our results indicated that early resprouting of Q aquifolioides shrubs after coppicing is largely determined by the initial carbohydrate pool but not by the carbohydrate concentrations in roots. The large resprouting vigor of this species may be mainly ascribed to its large ratios of root to shoot biomass or root NSC pool to shoot NSC pool. The resprouting vigor of clumps decreased significantly with increasing elevation, which corresponds to significant decreases in the root biomass or root NSC pool size per clump with increasing elevation. Resprouts self-thinned more early and rapidly in clumps at lower elevations than at higher elevations, which may be mainly resulted from competition occurred more early in the more productive sites at lower elevations compared to higher elevations. Our results support the 1st but not the 2nd hypothesis. The present study has important implications for resources storage dealing with ecophysiology-based management strategy of coppicing woodland across scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To understand how binding mechanisms interact to promote soil aggregation, the impacts of three tillage systems (no tillage (NT), ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT)) on soil aggregate binding agents (i.e., organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass and glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSPs)) and aggregation were studied in the black soil of Northeast China. Compared with CT, RT increased all the aggregate-associated SOC. and NT only increased the SOC in the microaggregates. However, the contents of microbial biomass and GRSPs within bulk soil and different aggregate fractions were higher in NT and RT than in CT. Among the four aggregate fractions, greater values of SOC, microbial biomass and easily extractable GRSP (EEGRSP) were found in microaggregates and macroaggregates, respectively; while the total GRSP (TGRSP) was distributed equally among aggregate fractions. Structural equation modelling revealed that SOC, microbial biomass, and GRSPs accounted for 79% of the variation in soil aggregation. Soil organic carbon influenced aggregate stability indirectly through the effects on MBC and MBN. Microbial biomass and glomalin were more important driving factors for aggregate stability in the RT and NT systems. Our results suggest that conservation tillage (RT and NT) is beneficial for soil structure due to its positive effects on aggregation processes in black soil region of Northeast China.

However, the detailed behavior of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON) and its antagonistic bacterium, Paenibacillus polymyxa SQR-21 (SQR-21), in the rhizosphere of watermelon after application of the bioorganic fertilizer had not been elucidated. A rhizobox experiment was carried out to investigate the distribution of FON and its antagonistic bacterium, SQR-21, in the soil at different distances from the watermelon rhizoplane by real-time PCR. The results confirmed that the bioorganic fertilizer (BIO) significantly suppressed Fusarium wilt and promoted the growth of the watermelon plants. Furthermore, we found that the application of BIO significantly enhanced the abundance of SQR-21 and reduced the population of FON in the soil near the rhizoplane as compared to the control. A maximal quantity (7.14 log(10)copies/g soil) of P. polymyxa SQR-21 was obtained in the rhizosphere under the BIO treatment, and this number was decreased with increasing distance from the rhizoplane. The population of FON in the rhizosphere of the control was 2 orders of magnitude higher than under the BIO treatment, and with increasing distance from the rhizoplane, the FON abundance increased in the SQR-21 inoculated treatments and decreased in the treatments without SQR-21. In the soil far from the rhizoplane (bulk soil), both FON and SQR-21 reached a level that was not statistically different between the treatments, which might be attributed to the background level of the infested soil. The localization and pattern of colonization of SQR-21 on the root surface was examined in an in vitro experiment by following green fluorescent protein (gfp)-labeled SQR-21. The colonization of P. polymyxa SQR-21 was found to occur at any site on the roots, yet it was preferentially found in defined regions of the root tip and root bend. These results revealed that the BIO applied with the developed method suppressed Fusarium wilt by the promotion of SQR-21 colonization in the rhizosphere, which largely reduced the population of the pathogen. The findings also indicated that the method of nursery application of BIO satisfies the ecological requirements of the biocontrol products. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Strategies to recover these areas include replanting native plant species, and symbiotic fungi from the neighboring area might be important for the establishment of the new vegetation. Species richness, diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated in NE Brazil in two natural areas, 'restinga' forest and seaside 'restinga', and in two areas of revegetated dunes after mining activity 20 and 8 years ago. Soil samples were collected during the dry (March) and wet (September) seasons of 2009 in Mataraca, Paraiba State, Brazil. Based on glomerospore morphology, 34 species of AMF were recorded, of which 29 were identified in field samples and five after trap culturing, with the greatest diversity and richness found in the dune revegetated 8 years ago. The sampling effort allowed an assessment of between 70 and 80 % of the species estimated for the areas by the first-order Jackknife index. Among the generalist species Gigaspora margarita was the only one found in all areas and during both collection periods. The similarity of AMF species between the revegetated areas and the seaside 'restinga' was > 60 %, supporting the hypothesis that this area represents a source of propagules, but the substrate used for seedling production may also bring other species, enabling the recovery of the AMF community in the mined and revegetated dunes.","[Alves da Silva, Danielle Karla; Rabelo Pereira, Camilla Maciel; de Souza, Renata Gomes; Maia, Leonor Costa] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Biol Fungos, Dept Micol, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Oehl, Fritz] Fed Res Inst Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","da Silva, DKA (reprint author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Biol Fungos, Dept Micol, Av Prof Nelson Chaves S-N, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil.",daniellekarlas@yahoo.com.br,"MAIA, LEONOR/E-6992-2013; MAIA, LEONOR/I-2172-2012; Herbario Virtual, Inct/J-8725-2013; Alves da Silva, Danielle Karla/J-7734-2012; Silva, Gladstone/E-5110-2013","Alves da Silva, Danielle Karla/0000-0001-9890-1285; Silva, Gladstone/0000-0002-5652-7800; Maia, Leonor/0000-0003-0095-5758; Maciel Rabelo Pereira, Camilla/0000-0002-7027-7430",CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPESCAPES [23038.036344/2008-91]; CNPq/INCT Herbario Virtual da Flora e dos Fungo,"The authors thank: the Millennium Inorganic Chemicals - a Cristal Company for logistical support; CNPq for masters, doctoral and research scholarships given to C.

Phenotypic variation in traits, arising from ""constitutive"" genetically based variation and from environmental influences on gene expression, or phenotypic plasticity, could affect inferences about community assembly. We found significant trait plasticity in 12 focal species across four species-interaction treatments grown in four soil environments. Phylogenetic signal in traits was present, but was also dependent on species-interactor treatment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and plant neighborhood could affect the ability to detect and interpret community phylogenetic patterns of trait variation. Individuals competing with conspecifics expressed significant divergence in specific leaf area (SLA) relative to when they were grown alone. Combined with the observation that competition is stronger between close relatives than between distant relatives in some soils, these results suggest that trait plasticity may be an adaptive response to competition. To test this hypothesis, we examined total biomass in a pot, relative to the predicted biomass of two individuals grown alone, and related pot biomass to phylogenetic distance of the interactor treatment, as well as to divergence in SLA and root : shoot ratio. Within competition treatments, only plastic divergence in root : shoot ratio in one interactor treatment was correlated with increased productivity, and only in one soil type. We also tested whether, across all treatments, divergence in SLA or root : shoot ratio increased pot productivity. We found that ""community"" productivity was positively influenced both by phylogenetic distance to competitor, as well as by divergence in root : shoot ratio due to both plasticity and constitutive differences. Phenotypic plasticity resulting in trait divergence may increase the ability of plants to coexist and may also decrease phylogenetic signal in community assembly at small spatial scales.","[Burns, Jean H.; Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Burns, JH (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",jbm122@case.edu,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",Center for Population Biology; College of Biological Sciences at the University of California-Davis; California Agricultural Experiment Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); American Association of University Women; Case Western Reserve University,"Special thanks to D.

Within-row spacings were chosen as 4, 8 and 12 cm to analyze the effect of seedlings density on growth performance. Seedling spacing significantly affected root collar diameter, shoot height, tap root length and number of fine roots in A. communis and P avium, but not in P elaeagnifolia and E. tribolatus. Additionally wider seedling spacings resulted in larger seedlings in A. communis and P avium. In conclusion, it would be beneficial to use wider seedling spacing in order to obtain better seedling growth in A. communis and P avium. Larger seedlings could also provide significant advantages because of reduced cultural activities and an expected higher growth and survival rate.","[Yucedag, C.] Bartin Univ, Fac Engn, TR-74100 Bartin, Turkey; [Yucedag, C.; Gailing, O.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Yucedag, C (reprint author), Bartin Univ, Fac Engn, TR-74100 Bartin, Turkey.",yucedagc@gmail.com,"Gailing, Oliver/X-2690-2019","Gailing, Oliver/0000-0002-4572-2408",,,,27,1,1,0,7,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,,,FOREST SYST,For.

In this study, P. parasitica var. nicotianae was successfully controlled in vitro and in vivo by a newly isolated strain, Paenibacillus polymyxa C5, which is a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and an effective biocontrol agent. Pot experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of a novel bio-organic fertilizer (BIO), produced by the solid fermentation of organic fertilizer amended P. polymyxa C5, on the control of tobacco black shank. In comparison with the control, the disease incidence was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by 50% with the application of BIO. P. polymyxa C5 was tagged with a plasmid-borne gfp gene to investigate its colonization behavior on tobacco roots in a natural soil system. As determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, P. polymyxa C5 formed a biofilm on the tobacco roots growing in soil, both on the root tip and elongation zone but not inside the roots. It is speculated that the colonization of tobacco roots by P. polymyxa C5 is one of the mechanisms for the protection of tobacco plants from fungal infection.","[Ren, Xiaoli; Zhang, Nan; Cao, Minghui; Wu, Kai; Shen, Qirong; Huang, Qiwei] Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Ren, XL (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qwhuang@njau.edu.cn,,,"Agricultural Ministry of ChinaMinistry of Agriculture, China [201103004]; Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31070462]",This research was financially supported by the Agricultural Ministry of China (201103004) and the Nature Science Foundation of China (31070462).,,47,25,41,2,66,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Vertical niche differentiation belowground might be one potential mechanism for such complementarity. However, most studies that have analysed the diversity/productivity relationship and belowground niche differentiation have done so for fully occupied sites, not very young tree communities that are in the process of occupying belowground space. Here we used a 5-6 year old forest diversity experiment to analyse how fine-root (< 2 mm) production in ingrowth cores (0-30 cm) was influenced by tree species identity, as well as the species diversity and richness of tree neighbourhoods. Fine-root production during the first growing season after the installation of ingrowth cores increased slightly with tree species diversity, and four-species combinations produced on average 94.8% more fine-root biomass than monocultures. During the second growing season, fine-root mortality increased with tree species diversity, indicating an increased fine-root turnover in species-rich communities. The initial overyielding was attributable to the response to mixing by the dominant species, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea abies, which produced more fine roots in mixtures than could be expected from monocultures. In species-rich neighbourhoods, P. abies allocated more fine roots to the upper soil layer (0-15 cm), whereas P. menziesii produced more fine roots in the deeper layer (15-30 cm) than in species-poor neighbourhoods. Our results indicate that, although there may be no lasting overyielding in the fine-root production of species-diverse tree communities, increasing species diversity can lead to substantial changes in the production, vertical distribution, and turnover of fine roots of individual species.","[Lei, Pifeng; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Fac Forest & Environm Sci, Inst Silviculture, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Lei, Pifeng] Cent S Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Lei, PF (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Forest & Environm Sci, Inst Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",pifeng.lei@yahoo.com; michael.scherer@biologie.uni-freiburg.de; juergen.bauhus@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); University of Freiburg,"We are grateful to Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, for the permission to use the BIOTREE experiment, and to D.

A total of 102 bradyrhizobial strains were isolated from the root nodules of soybeans cultivated in 12 locations in Nepal varying in climate and soil properties, and their genetic diversity was examined based on 16S rDNA, ITS regions of 16S-23S rDNA, nodC and nifH. In vitro growth properties of some representative strains were examined to elucidate their characteristic distribution in Nepal. Four species of the genus Bradyrhizobium were isolated, and B. japonicum dominated at temperate locations, while in subtropical locations, B. elkanii, B. yuanmingense, and B. liaoningense dominated at acidic, moderately acidic, and slightly alkaline soils, respectively. The relative nodule occupancies could not be fully explained by their in vitro growth properties. Similar nodC and nifH genes among the strains suggested co-evolution of these genes also in Nepal, probably through horizontal gene transfer. The influence of climate and soil pH on diversity at the sub-species level was revealed. It is concluded that the highly diverse climate and soils in Nepal might be conducive for the existence of diverse soybean rhizobial strains.","[Adhikari, Dinesh; Kaneto, Masakazu; Itoh, Kazuhito; Suyama, Kousuke] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Adhikari, Dinesh; Pokharel, Bhanu B.; Gaihre, Yam K.] Nepal Agr Res Council, Kathmandu, Nepal","Itoh, K (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",itohkz@life.shimane-u.ac.jp,"Gaihre, Yam/V-4183-2019","Gaihre, Yam/0000-0001-7716-5733",,,,47,31,35,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2012,357,2-Jan,,,,,131,145,,10.1007/s11104-012-1134-6,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,976AK,WOS:000306552700012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Alber, A; Ehlting, B; Ehlting, J; Hawkins, BJ; Rennenberg, H",,,,"Alber, A.; Ehlting, B.; Ehlting, J.; Hawkins, B.

We compared fluxes of nitrate and ammonium in white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] roots, measured using a non-invasive microelectrode ion flux measurement system (MIFE), and transcript abundance of ammonium and nitrate transporter genes in roots, determined by real time PCR. Seedlings were pretreated with water, or 50 mu M or 1,500 mu M NH4NO3 + 200 mu M CaSO4 + 25 mu M KH2PO4. Measurements were made on seedling roots 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-30 mm from the root tip. As ammonium and nitrate transporter family members in spruce are still uncharacterized, primers for real time PCR were designed to cover one family with each set of primers (AMT1, AMT2, NRT1, NRT2). The expression patterns obtained by real time PCR differed significantly among transporter family, treatments and root segments. Expression of AMT1 did not show a relationship with distance from the root tip, but the expression of AMT2 was generally greater 0-5 mm from the root tip than in segments farther from the tip. Expression of NRT1 was greatest 10-30 mm from the root tip, while expression of NRT2 was greatest 5-10 mm from the tip in all treatments, except the 1,500 mu M NH4NO3 treatment. MIFE measurements showed the highest N uptake and proton efflux near the root tip and declining fluxes with increased distance from the root tip in the 50 mu M N treatment. Significant net ammonium efflux was observed from some root segments in the 1,500 mu M N treatment. Transporter gene expression and ion fluxes were not correlated. Though the measured net fluxes of ammonium were greater than the measured net fluxes of nitrate, the nitrate transporters were, in general, more highly expressed than the ammonium transporters.","[Alber, A.; Ehlting, B.; Ehlting, J.; Hawkins, B.

Sexes might differ in either or both of these responses for homologous traits, which in turn has consequences for sexual dimorphism and its evolution. Here, we investigate both immediate changes in and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in response to a changing environment (with and without fluctuations) using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We investigate sex differences in plasticity and also the genetic architecture of body mass and developmental time dimorphism to test two existing hypotheses on sex differences in plasticity (adaptive canalization hypothesis and condition dependence hypothesis). We found a decreased sexual size dimorphism in higher temperature and that females responded more plastically than males, supporting the condition dependence hypothesis. However, selection in a fluctuating environment altered sex-specific patterns of genetic and environmental variation, indicating support for the adaptive canalization hypothesis. Genetic correlations between sexes (rMF) were affected by fluctuating selection, suggesting facilitated independent evolution of the sexes. Thus, the selective past of a population is highly important for the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of sexual dimorphism.","[Hallsson, L.

We investigated mycorrhizal Sebacinales (Basidiomycota) of 67 individuals of Ericaceae and Orchidaceae in a tropical mountain ecosystem in Southern Ecuador to provide a first estimate of whether these fungi are particularly diverse in the Northern Andes. We partially sequenced the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA and analyzed them together with all Sebacinales sequences available from GenBank. The clustering optimization technique was used to determine clustering parameters that maximize the comparability between molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) obtained from the distinct loci. Sampling effort and species richness were estimated with rarefaction-accumulation curves and non-parametric estimation using Chao2 and compared between Southern Ecuador and France. Clustering optimization indicated that a 1% LSU distance threshold corresponds to the commonly used 3% dissimilarity threshold for ITS, and that a clustering algorithm close to single-linkage clustering is optimal. The resulting clusters show that about 8-9% of observed Sebacinales MOTUs occur in the study area and that most of these MOTUs are endemic (74%). The widespread MOTUs from Southern Ecuador were also found in Panama, North America and Europe. The estimation of species richness revealed unsaturated sampling of Sebacinales in general and also in our study area. Our results suggest a high diversity of Sebacinales associated with Ericaceae and Orchidaceae at the study site in Southern Ecuador, but no hotspot of Sebacinales in comparison with other areas.","[Setaro, Sabrina D.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA; [Garnica, Sigisfredo] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Onkol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Herrera, Paulo I.; Suarez, Juan Pablo] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Ctr Biol Celular & Mol, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Goeker, Markus] DSMZ German Collect Microorganisms & Cell Culture, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany","Setaro, SD (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, 1834 Wake Forest Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA.",setarosd@wfu.edu,"Sigisfredo, Garnica/P-6506-2014; Suarez, Juan Pablo/D-1839-2009","Suarez, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-9453-5545; Goker, Markus/0000-0002-5144-6200","UTPL in Loja, Ecuador; DFG as part of the research unit [FOR 816]","We thank Jim Luteyn and Paola Pedraza for help with species identification of Neotropical Ericaceae and Michael Weiss for kindly providing Sebacinales-specific primers.

Mechanically, plant roots reinforce soil along a slope by providing cohesion (c(r)). c(r) is usually estimated using either of two models: a Wu and Waldron's Model (WWM) or a Fiber Bundle Model (FBM). The WWM assumes that all fine and medium roots break simultaneously during shearing, whereas the FBM assumes progressive breakage of these roots. Both models are based on measurements of root density (RD), root tensile strength (T-r) and root orientation (R-f). RD is highly variable and influences c(r) significantly more than the other variables. We investigated RD in a mixed forest stand dominated by Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba growing at an altitude of 1400 m and a mixed stand of Abies alba and Picea abies located at 1700 m. We assumed that our sites were composed of different plant functional groups, i.e. (1) only trees and shrubs were present and (2) trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants coexisted within the same site. Results showed that RD was significantly influenced by soil depth, tree spatial density and species composition. c(r) was then estimated by the WWM and three different FBMs; each FBM differed in the manner that load was apportioned to the roots (as a function of root cross-sectional area (CSA), root diameter or number of intact roots). Results showed that c(r) values differed significantly depending on the model used: c(r) (FBM, root number)< c(r) (FBM, root diameter)< c(r) (FBM, root CSA)< c(r) (WWM). Through a meta-analysis of literature data relating to changes in T-r with root diameter, we found that compared with other factors, plant functional group had a limited effect on the estimation of c(r). The use of a generic equation for T-r is therefore justified when studying the stability of temperate forested slopes with mixed species. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies at 48 sites across four continents that used enriched N-15 isotope tracers in order to synthesize information about total ecosystem N retention (i.e., total ecosystem N-15 recovery in plant and soil pools) across natural systems and N partitioning among ecosystem pools. The greatest recoveries of ecosystem N-15 tracer occurred in shrublands (mean, 89.5%) and wetlands (84.8%) followed by forests (74.9%) and grasslands (51.8%). In the short term (<1 week after N-15 tracer application), total ecosystem N-15 recovery was negatively correlated with fine-root and soil N-15 natural abundance, and organic soil C and N concentration but was positively correlated with mean annual temperature and mineral soil C:N. In the longer term (3-18 months after N-15 tracer application), total ecosystem N-15 retention was negatively correlated with foliar natural-abundance N-15 but was positively correlated with mineral soil C and N concentration and C:N, showing that plant and soil natural-abundance N-15 and soil C:N are good indicators of total ecosystem N retention. Foliar N concentration was not significantly related to ecosystem N-15 tracer recovery, suggesting that plant N status is not a good predictor of total ecosystem N retention. Because the largest ecosystem sinks for N-15 tracer were below ground in forests, shrublands, and grasslands, we conclude that growth enhancement and potential for increased C storage in aboveground biomass from atmospheric N deposition is likely to be modest in these ecosystems. Total ecosystem N-15 recovery decreased with N fertilization, with an apparent threshold fertilization rate of 46 kg N.ha(-1).yr(-1) above which most ecosystems showed net losses of applied N-15 tracer in response to N fertilizer addition.","[Templer, P.

At small spatial scales, however, it remains difficult to differentiate the underlying causes of plant delta N-15 variability and this limits the application of such measurements to better understand N cycling. We conducted a landscape-scale analysis of delta N-15 values from 31 putatively N-limited monospecific black spruce (Picea mariana) stands in central Alaska to assess the two main hypothesized sources of plant delta N-15 variation: differing sources and ECM fractionation. We found roughly 20% of the variability in black spruce foliar N and delta N-15 values to be correlated with the concentration and delta N-15 values of soil NH4 (+) and dissolved organic N (DON) pools, respectively. However, N-15-based mixing models from 24 of the stands suggested that fractionation by ECM fungi obscures the N-15 signature of soil N pools. Models, regressions, and N abundance data all suggested that increasing dependence on soil DON to meet black spruce growth demands predicates increasing reliance on ECM-derived N and that black spruce, on average, received 53% of its N from ECM fungi.

Some of these interactions are facultative symbioses, in which one partner is not essential to the other. Facultative symbioses are expected to be transitional stages along an evolutionary trajectory toward obligate relationships. We tested this evolutionary theory prediction in Ca. Glomeribacter gigasporarum, nonessential endosymbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota). We found that heritable facultative mutualisms can be both ancient and evolutionarily stable. We detected significant patterns of codivergence between the partners that we would only expect in obligate associations. Using codiverging partner pairs and the fungal fossil record, we established that the GlomeromycotaGlomeribacter symbiosis is at least 400 million years old. Despite clear signs of codivergence, we determined that the Glomeribacter endobacteria engage in recombination and host switching, which display patterns indicating that the association is not evolving toward reciprocal dependence. We postulate that low frequency of recombination in heritable endosymbionts together with host switching stabilize facultative mutualisms over extended evolutionary times.","[Mondo, Stephen J.; Toomer, Kevin H.; Pawlowska, Teresa E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Morton, Joseph B.] W Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59802 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Mondo, SJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tep8@cornell.edu,,"Mondo, Stephen/0000-0001-5797-0647",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0918880],"We thank V.

We observed a total of 27 EcM fungal taxa. Atheliaceae and Rhizopogon were the dominant taxa on exposed DG slopes. The fungal species compositions were similar between habitats (0.59 as calculated by the Morishita-Horn index). Fourteen fungal taxa were common to both habitats, and these accounted for more than 90% of the relative abundance in each habitat. There were no significant differences in relative abundance and colonization frequency of each EcM fungal taxon between the habitats, except for Russula sp. 2, which was significantly more frequent in habitat F than in habitat S.

Does early arrival aid in species ability to tolerate water stress? Is intra- and interspecific competition different for early and late arrivers? Location Greenhouse, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado, USA. Methods A 1-mo head start in the greenhouse was used to simulate early arrival of Panicum capillare and Polygonum persicaria. We used a completely randomized design to examine the effects of water stress (drained, drought, flood) and priority competition (interspecific and intraspecific) in relation to species cohort [older (established) and younger (novel) individuals planted in different combinations]. We calculated increases in root and shoot weights, total biomass, root/shoot ratios, height, leaf number and length of longest leaf. All dependent variables were analysed using MANOVA and individual GLM ANOVAs. Results Increases in shoot and root biomass were significantly affected by water stress but the effects were species- and priority level-specific. Root biomass for established individuals was significantly reduced after flooding and drought. Shoot biomass was least for drought and flood treatments of both older and younger P. persicaria, but older and younger P. capillare were unaffected. There were species-specific priority differences (i.e. greater for older individuals) for shoot height and increases in leaf number; however, the opposite was seen for increases in leaf length. Conclusions In terms of community assembly, neither species appears to have an advantage in relation to competition or water stress, as both seem plastic and are negatively affected by flood and drought stress. The greater impact of older P. persicaria on P. capillare is the only advantage P. persicaria seems to have in the greenhouse. Correlating this to natural conditions, it appears that chance in reaching a site first plays a major role in P. persicaria's colonization success. This study provides evidence of the impacts of arrival time on subsequent physiological and competitive abilities of plants.","[Moore, James E.] Christian Bros Univ, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38104 USA; [Franklin, Scott B.] Univ No Colorado, Sch Biol Sci, Greeley, CO 80639 USA","Moore, JE (reprint author), Christian Bros Univ, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38104 USA.",jmoore25@cbu.edu; scott.franklin@unco.edu,,,,,,56,12,12,3,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

To date, however, these direct and feedback effects have been evaluated separately. What is the relative importance of endophyte infection vs endophyte-mediated plantsoil feedback effects on competition between seedlings of the grass tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and common species of American Midwestern old-field successional grasslands? Location Long-term field experimental plots at the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve and greenhouse of Indiana University (Bloomington, IN, USA). Methods Endophyte-free (E-) and endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue seedlings were grown individually and in intraspecific competition and pair-wise interspecific competition. Endophyte-mediated plantsoil feedback effects were incorporated by growing seedlings in soil conditioned by either E or E+ tall fescue. Results We found that E and E+ tall fescue experienced stronger intra- and interspecific competition when competing in self-conditioned soils. This pattern was consistent regardless of competitor identity. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the direct benefits of endophyte infection do not drive competitive responses of tall fescue at the early stages of plant development, at least under the conditions examined in our study. Rather, negative plantsoil feedbacks may be more important in moderating plant responses to competitive interactions during seedling establishment of this species. Explicit manipulation of factors such as herbivory and abiotic stress is an important future direction for studies evaluating the relative importance of endophyte infection vs soil-mediated endophyte effects on host plant performance.","[Padilla, Francisco M.] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas CSIC, E-04120 La Canada De San Urbano, Almeria, Spain; [Mattingly, W.

Herbaceous annual species were excavated whole, while tree species were studied as seedlings in the field or as trap plants in pot experiments. Nodules were examined by microscopy to confirm their effectiveness and to determine their internal structure. Bacteria isolated from the nodules were authenticated on their original hosts and were identified on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the neighbour-joining method. We studied 35 of more than 50 species of native legume reported from these areas. Legumes are drought escaping (annual species), drought tolerant perennials or trees possessing deep root systems and other adaptations to arid conditions. Nodulation was recorded in all members of the Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae, but only one species of Caesalpinioideae. Internal structure of nodules varied within these groups, especially with respect to the presence or absence of uninfected cells in the infected region. Full 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the nodules harboured a range of nodulating bacteria belonging to the genera Sinorhizobium, Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, within which they formed separate sub clades. This study extends the range of legumes known to grow and nodulate in semi-arid regions, and provides information about their endosymbionts.","[Gehlot, Hukam S.; Panwar, Dheeren; Tak, Nisha; Tak, Alkesh; Sankhla, Indu S.; Poonar, Neetu; Parihar, Rashmita; Shekhawat, Narpat S.] JN Vyas Univ, Dept Bot, BNF & Stress Biol Lab, Jodhpur 342001, Rajasthan, India; [Kumar, Mahesh] Cent Arid Zone Res Inst, Div Nat Resources & Environm, Jodhpur 3420033, Rajasthan, India; [Tiwari, Ravi; Ardley, Julie] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Rhizobium Studies, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [James, Euan K.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Sprent, Janet I.] Univ Dundee JHI, Div Plant Sci, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Gehlot, HS (reprint author), JN Vyas Univ, Dept Bot, BNF & Stress Biol Lab, Jodhpur 342001, Rajasthan, India.",hsgehlot@gmail.com,"Tak, Nisha/P-7874-2019; GEHLOT, Hukam Singh/H-7529-2019; James, Euan/K-1135-2012","Sankhla, Dr Indu Singh/0000-0001-5131-6345; Gehlot, Hukam/0000-0001-7447-4960; Tiwari, Ravi/0000-0003-3354-770X; James, Euan/0000-0001-7969-6570","University Grants Commission (UGC)University Grants Commission, India; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaGovernment of India [BT/PR11461/AGR/21/270/2008]","Dheeren Panwar, Indu S.

One possible explanation is that large-seeded species have larger seedlings, which provide an advantage under drier conditions. We address the following questions: is seed mass correlated with seedling survival in annual legumes? Is this correlation influenced by the watering regime? Can seedling growth characteristics explain the differential survival of small- and large-seeded species? Location Annual Mediterranean grassland, Central Spain. Methods An experiment was conducted with six grassland legume species of different seed sizes, subjected to six different watering regimes, monitoring survival and morphological variables (shoot and root growth) for 40 d. Results Large seeds provide an advantage for seedling survival, but in extreme drought conditions, seedling survival in small-seeded species equals that of seedlings from large-seeded species. Seedlings from larger seeds are larger than those of small-seeded species, but have a lower root/shoot biomass ratio, leading to greater potential evapotranspiration, which could explain their loss of relative advantage under extreme droughts. Conclusion The hypothesis that seedlings from large-seeded species survive better than small-seeded species under drought conditions was not supported. Germination behaviour seems to be a more plausible explanation for the increased abundance in the field of large-seeded species in growing seasons with dry autumns.","[Peco, Begona] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Arellano, Gabriel] Real Jardin Bot CSIC, E-28014 Madrid, Spain","Peco, B (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",garellano@rjb.csic.es; begonna.peco@uam.es,"Arellano, Gabriel/Z-3549-2019; Peco, Begona/C-1197-2012","Arellano, Gabriel/0000-0003-3990-5344; Peco, Begona/0000-0003-2149-1438","Spanish Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN) [CGL2007-63382, CGL2011-24871]; Madrid Regional Government [S2009-AMB-1783]; Spanish Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [PR2011-0491]","Special thanks to Iker Dobarro for assistance with laboratory equipment and the phytotron, and for valuable comments on physiology of the plants involved.

This study investigated the effect of organic compounds on carbon and nitrogen dynamics and their relationship with pH changes in two soils differing in initial soil pH (Podosol of pH 4.5 and Tenosol of pH 6.2). Seven organic compounds representing common compounds in decomposing plant residues or root exudates were added to the soils and incubated for 60 d. The largest cumulative soil respiration occurred when glucose, malic acid and citric acid were added. In addition, the Tenosol had the greater respiration compared to the Podosol. The addition of organic acids (acetic, malic, citric, ferulic and benzoic acid) instantly decreased soil pH due to the dissociation of H+ from the acids. The pH of both soils was then restored over time, which was positively correlated with decomposition % of these compounds. The pH of the Tenosol amended with all the organic acids and of the Podosol with malic acid exceeded that of the control, and net alkalization occurred, with the degree of alkalization being greater with malic and citric acid. Adding organic acids to the Tenosol generally increased NH4 concentrations but decreased NO3 concentrations. The addition of glucose decreased pH in Podosol but slightly increased it in the Tenosol. The addition of glucosamine hydrochloride decreased pH due to significant nitrification. The results suggest that the addition of organic acids stimulates microbial NO3 uptake, and ammonification and decomposition of indigenous soil organic matter, resulting in a priming effect on alkalinity release, and that the degree of the priming effect is influenced by the type of organic acid and initial soil pH.

Archontophoenix alexandrae and Euterpe edulis are palm species used in southern Brazil to produce the palm heart, the latter being included in the list of threatened species due to the overexploitation of its native population. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on growth and physiological parameters of A. alexandrae and E. edulis. After germination, the seedlings were inoculated (AMF) or not (CTL) with AMF in the treatments. Values of chlorophyll content, biomass and shoot phosphorus were not statistically different between the AMF and CTL treatments, after five months in the greenhouse. Inoculation with AMF significantly increased the levels of starch and soluble carbohydrates in shoots and roots of both species. Under field conditions, AMF had no effect on stem diameter and height after 12 and 24 months, but total plant biomass and leaf, stem and root biomass were greater in AMF than in CTL plants. The data indicated that AMF inoculation in the nursery has a strong effect on biomass accumulation after growing for 24 months under field conditions. Therefore, AMF inoculation should be considered an important strategy to increase growth and production of these economically important tropical palm species.","[Sgrott, Andressa Franzoi; Booz, Maristela R.] Univ Reg Blumenau FURB, Programa Posgrad Engn Ambiental, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil; [Pescador, Rosete] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Fitotecnia, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Heck, Teresinha Catarina] EPAGRI, BR-88301970 Itajai, SC, Brazil; [Stuermer, Sidney Luiz] Univ Reg Blumenau FURB, DCN, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil","Sgrott, AF (reprint author), Univ Reg Blumenau FURB, Programa Posgrad Engn Ambiental, Caixa Postal 1507, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil.",dessa.biologia@gmail.com; maristela.rb@terra.com.br; rosete@cca.ufsc.br; tcheck@epagri.sc.gov.br; sturmer@furb.br,"Sturmer, Sidney/O-2616-2019",,CAPESCAPES; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [302667/2009-1],"This work is part of the first author's M.Sc. in Environmental Engineering.

We explore land cover effects on recharge processes and rate in Hawai'i, where precipitation on the mountain slopes of leeward Hawai'i Island recharges the aquifer that is the sole source of water for coastal communities. Applying a water balance, we quantify the influences of native forest and cattle pasture on recharge using measurements of precipitation and the drivers of evapotranspiration taken over 18 months. Surface runoff is negligible in these highly permeable basalt watersheds, simplifying fluxes into and out of the recharge area. On the basis of our analysis of measured fluxes, groundwater recharge is 96% of rainfall in pasture, 87% of above-canopy rainfall in open forest, and 106% of above-canopy rainfall in dense forest. Differences in recharge among vegetation types result largely from direct interception of cloud water by native Hawaiian forest. The majority of rainfall occurs in infrequent, large storms, so water moves quickly beyond plant rooting depth, limiting its availability for evapotranspiration. Potential evapotranspiration is low, as its drivers are modest and constant throughout the year. Existing estimates of submarine groundwater discharge support our conclusion that the rainfall-to-recharge ratio is close to one for all sites. Identifying primary influences on the recharge-to-rainfall ratio is key to predicting the types of changes that will have substantial effects on recharge. In any tropical setting with young, porous substrates, precipitation is likely to play a dominant role in the magnitude and variability of groundwater recharge; here, land-use changes that affect local precipitation, such as an increase in fog interception, will play a larger role than vegetation shifts that affect evapotranspiration.

Since the primary cost associated with this control method is labor, identifying factors that improve efficacy is important. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of glyphosate concentration and soil moisture on the control of buckthorn using the cut-stump method. More than 600 mature buckthorn plants were cut and treated with glyphosate at concentrations between 0 and 41% active ingredient during October in soils varying from dry to moist. While increased glyphosate concentration improved control rates, soil moisture played a dominant role. In moist soils, the impact of glyphosate concentration was insignificant (z=-1.723, p=0.085), and between 40% and 60% of treated buckthorn plants escaped control at all glyphosate concentrations. In dry soils, however, control rates increased significantly with higher concentrations of glyphosate (z=-8.84, p < 10-15), achieving up to 98% control with 41% glyphosate. Root exudates of two three-year old field-grown buckthorn seedlings that were treated with high glyphosate concentrations in dry soils using cut-stump treatments contained detectable glyphosate comparable to control rates of mature plants. These results suggest that using the highest labeled concentration of herbicide in relatively dry soil conditions will provide optimum effectiveness with control rates up to 98%.","[Dornbos, David L., Jr.] Calvin Coll, Dept Biol, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA; [Pruim, Randall] Calvin Coll, Dept Math, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA","Dornbos, DL (reprint author), Calvin Coll, Dept Biol, 1726 Knollcrest Circle SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA.",dld9@calvin.edu,,,Pierce Cedar Creek Institute,We acknowledge the efforts of Biology 243 students who cut and treated the buckthorn infested areas of the Calvin Nature Preserve during the fall semesters of 2005-2008 and then collected subsequent escape data in following years.

In the control, 80.6% of the root tips were vital, 76.5% of them showing ECM colonization. Higher root tip vitality and mycorrhization were observed in the treated plots. Forty-one morphotypes were identified, most of them detected at the higher N inputs. Results diverging from the expectations of a reduction in ECM presence and diversity could be related to a higher growth rate of the trees following fertilization. The repeated application of small N doses could have been a better imitation of natural inputs from atmospheric deposition and could have provided more reliable responses of ECM to treatment.","[Rossi, Sergio; Bordeleau, Adam; Morin, Hubert] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Houle, Daniel] Foret Quebec, Direct Rech Forestiere, Minist Ressources Nat & Faune, Ste Foy, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada; [Houle, Daniel] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Montreal, PQ H2Y 2E7, Canada","Rossi, S (reprint author), Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, 555 Blvd Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.",sergio.rossi@uqac.ca,"rossi, sergio/I-3725-2014","rossi, sergio/0000-0002-9919-0494",,,,50,5,5,0,32,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

In a hydroponic system, co-inoculation with strains Sp7 or acdS (+) , but with ipdC (-) and napA (-) mutants, enhanced root secretion of nod gene-inducing flavonoids in comparison with Rlv-inoculated plants.

All pedigree-based studies so far were conducted on populations of European origin. In this article, we analyzed 19 deep-rooting pedigrees in a population of mixed origin in Costa Rica. We calculated two estimates of the HVR-I mutation rate, one considering all apparent mutations, and one disregarding changes at sites known to be mutational hot spots and eliminating genealogy branches which might be suspected to include errors, or unrecognized adoptions along the female lines. At the end of this procedure, we still observed a mutation rate equal to 1.24 x 10-6, per site per year, i.e., at least threefold as high as estimates derived from phylogenies. Our results confirm that mutation rates observed in pedigrees are much higher than estimated assuming a neutral model of long-term HVRI evolution. We argue that until the cause of these discrepancies will be fully understood, both lower estimates (i.e., those derived from phylogenetic comparisons) and higher, direct estimates such as those obtained in this study, should be considered when modeling evolutionary and demographic processes.

Changes in aboveground ecosystem properties with this conversion have been well-documented, but little is known about how belowground communities are affected, yet these communities may be important drivers of desertification as well as constraints on the reversal of this state change. We examined nematode community structure and feeding as a proxy for soil biotic change across a desertification gradient in southern NM, USA. We had two objectives: (1) to compare nematode trophic structure and species diversity within vegetation states representing different stages of desertification, and (2) to compare nematode community structure between bare and vegetated patches that may be connected via a matrix of endophytic fungi and soil biotic crusts. The gradient included a perennial grassland dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda, the historic dominant in the Chihuahuan Desert, a duneland dominated by the shrub, Prosopis glandulosa, and the ecotone between them. We also sampled a relatively undisturbed, ungrazed B. eriopoda grassland at a nearby site to serve as an end member of our gradient. Nematode communities were sampled using soil cores to depth of 50 cm at each location in 2009 and 2010. Results showed that grasslands and mesquite dunelands had different trophic groupings and herbivorous nematode communities with lower species diversity and evenness compared with the ecotone. Nematode trophic structure and herbivore communities were significantly different in all vegetation states with the highest observed diversity in the undisturbed, ungrazed B. eriopoda grassland in 2010. Vegetated and bare ground patches within the two grassland sites had similar herbivore communities, especially species from the family Tylenchinae. However, the mesquite duneland showed the lowest sampled diversity of all sites, but had significantly larger nematode abundances in vegetated dunes than interdune areas that are void of vegetation and soil biotic crusts where bacteriovores dominated. Decreased nematode trophic structure and species diversity in the Jornada black grama grassland samples compared with the undisturbed grassland illustrate the effect of desertification on the soil biotic community. Our results show that nematodes can be used to identify changes in belowground community structure based on trophic interactions.

Recent focus has been on factors governing the stability of these mutualisms, including sanctions by the host, partner choice, and coevolutionary constraint, that is, the genetic correlation (r(G)) between fitness of both partners. So far these studies have been typically carried out in a single environment. Here, we ask if the genetic correlation between fitness of the host plant Medicago truncatula (Fabaceae) and its bacterial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti is affected by the presence/absence of a monoterpene (carvacrol) leached into the soil by Thymus vulgaris-a common plant of the Mediterranean vegetation, often co-occuring with Medicago. We show that the presence of carvacrol in the soil dramatically affects fitness of the rhizobial partner and increases the magnitude of rG between plant and rhizobia fitness (r(G) = 0.02 +/- 0.05 vs. r(G) = 0.57 +/- 0.02). This finding emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity in the biotic environment for understanding the evolution of species interactions.","[Ehlers, Bodil K.; Grondahl, Eva] Univ So Denmark, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Ronfort, Joelle] UMR AGAP, INRA, F-34130 Maugio, France; [Bataillon, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Ehlers, BK (reprint author), Univ So Denmark, Inst Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",behlers@biology.sdu.dk,"Ehlers, Bodil/J-5609-2013; Groendahl, Eva/K-5349-2013","Groendahl, Eva/0000-0002-9124-8313; Bataillon, Thomas/0000-0002-4730-2538",,,,25,5,5,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The results indicate that the biomass, density, and cover of ephemerals improved significantly after inoculation with AMF. Compared to the control treatment, aboveground biomass per plant of the mycorrhizal plant species Erodium oxyrrhynchum, Hyalea pulchella, Trigonella arcuata, and Schismus arabicus significantly increased in mycorrhizal treatment, but no significant differences were observed in the nonmycorrhizal species Alyssum linifolim and Ceratocarpus arenarius between mycorrhizal and control treatments. The total seedling numbers per square meter in the mycorrhizal treatment were much more than control treatment in all 3 yr. Inoculation with AMF increased the total cover of ephemeral plants from 7% to 14% in 2005, 15% to 38% in 2006, and 39% to 62% in 2009 than control treatment. Moreover, community productivity (shoot dry weight, grams per square meter) in mycorrhizal treatments significantly increased from 6 to 29 in 2005, 11 to 36 in 2006, and 27 to 81 in 2009 compared with the control treatment. It is concluded that AMF can speed up the regeneration process of grassland and this may be used as an effective biological approach in the restoration of degraded desert ephemeral plant communities.","[Zhang, Tao; Shi, Zhaoyong; Feng, Gu] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yu] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Crop Tillage & Cultivat Inst, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Feng, G (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, 2 Yuan Ming Yuan W Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",fenggu@cau.edu.cn,"Feng, Gu/K-8367-2012","Feng, Gu/0000-0002-1052-5009",Chinese National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30770341]; International Fund for Agricultural Development (the WATER-COPE project) [I-R-1284],"Research was funded by grants from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (30770341) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (the WATER-COPE project, I-R-1284).",,45,16,20,2,58,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Collembola and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are major soil biota representing different functional groups, and are known as two key promoters of soil aggregation. Although several studies have experimentally demonstrated that AM fungi and, more recently, collembola affect soil structure, there is no study investigating how both soil organisms affect soil aggregation excluding the influence of plant roots, another important driver of soil aggregation. Considering the importance of AM fungi and collembola in terrestrial ecosystems, here we asked if both organisms have any influence on soil aggregation when roots are not present. In order to examine this question we conducted a completely factorial greenhouse study manipulating the presence of both collembola and AM fungi and excluded the roots of Plantago lanceolata using a 38 mu m nylon screen compartment. We quantified soil aggregation as water stable soil aggregates in four size classes in the hyphal compartment and monitored a number of other explanatory variables, including AM (and non-AM) fungal soil hyphal length. The soil in the hyphal compartment showed greater soil aggregation with larger mean weight diameter when collembola were present, and a similar result was found in the presence of AM fungi, compared to control treatments. Moreover, combined presence of both AM fungi and collembola resulted in a non-additive increase of soil aggregation. Our study clearly indicated that collembola can enhance soil aggregation, that they can partially complement effects of AM fungi, and that these effects are independent of roots.

We evaluated the effects of stand age and disturbance origin on SOC, soil aggregate stability, and aggregate-associated SOC in the boreal forests of Ontario, Canada. Mineral soils at 0-15 cm depth were sampled in 27 stands of six post-fire age classes (2- to 203-year-old) and three post-clearcut age classes (2- to 29-year-old), each with three replications. In post-fire stands, the SOC pool increased from 2- and 10-year-old to 29-, 85- and 140-year-old, and then decreased in 203-year-old stands. Aggregate-associated SOC showed a similar trend. Abundance of water stable aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) was the highest in 2-year-old stands. Compared with the same-aged post-fire stands, the SOC pool and aggregate-associated SOC were higher, and aggregate stability was lower in 2- and 10-year-old post-clearcut stands. But the differences in SOC pool, aggregate-associated SOC, and aggregate stability between the two stand origins diminished or became less dramatic in 29-year-old stands. Our results indicate that aggregate stability is more dependent on thermal modification of SOC by fire than on aggregate-associated SOC. Our results also show higher SOC pool and aggregate-associated SOC but lower aggregate stability in post-clearcut than post-fire stands shortly after disturbance; however, differences between the two stand origins diminish when stands become older.

In a previous study, MR and RC of 95 grassland species were measured. We constructed a phylogeny for these species and found it explained variation in MR and RC. Next, we used multiple regressions to identify the models that most accurately predicted plant MR. Models including either phylogenetic or phenotypic and taxonomic information similarly improved our ability to predict MR relative to a null model.

The microbial community fingerprint and specific biomarkers varied substantially from year to year, in both control and experimental treatment plots. Possible drivers of the variability included plant growth, soil moisture, and ambient temperature. Surprisingly, background variation in the microbial community was of a larger magnitude than even very significant treatment effects, and this variation appeared to constrain responses to treatment. Microbial communities were mostly not responsive or not consistently responsive to the experimental treatments. Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomarker abundance (16 similar to:similar to 1 ?5c) and the fungal to bacterial ratio were lower under nitrogen addition in most years. Bacterial lipid biomarker abundances (15 similar to:similar to 0 iso and 16 similar to:similar to 1 ?7c) were higher under nitrogen addition in 2002, the year of largest microbial biomass, suggesting that bacteria could respond more to nitrogen addition in years of better growth conditions. Nitrogen addition and warming led to an interactive effect on the Gram-positive bacterial biomarker and the fungal to bacterial ratio. These patterns indicate that in California grassland ecosystems, microbial communities may not respond substantially to future changes in climate and that nitrogen deposition may be a determinant of the soil response to global change. Further, year-to-year variation in microbial growth or community composition may be important determinants of ecosystem response to global change.","[Gutknecht, Jessica L.

The objectives of the study were to assess the consistency in soil carbon estimates applying a multi-model comparison and to present and discuss the sources of uncertainties that create the differences in model results. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of different modelling approaches from the view point of large-scale carbon assessments. Our simulation results showed a wide range in soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates reflecting substantial uncertainties in model estimates. The measured stock change estimate decreased much more than the model predictions. Model results varied not only due to the model structure and applied parameters, but also due to different input information and assumptions applied during the modelling processes. Initialization procedures applied with the models induced large differences among the modelled soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates. Decomposition estimates of the litter pulse driven by model structures and parameters also varied considerably. Our results support the use of relatively simple soil-only models with low data requirements in inventory type of large-scale carbon assessments. It is important that the modelling processes within the national inventories are transparently reported and special emphasis is put on how the models are used, which assumptions are applied and what is the quality of data used both as input and to calibrate the models.

And the relation between flocs properties and the performance of coagulation-ultrafiltration process was investigated by the experiments of flocs size, fractal dimension and the surface charge. The removal efficiency of coagulation-ultrafiltration process showed that turbidity and UV254 could be removed efficiently regardless of polyferric chloride (PFC) dosage and solution pH. Even when dosage was 3 mg L-1, the turbidity and UV254 removal efficiencies were higher than 90% in coagulation-ultrafiltration process. The chlorine decay showed that under various technological conditions, the difference between chlorine decay curves obtained by coagulation-ultrafiltration process was less than that obtained by coagulation process. According to the analysis by AQUASIM software, the concentration of fast reducing agents (FRA) in coagulation-ultrafiltration process is lower than that in coagulation process, but the concentration of Slow Reducing Agents (SRA) in coagulation-ultrafiltration process was higher than in coagulation process except dosage = 18 mg L-1. Comparing the flocs properties to the performance of coagulation-ultrafiltration process, it can be found that when flocs size was small (<200 mu m), the HA removal efficiency increased with flocs size increasing, while when flocs size was large (>200 mu m), the HA removal efficiency was influenced mainly by flocs structure. The more compact the flocs, the higher the HA removal efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux (R-S) were investigated in a grassland of coastal Congo over two years. The objectives were (1) to identify the main factors controlling seasonal variations in R-S and (2) to develop a semi-empirical model describing R-S and including a heterotrophic component (R-H) and an autotrophic component (R-A). Plant above-ground activity was found to exert strong control over soil respiration since 71% of seasonal R-S variability was explained by the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed (APAR) by the grass canopy. We tested an additive model including a parameter enabling R-S partitioning into R-A and R-H. Assumptions underlying this model were that R-A mainly depended on the amount of photosynthates allocated below ground and that microbial and root activity was mostly controlled by soil temperature and soil moisture. The model provided a reasonably good prediction of seasonal variations in R-S (R-2 = 0.85) which varied between 5.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the wet season and 0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the end of the dry season. The model was subsequently used to obtain annual estimates of R-S, R-A and R-H. In accordance with results reported for other tropical grasslands, we estimated that R-H accounted for 44% of R-S, which represented a flux similar to the amount of carbon brought annually to the soil from below-ground litter production. Overall, this study opens up prospects for simulating the carbon budget of tropical grasslands on a large scale using remotely sensed data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Very little is known about the biology of these particular geophytes, the majority of which currently have either vulnerable or endangered status, mainly due to their dispersed and small populations generally associated to remnants of native vegetation. As mycorrhizal associations are essential for soil resource acquisition and stress mitigation in most plants, our objective was to assess the hitherto unknown mycotrophic status of ten species of Gilliesieae from central Chile by qualitative and quantitative assessment of intraradical fungal structures. All sampled genera (Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Solaria, Speea) showed regular presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza, while other mycorrhizal or putatively mutualistic associations, like dark septate endophytes, were practically absent. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots reached a mean of ca. 45 % across all examined taxa, with highly variable values ranging from 9 % to 82 % in Miersia tenuiseta and Gilliesia curicana, respectively. The high level of mycorrhization indicates that arbuscular mycorrhiza should be considered for conservation strategies of threatened species or biotechnological use in plant propagation. The main future task is the identification of the associated fungal taxa.","[Angelica Casanova-Katny, M.] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Biotechnol, Concepcion, Chile; [Torres-Mellado, Gustavo A.; Escobar, Inelia; Palfner, Goetz] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanograf, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile","Casanova-Katny, MA (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Ctr Biotechnol, POB 160 C, Concepcion, Chile.",angecasanova@gmail.com,,,Chilean National Council for Science and Technology CONICYT,We would like to thank Lucia Abello who kindly provided the high quality pictures of some species of Gilliesieae in Fig. 1.

Don, medicinal plant whose alkaloids have antineoplasic properties. In the first experimental stage, roots and rhizospheric soil were collected from the 13 MP in which the rnycorrhizal colonization percentage (MCP) and the number of spores were assessed; in addition, soil samples were used for establishing culture traps under greenhouse conditions for 10 months and thus, the main AMF genera were identified. All MP showed AMF colonization, and four fungal genera were identified (Glomus, Acaulospora, Gigaspora, and Scutellospora) from which Acaulospora and Glomus were predominant. The second experimental stage allowed the selection of eight consortia based on the MCP of trap cultures (> 40 %), that corresponded to samples collected from Adiantum capillus-veneris L., Castilleja tenuiflora Benth., Erigeron karvinskianus DC., Pimpinella anisum L., Plantago major L., Ricinus communis L., Rubus fruticosus L. and Rumex mexicanus Meisn. These consortia were inoculated to C. roseus to evaluate their capability for stimulating the plant growth under greenhouse conditions. After 70 days, in spite of presenting only one predominant AMF genus (Glomus), the consortium isolated from R. mexicanus showed more consistent effects on the growth of C. roseus (leaves number, leaf area and leaf dry weight) when compared to the remaining mycorrhizal consortia.","[De La Rosa-Mera, Claudia; Ferrera-Cerrato, Ronald; Alarcon, Alejandro; Franco-Ramirez, Alicia] Colegio Postgrad, Montecillo 56230, Mexico; [De Jesus Sanchez-Colin, Maria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super, Iztapalapa 09230, DF, Mexico; [De La Rosa-Mera, Claudia] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Div Ciencias Biol & Salud, Dept Biol Area Bot, Iztapalapa 09340, DF, Mexico","Alarcon, A (reprint author), Colegio Postgrad, Campus Montecillo,Carretera Fed Mexico Texcoco Km, Montecillo 56230, Mexico.",aalarconcp@gmail.com,,"Alarcon, Alejandro/0000-0002-7212-7751",,,,43,2,3,0,28,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

We tested the allelopathic potentials of the non-native, invasive grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stilt-grass) and the native herb Ageratina altissima (White Snakeroot), which both can dominate the herb layer in central New Jersey forests. Aqueous extracts from roots and shoots of both species negatively affected the speed of germination and the percent germination of Lettuce and Radish seeds in Petri dishes, and White Snakeroot shoot extract had the strongest effect. In a factorial experiment in pots of forest soil that combined extract treatments with activated carbon addition ( to manipulate allelochemicals) and soil sterilization (to investigate indirect allelopathic effects via the soil micro ora), Lettuce and Radish seedling establishment was reduced by extracts, especially from the native White Snakeroot. However, growth of surviving seedlings was unaffected by the extracts or their interactions with carbon or soil sterilization. These results show that a native species had stronger allelopathic potential than an aggressive, non-native invader from the same forest and that allelopathy was effective on the earliest developmental stages of the target plant species. In addition, activated carbon and sterilization interacted to directly influence plant growth. Growth was greater in sterilized than unsterilized soils, but only when carbon was added, suggesting caution in using these techniques in allelopathy studies.","[Corbett, Brian F.; Morrison, Janet A.] Coll New Jersey, Dept Biol, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA","Morrison, JA (reprint author), Coll New Jersey, Dept Biol, POB 7718, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA.",morrisja@tcnj.edu,,,Phi Kappa Phi Research award; Support of Scholarly Activity award from The College of New Jersey to J.A.

We found increased root biomass and photosynthetic rate at higher soil temperatures, but simultaneously with photosynthesis rate, higher temperature generally increased soil respiration as well as shoot, and root and rhizosphere respiration. The net CO2 exchange and seedling biomass did not increase significantly with increasing temperature due to a concomitant increase in carbon assimilation and respiration rates. The 2-month-long growth period in different soil temperatures did not alter the ECM fungi species composition and the below-ground carbon sink strength did not seem to be directly related to ECM biomass and species composition in any of the tree species.

In a greenhouse study, belowground competition of Quercus suber L. seedlings growing together with natural (Oak(NP)) or improved pasture (Oak(IP)) was evaluated, and their root systems compared with those of seedlings growing in bare soil (Oak(BS)). Two watering levels and two regimes of P2O5 fertilisation were also tested. Because of competition, the Oak(IP) seedlings had their fine root mass density, coarse root length, and shoot mass reduced by up to 40, 36, and 39%, respectively, when compared to Oak(NP) seedlings. Oak(NP) and Oak(BS) seedlings showed similar average root density parameters and shoot mass values, indicating that Q. suber seedlings growing with natural pasture is a low competitive system. High availability of water and phosphorus did not mitigate the strength of competition between herbaceous plants and oak seedlings, and favoured the pasture to the detriment of the trees. Our findings suggest that P2O5 fertilisation and irrigation practices performed to improve herbaceous productivity will negatively influence recruitment of Q. suber seedlings.","[Cubera, Elena; Moreno, Gerardo; Solla, Alejandro] Univ Extremadura, Plasencia 10600, Spain; [Cubera, Elena; Madeira, Manuel] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal","Cubera, E (reprint author), Univ Extremadura, Ave Virgen del Puerto 2, Plasencia 10600, Spain.",ecubera@unex.es,"Solla, Alejandro/L-3096-2014; Moreno, Gerardo/K-7825-2012","Solla, Alejandro/0000-0002-2596-1612; Moreno, Gerardo/0000-0001-8053-2696; Cubera, Elena/0000-0001-7971-0416; Madeira, Manuel/0000-0003-4497-9997","University of Extremadura [OR06/A7-01]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); Portuguese Ministerio da Agricultura, do Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas (VALMONT) [AGRO-2003-0850]; Consejeria de Infraestructuras y Desarrollo Tecnologico (Junta de Extremadura); European Social FoundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","We thank A.

We hypothesise that this effect is specific for these disturbed sites and that at sites of low and no disturbance the effect decreases. We determined plant species richness, cover percentage of five functional groups, root (length) density, and biomass as well as soil aggregate stability, gravimetric soil moisture, soil density, and particle size distribution at different levels of disturbance (i.e. graded and un-graded ski slopes and the surrounding area). Plant species richness, vegetation cover, aggregate stability and soil moisture were significantly reduced on machine-graded slopes compared to control plots but hardly on un-graded slopes. On the contrary, machine-grading increased soil density and friction angle compared to un-graded ski slopes. The influence of species richness on aggregate stability was only positive on gravely soils and graded ski slopes. Aggregate stability increased linearly up to approximately eight plant species, 70% vegetation cover and 0.006 g cm(-3) root density. Our study showed that the relationship between plant diversity and aggregate stability was strongest on slopes with high disturbance and relatively low species numbers. We suggest that high plant diversity, vegetation cover and root density need to be established after major human disturbance such as grading.","[Pohl, Mandy; Graf, Frank; Rixen, Christian] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Unit Community Ecol, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Buttler, Alexandre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Unit Community Ecol Pasture Woodlands & Wetlands, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pohl, Mandy; Buttler, Alexandre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UFR Sci & Tech,UMR 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France","Rixen, C (reprint author), WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Unit Community Ecol, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",rixen@slf.ch,"Buttler, Alexandre AB/K-1137-2012","Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988",Swiss MAVA-Foundation; Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL,"We would like to thank the Swiss MAVA-Foundation and the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL for the financial support.

The calculation assumes knowledge of the decomposition rate of dead fine roots during a given time period from a litter bag experiment. A mass balance model of organic matter derived from live fine roots is applied with an assumption about fine root mortality and decomposition to estimate decomposed dead fine roots from variables that can be quantified. Comparison of the estimated fine root dynamics with the decision matrix method and three new methods (forward estimate, continuous inflow estimate, and backward estimate) in a ca. 80-year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation in central Japan showed that the decision matrix nearly always underestimated production, mortality, and decomposition by underscoring the values of the forward estimate, which theoretically underestimates the true value. The fine root production and mortality obtained by the decision matrix were on average 14% and 38% lower than those calculated by the continuous inflow estimate method. In addition, the values by the continuous inflow estimate method were always between those calculated by the forward estimate and backward estimate methods.

Responses of tree roots to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and O-3 (eO(3)) have been characterized primarily by studies of relatively shallow roots, yet deeper roots often play a disproportionately large role in water acquisition relative to their biomass. We undertook the present study to determine if there were significant root responses to eCO(2) and eO(3) below the maximum soil depths typically studied. In the current study, we characterized small root biomass and morphometric responses to eCO(2) and eO(3) at the Aspen-FACE Experiment in Rhinelander, Wisconsin down to a depth of one meter. Elevated CO2 caused relatively undifferentiated growth stimulation. Elevated O-3 stimulated root growth in the AA community at depth, while in the AB community there was a reduction in root growth in the shallow soil layer that was reversed in the deeper layers. Root responses below depths typically studied were qualitatively similar than those within shallower soils for eCO(2), but were sometimes compensatory for eO(3).","[Rhea, L. K.; King, J.

Differences in root growth and the types of roots produced vary according to local environmental gradients and management practices. The production of deep roots in tallgrass prairie has been historically presumed as a mechanism for water uptake when surface soils are dry. We examined changes in root biomass, total root length, root width, and theoretical hydraulic conductivity using roots collected from deep soil cores in upland and lowland topographic positions in grazed and ungrazed watersheds of the Konza Prairie Biological Station in north-eastern Kansas, USA. Root biomass, total root length, and theoretical hydraulic conductivity were highest in roots found in the top 20 cm of the soil profile, and then declined exponentially with increasing soil depth. Compared to grazed areas, ungrazed locations had more root biomass and total root length of roots in the most superficial soil layers. No differences in rooting profiles were present among topographic contrasts. Theoretical hydraulic conductivity of axial root xylem did not vary by topographic position or grazing contrasts, and declines in conductivity by depth were driven by changes in the number of vessels per stele, rather than changes in vessel size. Irrespective of differences by grazing treatment or topographic position, significant reductions in root biomass, total root length, and theoretical hydraulic conductivity of grass roots at soil depths greater than 1 m suggest deep roots in this grassland have limited functional significance for water uptake.","[Nippert, Jesse B.; Wieme, Rachel A.; Ocheltree, Troy W.; Craine, Joseph M.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Nippert, JB (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nippert@ksu.edu,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",Konza Prairie LTER Program [DEB-0823341]; NSF-REUNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DBI-0851835],"We thank Gracie Orozco, Teall Culbertson, and Teddy Gelderman for technical support.

Partial mycoheterotrophy entails carbon gains both directly from photosynthesis and via symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, but determining the degree of plant dependence on fungal carbon is challenging. The purpose of this study was to determine if two chlorophyllous species of Pyroleae, and , were receiving carbon via mycorrhizal networks and, if so, if their proportional dependency on fungal carbon gains increased under reduced light conditions. This was accomplished by a field experiment that manipulated light and plants' access to mycorrhizal networks, and by using the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of leaf soluble sugars as a marker for the level of mycoheterotrophy. Based on leaf soluble sugars delta C-13 values, we calculated a site-independent isotope enrichment factor as a measure of fungal contributions to plant C. We found that, under each treatment and over time, the two test species demonstrated different isotopic responses caused by their different intrinsic physiologies. Our data, along with previously published studies, suggest that is primarily an autotrophic understory plant, while may be capable of partial mycoheterotrophy. However, in this study, a 50% decrease in light availability did not significantly change the relative dependency of on carbon gains via mycoheterotrophy.","[Hynson, Nicole A.; Amend, Anthony S.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Mambelli, Stefania; Dawson, Todd E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hynson, NA (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",nhynson@hawaii.edu,,,UC; Sonoma Mycological Society; San Francisco Mycological Society; Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemisty at UC Berkeley,"The authors would like to thank the following people for assistance with the sample processing for this project: Alexandra Grote, Olga Lastovetskaya, Celia Jeanningros and Joyce Lee.

In the vast majority of local, regional, and global assessments, C content has been assumed to be 50% of tree biomass; however, recent studies indicate that this assumption is not accurate, with substantial variation in C content among tree species as well as among tissue types. Here we conduct a comprehensive literature review to present a global synthesis of C content in tissues of live trees. We found a total of 253 species-specific stem wood C content records in 31 studies, and an additional 34 records of species with C content values of other tissues in addition to stem wood. In all biomes, wood C content varied widely across species ranging from 41.9-51.6% in tropical species, 45.7-60.7% in subtropical/Mediterranean species, and 43.4-55.6% in temperate/boreal species. Stem wood C content varied significantly as a function of biome and species type (conifer, angiosperm). Conifer species exhibited greater wood C content than angiosperm species (50.8 +/- 0.7% (95% C.I.) and 47.7 +/- 0.3%, respectively), a trend that was consistent among all biomes. Although studies have documented differences in C content among plant tissues, interspecific differences in stem wood appear to be of greater importance overall: among species, stem wood C content explained 37, 76, 48, 81, and 63% respectively of the variation in bark, branch, twig, coarse root, and fine root C content values, respectively. In each case, these intraspecific patterns approximated 1: 1 linear relationships. Most published stem wood C content values (and all values for other tree tissues) are based on dried wood samples, and so neglect volatile C constituents that constitute on average 1.3-2.5% of total C in live wood. Capturing this volatile C fraction is an important methodological consideration for future studies. Our review, and associated data compilation, provides empirically supported wood C fractions that can be easily incorporated into forest C accounting, and may correct systematic errors of similar to 1.6-5.8% in forest C assessments.","[Thomas, Sean C.; Martin, Adam R.] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada","Martin, AR (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Earth Sci Bldg,33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",sc.thomas@utoronto.ca; adam.martin@utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Jeanne F.

Empirical and allometric methods are easily developed and computationally efficient, but lack the power of evolution-based approaches to explain and predict multifaceted effects of environmental variability and climate change. In evolution-based methods, allocation is usually determined by maximization of a fitness proxy, either in a fixed environment, which we call optimal response (OR) models, or including the feedback of an individual's strategy on its environment (game-theoretical optimization, GTO). Optimal response models can predict allocation in single trees and stands when there is significant competition only for one resource. Game-theoretical optimization can be used to account for additional dimensions of competition, e.g., when strong root competition boosts root allocation at the expense of wood production. However, we demonstrate that an OR model predicts similar allocation to a GTO model under the root-competitive conditions reported in free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments. The most evolutionarily realistic approach is adaptive dynamics (AD) where the allocation strategy arises from eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations instead of a fitness proxy. We also discuss emerging entropy-based approaches that offer an alternative thermodynamic perspective on allocation, in which fitness proxies are replaced by entropy or entropy production. To help develop allocation models further, the value of wide-ranging datasets, such as FLUXNET, could be greatly enhanced by ancillary measurements of driving variables, such as water and soil nitrogen availability.","[Franklin, Oskar; Johansson, Jacob; Dieckmann, Ulf; Brannstrom, Ake] IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Johansson, Jacob] Lund Univ, Theoret Populat Ecol & Evolut Grp, Dept Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Dewar, Roderick C.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [McMurtrie, Ross E.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Dybzinski, Ray] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Brannstrom, Ake] Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Franklin, O (reprint author), IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",franklin@iiasa.ac.at,"Brannstrom, Ake/E-7850-2011; Dewar, Roderick/C-9304-2009; Dieckmann, Ulf/E-1424-2011","Dieckmann, Ulf/0000-0001-7089-0393; Dybzinski, Ray/0000-0002-1712-1875; Johansson, Jacob/0000-0002-0018-7018; Franklin, Oskar/0000-0002-0376-4140","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in the framework of the Greenhouse Gas Initiative (GGI); Vinnova, SwedenVinnova; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council","O.F., J.J., U.D. and A.B. were funded by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in the framework of the Greenhouse Gas Initiative (GGI).

Thus, pulse-labelling enables the quantification of C partitioning in forests and the assessment of the role of partitioning in tree growth, resource acquisition and C sequestration. However, this is associated with challenges as regards the choice of a tracer, the methods of tracing labelled C in tree and soil compartments and the quantitative analysis of C dynamics. Based on data from 47 studies, the rate of transfer differs between broadleaved and coniferous species and decreases as temperature and soil water content decrease. Labelled C is rapidly transferred belowground-within a few days or less-and this transfer is slowed down by drought. Half-lives of labelled C in phloem sap (transfer pool) and in mature leaves (source organs) are short, while those of sink organs (growing tissues, seasonal storage) are longer. C-13 measurements in respiratory efflux at high temporal resolution provide the best estimate of the mean residence times of C in respiratory substrate pools, and the best basis for compartmental modelling. Seasonal C dynamics and allocation patterns indicate that sink strength variations are important drivers for C fluxes. We propose a conceptual model for temperate and boreal trees, which considers the use of recently assimilated C versus stored C. We recommend best practices for designing and analysing pulse-labelling experiments, and identify several topics which we consider of prime importance for future research on C allocation in trees: (i) whole-tree C source-sink relations, (ii) C allocation to secondary metabolism, (iii) responses to environmental change, (iv) effects of seasonality versus phenology in and across biomes, and (v) carbon-nitrogen interactions. Substantial progress is expected from emerging technologies, but the largest challenge remains to carry out in situ whole-tree labelling experiments on mature trees to improve our understanding of the environmental and physiological controls on C allocation.","[Epron, Daniel; Maillard, Pascale; Gerant, Dominique] Univ Lorraine, UMR 1137, Fac Sci, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Epron, Daniel; Maillard, Pascale; Gerant, Dominique] INRA, UMR 1137, Ctr Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Bahn, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Derrien, Delphine] INRA, UR 1138, Ctr Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Lattanzi, Fernando Alfredo] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Grunlandlehre, Alte Akad, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Pumpanen, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Gessler, Arthur] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Landscape Biogeochem, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Gessler, Arthur] Humboldt Univ, Fac Agr & Hort, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Hoegberg, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Forest & Biomat Sci, Lab Forest Utilizat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Buchmann, Nina] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Epron, D (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, UMR 1137, Fac Sci, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",daniel.epron@univ-lorraine.fr,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Epron, Daniel/B-5093-2011; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; GERANT, Dominique/B-8625-2011; Pumpanen, Jukka/B-1254-2012; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Lattanzi, Fernando Alfredo/A-5609-2009","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Epron, Daniel/0000-0001-9451-3437; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Pumpanen, Jukka/0000-0003-4879-3663; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Lattanzi, Fernando Alfredo/0000-0002-2682-3692",COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [ES0806]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [LA: 2390/1-1]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [218094]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP7-ENV-2008-1-226701],"This idea for this review emerged during a workshop on 'Analysing post labelling experiments' held in Nancy, France, in March 2010, which was supported by the COST Action ES0806 SIBAE (Stable Isotopes in Biosphere-Atmosphere-Earth System Research, http://www.sibae.ethz.ch/cost-sibae/).

Treatment effects were not significant on standing root biomass in 2003, although root growth rate was significantly higher in the warmed than control plots. However, in the post-treatment year, the warmed plots had significantly lower standing root biomass than the controls, likely resulting from increased root death rate. Root death rate was significantly lower in the doubled precipitation and warmed plus doubled precipitation plots than that in the warmed plots in 2004. The root:shoot ratio showed similar responses to the post-treatments as standing root biomass, whereas aboveground biomass changed relatively little, indicating that roots were more sensitive to lagged effects than aboveground biomass. Our results demonstrate that root growth and death rates are highly sensitive to extreme climate events and lagged effects of extreme climate on root dynamics are important in assessing terrestrial carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate change.","[Zhou, Xuhui; Luo, Yiqi] Fudan Univ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn,Sch Life Sci, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary,Min, Inst Biodivers Sci,Res Inst Changing Global Envir, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xuhui; Fei, Shenfeng; Sherry, Rebecca; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Zhou, XH (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn,Sch Life Sci, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary,Min, Inst Biodivers Sci,Res Inst Changing Global Envir, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zxuhui14@fudan.edu.cn,"Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011; Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019","Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901","NSF IRCEBNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0078325, DEB 0444518]","The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

To better understand whether grasslands will act as C sources or sinks in the future we measured microbial respiration in long-term laboratory incubations of soils collected from a grassland field experiment after 9 years of factorial treatment of atmospheric CO2, N deposition, and plant species richness on a deep and uniformly sandy soil. We fit microbial soil respiration rates to three-pool models of soil C cycling to separate treatment effects on decomposition and pool sizes of fast, slow, and resistant C pools. Elevated CO2 decreased the mean residence time (MRT) of slow C pools without affecting their pool size. Decreasing diversity reduced the size and MRT of fast C pools (comparing monocultures to plots planted with 16 species), but increased the slow pool MRT. N additions increased the size of the resistant pool. These effects of CO2, N, and species-richness treatments were largely due to plant biomass differences between the treatments. We found no significant interactions among treatments. These results suggest that C sequestration in sandy grassland soils may not be strongly influenced by elevated CO2 or species losses. However, high N deposition may increase the amount of resistant C in these grasslands, which could contribute to increased C sequestration.","[Reid, Joseph P.; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Adair, E.

Soil samples were taken at different depths from four replicate comparative study plots in each of three forest age classes (young 10-40 years, medium 40-80 years, old >= 80 years). Microbial biomass and community structure were then determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) were determined by substrate-induced respiration. These data were then related to plant community and soil variables using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis and post-hoc permutational correlations. We found that microbial lipid composition and abundance were not related to forest age class. Instead, microbial lipid composition and abundance were related to factors reflecting primary production, i.e., percent litter cover, percent dead wood cover, and percent tree layer cover. Specifically, the relative abundance (mol fraction) of indicators for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were positively significantly correlated with percent litter cover. We also found that the biomass of all microbial groups and total PLFA were negatively significantly related to percent deadwood cover. In addition, pH(H2O) was the only soil parameter that was correlated significantly to microbial biomass. Our results indicate that overarching ecological factors such as plant productivity and soil pH are important factors influencing the soil microbial community, both in terms of biomass and of community composition in this subtropical ecosystem.","[Wu, Yu Ting; Gutknecht, Jessica; Wubet, Tesfaye; Buscot, Francois] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wu, Yu Ting; Buscot, Francois] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Grp Terr Ecol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Nadrowski, Karin] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Grp Special Bot & Funct Biodivers, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Geissler, Christian; Kuehn, Peter; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Dept Phys Geog & Soil Sci, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Both, Sabine; Erfmeier, Alexandra; Boehnke, Martin; Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Biol & Geobot, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany","Wu, YT (reprint author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",yuting.wu@ufz.de,"Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Kuhn, Peter/A-9146-2009; Erfmeier, Alexandra/C-3381-2013; Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016; Scholten, Thomas/E-4024-2012; Erfmeier, Alexandra/L-1986-2016; Wubet, Tesfaye/C-6241-2012","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Kuhn, Peter/0000-0002-4417-5633; Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; Scholten, Thomas/0000-0002-4875-2602; Wubet, Tesfaye/0000-0001-8572-4486; Nadrowski, Karin/0000-0001-5358-5469",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [BU 941/12-1]; Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),We are grateful to the staff of the Gutianshan NNR and the students Bo Tong and Bo Yang for their field assistance.

Significant differences in ectomycorrhizal community composition between sites and between decline classes were found.

Three spacings were used as whole-plots (1 x 1 m, 3 x 3 m and 5 x 5 m), with two hybrid poplar clones as subplots (BT747, Populus balsamifera L. x P. trichocarpa Torr. & Gray; MB915, P. maximowiczii A.

After six growing seasons, diameter at breast height (dbh) increased by about 120% from the 1 x 1 m to the 5 x 5 m spacing for clone MB915, while there was no significant change in dbh for the other clone. The effect of spacing on height growth was opposite for the clones; it increased by about 175% from the narrowest to the widest spacing for clone MB915, while it decreased by about 27% for clone BT747. Estimates of above-ground biomass production after six growing seasons were significantly reduced with increasing spacing, with 29.6, 4.9 and 3.2 MgDM ha(-1) on average from the narrowest to the widest spacing. Branch traits and the vertical distribution of leaf area were the most affected by spacing for both clones, while live crown ratio and percentage of syllepsis did not change. Spacing also affected proportions of biomass allocated to stem, leaves, and branches, but allocation to roots did not change.","[Benomar, Lahcen; DesRochers, Annie] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, CEF, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada; [Benomar, Lahcen; DesRochers, Annie] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Chaire Ind CRSNG UQAT UQAM Amenagement Forestier, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada; [Larocque, Guy R.] Ressources Nat Canada, Serv Canadien Forets, Ctr Foresterie Laurentides, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Benomar, L (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, CEF, 341 Rue Principale Nord, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada.",Lahcen.benomar@uqat.ca,"benomar, lahcen/Q-3080-2019; DesRochers, Annie/B-8431-2015","benomar, lahcen/0000-0003-4462-3755; DesRochers, Annie/0000-0002-4653-4062; benomar, lahcen/0000-0001-9301-5655",Canada Economic Development; Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Fauna (MRNF); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-CRSNG)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Program on Energy Research and Development of Natural Resources CanadaNatural Resources Canada; Reseau Ligniculture Quebec; Norbord Inc.; Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.; CRSNG-UQAT-UQAM Industrial Chair in Sustainable Forest Management; Centre for Forest Research (CEF); Laurentian Forestry Centre of the Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service,"We thank W.

The aim of this study was to analyze the root system plasticity of three layers of vegetation growing together (trees, shrubs and pasture) and identify potential mechanisms of competition avoidance. Root morphology and distribution of trees, pasture and two contrasting shrub species (deep and shallow rooted) were studied in open oak woodlands of south-western Spain. Soil samples were obtained from paired adjacent plots, with and without shrubs, by taking soil cores to a depth of 3 m. Analysis of tree and pasture root systems in the presence of shrubs revealed significant reductions in root biomass and consistent increases in specific root length. Additionally, root profiles changed substantially, becoming significantly deeper for trees and shallower for pasture. In contrast, both types of shrub increased their root biomass when growing in competition, but without significantly modifying their rooting profile. Shrubs seem to be stronger competitors for below-ground resources than neighboring species. However, trees and pasture show clear plastic responses to shrub presence, irrespective of their rooting patterns, probably to minimize competitive interactions and maximize resource acquisition.","[Rolo, V.; Moreno, G.] Univ Extremadura, Sch Forestry, Plasencia 10600, Spain","Moreno, G (reprint author), Univ Extremadura, Sch Forestry, Plasencia 10600, Spain.",gmoreno@unex.es,"Rolo, Victor/H-1713-2016; Moreno, Gerardo/K-7825-2012","Rolo, Victor/0000-0001-5854-9512; Moreno, Gerardo/0000-0001-8053-2696","Spanish Research Program [AGL 2006-09435]; Regional Government of Extremadura (Consejeria de Economia, Comercio e Innovacion); Fondo Social EuropeoEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","This work has been funded by the Spanish Research Program (AGL 2006-09435).

No soil differences were observed on the Yellowstone River. Mycorrhizal infectivity potential was high in both occupied and unoccupied soils, with a slight reduction (from 73% to 65% colonization) in tamarisk occupied soils. These impacts were statistically but not ecologically significant and did not extend to other metrics of impact such as richness, Simpson's diversity or composition of plant communities.

These fungi have been studied only in Argentina, where they have been detected in 36 native grass species. The hybrid Neotyphodium tembladerae is present in an extremely wide host range found in diverse environmental conditions, but some other endophytes seem to be strictly associated with one host species in a particular environment. In host species that inhabit different environments, the incidence of endophytes is highly variable among populations and in most of the cases is clearly associated with environmental conditions. In these native grasses, Neotyphodium presents a mutualistic behaviour, conferring enhanced growth, promoting the symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and inhibiting growth of pathogenic fungi. In native forage grasses, preliminary analyses indicate that some Argentinian endophytes can produce lolines but are unlikely to produce lolitrem B or ergot alkaloids.

Here we used C-13-labelled mycelium of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus microcarpus in laboratory incubations in combination with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the identity of functionally active soil fungi that can utilise dead mycelium. We also used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect parallel changes in the abundance of key biochemical constituents of soil. A decrease in bulk soil C-13 concentration together with rapid loss of glycogen and chitin-glucan during the 4 week incubations suggested that dead mycelium was rapidly turned over. Further, C-13 was incorporated into fungal DNA within 7 days of addition to soil. DNA-SIP also revealed a dynamic community of functionally active soil fungi. By applying DNA-SIP and NMR in parallel, our data show that carbon from decaying ectomycorrhizal mycelium is rapidly transformed and incorporated into free-living soil fungi. This finding emphasises that dead extramatrical mycelium is an important source of labile carbon for soil microorganisms. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Root exudation (rhizode-position) is a primary source of these inputs and will likely increase with rising atmospheric CO2. Yet the fates of these compounds belowground, as well as the environmental factors that influence them, are relatively unexplored. Using stable isotopes we track the fate of one dominant LMWCC, glucose, in three pasture and three forest sites located in South Carolina, USA. We resolve glucose-derived C in CO2, dissolved and soil organic C (DOC, SOC), microbial biomass, and microarthropods (Collembola, oribatid and mesostigmatid mites). After 72 h, the greatest proportions of glucose-C are in microbial biomass and SOC, followed by CO2, DOC, and microarthropods. Within this short time frame, glucose-C propagates through the foodweb to the highest trophic level, predatory mesostigmatid mites. The biomass of these predators is the only variable that explains the relative partitioning across sites of glucose-C, with higher biomass associated with reduced partitioning of glucose-C to respiration and hence greater retention belowground. Our results suggest that LMWCCs entering belowground systems may propagate through soil foodwebs rapidly, and that their partitioning belowground may potentially be determined by higher trophic levels.

In this study we analysed the diversity of AMF in the roots of two perennial gypsophyte plant species, Herniaria fruticosa and Senecio auricula, and an annual herbaceous species, Bromus rubens, growing in a gypsum soil from a semiarid area. The objective was to determine whether perennial and annual host plants support different AMF communities in their roots. The roots were analysed by nested PCR, cloning, sequencing of the ribosomal DNA small subunit region and phylogenetic analysis. Twenty AMF sequence types, belonging to the Glomus group A, Glomus group B, Diversisporaceae, Acaulosporaceae, Archaeosporaceae and Paraglomeraceae, were identified. Both gypsophyte perennial species, H. fruticosa and S. auricula had different compositions of the AMF community and higher diversity than B. rubens. This annual plant species shared the full composition of its AMF community with both perennial plant species. Seasonal variations in the colonisation of AM fungi could explain the observed differences in AMF community composition, but this is still a working hypothesis that requires the analysis of further data obtained from a higher number of both annual and perennial plant species in order to be fully tested.

Plantago lanceolata was inoculated with one of: Glomus geosporum, Glomus mosseae or Glomus intraradices, and every combination of the fungal species. Infectivity was similar for each individual species, but G. mosseae and G. intraradices together resulted in the lowest per cent root length colonised. Despite the lower percentage colonisation, this combination induced the greatest mycorrhizal growth response. Aggregate stability and aggregate size distribution were unaffected by AMF but were increased by the presence of roots. Microbial biomass-C was also enhanced by roots. Pore size, pore size distribution and nearest neighbour distance were all reduced by G. mosseae and increased by G. intraradices. All AMF inocula containing G. intraradices resulted in greater distances between pores within the experimental soils. Porosity (%) was increased by G. mosseae suggesting that more, smaller pores with less distance between them enhanced overall porosity. (c) 012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Martin, S.

The importance of their diversity and functions for natural systems is well recognized. However, a better understanding of successional changes of microbial communities over long time scales is still required. In this work, the size and composition of microbial communities in soils of a deglaciation chronosequence at the Damma glacier forefield were studied by fatty acid profiling. Soil fatty acid concentrations clearly increased with soil age. The abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacteria and other soil fungi, however, were more affected by abiotic soil parameters like carbon content and pH than by soil age. Analysis of ratios of the different microbial groups (AMF, fungi, bacteria) along the soil chronosequence indicated that: i) the ratios of AMF to bacteria and AMF to fungi decreased with soil age; and ii) the ratio of fungi to bacteria remained unchanged along the soil chronosequence. These two pieces of evidence suggest that the evolution of this ecosystem proceeds at an uneven pace over time and that the role of AMF is less important in older, more organic and acidified soils than in mineral soils. In contrast to other studies, no successional replacement of bacteria with fungi in more acidified and organic soil was observed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to characterize changes in microbial community structure with time. Initial effects of surface mining resulted in reductions of total microbial biomass and diversity, with the greatest influence on saprophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi relative to undisturbed soils. The total concentration of PLFA biomarkers increased after 14 yr in soils established under cool-season grass communities and 5 yr in soils colonized by sagebrush communities. Canonical multivariate analysis of variance indicated that soil microbial communities under reestablished sagebrush were more similar to one another than those under cool-season grasses. In general, microbial biomarkers of reclaimed soils recovered to predisturbance levels within 5 to 14 yr, which indicated that the most important phase of microbial community recovery occurs between 5 and 14 yr after reclamation.","[Dangi, Sadikshya R.] USDA ARS, Parlier, CA 93648 USA; [Dangi, Sadikshya R.] Univ Calif Davis, Salinas, CA 93905 USA; [Stahl, Peter D.] Univ Wyoming, Dep Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Wick, Abbey F.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dep Crop & Soil Environm Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Ingram, Lachlan J.] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr Food & Nat Resources, Cobbity, NSW 2570, Australia; [Buyer, Jeffrey S.] USDA ARS, Sustainable Agr Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Dangi, SR (reprint author), USDA ARS, 9611 S Riverbend Ave, Parlier, CA 93648 USA.",Sadikshya.Dangi@ars.usda.gov,"Ingram, Lachlan/E-3529-2013","Ingram, Lachlan/0000-0002-4697-9504; Buyer, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2098-0547",Abandoned Coal Mine Land Research Program; Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality,"We would like to acknowledge the funding assistance provided by the Abandoned Coal Mine Land Research Program and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to conduct this research.

These changes may affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and therefore have implications for terrestrial ecosystems. To assess these consequences we focused on AMF in semi-arid plant communities from SE Spain. We monitored root length colonization in Artemisia barrelled, a shrub species endemic from the most arid systems in SE Spain, growing in plots subjected to different precipitation regimes according to scenarios predicted by the IPCC for this region. Our results showed that mycorrhizal associations responded to changing precipitation regimes. Specifically, vesicles decreased with decreasing annual precipitation and arbuscules increased with stronger seasonal drought but decreased with lower annual precipitation and other seasonal changes. It may then be expected that dryer conditions in arid ecosystems caused by climate change will alter arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions in different ways depending on the intensity of the drought, thereby influencing the dynamics of extant plant communities.

In this procedure, an array of simple organic substrates is added to soil samples, and the resulting multiple respiration values are used to give a functional description of the microbial community. In this study, we tested 44 substrates and five substrate concentrations for their ability to discriminate land use types and individual sites, specifically in large scale surveillance and monitoring programs. We assessed the concentrations with the coefficient of variation and found only little differences (less than 0.8 units) in the discriminative power of sites. Therefore we recommend using the amount equivalent to the substrate-induced respiration. In practice, most substrates performed well with respect to number of re-measurements, linearity of measurement curves and retail price. A Principle Components Analysis of all 44 substrates successfully ordinated land use types in distinct clusters and identified sites of unusual soil condition (e.g. especially wet or freshly fertilised sites). The discriminative power of 26 substrates was high (> 60% contribution to total variance) and substrates were equally appropriate to differentiate land use. Four optimum substrates were identified (threonine, malonic acid, quinic acid and pantothenic acid) that together explained 86% of the empirical data variation and yielded an almost identical ordination of sites as the full substrate set. Thus, the number of substrates in future studies can be considerably reduced. A resemblance matrix based on root exudates was highly (76%) correlated to a non-exudate matrix, indicating that root exudates were not better suited for community-level profiling than others. We discuss current measurement systems and suggest using more than just several grams of whole soil samples per measurement to adequately represent field conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In addition, we analyze the similarities between the AMF communities in coffee production systems and those that occur in a tropical montane cloud forest patch in order to evaluate the capacity of coffee production systems to preserve the native AMF community. We carried out four samplings in five coffee production systems representative of a vegetation structure gradient, and in a forest. From 120 soil samples, 33 morphospecies were detected. In all the sites, the dominant morphospecies were and sp. 3. We found no significant difference in AMF spore richness between sites. Diversity was similar in most of the coffee production systems. Significant differences were only detected in spore abundance; during the dry season the forest, shaded traditional rustic system and shaded simple system presented the highest spore abundance. With the exception of one species exclusive to the forest, the coffee production systems all share the same AMF species as the forest. The coffee production systems with the greatest similarity to cloud forest were the shaded traditional rustic system and the shaded simple system. It is suggested that control of weeds and fertilization could be important factors influencing the composition and abundance of AMF spores in coffee production systems.","[Maria Arias, Rosa; Heredia-Abarca, Gabriela; Sosa, Vinicio J.] Inst Ecol AC, Xalapa 91070, Ver, Mexico; [Maria Arias, Rosa; Ernesto Fuentes-Ramirez, Luis] Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Ctr Invest Ciencias Microbiol, Puebla 72570, Pue, Mexico","Arias, RM (reprint author), Inst Ecol AC, Carretera Antigua Coatepec,351 Col El Haya, Xalapa 91070, Ver, Mexico.",rosy.arias@inecol.edu.mx,"Heredia, Gabriela/I-9194-2014; VJ, Sosa/Q-6888-2018; Fuentes, Luis E/Q-9675-2018; Arias, Rosa Maria/I-9200-2014","Heredia, Gabriela/0000-0001-7047-412X; VJ, Sosa/0000-0002-4712-3900; Fuentes, Luis E/0000-0002-8053-7742; ","SEMARNAT-CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [2002-01-C01-0194, C01-0194]; FORDECYT [139378]","This study was supported by the project SEMARNAT-CONACyT (2002-01-C01-0194).

The understory Sasa enhances the soil respiration rate both before and after the clearcutting of deciduous broad-leaved forest. The Sasa sites had larger total belowground biomass compared with the non-Sasa sites, which could be attributed to Sasa presence. Our results also suggest that clearcutting decreases temperature-normalized soil respiration rates (R-15) and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in both Sasa and non-Sasa ecosystems. Clearcutting significantly reduced the fine root biomass of trees and Sasa. The fine roots of trees and Sasa had high specific respiration rates compared with larger roots and rhizomes at Sasa and non-Sasa sites, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesize that the loss of fine roots after clearcutting is responsible for the reduction in soil respiration rate. A comparison with other studies revealed a positive linear relationship between total (tree and Sasa) fine root biomass and R-15, suggesting that fine root biomass controls soil respiration at the landscape scale. The Q(10) value is also likely to be related to fine root biomass, although the relationship was not significant. We conclude that understory Sasa increases belowground biomass, especially fine roots, and the spatial variation in soil respiration at the landscape scale.","[Yashiro, Yuichiro; Shizu, Yoko] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, Takayama Expt Field Stn, Takayama, Gifu 5060815, Japan; [Adachi, Tatsuharu; Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki; Iimura, Yasuo] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Lee, Na-yeon] Natl Pk Res Inst, Namwon Si 590811, Jeonllabuk Do, South Korea; [Koizumi, Hiroshi] Waseda Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628480, Japan","Yashiro, Y (reprint author), Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, Takayama Expt Field Stn, 919-47 Iwaicho, Takayama, Gifu 5060815, Japan.",yashiro@green.gifu-u.ac.jp,", _______/V-6687-2019",", _______/0000-0002-9032-7933","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japanese Alps Interuniversity Cooperative Project","We thank Mr. Kenji Kurumado and Mr. Norihiro Miyamoto of Gifu University, Japan, for assistance with field measurements.

The results indicated the following: (1) Root morphology: under excellent soil moisture conditions, seedlings developed many horizontal roots and root sprouts to compete for light; but under poor soil moisture, the vertical root system expanded its resource space into deeper soil. Plasticity of root morphology is an important strategy to capture water and adapt to the hyperarid environment. (2) Root/shoot ratio: root/shoot ratio increased with declining soil moisture, and this trend was more obvious later in the growing season. Increase of root/shoot ratio is a strategy for adapting to drought. (3) Growth of root system: The seedlings prefer to develop roots in shallower surface layers with less water availability. The growth depth and vertical growth rate of roots increased with decreased soil moisture. (4) Accumulation of root biomass: biomass and surface area of the root system decreased with increased soil depth, with the roots distributed in an 'inverted pyramid' in vertical section view. The formation of root biomass conformed to a logistic 'slow-quick-slow' growth curve, and total biomass decreased with intensity of soil drought. The findings will provide data useful for effective restoration of and better utilization of water resources in hyperarid regions.","[Zeng, Fan-jiang; Lu, Yan; Guo, Hai-feng; Liu, Bo; Zeng, Jie; Zhang, Li-Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Fan-jiang; Lu, Yan; Guo, Hai-feng; Liu, Bo; Zeng, Jie; Zhang, Li-Gang] Cele Natl Stn Observat & Res Desert Grassland Eco, Cele 848300, Peoples R China","Zeng, FJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 S Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",zengfj369@sohu.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30870471, 31070477]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-EW-316]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 30870471, 31070477) and the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

The intention was to study whether these two species promoted the diversity of AM fungi in their rhizospheres differently and to ascertain whether the AMF community harboured by an annual plant species differed from that harboured by a perennial species when both grew in the same place. The AMF large subunit ribosomal RNA genes (LSU) were subjected to nested PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Twenty AMF sequence types belonging to Glomus group A, Glomus group B and Diversispora were identified. The two plant species differed in the AMF community composition in their roots, B. rubens showing a higher diversity of AMF than B. retusum. However the composition of the AMF communities associated with the two rhizosphere soils was similar. These results suggest that the management of these Mediterranean, semiarid degraded areas should include the promotion of annual herbaceous plant communities in order to maintain the sustainability and productivity of these ecosystems.","[Torrecillas, Emma; del Mar Alguacil, Maria; Roldan, Antonio] CSIC Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Murcia 30100, Spain","Alguacil, MD (reprint author), CSIC Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, POB 164,Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",mmalguacil@cebas.csic.es,"del Mar Alguacil, Maria/M-3859-2014; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013","del Mar Alguacil, Maria/0000-0001-8495-8707; Roldan, Antonio/0000-0002-2610-7784","Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, SpainMinistry of Education and Science, Spain; Spanish CICYTConsejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT) [AGL2009.12530-CO2-O1]","MM Alguacil was supported by the Ramon y Cajal programme (Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, Spain).

It has been shown that mutualism can grade into parasitism, but even when exchange is mutually beneficial, a conflict of interest remains because each partner benefits from reaping more benefits at a lower cost. Metaphorically, the partners negotiate the conditions of trade, the outcome of which will determine the net benefit to each partner. Each partner can adjust its allocation to self-provisioning while negotiating the ratio at which benefits are exchanged. To understand how these two features of trade affect mutualisms, we used the example of the plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal mutualism and modeled uptake and trade of two resources, phosphorus and carbon. In most contexts, the fungus specialized on phosphorus uptake while the plant took up both phosphorus and carbon. However, when phosphorus was abundant and light was scarce, the plant specialized, taking up only carbon and relying on trade for phosphorus. Resource availability was the most important factor determining specialization and the outcome of negotiation and trade, but other aspects of the context were also important. These results suggest experiments to link these two key features of trade with environmental conditions to determine the outcome of mutualism.","[Grman, Emily] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Grman, E (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",grmanemi@msu.edu,"Klausmeier, Christopher/J-9339-2012",,"James S.

Why cooperate if defection potentially reaps greater benefits? It is commonly assumed that spatial structure (limited dispersal) aligns the interests of mutualistic partners. But does spatial structure consistently promote cooperation? Here, we formally model the role of spatial structure in maintaining mutualism. We show theoretically that spatial structure can actually disfavor cooperation by limiting the suite of potential partners. The effect of spatial structuring depends on the scale (fine or coarse level) at which hosts reward their partners. We then test our predictions by using molecular methods to track the abundance of competing, closely related, cooperative, and less cooperative arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbionts on host roots over multiple generations. We find that when spatial structure is reduced by mixing soil, the relative success of the more cooperative AM fungal species increases. This challenges previous suggestions that high spatial structuring is critical for stabilizing cooperation in the mycorrhizal mutualism. More generally, our results show, both theoretically and empirically, that contrary to expectations, spatial structuring can select against cooperation.","[Verbruggen, Erik; Akkermans, Geert; Kiers, E.

Trees on twelve 75 x 75-m plots were girdled according to four treatments: girdling all the oaks on the plot (OG), girdling half of the oak trees on a plot (O50), girdling all non-oaks on a plot (NO), and a control (C). In addition, one circular plot (diameter 50 m) was created where all trees were girdled (ALL). Soil respiration was measured before and after tree girdling. A conservative estimate of the total autotrophic contribution is approximately 50%, as indicated by results on the ALL and OG plots. Rapid declines in carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from both the ALL and OG plots, 37 and 33%, respectively, were observed within 2 weeks following the treatment, demonstrating a fast turnover of recently fixed carbon. Responses from the NO and O50 treatments were statistically similar to the control. A non-proportional decline in respiration rates along the gradient of change in live aboveground biomass complicated partitioning of the overall rate of soil respiration and indicates that belowground carbon flux is not linearly related to aboveground disturbance. Our findings suggest that in this system there is a threshold disturbance level between 35 and 74% of live aboveground biomass loss, beyond which belowground dynamics change dramatically.","[Levy-Varon, Jennifer H.; Griffin, Kevin L.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Schuster, William S.

After more than 11 years of free-air CO2 enrichment in a Liquidambar styraciflua L. (sweetgum) plantation in Oak Ridge, TN, USA, greater inputs of fine roots resulted in the incorporation of new C (i.e., C with a depleted d13C) into root-derived particulate organic matter (POM) pools to 90-cm depth. Even though production in the sweetgum stand was limited by soil N availability, soil C and N contents were greater throughout the soil profile under elevated [CO2] at the conclusion of the experiment. Greater C inputs from fine-root detritus under elevated [CO2] did not result in increased net N immobilization or C mineralization rates in long-term laboratory incubations, possibly because microbial biomass was lower in the CO2-enriched plots. Furthermore, the d13CO2 of the C mineralized from the incubated soil closely tracked the d13C of the labile POM pool in the elevated [CO2] treatment, especially in shallower soil, and did not indicate significant priming of the decomposition of pre-experiment soil organic matter (SOM). Although potential C mineralization rates were positively and linearly related to total SOM C content in the top 30 cm of soil, this relationship did not hold in deeper soil. Taken together with an increased mean residence time of C in deeper soil pools, these findings indicate that C inputs from relatively deep roots under elevated [CO2] may increase the potential for long-term soil C storage. However, C in deeper soil is likely to take many years to accrue to a significant fraction of total soil C given relatively smaller root inputs at depth. Expanded representation of biogeochemical cycling throughout the soil profile may improve model projections of future forest responses to rising atmospheric [CO2].","[Iversen, Colleen M.; Garten, Charles T., Jr.; Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Keller, Jason K.] Chapman Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Orange, CA 92866 USA","Iversen, CM (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, 1 Bethel Valley Rd,Bldg 2040, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",iversencm@ornl.gov,"Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012; Iversen, Colleen M/B-8983-2012","Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Iversen, Colleen M/0000-0001-8293-3450; Garten, Charles/0000-0001-5303-3031","United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); United States Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","Thanks to D.

Our previous studies showed that serpentine and non-serpentine adapted ecotypes of Collinisa sparsiflora associates with distinct AMF assemblages, but a common garden experiment showed that this pattern was not due to host-fungal preference. We hypothesized that the observed differences in AMF associated with C. sparsiflora ecotypes was driven by edaphically defined AMF assemblages. To test this idea we employed a broader sampling of the plant community from five serpentine and five non-serpentine sites in close proximity (50-150 m between sites) and identified AMF and plant species associated with root samples by amplifying rDNA and cpDNA respectively, cloning, and sequencing. We compared AMF and plant assemblages, and measured the relative contribution of distance, plant and soil factors on AMF assembly. Analyses clearly showed that serpentine and non-serpentine AMF assemblages are distinct-with the complete absence of the non-serpentine dominant AMF taxon on serpentine. These results show strong edaphic sorting of serpentine tolerant/adapted AMF taxa in serpentine soil and indicate a strong ecological correlation between AMF and plant tolerance to serpentine soil.","[Schechter, S.

Given the complexity inherent to interactions between different evolutionary entities, ecological factors may especially limit the power of trade-off models to predict evolutionary change. Here, we use four case studies to examine the importance of ecological context for the study of trade-offs in organismal interactions: (1) resource-based mutualisms, (2) parasite transmission and virulence, (3) plant biological invasions, and (4) host range evolution in parasites and parasitoids. In the first two case studies, mechanistic trade-off models have long provided a strong theoretical framework but face the challenge of testing assumptions under ecologically realistic conditions. Work under the second two case studies often has a strong ecological grounding, but faces challenges in identifying or quantifying the underlying genetic mechanism of the trade-off. Attention is given to recent studies that have bridged the gap between evolutionary mechanism and ecological realism. Finally, we explore the distinction between ecological factors that mask the underlying evolutionary trade-offs, and factors that actually change the trade-off relationship between fitness-related traits important to organismal interactions.","[Asplen, Mark K.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Bruns, Emily; David, Aaron S.; Kaiser, Matthew C.; Mohl, Emily K.; Quiram, Gina; Prescott, Kristina; Stanton-Geddes, John; Wragg, Peter D.] Univ Minnesota, Grad Program Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Denison, R.

This review shows that water uptake by roots from the least saline part of the soil is the key factor driving shoot growth; plants with part of the root at low salinity (0-10 mM NaCl) had 3- to 10-fold higher shoot dry mass than plants with roots in uniformly saline (50-800 mM NaCl) media. Plants in heterogeneous salinity had shoot water potentials similar to those of plants growing in uniform low-salt media, and this was likely a result of uptake of low salinity water and reduced stomatal conductance. Under heterogeneous conditions, roots in saline media took up ions, resulting in higher shoot Na+ and Cl- concentrations compared with plants growing in low-salt media. Results from split-root experiments complement knowledge of plant responses to uniform salinities; the next challenge is to develop new protocols so that this understanding can be extrapolated to more complex soil- and field-based systems. More work is also required to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in stomatal conductance and shoot ion regulation in plants under heterogeneous salinities and how these are linked to the saline parts of the root-zone.","[Bazihizina, Nadia; Barrett-Lennard, Edward G.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Ecohydrol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bazihizina, Nadia; Barrett-Lennard, Edward G.; Colmer, Timothy D.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Barrett-Lennard, Edward G.] Univ Western Australia, Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Colmer, Timothy D.] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Bazihizina, N (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Ecohydrol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",nadia.bazihizina@graduate.uwa.edu.au,"Bazihizina, Nadia/L-5355-2019; Bazihizina, Nadia/O-9674-2015; Colmer, Timothy/A-9994-2011; Barrett-Lennard, Edward G/D-5387-2011","Bazihizina, Nadia/0000-0003-4856-0659; Bazihizina, Nadia/0000-0003-4856-0659; Colmer, Timothy/0000-0002-3383-9596; Barrett-Lennard, Edward G/0000-0001-9945-1044","Australian GovernmentAustralian Government; University of Western Australia; ACIAR [LWR/2009/034]; School of Plant Biology (UWA); Western Australian Government's Centre for Ecohydrology; Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research CentreAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme","We are grateful to the Director General of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food for the permission to use Fig. 1a.

Roots from a well-preserved area of the ecosystem were extracted from soil and analyzed by nested PCR, single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of the NS31-AM1 and NS8-ARCH1311 regions of the small subunit of the ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). Ten AM fungal phylotypes were identified; eight belonged to the Glomeraceae and two to the Diversisporaceae. Only two of the phylotypes clustered with sequences of morphologically defined species and a high dominance by one AM group (Glomus intraradices) was detected. Our diversity analyses revealed that the AM fungal communities of G. cinerea, L. latifolia and T. mastichina did not significantly differ while the AM fungal communities of R. officinalis and T. zygis were distant from this cluster and from each other. The highest diversity was found in the roots of T. zygis. Our data indicate that co-occurring plant species may house distinct communities of AM fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

At the local scale, the distribution of AMF is well documented. Studies at large scales, however, are limited because intensive sampling is difficult. Here, we used ITS rDNA sequence metadata obtained from public databases to study the distribution of AMF at continental and global scales. We also used these sequence metadata to investigate whether host plant is the main factor that affects the distribution of AMF at large scales. Results: We defined 305 ITS virtual taxa (ITS-VTs) among all sequences of the Glomeromycota by using a comprehensive maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Each host taxonomic order averaged about 53% specific ITS-VTs, and approximately 60% of the ITS-VTs were host specific. Those ITS-VTs with wide host range showed wide geographic distribution. Most ITS-VTs occurred in only one type of host functional group. The distributions of most ITS-VTs were limited across ecosystem, across continent, across biogeographical realm, and across climatic zone. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) showed that AMF community composition differed among functional groups of hosts, and among ecosystem, continent, biogeographical realm, and climatic zone. The Mantel test showed that AMF community composition was significantly correlated with plant community composition among ecosystem, among continent, among biogeographical realm, and among climatic zone. The structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the effects of ecosystem, continent, biogeographical realm, and climatic zone were mainly indirect on AMF distribution, but plant had strongly direct effects on AMF. Conclusion: The distribution of AMF as indicated by ITS rDNA sequences showed a pattern of high endemism at large scales. This pattern indicates high specificity of AMF for host at different scales (plant taxonomic order and functional group) and high selectivity from host plants for AMF. The effects of ecosystemic, biogeographical, continental and climatic factors on AMF distribution might be mediated by host plants.","[Yang, Haishui; Zang, Yanyan; Yuan, Yongge; Tang, Jianjun; Chen, Xin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chen, X (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol, Zijingang Campus,668 Yuhang Rd, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chen-tang@zju.edu.cn,,"Yang, Haishui/0000-0001-7255-9653","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [31070389, 30870405]","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Nos. 31070389 and 30870405).

However, data is particularly limited for forests in permafrost regions. In this study, therefore, we estimated the above- and belowground biomass of a black spruce (Picea mariana) stand underlain with permafrost in interior Alaska. Allometric equations were established using 4-6 sample trees to estimate the biomass of the aboveground parts and the coarse roots (roots >5 mm in diameter) of P. mariana trees. The aboveground biomass of understory plants and the fine-root biomass were estimated by destructive sampling. The aboveground and coarse-root biomasses of the P. mariana trees were estimated to be 3.97 and 2.31 kg m(-2), respectively. The aboveground biomass of understory vascular plants such as Ledum groenlandicum and the biomass of forest floor mosses and lichens were 0.10 and 0.62 kg m(-2), respectively. The biomass of fine roots <5 mm in diameter was 1.27 kg m(-2). Thus, the above- and belowground biomasses of vascular plants in the P. mariana stand were estimated to be 4.07 and 3.58 kg m(-2), respectively, indicating that belowground biomass accounted for 47% of the total biomass of vascular plants. Fine-root biomass was 36% of the total root biomass, of which 90% was accumulated in the surface organic layer. Thus, this P. mariana stand can be characterized as having extremely high belowground biomass allocation, which would make it possible to grow on permafrost with limited soil resource availability.

For example, Centaurea stoebe invasion in the western US is at least partially due to AMF networks allowing Centaurea to parasitize sonic native plant species. Centaurea also invades sand clone systems of the northern Great Lakes region, which often have reduced or altered soil communities compared to other grasslands. In these habitats, AMF may play a different role in invasion success of this species. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare effects of soil biota and AMF on competitive interactions between Centaurea and two varieties of Ammophila breviligulata, a dominant native grass of Great Lakes sand dunes. We found that Centaurea growth was slowed by the presence of Ammophila competitors, while AMF had no direct or indirect effect on growth. Both Ammophila varieties were uninhibited by the presence of Centaurea. The commercially available Cape variety of Ammophila had more than twice the inhibitory effect of a native Michigan variety on Centaurea growth. It does not appear that Centaurea takes advantage of AMF networks in this dune system. Indeed, since Centaurea growth is actually reduced in direct competition with Ammophila, we suspect that invasion of dunes by this species is a result of disturbance. For land managers, planting Ammophila in open areas as part of a restoration plan may slow spread of Centaurea in this system.","[Emery, Sarah M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Emery, SM (reprint author), Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",sarah.emery@louisville.edu,,,Andrew W.

Soil, root and symptomatic foliage samples were collected from five separate sites where C. obtusa was the dominant species in cloud forests at ca. 18002500 m. Soil and fine root samples were baited with cedar needles; both direct isolation and cedar needle baiting were used on foliage samples. Phytophthora lateralis was obtained from soil at three of the sites, but only from three of the 27 soil samples overall. Only one of 25 root samples yielded the pathogen, and this was associated with infested soil. Three foliage samples with symptoms visible as dark brown to black frond tips also yielded P. lateralis; these came from two different sites. This is the first record of P. lateralis infecting the foliage of C. obtusa. Moreover, when some of the symptomatic Chamaecyparis foliage segments were incubated, sporangia of P. lateralis formed on the necrotic tissues, sometimes in the axils of needle segments. The study provides evidence that P. lateralis has both a soil/root infecting phase and an aerial or foliar infecting phase in Taiwan, which is consistent with its unusual combination of water-dispersed (non-papillate) and aerially dispersed (caducous) sporangia. It also demonstrates the importance of investigating the biology, aetiology and ecological behaviour of Phytophthoras in their native, endemic environments.","[Vettraino, A.

If these traits affect competition with native species, then management may benefit from considering the genetic landscape of the invader. Across their introduced range, Alliaria petiolata populations vary in their investment in allelopathic traits according to invasion history, which could lead to gradients of impact on native species. Red oak (Quercus rubra) seedlings were transplanted into eight A. petiolata-invaded sites that varied in their invasion history and allelochemical concentrations. At each site, an invader removal treatment was crossed with experimental inoculations of native soil biota, to test whether the benefits of these restoration actions differed across invader populations. Q. rubra seedlings grew faster in invader populations with a longer invasion history and lower allelochemical concentrations. Invader removal and soil inoculation interacted to determine seedling growth, with the benefits of soil inoculation increasing in younger and more highly allelopathic invader populations. A greenhouse experiment using soils collected from experimentally inoculated field plots found similar patterns. These results suggest that the impact of this invader varies across landscapes and that knowledge of this variation could improve the efficacy and efficiency of restoration activities.","[Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ralankau@illinois.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",USDA-NRIUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-02894],"I thank the Cook county Forest Preserve District, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Lake Forest Open Lands Association, the Army Corps of Engineers, the University of Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, and Paul Brewer for access to field sites.

However, little is known about their influence on podzols in coniferous forests. In our study we examined how soil chemical properties of a podzol in a Norway spruce stand are affected by preferential flow. We did three tracer experiments with Brilliant Blue FCF and analyzed soil chemical parameters (exchangeable cations, pH, total C, total N and C:N ratio) of preferential flow paths and soil matrix. For statistical analysis, we used mixed-effects models to account for a hierarchical sampling of our data. We found 5.0 g kg(-1) more C, 0.24 g kg(-1) more N, a C:N ratio larger by 2, smaller pH values (0.16 pH units), 32% more Ca and 57% more Mg in preferential flow paths than in soil matrix. Compared to the adjacent soil matrix, the content of Al did not differ significantly. However, 67% more Fe were found in preferential flow paths. These distinct chemical properties are probably due to root exudates, transport of solutes and dissolved organic carbon and percolation of acid soil solution from organic horizons along preferential paths. We attribute the increase of Ca and Mg to their transport via preferential flow paths after the application of lime some years ago. We conclude that a lower pH might enhance the release of Fe (and possibly Al) and thus increase podzolisation. In addition, our results show that soil liming could affect both the topsoil and the subsoil via transport of basic cations along preferential flow paths. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

Here we examine the impact of root branching order and season on key functional root traits for grass species. We also compare root traits among co-existing grass species as a step towards defining root trait syndromes. Methods Monocultures of 13 grass species, grown under field conditions and subjected to intensive management, were used to record root trait values for coarse roots (1st order, >0.3 mm), fine roots (2nd and 3rd orders, <0.2 mm) and mixed root samples over three growing seasons. Results Branching order and species had a significant effect on root trait values, whereas season showed a marginal effect. The diameter of coarse roots was more variable than that of fine roots and, as expected, coarse roots had higher tissue density and lower specific root length values than fine roots. Principal component analysis run on eight root traits provided evidence for two trait syndromes related to resource acquisition and conservation strategies across grass species. Conclusions Our data show that root branching order is the main determinant of root trait variation among species. This highlights the necessity to include the proportion of fine vs coarse roots when measuring traits of mixed root samples.","[Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Pilon, Remi; Tarroux, Emilie] INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res Team, UR874, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Pages, Loic] INRA, Plantes & Syst Culture Hort UR1115, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Robertson, Jean; Dawson, Lorna] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland","Picon-Cochard, C (reprint author), INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res Team, UR874, 234 Ave Brezet, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France.",picon@clermont.inra.fr,", Picon-Cochard/J-3954-2013; Pages, Loic/F-9893-2011",", Picon-Cochard/0000-0001-7728-8936; ",French government through GEOTRAITS; French government through GDR UTILITERRES; INRA EFPA Research Department; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS) Division,"We thank Sandrine Revaillot and Angelique Corrent for root collection, preparation and morphology measurements.

Here, we present the first systematic investigation of these rhizobia's genetic diversity and symbiotic interactions with their host plant. Methods Ninety-five isolates obtained from chickpea nodules in eight alkaline-saline (pH 8.24-8.45) sites in Xinjiang were characterized by nodulation test, symbiotic gene analysis, PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS), BOX-PCR, phylogenies of 16S rRNA and housekeeping genes (atpD, recA and glnII), multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and DNA-DNA hybridization. Results All 95 isolates were identified within the genus of Mesorhizobium. Similarities less than 96.5% in MLSA and DNA-DNA hybridization values (<50%) between the new isolates and the defined Mesorhizobium species, and high similarities (>98%) of symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) with those of the well studied chickpea microsymbioints Mesorhizobium ciceri and Mesorhizobium mediterraneum were found. Conclusions Chickpea rhizobia in alkaline-saline soils of Xinjiang, China, form a population distinct from the defined Mesorhizobium species. All these chickpea rhizobia in Xinjiang harbored symbiotic genes highly similar to the type strains of two well-studied chickpea rhizobia, M. ciceri and M. mediterraneum, evidencing the possible lateral transfer of symbiotic genes among these different rhizobial species. On the other hand, chickpea may strongly select rhizobia with a unique symbiotic gene background.","[Zhang, Jun Jie; Wang, En Tao; Tian, Chang Fu; Sui, Xin Hua; Chen, Wen Feng; Chen, Wen Xin] China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun Jie; Wang, En Tao; Tian, Chang Fu; Sui, Xin Hua; Chen, Wen Feng; Chen, Wen Xin] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Lou, Kai] Xinjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Microbiol, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Xiang; Mao, Pei Hong] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Phys Sci & Technol, Inst Ion Beam Biotechnol, Urumqi 830008, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, En Tao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Microbiol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico","Chen, WF (reprint author), China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",chenwf@cau.edu.cn,"Tian, Chang Fu/C-2507-2012; TIAN, Chang Fu/O-4482-2019","Tian, Chang Fu/0000-0002-0479-363X; TIAN, Chang Fu/0000-0002-0479-363X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China; Agricultural Scientific Achievement Transformation of Ministry of Science and Technology; SKLAB; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund; IPN; ICyT DF of Mexico,"This work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Agricultural Scientific Achievement Transformation of Ministry of Science and Technology, funds from SKLAB, Chinese Universities Scientific Fund and ""973"".

Variation in the effectiveness of mutualistic associations is well characterized in plantsoil symbiont interactions, yet there are little empirical data providing insight into how such variation evolves and persists in natural settings. 2. Heterogeneity in the strength and direction of co-evolutionary selection among spatially discrete demes is predicted to be important for the maintenance of genetic variation in species interactions. Here, we experimentally test the potential for local adaptation to generate phenotypic divergence among wild host-symbiont populations using two leguminous host species that differ in their specificity for rhizobial partners. 3. Molecular characterization of host populations and associated rhizobial communities revealed significant among-population genetic differentiation. Reciprocal cross-inoculation experiments testing for variation in the fitness of nine populations of Acacia salicina and A. stenophylla in response to inoculation with rhizobia revealed variation in host response to the mutualism (both host species), and the benefit conferred by different rhizobial populations (A. salicina only). However, there was no indication that host population-by-rhizobial population interactions influence the outcomes of mutualism for the host. 4. We further examined potential correlations between (i) plant response to inoculation and (ii) rhizobial effectiveness, with variation in soil fertility at the sites from which plant and rhizobial samples originated. Data from the cross-inoculation experiments revealed no correlations between soil chemistry, water availability and either host or rhizobial performance. However, analysis of results from an extensive whole-soil inoculation trial including nearly 60 A. salicina and A. stenophylla sites showed a significant negative correlation between levels of soil nitrogen and plant response to inoculation. 5. Overall, these findings suggest that selection for local adaptation may play little role in maintaining phenotypic variation in these interactions. We hypothesize that mutualistic interactions occurring among communities of hosts and symbionts do not favour co-evolutionary divergence among populations.","[Barrett, Luke G.; Broadhurst, Linda M.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Barrett, LG (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",luke.barrett@csiro.au,"Broadhurst, Linda/J-6907-2012; Thrall, Peter/J-6672-2013; Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015","Broadhurst, Linda/0000-0002-9853-3328; Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; NSW Environmental Trust,"We thank Shamsul Hoque, Jacqui Mackinnon and Jo Slattery for technical support.

However, it is largely unknown if and how earthworms and AMF may affect plant succession. We planted mesocosms with an early-mid successional and a mid-late successional grassland plant community and added endogeic earthworms and commercial AMF in a full-factorial way to natural background soil. Earthworms had a positive effect on the total root and shoot biomass of both plant communities, with the effect on the shoots being slightly enhanced by co-inoculation with AMF. Surprisingly, the earthworm effect on the mid successional plant species depended on the successional stage of the plant community. Earthworms had a positive effect on the mid successional plant species when they were growing in the mid-late successional plant community, but no effect when the same plant species were growing in the early-mid successional plant community. Addition of AMF alone tended to reduce the shoot biomass of the early successional plant species, while the addition of earthworms in the presence or absence of AMF increased their shoot biomass. We conclude that the impacts of earthworms on plant species may depend on the successional stage of the plant community, while the effect of AMF addition depends on the successional stage of the plant community and may be changed by the presence of earthworms. Earthworms and AMF addition affect plants and plant communities of different successional stages differently with potential effects on plant succession.","[Mammitzsch, Lisa; Teply, Anja; Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Wurst, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",s.wurst@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,32,5,7,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2012,213,4,,,,,675,683,,10.1007/s11258-012-0031-7,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,919TE,WOS:000302350900013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Heinemeyer, A; Tortorella, D; Petrovicova, B; Gelsomino, A",,,,"Heinemeyer, A.; Tortorella, D.; Petrovicova, B.; Gelsomino, A.",,,Partitioning of soil CO2 flux components in a temperate grassland ecosystem,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; UPLAND GRASSLAND; ROOT RESPIRATION; CARBON; DIVERSITY; BIOMASS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; DECOMPOSITION,"We deployed an automated multiplexed soil-respiration (SR) system to monitor partitioned soil CO2 component fluxes (from roots, mycorrhizal hyphae and heterotrophs) in a UK grassland using a combination of shallow surface (total SR flux), deep (excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi) and 20-mu m pore mesh window soil collars (excluding roots only). Soil CO2 efflux was monitored during a 3-month period during summer. Repeated cutting of mycorrhizal connections in some of the mycorrhizal treatments enabled assessment of subsequent recovery of mycorrhizal fluxes and a comparison with deep collar fluxes. After soil collar insertion, fluxes in the deep collars were significantly reduced, by approximately 40%. Whereas fluxes in the uncut, mycorrhizal collar treatments remained close to those from the surface collar, cut mycorrhizal treatments showed an immediate reduction after cutting to values close to those from the deep collar with a subsequent recovery of around 4 weeks. Overall, the autotrophic root and mycorrhizal flux was relatively stable throughout. Whereas root fluxes contributed about 10-30% of the total flux during the initial larger flux period, this declined and there was an increased mycorrhizal contribution during the latter part of the measurement period. Moreover, SR flux components differed in their response to key climatic factors, with root fluxes responding equally to temperature and light. Importantly, whereas the heterotrophic flux component responded strongly to temperature and soil moisture, the mycorrhizal component responded much less to those factors, but more to light. We also investigated treatment impacts over time on soil biochemical variables such as microbial biomass C, extractable C, microbial quotient and metabolic quotient, and bacterial community structure, and discussed these in relation to measured SR fluxes and the partitioning technique.","[Heinemeyer, A.] Univ York, York Ctr, Dept Environm, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Tortorella, D.; Petrovicova, B.; Gelsomino, A.] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dipartimento Biotecnol Monitoraggio Agroalimentar, I-89124 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy","Heinemeyer, A (reprint author), Univ York, York Ctr, Dept Environm, Stockholm Environm Inst, Grimston House, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",andreas.heinemeyer@york.ac.uk,"Gelsomino, Antonio/Y-7810-2019","GELSOMINO, Antonio/0000-0001-5915-7625; Heinemeyer, Andreas/0000-0003-3151-2466",COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [639 (COST-STSM-639-03461)]; Mediterranean University at Reggio Calabria,The authors are grateful to Red House Estate for site access and R.

Although losses from living EMM occur via respiration and exudation. EMM represents a considerable biomass component and potential carbon sink in many forest soils. ECM root tips and rhizomorphs may persist in soil for many months, but interactions between grazing arthropods and decomposers probably facilitate more rapid turnover of diffuse EMM. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] is likely to increase carbon allocation to ECM fungi by their tree hosts. This will probably increase root colonization by ECM fungi and drive changes in their communities in soil. The likely effects of elevated [CO2] and other climate change factors on the production and turnover of EMM production are difficult to predict from current evidence, and this hampers our understanding of their potential value as future carbon sinks. Responses of grazing soil arthropods to future climate change will have a strong influence on EMM turnover, along with the abilities of ECM fungi to store carbon in below-ground, and this should be seen as a priority area for future research.

Hyphae adhered closely or were embedded in mucilage-like materials on the epidermis. Epidermal cells and root hairs of the non-inoculated second-order lateral roots developing from the taproot harbored polyphenolic compounds that were stained by TBO. At non-inoculated stage, the average numbers of epidermal cells stained entirely (PC2), stained partially (PC1) or remaining unstained (PC0) were 16.5 +/- A 0.7, 0 +/- A 0, and 0 +/- A 0, respectively. At the early mantled stage, the numbers were 6.5 +/- A 1.6, 5.2 +/- A 1.4, and 4.2 +/- A 1.0, and at the mycorrhizal stage, it was 0 +/- A 0, 0 +/- A 0, and 32.8 +/- A 1.3 for PC2, PC1, and PC0, respectively. Total phenolic content in the root tips at each developmental stage declined with ECM development. The early mantled stage involved a dynamic process of polyphenol localization. However, some epidermal cells and endodermal cells of the proximal zone accumulated polyphenols. Eventually, polyphenolic compounds, which were found abundantly in the epidermal cells and root hairs of the non-inoculated lateral roots of the host, disappeared at the mycorrhization process with the symbiont.","[Jung, Nam Chul; Tamai, Yutaka] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Lab Forest Resource Biol, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Tamai, Y (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Lab Forest Resource Biol, Kita Ku, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",ytamai@for.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20255002]; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea","This study was financially supported from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (#20255002) and also the National Research Foundation of Korea.

Because there is very little information about the rhizobia that nodulate and fix nitrogen in rooibos, the characterization of rhizobial strains and their ability to nodulate A. linearis was investigated in this study. Soils intially collected from the rhizosphere of different Aspalathus populations were used in a baiting experiment to trap rhizobia by rooibos roots. The rhizobia trapped in the nodules were re-isolated and used in Koch's postulate experiment using the Leonard jar assembly in the glasshouse. The strains that formed on the average between five and 12 indeterminate pink nodules per plant resulted in statistically significant (P = 0.05) increase in shoot and root dry weights. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA sequence of the isolates from the root nodules revealed for the first time that A. linearis is nodulated by different groups of rhizobia belonging to members of both the alpha-Proteobacteria and the beta-Proteobacteria. It was also found that only 2% of the total rhizobia isolated from the root nodules of rooibos were represented by the genus Bradyrhizobium. The finding that rooibos is nodulated by different groups of alpha-rhizobia and beta-rhizobia provides valuable information both in the study of the microbial ecology of rooibos and in the selection of highly efficient nitrogen fixing strains for the commercial cultivation of this indigenous legume.","[Hassen, Ahmed Idris; Bopape, Francina Lebogang; Habig, Johannes] ARC Plant Protect Res Inst, ZA-0121 Pretoria, South Africa; [Lamprecht, Sandra Christina] ARC Plant Protect Res Inst, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa","Hassen, AI (reprint author), ARC Plant Protect Res Inst, Private Bag X134, ZA-0121 Pretoria, South Africa.",HassenA@arc.agric.za,,,South African Rooibos Council; Agricultural Research Council (ARC),"The authors would like to acknowledge the South African Rooibos Council and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) for the financial support provided, Prof Ben-Eric van Wyk for the identification of the localities where soil samples from wild rooibos populations were collected, Dr Elize Jooste for reading the manuscript and providing valuable comments, Mr Frikkie Calitz from the Biometry unit of the ARC for his advise and support in the statistical analysis, the technical assistance of Johan Brand (Rooibos Ltd.) and staff of the Soilborn Plant Diseases Unit and Nitrogen Fixation Unit of the ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute to accomplish this project.",,35,12,13,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Fungi are exceptionally diverse and play key roles in ecosystem function, yet despite predictions of negative impacts due to urbanization, fungi have been generally overlooked in urban ecological studies. We surveyed fungi in 16 remnant river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis: Myrtaceae) woodlands along a gradient of 435 km from the city of Melbourne (south-east Australia). Using both sporocarp surveys and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP; primer pair ITS1-F-ITS4), we examined relationships between fungal community composition, landscape context (i.e. urbanization) and soil physicochemical properties. Community compositions from sporocarp data were significantly correlated with those from T-RFLP data, largely because of correlations with ectomycorrhizal sporocarps (Spearman rank correlation coefficients ? 0.310.42) rather than saprotrophic fungi (? 0.180.21). Principal components analysis of soil properties and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations of fungal community composition showed no clear separation of sites according to urbanization, and there were no significant correlations between fungal community composition and urbanization. However, fungal community composition was significantly correlated with soil chemical properties (? 0.410.55). These data suggest that site-scale soil properties, and associated effects of past and current land management activities, were more important in determining fungal community composition than the landscape-level influences of urbanization.","[Newbound, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Dept Bot, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Newbound, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Royal Bot Gardens Melbourne, Australian Res Ctr Urban Ecol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Bennett, Lauren T.; Tibbits, Josquin] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Creswick, Vic, Australia; [Tibbits, Josquin] Victorian AgriBiosci Ctr, Dept Primary Ind, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Kasel, Sabine] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Newbound, M (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",newbound@unimelb.edu.au,"Bennett, Lauren/G-9609-2016","Bennett, Lauren/0000-0003-2472-062X",ARCUE; Holsworth Wildlife Research Fund; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Albert Shimmins Memorial Fund,"We thank M.

In the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, reports of parasitism suggest that reductions in plant carbon allocation are not universally effective. I asked whether plant species differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness would affect both their susceptibility to parasitism and their reduction in allocation to non-beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in high-phosphorus soils. In a greenhouse experiment, I found that two C-3 grasses, Bromus inermis and Elymus repens, effectively suppressed root colonization and AMF hyphal abundance. Increases in soil phosphorus did not reduce the degree to which AMF increased plant biomass. In contrast, two C-4 grasses, Andropogon gerardii and Schizachyrium scoparium, more weakly reduced root colonization and failed to suppress AMF hyphal abundance. Consequently, they experienced strong declines in their response to AMF, and one species suffered parasitism. Thus, species differ in susceptibility to parasitism and their reduction in allocation to non-beneficial AMF. These differences may affect the distribution and abundance of plants and AMF, as well as the stability of the mutualism.","[Grman, Emily] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grman, Emily] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Grman, E (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",grmanemi@msu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0909942]; Michigan State University; Kellogg Biological Station; KBS ROKS; Learn program; Intern program,"For help with experimental design and writing, I thank Kay Gross, Heather Reynolds, Yair Shachar-Hill, Chris Klausmeier, Jen Lau, Toby Kiers, and an anonymous reviewer.

To test these hypotheses, we characterized the richness, diversity, and composition of rhizosphere fungi colonizing three alpine plant species, Taraxacum ceratophorum, Taraxacum officinale, and Polemonium viscosum. Roots were collected from open meadow and willow understory habitats at treeline on Pennsylvania Mountain, Colorado, USA. Fungal small subunit ribosomal DNA was sequenced using fungal-specific primers, sample-specific DNA tags, and 454 pyrosequencing. We classified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) or non-arbuscular mycorrhizal (non-AMF) fungi and then tested whether habitat or host identity influenced these fungal communities. Approximately 14% of the sequences represented AMF taxa (44 OTUs) with the majority belonging to Glomus groups A and B. Non-AMF sequences represented 186 OTUs belonging to Ascomycota (58%), Basidiomycota (26%), Zygomycota (14%), and Chytridiomycota (2%) phyla. Total AMF and non-AMF richness were similar between habitats but varied among host species. AMF richness and diversity per root sample also varied among host species and were highest in T. ceratophorum compared with T. officinale and P. viscosum. In contrast, non-AMF richness and diversity per root sample were similar among host species except in the willow understory where diversity was reduced in T. officinale. Fungal community composition was influenced by host identity but not habitat. Specifically, T. officinale hosted a different AMF community than T. ceratophorum and P. viscosum while P. viscosum hosted a different non-AMF community than T. ceratophorum and T. officinale. Our results suggest that host identity has a stronger effect on rhizosphere fungi than habitat. Furthermore, although host identity influenced both AMF and non-AMF, this effect was stronger for the mutualistic AMF community.","[Becklin, Katie M.; Hertweck, Kate L.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Jumpponen, Ari] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Becklin, KM (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",kbecklin@ku.edu,,"Hertweck, Kate/0000-0002-4026-4612",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0808000]; University of Missouri,"A NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grant (DEB-0808000) and the University of Missouri funded this study.

Our main objective was to assess the degree of variation in fungal richness and community composition as vegetation cover increases along the chronosequence. Sixty root systems of B.vivipara were sampled in vegetation zones delimited by dated moraines in front of a retreating glacier in Norway. We extracted DNA from rinsed root systems, amplified the ITS1 region using fungal-specific primers and analysed the amplicons using 454 sequencing. Between 437 and 5063 sequences were obtained from each root system. Clustering analyses using a 98.5% sequence similarity cut-off yielded a total of 470 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), excluding singletons. Between eight and 41 fungal OTUs were detected within each root system. Already in the first stage of succession, a high fungal diversity was present in the B.vivipara root systems. Total number of OTUs increased significantly along the gradient towards climax vegetation, but the average number of OTUs per root system stayed unchanged. There was a high patchiness in distribution of fungal OTUs across root systems, indicating that stochastic processes to a large extent structure the fungal communities. However, time since deglaciation had impact on the fungal community structure, as a systematic shift in the community composition was observed along the chronosequence. Ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes were the dominant fungi in the roots of B.vivipara, when it comes to both number of OTUs and number of sequences.","[Blaalid, Rakel; Carlsen, Tor; Kumar, Surendra; Kauserud, Havard] Univ Oslo, MERG, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Halvorsen, Rune] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Fontana, Giovanni] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol, Ecol Grp, I-48123 Ravenna, Italy","Blaalid, R (reprint author), Univ Oslo, MERG, Dept Biol, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",rakel.blaalid@bio.uio.no; haavarka@bio.uio.no,"Rieseberg, Loren/B-3591-2013; Kumar, Surendra/C-9238-2011","Rieseberg, Loren/0000-0002-2712-2417; Kumar, Surendra/0000-0001-5396-5509",University of Oslo,"We acknowledge Tom Andersen for help with statistical analyses, Kristian Skaven Seierstad for assistance in the field and Jenni Norden, Marie Davey and three anonymous reviewers for comments to the manuscript and Finse Research Station for help during the fieldwork.

We made direct comparisons of grassland plant richness in identical volumes (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 m) above and below the soil surface, using conventional species identification to measure aboveground richness and 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL(UAA) intron to measure belowground richness. We described above- and belowground richness at multiple spatial scales (from a neighbourhood scale of centimetres to a community scale of hundreds of metres), and related variation in richness to soil fertility. Tests using reference material indicated that 454 sequencing captured patterns of species composition and abundance with acceptable accuracy. At neighbourhood scales, belowground richness was up to two times greater than aboveground richness. The relationship between above- and belowground richness was significantly different from linear: beyond a certain level of belowground richness, aboveground richness did not increase further. Belowground richness also exceeded that of aboveground at the community scale, indicating that some species are temporarily dormant and absent aboveground. Similar to other grassland studies, aboveground richness declined with increasing soil fertility; in contrast, the number of species found only belowground increased significantly with fertility. These results indicate that conventional aboveground studies of plant richness may overlook many coexisting species, and that belowground richness becomes relatively more important in conditions where aboveground richness decreases. Measuring plant belowground richness can considerably alter perceptions of biodiversity and its responses to natural and anthropogenic factors.","[Hiiesalu, Inga; Oepik, Maarja; Davison, John; Vasar, Martti; Moora, Mari; Zobel, Martin; Paertel, Meelis] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Metsis, Madis; Lilje, Liisa] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ctr Biol Integrated Syst, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Wilson, Scott D.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Hiiesalu, I (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",inga.hiiesalu@ut.ee,"Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012; Rieseberg, Loren/B-3591-2013; Metsis, Madis/F-7080-2016; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Zobel, Martin/H-1336-2015; Hiiesalu, Inga/A-9313-2015","Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Rieseberg, Loren/0000-0002-2712-2417; Metsis, Madis/0000-0003-1667-677X; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Zobel, Martin/0000-0001-7957-6704; Hiiesalu, Inga/0000-0002-5457-2376","European Union through the Center of Excellence FIBIR; EUEuropean Union (EU) [FP6-036866]; GLOBAM [PERG03-GA-2008-231034]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [7738, 8323]","This study was supported by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence FIBIR), EU 6th framework project ECOCHANGE (FP6-036866), Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant (GLOBAM, PERG03-GA-2008-231034), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Estonian Science Foundation (grants 7738, 8323).",,70,65,70,5,143,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

However, little information is available on the carbon flux input to soil resulted from fine roots turnover and leaf fallen during restoration. The present study relying on the ingrowth core and sequential core methods investigated the fine-root dynamics and fine-root production of three shrub stands (dominated by Artemisia halodendron, Caragana microphylla and Salix gordejevii respectively) which have different life-forms and root architectures. The soil carbon and nitrogen stock was also estimated in the restoration, and the relative contribution of carbon input related to fine root mortality and leaf fallen was assessed. The mean standing live and dead fine-root biomass in A. halodendron stand at the primary restoration were significantly less than in C. microphylla stand at moderate restoration and S. gordejevii stand in lowland. Consistent with leaf production, fine root production showed a positive correlation with soil water content and followed the order of A. halodendron < C. microphylla < S. gordejevii. In contrast, the fine-root turnover rate was quicker in primary restoration phase (2.12 year(-1)) than in moderate restoration phase (1.55 year(-1)) and lowland (1.28 year(-1)). The annual carbon and nitrogen inputs via fine root mortality and leaf fallen increased from 74.78 g C m(-2) year and 1.25 g N m(-2) year(-1) in A. halodendron stand to 189.66 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 1.67 g N m(-2) year(-1) in S. gordejevii stand. Although the share of the fine roots of A. halodendron seized a relatively smaller proportion in the net primary production compared with those in C microphylla and S. gordejevii, the relative contribution of carbon input related to fine roots mortality in primary restoration phase was higher than in the other two shrub stands. The present study proved that the carbon input to soil by fine-root mortality considerably contributed to the restoration of soil carbon and nitrogen stock in semi-arid degraded lands.

Urban environments exhibit several factors affecting plant growth and function, including high temperatures (particularly at night), CO2 concentrations and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We investigated the effects of urban environments on growth in Quercus rubra L. seedlings. We grew seedlings from acorns for one season at four sites along an urban-rural transect from Central Park in New York City to the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York (difference in average maximum temperatures of 2.4 degrees C; difference in minimum temperatures of 4.6 degrees C). In addition, we grew Q. rubra seedlings in growth cabinets (GCs) mimicking the seasonal differential between the city and rural sites (based on a 5-year average). In the field experiment, we found an eightfold increase in biomass in urban-grown seedlings relative to those grown at rural sites. This difference was primarily related to changes in growth allocation. Urban-grown seedlings and seedlings grown at urban temperatures in the GCs exhibited a lower root: shoot ratio (urban similar to 0.8, rural/remote similar to 1.5), reducing below-ground carbon costs associated with construction and maintenance. These urban seedlings instead allocated more growth to leaves than did rural-grown seedlings, resulting in 10-fold greater photosynthetic area but no difference in photosynthetic capacity of foliage per unit area. Seedlings grown at urban temperatures in both the field and GC experiments had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations per unit area than those grown at cooler temperatures (increases of 23% in field, 32% in GC). Lastly, we measured threefold greater C-13 enrichment of respired CO2 (relative to substrate) in urban-grown leaves than at other sites, which may suggest greater allocation of respiratory function to growth over maintenance. It also shows that lack of differences in total R flux in response to environmental conditions may mask dramatic shifts in respiratory functioning. Overall, our findings indicating greater seedling growth and establishment at a critical regeneration phase of forest development may have important implications for the ecology of urban forests as well as the predicted growth of the terrestrial biosphere in temperate regions in response to climate change.","[Boelman, Natalie T.; Griffin, Kevin L.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Searle, Stephanie Y.; Turnbull, Matthew H.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Schuster, William S.

Therefore, we established an experiment with two tree species (Cupressus funebris, Cryptomeria fortunei) and two landslide conditions (non-impacted and impacted stands) near the northern section of the fault belt one year after the Wenchuan Earthquake (8.0M(s)) that occurred in China in 2008. At site I. two plots of each species were located in non-impacted stands. At site II, three plots of Cu. funebris were established in non-impacted stands, and three plots were established in impacted stands. At site III, three plots of Cr. fortunei were placed in non-impacted stands, while two plots were placed in impacted stands. All plots were 20m x 20m in size. At each plot, we measured the diameter at breast height and the height of each tree and used their mean values to select five trees representing average growth. Two to three small fine roots (<= 2.0 mm in diameter, >20 cm long) were sampled in just three of the five selected trees to investigate root parameters. Leaf, branch and root water contents of the sampled trees were also examined. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 10, 10 to 20 and 20 to 40 cm depths at the center and near the four corners of each plot to analyze soil physical properties. The study revealed that saturated water content, capillary moisture capacity, field water capacity, total porosity and capillary porosity were lower in the impacted stands than in the non-impacted stands. Conversely, bulk density was higher in the impacted stands, indicating that the soils in the impacted stands had become compacted and dry. Soil water content, saturated water content, capillary moisture capacity, field water capacity, total porosity, capillary porosity and non-capillary porosity were greater in Cr. fortunei stands than in Cu. funebris stands, while bulk density was lower, indicating that impacted stands of Cu. funebris were more compacted and dry than those of Cr. fortunei. In impacted Cu. funebris stands, mean tip length/length and mean tip length/biomass decreased, while plant organ water contents did not change. In impacted Cr. fortunei stands, in contrast, these root parameters as well as specific root area, specific root length and leaf water content increased. These patterns suggest Cr. funebris experiences a much higher root growth than Cu. funebris in landslide impacted stands. Survival and recovery may be more difficult for Cu. funebris than for Cr. fortunei. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Six plots (12 X 12m) were set as AMF inoculum source. Six replicates of six different species arranged in a Latin Square design were set in each plot. Plant height, cover area and the number of leaves produced by individual plant was measured monthly during the first growing season in each treatment. Species differed in their ability to benefit from AMF and the largest responsiveness in plant height and leaf production was exhibited by the slow-growing species Swietenia humilis, Hintonia latiflora and Cordia alliodora. At the end of the growing season (November), the plant height of the fast growing species Tabebuia donnel-smithii, Ceiba pentandra and Guazuma ulmifolia were not influenced by AMF. However, inocula of AMF increased leaf production of all plant species regardless the functional characteristics of the species, suggesting a better exploitation of above-ground space and generating a light limited environment under the canopy, which contributed to pasture suppression. Inoculation of seedlings planted in abandoned pasture areas is recommended for ecological restoration due to the high responsiveness of seedling growth in most of species. Use of forest inoculum with its higher diversity of AMF could accelerate the ecological restoration of the above and below-ground comunities.","[Huante, Pilar; Orozco-Segovia, Alma; Sanchez-Coronado, Maria Esther; Acosta, Irma; Rincon, Emmanuel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Ceccon, Eliane] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Huante, P (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",phuante@cableonline.com.mx; ececcon61@gmail.com; alma@miranda.ecologia.unam.mx; mariaesanchez@miranda.ecologia.unam.mx; emmanuel.rincon@prodigy.net.mx,"Ceccon, Eliane/G-1853-2012",,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-9622352]; PAPIITPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) [IN304409],Research field support was provided by the US National Science Foundation grant no.

Studies of this association in South America are still scarce, especially when referring to the causes of temporal dynamics of this symbiotic community, despite its importance in countries with a thriving forestry industry like Chile. This study evaluates the dynamics of the ectomycorrhizal community of Pinus mdiata stands of 3, 10 and 20 years of age, identifying and quantifying the most common fungal colonizers of fine roots in each age class. The results confirm that the mycobiont community changes with host tree age but that age classes differ in dominance patterns rather than in species richness, with the three- and ten-year-old tree cohorts forming a group separate from the 20-year-old trees. A total of eleven ectomycorrhizal root morphotypes could be distinguished. Four of them which were identified as Hebeloma crustuliniforme, Inocybe sp., Russula sardonic and Pinirhiza spinulosa, were the most abundant (77, 29, 78 and 8 % respectively) and were found in more than one root sample whereas the remaining morphotypes accounted for less than 100 (< 7 %) root tips and showed a patchy distribution. Inocybe sp. was only found on root tips of three-year-old trees, characterizing as an early-stage mycobiont. H. crustuliniforme appeared as a multi-stage colonizer in all three age classes but was clearly dominant on roots of three- and ten-year-old trees, whereas R. sardonia was mainly found on roots of 20-year-old trees, classifying as a late-stage species together with the unidentified morphotype Pinirhiza spinulosa which is reported for the first time from Chile. Our results suggest that the observed changes in the ectomycorrhizal community are not induced by the site per se, but are rather an effect of the interaction between the trees and their environment.","[Palacios, Yussi M.; Palfner, Goetz] Univ Concepcion, Lab Quim Prod Nat, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile; [Hernandez, Cristian E.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Zool, Concepcion, Chile","Palfner, G (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Lab Quim Prod Nat, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",gpalfner@udec.cl,,,,,,55,1,1,1,17,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Based on destructive sampling of root systems of harvested loblolly pine trees, we estimated that root systems contained about 32% (17.2 Mg ha(-1)) at the time of harvest, and about 13% (6.1 Mg ha(-1)) of the soil organic carbon 10 years later. Based on the published roundwood output data, we estimated belowground biomass at the time of harvest for loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina. We then calculated C that remained in the decomposing root systems in 2005 using the decay function developed for loblolly pine. Our calculations indicate that the amount of C stored in decaying roots of loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina was 7.1 Tg. Using a simple extrapolation method, we estimated 331.8 Tg C stored in the decomposing roots due to timber harvest from 1995 to 2005 in the conterminous USA. To fully account for the C stored in the decomposing roots of the US forests, future studies need (1) to quantify decay rates of coarse roots for major tree species in different regions, and (2) to develop a methodology that can determine C stock in decomposing roots resulting from natural mortality.","[Wang, G.

Here, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that invasive tamarisk (Tamarix sp.) negatively affects native cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) by disrupting their associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. At a field site in the early stages of tamarisk invasion, cottonwoods with tamarisk neighbors had reduced EM colonization and altered EM fungal community composition relative to cottonwoods with native neighbors, leading to reductions in EM propagule abundance in the soil beneath tamarisk. Similarly. AM colonization of cottonwoods was reduced with a tamarisk neighbor, but there were no significant changes in AM fungal spore communities or propagule abundance. Root colonization by nonmycorrhizal fungi, including potential pathogens, was higher in cottonwoods with tamarisk neighbors. A greenhouse experiment in which AM and EM inoculation and plant neighbor were manipulated in a fully factorial design showed that cottonwoods benefited from mycorrhizas, especially EM, in terms of shoot biomass when grown with a conspecific, but shoot biomass was similar to that of nonmycorrhizal controls when cottonwoods were grown with a tamarisk neighbor. These results are partially explained by a reduction in EM but not AM colonization of cottonwoods by a tamarisk neighbor. Tamarisk neighbors negatively affected cottonwood specific leaf area, but not chlorophyll content, in the field. To pinpoint a mechanism for these changes, we measured soil chemistry in the field and the growth response of an EM fungus (Hebeloma crustuliniforme) to salt-amended media in the laboratory. Tamarisk increased both NO3- concentrations and electrical conductivity 2.5-fold beneath neighboring cottonwoods in the field. Salt-amended media did not affect the growth of H. crustuliniforme. Our findings demonstrate that a nonnative species, even in the early stages of invasion, can negatively affect a native species by disrupting its mycorrhizal symbioses. Some of these changes in mycorrhizal fungal communities may remain as legacy effects of invasives, even after their removal, and should be considered in management and restoration efforts.","[Meinhardt, Kelley A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Gehring, Catherine A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Meinhardt, KA (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",km325@nau.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0425908]; Doris Duke FoundationDoris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF),"We thank Baoming Ji, Anita Antoninka, Ahn-Heum Eom, and Wittaya Kaonongbua for help with AMF spore identification; Christian Meinhardt, Mara Trushell, and Jamie Lamit for assistance in the field and greenhouse; Andy Krohn and Lluvia Flores for their advice and much-appreciated support with molecular analysis; and Nancy Johnson, Ron Hiebert, and the Gehring lab group for providing comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Methods A field survey was carried out in a meadow steppe area with a gradient of grazing pressures (a site with four grazing intensities and a reserve closed to grazing). The AMF community composition (characterized by spore abundance) and diversity, the vegetation characters and soil properties were measured, and root colonization by AMF was assessed. Results AMF diversity (richness and evenness) was higher under light to moderate grazing pressure and declined under intense grazing pressures. Results of multiple regressions indicated that soil electrical conductivity was highly associated with AMF diversity. The variation in AMF diversity was partially associated to the density of tillers of the dominant grass (Leymus chinensis), the above and below-ground biomass and the richness of the plant community. Conclusions We propose that the relationship between plants and AMF is altered by environmental stress (salinity) which is in turn influenced by animal grazing. Direct and indirect interactions between vegetation, soil properties, and AMF community need to be elucidated to improve our ability to manage these communities.","[Ba, Lei; Ning, Jiaxu; Wang, Deli; Yang, Yaning; Zhang, Lichao] NE Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Facelli, Evelina] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Wang, DL (reprint author), NE Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",wangd@nenu.edu.cn,,,"State Key Basic Research Program [2007CB106801]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30900184, 31070294, 31072070]; Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [20090043120010]","We are grateful to Jane Prider and Tanya R.

However, the pattern of root respiration rates from finer and coarser roots across various tropical species remains unknown. To clarify how respiration is related to the morphological traits of roots, we evaluated specific root respiration and its relationships to mean root diameter (D) of various diameter and root tissue density (RTD; root mass per unit root volume; gcm(-3)) and specific root length (SRL; root length per unit root mass; mg(-1)) of the fine roots among and within 14 trees of 13 species from a primary tropical rainforest in the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia. Coarse root (2-269mm) respiration rates increased with decreasing D, resulting in significant relationships between root respiration and diameter across species. A model based on a radial gradient of respiration rates of coarse roots simulated the exponential decrease in respiration with diameter. The respiration rate of fine roots (< 2mm) was much higher and more variable than those of larger diameter roots. For fine roots, the mean respiration rates for each species increased with decreasing D. The respiration rates of fine roots declined markedly with increasing RTD and increased with increasing SRL, which explained a significant portion of the variation in the respiration among the 14 trees from 13 species examined. Our results indicate that coarse root respiration in tree species follows a basic relationship with D across species and that most of the variation in fine root respiration among species is explained by D, RTD and SRL. We found that the relationship between root respiration and morphological traits provides a quantitative basis for separating fine roots from coarse roots and that the pattern holds across different species.","[Makita, Naoki; Kosugi, Yoshiko; Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Takanashi, Satoru] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Niiyama, Kaoru] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tohoku Res Ctr, Morioka, Iwate 0200123, Japan; [Kassim, Abd Rahman; Nik, Abdul Rahim] Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur 52109, Malaysia","Makita, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",naokimakita@affrc.go.jp,"makita, naoki/D-2473-2012; Takanashi, Satoru/F-1711-2010",,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sports, and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20255010]","This study was funded in part by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sports, and Technology (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) 20255010).",,56,35,35,0,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2012,32,3,,,,,303,312,,10.1093/treephys/tps008,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,919DF,WOS:000302300600006,22367761,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Wolfe, BT; Van Bloem, SJ",,,,"Wolfe, Brett T.; Van Bloem, Skip J.",,,Subtropical dry forest regeneration in grass-invaded areas of Puerto Rico: Understanding why Leucaena leucocephala dominates and native species fail,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Guanica Forest; Fire; Pennisetum ciliare; Novel ecosystems; Soil organic matter; Restoration,TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST; SEEDLING SURVIVAL; SOIL PROPERTIES; RESTORATION; GROWTH; CARBON; DIVERSITY; MYCORRHIZAE; COMPETITION; SUCCESSION,"Throughout the tropics, non-native grasses invade, dominate, and persist in areas where subtropical and tropical dry forests have been highly degraded. In Central America and the Caribbean Islands, forests that regenerate in grass-invaded areas are generally composed of one to a few tree species, usually of the Fabaceae family and often non-native. We investigated the ecological factors that drive these successional patterns in southwestern Puerto Rico, where African grasses dominate extensive areas that are maintained by fires. The non-native legume tree Leucaena leucocephala commonly establishes in these areas and forms persistent, mono-dominant stands. We planted 455 saplings of 13 native tree species and Leucaena in native forest understory and in grass-invaded areas that were either subjected to or protected from prescribed fires 4 months later. We measured growth and survival to test the following hypotheses: (1) saplings of native species are suppressed in grass-invaded areas compared to the forest understory, (2) Leucaena saplings outperform native species in grass-invaded areas, but not in the forest understory, and (3) Leucaena saplings are less susceptible to wildfires than native species. After 20 months, 50%, 40%, and 3% of native saplings survived in the forest, unburned-grass, and burned-grass treatments, respectively. Over the same period, 90%, 80%, and 25% of Leucaena survived in the same treatments. The fires immediately killed 65% of native saplings and 50% of Leucaena saplings. The majority of unburned native saplings died during a seasonal drought, when high irradiance and reduced soil organic matter content likely led to higher mortality in grass-invaded areas than in forest understory. Native species' growth was low in all treatments, yet diameter growth was slightly higher in the unburned grass than the forest understory. Leucaena saplings grew faster than the native saplings in all three treatments, especially in the unburned grass. Slow growth and high mortality of native saplings in grass-invaded areas contribute to the dominance of Leucaena in forests that regenerate on these sites and suggest that Leucaena may play a beneficial role in dry forest restoration in the Caribbean.

Understanding mechanisms underlying species distributions is a central theme in ecology. This study identifies factors driving spatial variation in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We conducted two experiments to test whether heterogeneity in AMF colonization of alpine perennial plants across a willow-meadow ecotone is due to variation in (i) above-ground competition with willows for light (experiment 1), (ii) below-ground interactions with willows and their ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF; experiment 1) or (iii) leaf litter deposition (experiment 2). 2. In experiment 1, we tested the above-ground interactions hypothesis by covering open meadow plots with 80% shade cloth to simulate willow shading (S). To test the below-ground interactions hypothesis, we transplanted ectomycorrhizal (MW) and nonmycorrhizal willows (NW) into the open meadow. AMF colonization of herbaceous plants in the S, MW and NW treatments was compared to colonization of plants growing in unmanipulated open meadow (OC) and willow understorey (WC) control plots. In experiment 2, we tested the leaf litter hypothesis by manipulating leaf litter deposition in open meadow and willow understorey plots. AMF and EMF colonization was compared in plots with and without leaf litter. 3. In experiment 1, AMF colonization was reduced in MW and WC plots compared to the other three treatments, suggesting that below-ground interactions with EMF suppressed AMF colonization of herbaceous hosts. In experiment 2, the presence of leaf litter increased EMF colonization in the open meadow and reduced AMF colonization in both open meadow and willow understorey habitats, suggesting that willow-derived leaf litter indirectly affected AMF colonization by promoting EMF colonization. 4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that willows indirectly reduce AMF colonization of neighbouring herbaceous plants via feedbacks with leaf litter and EMF. These willow-mediated effects could alter the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi in alpine communities, which could in turn impact the fitness and distribution of closely associated host species. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the potential for below-ground interactions to drive variation in species associations across ecotonal boundaries.","[Becklin, Katie M.; Pallo, Megan L.; Galen, Candace] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Becklin, Katie M.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Becklin, KM (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",kbecklin@ku.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DDIG DEB-0808000, UMEB DBI-0603049]; University of Missouri; Trans World Airlines; Colorado Native Plant Society","NSF (DDIG DEB-0808000 and UMEB DBI-0603049; C.

ECM root tips were sampled from five shrub species belonging to the genera Arbutus, Cistus and Halimium and from maritime pine in four areas of central Portugal characterized by differing fire return interval length. Fungal symbionts were identified using molecular techniques with direct sequencing of the nrDNA ITS region. Twenty nine ECM species and sixteen non-ECM root inhabitants were identified. Six years after wildfire disturbance ECM species richness did not differ significantly between unburnt and burnt areas. Nine ECM fungal species were common to pine and shrubs and both their frequency of occurrence and proportion were significantly higher in the unburnt area when compared with both areas subjected to fire. Our study revealed that while the potential for CMNs between understorey shrub species and pine seemed to be maintained in the long fire return interval area, recurrent fires significantly reduced the frequency of occurrence and the proportion of common symbiont species. High fire frequencies could therefore delay the process of re-colonization by pine seedlings limiting their dispersal in new settings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about environmental factors that influence the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi. Previous studies using seed packets have been unable to distinguish whether germination patterns resulted from the distribution of appropriate edaphic conditions or the distribution of host fungi, as these cannot be separated using seed packets alone. We used a combination of organic amendments, seed packets and molecular assessment of soil fungi required by three terrestrial orchid species to separate direct and indirect effects of fungi and environmental conditions on both seed germination and subsequent protocorm development. We found that locations with abundant mycorrhizal fungi were most likely to support seed germination and greater growth for all three orchids. Organic amendments affected germination primarily by affecting the abundance of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. However, fungi associated with the three orchid species were affected differently by the organic amendments and by forest successional stage. The results of this study help contextualize the importance of fungal distribution and abundance to the population dynamics of plants with specific mycorrhizal requirements. Such phenomena may also be important for plants with more general mycorrhizal associations.","[McCormick, Melissa K.; Juhaszova, Katarina; Burnett, Robert K., Jr.; Whigham, Dennis F.; O'Neill, John P.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Taylor, D.

Previous studies have shown that some species are highly specialized towards narrow lineages of AMF and have suggested that only particular lineages of these fungi are targeted by mycoheterotrophic plants. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed all available partial SSU sequences of AMF associated with mycoheterotrophic plants including data from 13 additional specimens from French Guiana, Gabon and Australia. Sequences were assigned to virtual taxa (VT) according to the MaarjAM database. We found that 20% of all known Glomeromycota VT are involved in mycoheterotrophic interactions and the majority of associations involve Glomeraceae (Glomus Group A) fungi. While some mycoheterotrophic plant species have been found growing with only a single VT, many species are able to associate with a wide range of AMF. We calculated significant phylogenetic clustering of Glomeromycota VT involved in mycoheterotrophic interactions, suggesting that associations between mycoheterotrophic plants and AMF are influenced by the phylogenetic relationships of the fungi. Our results demonstrate that many lineages of AMF are prone to exploitation by mycoheterotrophic plants. However, mycoheterotrophs from different plant lineages and different geographical regions tend to be dependent on lineages of AMF that are phylogenetically related.","[Merckx, Vincent S. F.

The effects of factor levels on allocation to biomass compartments were analyzed using ANCOVA. As plant allocation patterns are size-dependent, tree size was used as a covariate. In both tree species, growth and biomass allocation to above and belowground plant components were affected by light availability. European beech showed a distinct increase in allocation to leaves, stem and branch biomass at the expense of fine and coarse roots with decreasing light availability. For Norway spruce, only allocation to stem biomass increased and allocation to fine root biomass decreased under low light. To drought a significant increase of the percentage of belowground compartments was found for European beech but not for Norway spruce. Overall, European beech seedlings were more plastic than Norway spruce seedlings. European beech seedlings appear better able to adjust biomass partitioning to resource availability. In contrast Norway spruce responded languidly. Our results indicate that biomass partitioning is not only driven by ontogeny, and thus tree size, but is environmentally determined to a substantial degree. A possible explanation for this divergence from other results on the role of ontogeny in biomass partitioning may be that seedling plasticity in response to limited resources declines with increasing age and/or time of exposure to the limited resources.

We fit the data with a mixing model that accounted for the mineral, air, and root components of the sample. Our results indicate that changes in volumetric root content can be detected by GPR under such simple, controlled conditions; however, the presence of pore water, along with its spatial variability and the inherent structural heterogeneity of soils, will probably render detection of fine root biomass from a GPR measurement very challenging in the field.","[Parsekian, Andrew D.; Slater, Lee] Rutgers State Univ, Dep Earth & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Schaefer, Karina V.

To reduce this uncertainty, we evaluated the environmental controls over fine root dynamics in balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Fine root production was measured over 5 years at two balsam fir sites in the southern part of its range and two sites in the northern part using the minirhizotron and soil-coring methods. The objective of the study was to quantify climatic effects on fine root production and on allocation of growth to foliage (NPPf) and fine roots (NPPfr). Year-end fine root biomass was greater in the south (800 +/- 60 g.m(-2)) than in the north (490 +/- 69 g.m(-2)) (p < 0.001). Similarly, NPPfr was greater in the south (557 +/- 35 g.m(-2)) than in the north (351 +/- 41 g.m(-2)) (p = 0.01). Differences in annual NPPfr between north and south arose because summer and autumn NPPfr was greater in the south. Fine root production did not vary interannually within regions. Annual fine root growth was correlated with air growing degree-days (r(2) = 0.53, p = 0.002). The allocation to NPPf relative to NPPfr did not differ significantly between regions. Our results suggest that NPPfr will increase with an increase in mean annual air temperature but that there will be no significant changes in functional equilibrium between foliage and fine roots as global warming progresses.","[Olesinski, Jakub; Krasowski, Marek J.; Kershaw, John A., Jr.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Lavigne, Michael B.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada; [Bernier, Pierre Y.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Olesinski, J (reprint author), Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, POB 4400,28 Dineen Dr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",j.olesinski@unb.ca,,"Kershaw, John/0000-0003-1360-0091",Gretta Goodine and Rodney Foster (Canadian Forest Service - Atlantic Forestry Centre)Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Sebastien Dagnault (Canadian Forest Service - Laurentian Forestry Centre)Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service,We want to acknowledge the invaluable support provided by Gretta Goodine and Rodney Foster (Canadian Forest Service - Atlantic Forestry Centre) and Sebastien Dagnault (Canadian Forest Service - Laurentian Forestry Centre) for various aspects of this work.

In the experiment, AMF communities (created by combining various AMF species that were found to be dominant in natural farm soil) were inoculated into the degraded soil, and then the soil was planted with cucumber. Inoculation with AMF communities did not affect soil pH but increased soil aggregate stability and decreased the concentrations of salt ions and electrical conductivity (EC) in the soil. Inoculation with AMF communities increased the numbers of culturable bacteria and actinomycetes but reduced the number of fungi. AMF communities increased plant growth, soluble sugar content, chlorophyll content, and root activity compared to non-mycorrhizal or a single AMF species treatments. Improvements of soil quality and plant growth were greatest with the following two communities: Glomus etunicatum + G. mosseae + Gigaspora margarita + Acaulospora lacunosa and G. aggregatum + G. etunicatum + G. mosseae + G. versiforme + G. margarita + A. lacunosa.

Significant transplant stress during establishment has been a feature of contemporary plantings in Australia. It is therefore important to determine the nature of this stress to mitigate its effect in future plantings. This study examined the influence of antitranspirant and fertiliser applied after planting in open conditions on the relative mean leaf chlorophyll content, survival and growth (height and diameter) of Aquilaria crassna seedlings when compared with a shade control. Additional field-applied fertiliser (without antitranspirant) had a significantly positive effect on mean chlorophyll index and height and diameter growth after transplanting, but a leaf application of antitranspirant had no such effect. Despite the benefit of additional fertiliser (without antitranspirant) this treatment had significantly greater mortality when compared with the shade treatment. The immediate increase in mean chlorophyll index in shade and its initial decline in full-sun exposed seedlings after planting indicates that the transplant stress is influenced, in part, by sun-exposure. Seedlings in the shade treatment were significantly taller than those exposed to full-sun after 60-weeks but no significant differences were found for mean basal diameter. With the exception of one treatment (fertiliser with antitranspirant) it is evident that taller seedlings with thicker stems have a greater survival after transplanting than shorter seedlings with thinner stems. This study reveals that the planting of A. crassna seedlings with mean height and stem diameter of 35 cm and 4.0 mm respectively and providing fertiliser and shade after planting can reduce transplant stress and improve survival and growth of this species. Areas requiring further research including other potential factors influencing transplant stress are explored in this report. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

During the next century, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to more than double, potentially leading to a decline in plant diversity as well as a change in plant community composition and structure. 2. In a decade-long field experiment, simulated atmospheric N deposition has slowed litter decay, resulting in an accumulation of forest floor (i.e. Oi & Oe horizons). We reasoned that a greater forest floor mass under simulated N deposition would impose a physical barrier to sugar maple Acer saccharum seedling establishment, thereby reducing seedling populations of an ecologically and economically important tree species. 3. To test this idea, we first quantified sugar maple seedling abundance in replicate northern hardwood forest stands receiving ambient atmospheric N (7-12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and experimental atmospheric N deposition, simulating future amounts in eastern North America (ambient plus 30 kg NO3-) N ha(-1) year(-1)). Then, we experimentally manipulated forest floor mass under ambient and simulated N deposition treatments. Finally, we transplanted first-year established seedlings into areas receiving ambient and simulated N deposition and quantified their mortality after 1 year. 4. First-year seedling abundance did not differ under ambient and simulated N deposition; however, there were greater abundances of second-and third-to-fifth-year seedlings under ambient N deposition (P < 0.001). In all cases, experimental manipulation to increase forest floor mass, equivalent to that under simulated N deposition, resulted in significantly (P = 0.001) fewer established individuals, regardless of whether the greater forest floor mass occurred under ambient or simulated N deposition. Finally, fewer 1-year-old transplanted seedlings survived when grown under simulated N, albeit that result was not statistically significant. 5. Synthesis and applications. The slowing of decay and the accumulation of forest floor under anthropogenic N deposition can negatively impact seedling survival and potentially alter stand development and structural diversity. As atmospheric N deposition increases globally, it becomes necessary to understand the mechanisms that lead to population changes for ecologically important tree species. The responses we document should be considered in simulations of future of forest dynamics, as atmospheric N deposition continues to increase, specifically when sugar maple life-history traits are included to simulate regeneration, structural diversity and stand development.","[Patterson, Sierra L.; Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Burton, Andrew J.] Michigan Technol Univ, Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Talhelm, Alan F.; Pregitzer, Kurt S.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",drzak@umich.edu,"Talhelm, Alan F/F-9365-2013; Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012; Talhelm, Alan/K-6631-2018","Talhelm, Alan/0000-0002-5542-8237; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Department of Energy's Division of Environmental Biology,"Funding for the Michigan Gradient Study has been provided by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy's Division of Environmental Biology.

Here we examined the effects of canopy shading and fine roots of the trees (Elaeagnus angustifolia) on size inequality of the grasses (Achnatherum splendens) in a temperate savanna community in northwest China. Three study plots of 400 m(2) were divided into 4-m(2) quadrats, within each of which (1) canopy shading was quantified by modeling cumulative direct solar radiation (CDSR) and (2) the root effect was quantified using an empirical relationship between tree fine root density (TFRD) and relative distance to tree bases. Morphological traits were measured to represent grass size. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to examine the relative influences of grass density, CDSR and TFRD on the coefficient of variation of grass size. Results showed that no significant correlation occurred between grass density and grass size inequality. Both CDSR and TFRD had significant negative correlations with grass size inequality, suggesting that canopy shading and the presence of fine roots of trees can, respectively, increase and reduce grass size inequality. Canopy shading and TFRD played competitive roles in determining grass size inequality, where the root effect was a stronger factor than canopy shading. The tree effects can substantially alter the intensity of water stress. In response, size inequality of the grasses could be influenced through size-specific growth/mortality and slowed size divergence. These mechanisms could operate together in the savanna community.","[Xu, Chi; Zhang, Mingjuan; Liu, Maosong; An, Shuqing; Sheng, Sheng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mingjuan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Liu, MS (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",msliu@nju.edu.cn,,"Xu, Chi/0000-0002-1841-9032",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40675040],"We would like to thank Dr. Kimberly Brosofske for enlightening discussion and linguistic checking, and an anonymous reviewer for valuable comments on the earlier versions of this paper.

The effect of this treatment on the availability of nitrogen (N) in the soil was assessed along three transects across the experimental area, one under Fagus sylvatica, one under Quercus robur and Q. petraea and one under Carpinus betulus. Nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic N (DON) were analysed in soil solution obtained with suction cups. Nitrate and ammonium were also captured in buried ion-exchange resin bags. These parameters were related to the local intensity of the FACE treatment as measured from the 13C depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the soil solution. Over the 8-years of experiment, the CO2 enrichment reduced DON concentrations, did not affect ammonium, but induced higher nitrate concentrations, both in soil solution and resin bags. In the nitrate captured in the resin bags, the natural abundance of the isotope 15N increased strongly. This indicates that the CO2 enrichment accelerated net nitrification, probably as an effect of the higher soil moisture resulting from the reduced transpiration of the CO2-enriched trees. It is also possible that N mineralization was enhanced by root exudates (priming effect) or that the uptake of inorganic N by these trees decreased slightly as the result of a reduced N demand for fine-root growth. In this mature deciduous forest, we did not observe any progressive N limitation due to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations; on the contrary, we observed an enhanced N availability over the 8-years of our measurements. This may, together with the global warming projected, exacerbate problems related to N saturation and nitrate leaching, although it is uncertain how long the observed trends will last in the future.","[Schleppi, Patrick; Bucher-Wallin, Inga; Hagedorn, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Schleppi, P (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",schleppi@wsl.ch,"Schleppi, Patrick/E-6751-2011; Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Schleppi, Patrick/0000-0002-3578-6563; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776","Swiss National Foundation for Scientific ResearchSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31-67775.02, 3100-059769.99, 3100-067775.02, 3100AO-111914/1]; Federal Office of the Environment; State Secretariat for Education and Research within the COST [C00.0061, E21]","The Hofstetten FACE experiment was supported by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research (grants 31-67775.02, 3100-059769.99, 3100-067775.02 and 3100AO-111914/1).

Genetic variability in morphological and physiological seedling characteristics of 75 open-pollinated white spruce families was estimated to determine whether genetic selection for improved seedling root systems is possible. Seedlings were grown for 2 years under standard cultural practices in a forest nursery. Gas exchange measurements and seedling morphological characteristics (height, diameter, shoot and root dry mass, root to shoot ratio) were measured at the end of the two growing seasons whereas seedling mineral (N, P, and K) status was assessed at the end of the first growing season. Genetic parameters (heritabilities-h(2)-and genetic correlations) were estimated for every seedling characteristic and a strong genetic control associated with a large genetic variation was observed at both family (0.20 <= h(f)(2)<= 0.88) and individual (0.21 <= h(i)(2)<= 0.97) levels. A single, late-season measurement of physiological characteristics did not reveal physiological basis for family variability in seedling root growth. Nevertheless, the family variation was large enough to permit genetic improvement of 2-year-old seedling juvenile morphological characteristics. Strong, positive genetic correlations enable us to foresee using root collar diameter as an effective method for indirectly selecting white spruce families with heavier root systems.","[Carles, Sylvie; Stowe, Debbie C.; Margolis, Hank A.] Univ Laval, CEF, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Lamhamedi, Mohammed S.] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune, Direct Rech Forestiere, Quebec City, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada; [Beaulieu, Jean] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Carles, S (reprint author), Univ Laval, CEF, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Pavillon Abitibi Price,2405 Rue Terrasse,, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",sylvie.carles@sbf.ulaval.ca,,,"Fonds de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies du Quebec [2004-FO-103181, 2009-FT-130171]; Direction generale des pepinieres et des stations piscicoles (DGPSP, MRNF); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Direction de la recherche forestiere (DRF, MRNF) [112310094, 112310084]; Canadian Wood Fibre Centre (Canadian Forest Service)Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service","This study was conducted in collaboration with the Centre de Production de Plants Forestiers de Quebec Inc.

Location: Grass-shrub Patagonian steppe, Chubut, Argentina. Methods: Permanent plots were established in grazed paddocks and paddocks excluded from grazing in representative Patagonian rangelands. Shrub abundance, population size-structure, short-term (two 3-yr periods) and long-term (matrix models) population dynamics, and neighborhood interactions of three native and codominant shrub species (Mulinum spinosum, Senecio filaginoides and Adesmia volckmanni) were measured and analysed using different statistical approaches. Results: The total density of shrubs was 74% higher in paddocks excluded from grazing, owing mainly to increases in Mulinum (80%) and Senecio (68%) species. However, differences in size structure between ungrazed and grazed paddocks were only detected in Mulinum. Demographic rates differed between shrub species, time-periods and grazing conditions. In particular, recruitment in the short term (especially in wet years) and population growth rate in the long term (l) were higher in paddocks excluded from grazing only in Mulinum populations. Senecio populations showed a marginal increase in recruitment and mortality independent of the grazing condition in the wet and dry period. Grazing exclusion modified the balance of neighborhood interactions among the three shrub species. In grazing-exclusion paddocks, there was a balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions, while in grazed paddocks there were more negative intraspecific and interspecific interactions, resulting in a net negative balance of neighborhood interactions. Conclusions: Our understanding of woody encroachment in arid rangelands can be informed through evaluation of direct and indirect effects of grazing exclusion on the abundance and demography of dominant woody species. In Patagonian arid steppes, the occurrence of woody encroachment in rangelands excluded from grazing can be explained by altered responses in plant-animal and plant-plant interactions among shrub species.","[Cipriotti, Pablo A.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac IF, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Aguiar, Martin R.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Dept Recursos Nat & Ambiente IFEVA, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Cipriotti, PA (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac IF, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",cipriott@agro.uba.ar; aguiar@agro.uba.ar,,,University of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires [UBACyT G032]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 5963]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT 00462]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"We thank Pablo Roset, Ruy Perea and Lucia Vivanco for their valuable help in the field work; Dr Suzanne Prober and two anonymous reviewers for useful comments on our manuscript.

The main mechanism proposed to explain this relationship is niche complementarity, which is determined by differences in plant traits that affect resource use. We combined field and laboratory experiments using the most abundant species of the Patagonian steppe to identify which are the traits that determine niche complementarity in this ecosystem. We estimated traits that affect carbon, water, microclimate, and nitrogen dynamics. The most important traits distinguishing among species, from the standpoint of their effects on ecosystem functioning, were potential soil nitrification, rooting depth, and soil thermal amplitude. Additionally, we explored the relationship between trait diversity and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) using a manipulative field experiment. ANPP and the fraction of ANPP accounted for by trait diversity increased with number of traits. The effect of trait diversity decreased as the number of traits increased. Here, the use of traits gave us a mechanistic understanding of niche complementarity in the Patagonian steppe.","[Flombaum, Pedro] Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sala, Osvaldo E.] CONICET FCEN UBA UMI, Inst Franco Argentino Estudios Clima & Impactos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Flombaum, P (reprint author), Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Pabellon II Piso 2,Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pflombaum@cima.fcen.uba.ar,,"Sala, Osvaldo/0000-0003-0142-9450; Flombaum, Pedro/0000-0001-5307-4319",Institute for Agricultural Plant Physiology and Ecology (IFEVA); Agricultural Research Service of Argentina (INTA) of Rio Mayo; Argentina National Council for Research PIP [112-200801-01788 (CONICET)]; PRH-PICT [1-1 0106 (Agencia)]; University of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires; Arizona State University,"We thank M.

By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon.

Sea water invasion of the dunar zone caused by storms is an important factor that determines the persistence of a plant community. In the present study, the benefits of arbuscular mycorrhiza on psammophilic plant species subjected to sea water flooding episodes were evaluated under controlled conditions and the effect of sea water on in vitro spore production was determined. In a greenhouse experiment, the growth response of nine plant species to inoculation with Glomus intraradices in beach sand was evaluated. A second experiment was designed in order to test if plant survival under sea water flooding was influenced by the symbiosis. A third experiment was conducted in vitro to quantify the effect of sea water on the production of G. intraradices spores. Glomus intraradices was effective in promoting plant growth and survival in beach sand and promoted the survival of some species subjected to flooding events. Spore production was inhibited by 50% of sea water in the growth media, but not by 10% sea water. Results obtained under controlled conditions indicated that arbuscular mycorrhiza can improve the establishment of certain dune plant species in beach sand as the symbiosis contributes to enhanced plant tolerance against occasional sea water flooding.","[Camprubi, Amelia; Abril, Meritxell; Estaun, Victoria; Calvet, Cinta] IRTA, Ctr Cabrils, Barcelona 08348, Spain","Camprubi, A (reprint author), IRTA, Ctr Cabrils, Ctra Cabrils Km 2, Barcelona 08348, Spain.",amelia.camprubi@irta.es,"Camprubi, Amelia/J-8520-2017; Calvet, Cinta/F-1586-2017","Camprubi, Amelia/0000-0002-3385-8121; Calvet, Cinta/0000-0002-5685-019X; Abril, Meritxell/0000-0002-5103-5567",Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)European Union (EU); Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA)Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [RTA2007-00039],This research was financially supported by the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) and by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) project RTA2007-00039.,,37,10,15,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2012,351,2-Jan,,,,,97,105,,10.1007/s11104-011-0933-5,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,887VJ,WOS:000299959100007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Young, IM; Feeney, DS; O'Donnell, AG; Goulding, KWT",,,,"Young, Iain M.; Feeney, Deborah S.; O'Donnell, Anthony G.; Goulding, Keith W.

Based on root branching structure, we studied the total Hg (THg) and its cellular partitioning in fine roots in 6 Chinese subtropical trees species and the impacts of root morphological and stoichiometric traits on Hg partitioning. The THg concentration generally decreased with increasing root order, and was higher in cortex than in stele. This concentration significantly correlated with root length, diameter, specific root length, specific root area, and nitrogen concentration, whereas its cytosolic fraction (accounting for <10% of THg) correlated with root carbon and sulfur concentrations. The estimated Hg return flux from dead fine roots outweighed that from leaf litter, and ephemeral first-order roots that constituted 7.2-22.3% of total fine root biomass may have contributed most to this flux (39-71%, depending on tree species and environmental substrate). Our results highlight the high capacity of Fig stabilization and Hg return by lower-order roots and demonstrate that turnover of lower-order roots may be an effective strategy of detoxification in perennial tree species.","[Wang, Jun-Jian; Guo, Ying-Ying; Kong, De-Liang; Liu, Yang-Sheng; Zeng, Hui] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Circular Econ, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun-Jian; Guo, Da-Li; Yin, Sen-Lu; Kong, De-Liang; Zeng, Hui] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang-Sheng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Liu, YS (reprint author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Circular Econ, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",yshliu@pku.edu.cn; huizeng0608@gmail.com,"Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012; Guo, Dali/G-2158-2014; Wang, Jun-Jian/G-6397-2011; Wang, Jun-Jian/B-5956-2014","Wang, Jun-Jian/0000-0003-0973-2067; Wang, Jun-Jian/0000-0002-3040-0924","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [41071117, 31021001]","We thank Yan-bing Wang and Qing-long Xie for the sample preparation, and Zachary Smoot from Clemson University for the language improvement.

In this study, we used radiocarbon (C-14) signatures to partition soil respiration in a cool-temperate deciduous forest, using an isotope mass balance approach. Monthly measurements of soil respiration rates and C-14 emissions from soil respiration were conducted using a closed chamber method throughout the growing seasons (May-November) in 2007 and 2008. The C-14 contents in root-derived CO2 were assumed to be equivalent to those of the CO2 in the atmosphere or CO2 derived from stored carbon in the plant body with a mean residence time of 2.5 years. C-14 contents in CO2 efflux from soil organic carbon were calculated using a model based on five soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and mean residence times of these pools. The contributions of CO2 efflux from surface litter to the total soil respiration were directly measured in situ. The seasonal variation clearly differed among the carbon sources. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration increased with the rise in soil temperature in August and September. Conversely, the contribution of root-derived carbon increased in late July and appeared to correlate with vegetation phenology. The annual CO2 flux was calculated using empirical models based on the soil temperature with the phenology index and the daily averaged soil temperature of the site. Based on these results, the contribution rates of CO2 sources to soil respiration were estimated as 35-39% from surface litter, 23-33% from SOC. and 31-39% from root-derived carbon.

The assays of soil enzymes are generally simple, accurate, sensitive and relatively rapid and for this reasons they have been extensively used to determine the effects of contaminants, changes in management practices and effects of environmental factors and plant cover on soil metabolism. However, the present enzyme assays determine potential rather than real enzyme activities due to the optimal conditions of the assays and they do not discriminate the contribution of extracellular stabilised enzymes from that of intracellular enzyme activities. The determination of the latter is important to evaluate the answer of soil microorganisms to any effect on soil. Methods based on fumigation of soil with chloroform or with the physiological response of soil microorganisms to glucose addition to soil present drawbacks. Presently, enzyme activities are still used to evaluate the response of soil metabolism to any effect not only in arable soils but also in forest soils. However, not always the past bibliography and the limits of the present enzyme assays are considered. A few innovative studies have been carried out. Measurements of enzyme activities have been combined with those on microbial diversity evaluated by molecular techniques. Both synthesis and persistence of phosphomonoesterases have been quantified in studies based on the stimulation of microbial growth by adding easily degradable organic compounds to soil. Metcalfe et al. (Appl Environ Microbiol 68:5042-5050, 2002) covered all events from gene presence, through gene expression and up to the detection of target enzyme in soil. The addition of sludge to a pasture soil increased chitinase activity and the number of actinobacteria but selected actinobacterium-like chitinase sequences. Enzyme assays distinguishing the contribution of extracellular stabilised enzymes from that of intracellular enzyme activities are needed. Future research should increase the number. of enzyme activities which can be determined in soil. For example, an accurate assay for determining nuclease activity in soil is not available. It is important to set up accurate methods for extracting intracellular and stabilised extracellular proteins, which are largely prevailing, so as to be able to carry out the proteomic approach in soil. The understanding of microbial synthesis of proteins (functional proteomic) as affected by different environmental conditions can increase our knowledge on the synthesis of enzymes in soil whereas the characterization of proteins protected against microbial degradation by their interactions with surface-reactive particles or their inclusion within humic component (structural proteomic) can give insights on the stabilization of organic N, including enzymes, in soil. The set up of suitable techniques is needed to visualise the location of stabilised enzymes in soil sections by both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Acid phosphatase activity has been detected in small (7 x 20 nm) fragments of microbial membranes, roots, mycorrhizae, etc. of soil but not in naturally-electron dense soil components (minerals) and in soil components reacting with OsO4 (humus) and this does not permit to localize extracellular enzymes or proteins stabilized by clay minerals or humic materials (Ladd and Butler, Aust J Soil Res 4:41-54, 1966).","[Nannipieri, Paolo; Landi, Loretta; Giagnoni, Laura; Renella, Giancarlo] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Prod Vegetali Suolo & Ambiente A, I-50144 Florence, Italy","Nannipieri, P (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Prod Vegetali Suolo & Ambiente A, Ple Cascine 28, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",paolo.nannipieri@unifi.it,"Giagnoni, Laura/J-1491-2019","Giagnoni, Laura/0000-0002-2043-6261",,,,102,3,3,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,1863-5539,978-3-642-21161-4,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

Two soil ecosystems characterized by a gradient of different grass covers, i.e. (1) a natural Catena (control) and (2) a managed Catena altered by amending practices were selected in a semi arid zone of the Mediterranean (Murcia region, Spain). Both natural and managed Catenas showed activation of carbon cycle which gradually shifted vegetal carbon toward the humic substance formation and accumulation of active humic-beta-glucosidase complexes. The model of study and the correlation among the selected parameters, has permitted to discriminate even little differences in soil biochemical properties and, on the basis of these properties, to rank the soil ecosystems in a decreasing order of quality: forest > shrub > bare. There was a narrow correlation between amount of humic carbon forms and humic-associated enzyme-activity, demonstrating that a sort of humification in situ was steadily taking place even after years and likely sustained by plant root exudates. The combination of UF and IEF resulted very efficient in the characterization of humic-enzyme complexes and biochemical processes which drive the humic substances formation, storage and activity in soils.","[Masciandaro, Grazia; Macci, Cristina; Doni, Serena; Ceccanti, Brunello] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-56124 Pisa, Italy","Masciandaro, G (reprint author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",grazia.masciandaro@ise.cnr.it,,"Doni, Serena/0000-0002-9428-9778; Masciandaro, Grazia/0000-0003-2983-1943",,,,26,1,3,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1863-5520,1863-5539,978-3-642-21161-4,ENVIRON SCI ENG,Environ.

Precipitation, as the sole source of water replenishment in arid area, plays an important role in sustaining the desert ecosystem. With the trend of global warming, precipitation is increasing in arid region recently, especially in the extremely arid region at the south rim of Tarim Basin. Halogeton glomeratus (Bieb.) C. A.Mey is the key species of Gobi desert at the south rim of Tarim Basin, which use the scarce and irregular rainfall for survival in greatest possible. There was little research on characteristics of H. glomeratus involving biomass allocation and root distribution under different rainfall conditions in extremely arid regions. Our objective was to study the response for H. glomeratus to the global precipitation change. Artificial controlling water supply was conducted at three levels in experimental fields in Cele Gobi desert. Additionally, the natural precipitation control plot was analyzed for comparison. Frequent harvests were used to determine the response of biomass allocation and root distribution of H. glomeratus during a growing season under extreme rainfall conditions. Biomass of H glomeratus increased as rainfall increased in the prophase of the growing season, but decreased in the later half phase of the growing season. Biomass allocation showed no significant difference among the treatments. However, H. glomeratus with higher level of rainfall allocates more biomass to roots. H glomeratus adapts to the lower water condition by means of modulating roots distribution with deeper vertical main root and extent horizontal lateral roots.","[Li, Haifeng; Zeng, Fanjiang; Gui, Dongwei; Liu, Zhen; An, Guixiang; Zhang, Ligang; Song, Cong; Gao, Huanhuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Li, HF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",haifengl1984@sina.com; zengfj@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,,,,26,0,1,0,9,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,DURNTEN-ZURICH,"KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",1022-6680,,978-3-03785-416-7,ADV MATER RES-SWITZ,,,2012,518-523,,,,,,5000,5007,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.5000,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Materials Science,BDM58,WOS:000313845902174,,,,,10/31/19S,"Yang, QL; Liu, KN; Liu, XG; Wang, MK",,"Iranpour, R; Zhao, J; Wang, A; Yang, FL; Li, X",,"Yang, Qiliang; Liu, Kenan; Liu, Xiaogang; Wang, Mingke",,,Effect of limited irrigation on growth and water use of Jatropha curcas L.,"ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, PTS 1-6",Advanced Materials Research,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP 2012),"JUN 23-24, 2012","Hohhot, PEOPLES R CHINA",Inner Mongolia Univ,,Limited irrigation; Jatropha Curcas L.; Growth; storage water regulation; Water use efficiency,DROUGHT; STORAGE; SUGARCANE; SEEDLINGS; STRESS,"A pot-grown experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of limited irrigation on growth, storage water amount of every organ and water use of Jatropha curcas L.seedlings.

Dry mass of every organ in plant shows that shoot>branch and master rod>leaf>root>petiole. Storage water capability of unit dry mass for every organ in plant shows that petiole>branch and master rod or shoot>leaf>root. Compared to W4 treatments, W2 reduced irrigation water by 27.1%, mean leaf area of Jatropha curcas L.seedlings for W2 reduced by 25.8%, but root-shoot ratio increased by 6.1%, meanwhile, mean storage water capability of unit root, lateral branch and master rod, leaf, shoot and total plant dry mass of Jatropha curcas L.seedlings for W2 increased by 15.4%, 1.3%, 7.4%, 0.6% and 1.8%, respectively. But mean root, shoot and total plant dry mass accumulation of Jatropha curcas L.seedlings for W2 only reduced by 11.4%, 17.7%, 15.8%, respectively, therefore, irrigation water use efficiency and total water use efficiency of Jatropha curcas L.seedlings for W2 increased by 15.5%, 14.9%, respectively. It is clear that W2 treatment not only increased water use efficiency, but increased regulation storage water capability, thus W2 treatment's Jatropha curcas L.seedlings improved water regulation and controlled water balance capability and resistance ability to drought-stress.","[Yang, Qiliang; Liu, Kenan; Liu, Xiaogang; Wang, Mingke] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Modern Agr Engn, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China","Yang, QL (reprint author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Modern Agr Engn, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China.",yangqilianglovena@163.com,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,DURNTEN-ZURICH,"KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",1022-6680,,978-3-03785-416-7,ADV MATER RES-SWITZ,,,2012,518-523,,,,,,5251,5256,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.5251,,,6,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Materials Science,BDM58,WOS:000313845902219,,,,,10/31/19S,"Tang, YL; Zhou, BZ; Li, Q",,"Iranpour, R; Zhao, J; Wang, A; Yang, FL; Li, X",,"Tang, Yilin; Zhou, Benzhi; Li, Qian",,,Fine root decomposition dynamics in moso bamboo forest of southeast China,"ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, PTS 1-6",Advanced Materials Research,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Conference on Energy and Environmental Protection (ICEEP 2012),"JUN 23-24, 2012","Hohhot, PEOPLES R CHINA",Inner Mongolia Univ,,Moso bamboo; Fine root; Decomposition dynamics; Mass loss,TURNOVER; PATTERNS,"To provide an important basis for the biogeochemical cycle of bamboo forest ecosystem, particularly the cycling of carbon, we studied decomposition dynamics of fine root in moso bamboo(Phyllostachys pubescens) forest.

These interactions can produce a large amount of soil respiration (R-s) and respond strongly to such climatic changes as temperature and precipitation. The objective of the present study was to explore how interannual variations in environmental factors (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and biotic factors (leaf area index, LAI) influence soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity (apparent Q(10)) in global forest ecosystems that are classified by the mycorrhizae of the dominant plants. Based on a global forest database, the mycorrhizal strategy of tree species over 200 site-years was determined. The R-s on the global scale was largely controlled by temperature. When the mycorrhizal strategy was considered, the responses of the R-s to the mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and LAI were highly variable among different mycorrhizal strategies. For example, the R-s was explained mainly by the LAI for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and AM+ ectomycorrhizal (ECM) types and by the MAT for ECM and ECM+EEM (ectendomycorrhizal)+NM (non-mycorrhizal) types. The apparent Q(10) of the R-s was not significantly different. This study was the first to evaluate the influence of different mycorrhizal strategies on forest R-s on the global scale. The mycorrhizal strategy plays an important role in the interpretation of the current soil respiration data.","[Shi, Z.; Wang, F.; Liu, Y.] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Agr, Luoyang 471003, Henan Province, Peoples R China; [Shi, Z.] Peking Univ, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China","Shi, Z (reprint author), Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Agr, Tianjin Rd 70, Luoyang 471003, Henan Province, Peoples R China.",shizy1116@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40971150]; Chinese Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20090450004, 20103018]; open fund of Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Ministry of Education [2011004]; Science Foundation Fostering Innovative Ability of Henan University of Science and Technology [2009CZ0006]","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 40971150), the Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation (20090450004, 20103018), the open fund of Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Ministry of Education (2011004), and the Science Foundation Fostering Innovative Ability of Henan University of Science and Technology (2009CZ0006).",,46,4,5,0,53,SOC CHILENA CIENCIA SUELO,TEMUCO,"CASILLA 54-D, TEMUCO, 00000, CHILE",0718-9516,,,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,J.

We investigated how salt stress and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influence plant neighbour effects and self-thinning in experimental populations of Medicago sativa. We obtained two mycorrhizal levels by applying the fungicide benomyl (low AMF) or not (high AMF) at three salinity levels (0.05%, 0.2% and 0.5%). In experiment 1, we investigated how salinity and AMF interact to influence plant interaction intensity using a neighbour removal treatment. In experiment 2, we investigated how self-thinning dynamics vary under salinity conditions and different AMF levels at two initial plant densities (6000 and 17,500 seeds m(-2)). Shoot biomass and plant density were measured 30, 60 and 90 days after sowing. Standardized major axis regression was used to estimate self-thinning parameters. In experiment 1, AMP increased competitive plant neighbour effects when there was no salinity stress, but this enhancement was not significant with increasing salinity. In experiment 2, there were effects of salinity and AMF on the self-thinning trajectory. The slope of the log (mean shoot biomass per unit area) vs. log density relationship was significantly steeper for the high AMF treatment than for the low AMF treatment without salinity, but the effect of AMF level on the self-thinning exponent was not significant under the two higher salinity levels. The effect of AMP treatments on the intercept of the self-thinning line was not significant at 0.2% salinity but was significant at 0.5% salinity, higher elevation for high AMP treatment. In self-thinning populations, AMF decreased the survival rate without salinity; but increased the survival rate at the highest salinity level. Our results support the hypothesis that salinity and AMP interact to influence plant neighbour effects and self-thinning. Under no-salinity conditions, AMF increased competition, steepened the self-thinning line and decreased survival rate, but these effects of AMP were not significant in the presence of salinity.","[Yu, Z.

Here we report on soil organic carbon, root density, and estimates of annual fluxes of soil CO2 as measured with a mobile chamber system at 16 permanent collars about monthly during the course of a year. We partitioned between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration by the indirect regression method, which enabled us to obtain the seasonal pattern of single components. The soil pool of organic carbon, with 15.8 (+/- 4.5) kg m(-2), was very high over the entire depth of 45 cm. The annual respiration rates ranged from 0.6 to 6.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) with an average value of 3.4 (+/- 2.3) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and a cumulative flux of 1.1 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The heterotrophic component accounted for 66% of annual CO2 efflux. Soil temperature largely controlled the heterotrophic respiration (R-2 = 0.93), while the autotrophic component followed irradiation, pointing to the role of photosynthesis in modulating the annual course of soil respiration. Most studies on soil respiration partitioning indicate autotrophic root respiration as a first control of the spatial variability of the overall respiration, which originates mainly from the uppermost soil layers. Instead, in our forest the spatial variability of soil respiration was mainly linked to soil carbon, and deeper layers seemed to provide a significant contribution to soil respiration, a feature that may be typical for an undisturbed, naturally maturing ecosystem with well developed pedobiological processes and high carbon stocks.

In mined dunes areas, we have compared the growth of Guazuma ulmifolia and Tabebuia roseo-alba seedlings using substrates containing 10 or 15% of cattle manure, uninoculated or inoculated with a mixture of native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or exotic AMF (Acaulospora longula). The inoculated plants had a higher percentage of colonization than those that were uninoculated. Plants of G. ulmifolia had the highest growth when inoculated with native AMF and fertilized with 10% manure or inoculated with A. longula and fertilized with 15% manure. In general, fertilization with 15% manure did not produce greater seedling development and had a negative effect on the effectiveness of the symbiosis. Twenty one AMF species were recorded in the planting areas at the end of the experiments, with a predominance of species that form acaulosporoid spores in areas with T. roseo-alba and gigasporoid spores in areas with G. ulmifolia plants. The incorporation of 10% cattle manure and native AMF in the substrate of T. roseo-alba and G. ulmifolia seedlings contributes to the initial establishment of plants in the field and to the incorporation of AMF propagules in the soil of the revegetated mined dunes.

Declining soil fertility and absence or presence of ineffective indigenous rhizobia in soils are assumptions that have been formulated but still require to be demonstrated. In this study, soils were collected from legume growing areas of Western (Bungoma), Nyanza (Bondo), Eastern (Isiolo), Central (Meru) and Coast (Kilifi) provinces in Kenya to assess indigenous rhizobia in soils nodulating cowpea and green gram under greenhouse conditions. Our results showed that highest nodule fresh weights of 4.63 and 3.32?g plant-1 for cowpea and green gram were observed in one soil from Isiolo and another from Kilifi, respectively, suggesting the presence of significant infective indigenous strains in both soils. On the other hand, the lowest nodule fresh weights of 2.17 and 0.72?g plant-1 were observed in one soil from Bungoma for cowpea and green gram, respectively. Symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation by cowpea and green gram was highest in Kilifi soil with values of 98% and 97%, respectively. A second greenhouse experiment was undertaken to evaluate the performance of commercial rhizobial inoculants with both legumes in Chonyi soil (also from Coast province) containing significant indigenous rhizobia [>13.5?x?103 Colony Forming Units (CFU) g-1]. Rhizobial inoculation did not significantly (P?<?0.05) affect nodulation, biomass yield and shoot N content in cowpea and green gram compared with controls. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) region analysis of nodules revealed six groups of which only IGS Group IV corresponded with those from commercial inoculants applied, indicating a lower competitiveness of inoculated strains. In cowpea, IGS III was dominant in nodules of plants inoculated with Biofix and Rizoliq commercial inoculants, and the uninoculated control treatment (63.2, 60 and 52.9%, respectively). Similarly, in green gram, IGS Group III was dominant in nodules of plants inoculated with Biofix 704 and Rizoliq commercial inoculants, and the uninoculated control treatment (75, 73.7 and 61.1%, respectively). Our results suggest that the systematic inoculation of both legumes with current available commercial inoculants to improve biomass yields is not necessary in these regions of Kenya. Also, according to our study, it would make sense to promote the utilization of indigenous strains performing well with both legumes.","[Lesueur, Didier] CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols CIRAD IRD INRA SupAgro, Off Sci Land Dev, Land Dev Dept, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Mathu, Samuel; Herrmann, Laetitia; Pypers, Pieter; Lesueur, Didier] CIAT, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mathu, Samuel; Matiru, Viviene; Mwirichia, Romano] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Nairobi, Kenya","Lesueur, D (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols CIRAD IRD INRA SupAgro, Off Sci Land Dev, Land Dev Dept, 2003-61 Paholyothin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",didier.lesueur@cirad.fr,,"Mwirichia, Romano/0000-0002-4198-5593",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute of CIAT (TSBF-CIAT),"This research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute of CIAT (TSBF-CIAT) project with the acronym COMPRO on commercial products.

(Ipil Ipil) seedlings, established from seeds exposed to a magnetic field (MF) of 75 millitesla for 3 different time intervals, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min respectively. After the seeds were exposed to a MF of 75 mT for 15 min, A. procera plants showed 49% more germination than in the control (41%), whereas L. leucocephala plants gained 37% more germination in the same treatment. A. procera had maximum plant height (13.1 cm) when seeds were exposed to a MF of 75 mT for 15 min, while the height gained by the control was only 7.1 cm. Similarly, L. leucocephala gained maximum plant height (17.8 cm) when seeds were treated with MF for 15 min, i.e. 137% greater than the height gained from nontreated seeds (7.5 cm). Seed exposure to MFs also resulted in higher collar diameter in both plants. In high-MF-treated A. procera (18.6 cm) seedlings, root length was 3 times longer than in the control (6.5 cm); MF-treated L. leucocephala seedlings gained maximum (63% longer) root length (18.9 cm), as well. A. procera had its maximum root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) (1.9) in the seedlings treated with low MF (5 min), whereas L. leucocephala had its maximum R/S (1.6) in nontreated seeds. Seeds exposed to MF for 5 min resulted in minimum R/S (0.9). The results clearly suggested that by increasing the time intervals for seed exposure to the fixed MF of 75 mT, the sowed seeds of both species showed higher growth rate.","[Tanvir, Muhammad Ayyoub; Nawaz, Muhammad Farrakh; Siddiqui, Muhammad Tahir; Shah, Amer] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Forestry Range Management & Wildlife, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Zia-ul-Haq] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Phys, Faisalabad, Pakistan","Tanvir, MA (reprint author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Forestry Range Management & Wildlife, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",mayyoubtanvir@gmail.com,"Nawaz, Muhammad Farrakh/L-5819-2019",,,,,29,2,2,0,10,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

Allometric partitioning theory (APT) supposes a constant root-shoot allometry. Optimal partitioning theory (OPT) assumes that plants' root growth is enhanced under water limitation. However, recent studies show that fine and coarse roots react differently. This paper draws attention to the root-shoot allometry of adult Monterey pines (Pinus radiata D. Don) and its dependency on site conditions in South Africa. For assessment of the root-shoot-diameter relationship as an allometric relationship in general and for comparison with APT we used a sample of nine radiata pines from Jonkershoek and three maritime pines (Pinus pinaster Aiton) from Napier. In order to test for a site-dependency of the root-shoot allometry we sampled increment cores from stem and coarse roots of 48 radiata pines along a gradient from moist to dry sites in the Western Cape province. Tree ring analysis revealed an allometric relationship between root diameter (dr) and shoot diameter (ds) (ln(dr) = a + alpha(dr,ds) x ln(ds)). Despite strong variation of the allometric exponent alpha(dr,ds) we found a systematic deviation from 1.0 as would be predicted by APT. We also found alpha(dr,ds) to decrease with drought stress, which is contradictory to both APT and OPT. However, on sites with more pronounced drought stress we detected greater allometric factors a. We hypothesise that fine root growth, and also fine root mortality, is higher on dry sites. On these sites coarse roots seem to be less necessary for matter transport compared with moist and fertile sites. On the latter, fine roots are less ephemeral and require larger coarse roots for transport. We conclude that combined root shoot tree ring analyses have the potential for improving understanding and modelling ecosystems and better assessment of forest functions such as resource use efficiency, stand stability and belowground carbon storage.","[Pretzsch, H.; Biber, P.; Uhl, E.; Hense, P.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Pretzsch, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Hans.Pretzsch@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868","BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); NRF; Germany and South Africa (project FORSIM [SUA 08/041]; EU (project Climate-Fit Forests, FP7 Marie Curie IRSES)European Union (EU) [GA 295136]","Thanks are due to BMBF and NRF for providing the funds for climate change research and cooperation between Germany and South Africa (project FORSIM, # SUA 08/041).

We used the ingrowth bag technique to sample the fine roots produced by each species in spring, summer, and winter. For each season, root architecture traits (specific root length, root diameter, root tips) and variables associated to root ectomycorrhizal status were measured in the laboratory. Results showed a marked seasonality in the fine root architecture, including more fine root tips and longer roots per unit of weight formed in spring and summer, revealing a capacity in Mediterranean oak species to modify root architecture in spring and suggesting the possibility of increased resource capture in summer. Fine root ectomycorrhizal status was comparable between species and also showed marked seasonality: we found a high percentage of roots colonized by dead ectomycorrhizas in winter but low ectomycorrhizal colonization rates in summer. Quercus ilex produced greater amounts of fine roots than Q. faginea (particularly during spring), suggesting greater competitive ability in the former species for belowground resources.","[Coll, Lluis; Martinez De Aragon, Juan] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain; [Coll, Lluis] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Julio Camarero, Jesus] Inst Pirenaico Ecol CSIC, ARAID, Zaragoza 50192, Spain","Coll, L (reprint author), Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain.",lluis.coll@ctfc.cat,"Camarero, J.

Empirical data from long-term field experiments in Sweden, two sites with Norway spruce and two with Scots pine with different levels of productivity, were used to calibrate the model against the stem-only treatment. The highest initial reduction in soil C, N and Ca stores was predicted for SSlSt, and the reduction was more pronounced at low productive sites than at the high productive ones. Most of the decline in soil C and Ca stocks was offset by the litter production in the following forest stand. N showed an initial phase of immobilisation in stumps and coarse roots, while N was immediately released from tops and branches, which contained N-rich needles. Removal of stumps and coarse roots in combination with slash resulted in a similar load of inorganic soil N as for the S treatment, whereas the SSl treatment with stumps left in the soil initially reduced the inorganic soil N pool.","[Hyvonen, Riitta; Olsson, Bengt A.; Agren, Goran I.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Hyvonen, R (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",riitta.hyvonen@slu.se,,,"Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy Agency; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences","This research was funded by the Swedish Energy Agency, and by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences.

A 2x3 factorial design was established with 8 treatments - with and without nematodes, with and without mycorrhizae, and with and without fertilizer application with 4 replicates. Two weeks after inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the plants were infested with 4 nematode egg masses, and 8 weeks later, the plants were harvested. The inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi significantly reduced the proline content, with the non-inoculated plants exhibiting a higher concentration. Neither the infestation of the nematodes nor the addition of fertilizer significantly affected the proline content. Plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, number of leaves, and fresh weight were significantly improved by the presence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The interaction of the fungi and the fertilizer did have a significant effect for height and leaf area.

Furthermore, significant increase in the shoot and root growth of the plantlets inoculated with G. viscosum + P chrysosporium, and G. intraradices + C. rigida were observed. On the other hand, G. claroideum + T versicolor showed the high increase in the dehydrogenase enzyme activity, while inoculation with G. claroideum alone showed the greatest beta-glucosidase activity.

This symbiosis increases nitrogen (N) in the soil; however, to establish such a synergistic relationship, a complex communication system is required between the bacterium and its legume host. Rhizobacteria are known to respond to plant root exudates and produce signal molecules known as ""Nod"" factors. Research suggests that the brown seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) extract (ANE) stimulates both root nodulation and growth of alfalfa (Khan et al. 2011). To elucidate the mechanism of action, the effects of ANE on the early stages of root-rhizobia interactions were examined. A. nodosum extract (ANE) and its organic fractions were prepared and alfalfa roots were treated. After 2 days, the treated roots were inoculated with S. meliloti. The roots from treated plants were excised and observed for colony-forming units. To verify whether ANE elicited the synthesis and secretion of factors similar to those induced by luteolin, S. meliloti cultures were treated with ANE and the bacterial components were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study Nod factor induction by S. meliloti due to ANE treatment, a root hair deformation assay was performed. A translational fusion of S. meliloti NodC: LacZ (strain JM57) was used to observe the effect of ANE on bacterial gene expression. When S. meliloti culture medium was supplemented with ANE, no effect on bacterial growth was observed. However, it was observed that the attachment of S. meliloti to the root hairs was improved. Similarly in vitro ANE root treatments, followed by S. meliloti inoculation, increased bacterial colonies. HPLC profiles and a root hair deformation assay suggested that ANE elicits production of compounds similar to the Nod factor, which are normally induced by the plant signaling molecule luteolin. The results suggest that ANE may contain compound(s) that promote the legume-rhizobia symbiotic relationship and plant signaling.","[Zhai, Ruijie; Prithiviraj, Balakrishnan] Nova Scotia Agr Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada; [Khan, Wajahatullah] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biochem, Genome Res Chair Unit, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Souleimanov, Alfred; Smith, Donald L.] McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Critchley, Alan T.] Acadian Seaplants Ltd, Dartmouth, NS, Canada","Prithiviraj, B (reprint author), Nova Scotia Agr Coll, Dept Environm Sci, POB 550, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada.",bprithiviraj@nsac.ca,"Khan, Wajahatullah/J-9574-2012; Critchley, Alan/AAB-1467-2019","Critchley, Alan/0000-0003-1704-458X",Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; Acadian Seaplants Limited; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Research in B.

The dilution method effectively resulted in soil communities with consistently contrasting levels of species (TRF) richness. In particular, the 10(-6) dilution of field soil resulted in less rich communities in bare unplanted soil than did the 10(-1) soil dilution. However, this was not the case in planted soils where root activity was a powerful influence on species richness. After seven months, principal components analysis (PCA) separated bacterial community composition primarily on planting regime: planted mycorrhizal, planted non-mycorrhizal and bare soil treatments all contained different bacterial community compositions. A consistent finding in planted and unplanted soils was that aggregate stability was positively correlated with small pore sizes. Mycorrhizal colonisation decreased plant biomass and also resulted in reduced soil bacterial species richness, lower percentage organic matter and smaller pore sizes relative to planted but non-mycorrhizal soils. However, soil aggregate stability and water repellency were increased in these (mycorrhizal) soils probably due to AMF hyphal activities including enmeshment and/or glomalin production. In contrast, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare and non-mycorrhizal planted soils. Soil organic carbon was an important factor in all treatments, but in the bare soil where there was no additional input of labile C from roots, the percentage C could be directly related to fungal TRF richness. The less species rich bare soil contained more organic C than the more species rich bare soil. This suggests a degree of redundancy with regard to mineralisation of organic matter when additional, more utilisable C sources are unavailable. Understanding the effects of microbial diversity on functional parameters is important for advancing sustainable soil management techniques, but it is clear that soil is a dynamic ecosystem.

Oxygen must be taken from the atmosphere for root respiration, and carbon dioxide must be discharged to the atmosphere. Because the pore space of the soil could be considered the ""dead end"" of the free atmosphere, topsoil gas diffusivity is particularly important for soil aeration. Due to diverse land uses, several soil cover types alternate on a small scale at urban sites, competing with the natural function of soil as the living space for roots. During Documenta 7 in 1982, the artist Joseph Beuys initiated the spectacular landscape art project 7000 Oaks"". Seven thousand trees of approximately the same age were planted over the whole city of Kassel, Germany, offering best possible conditions for investigating the influence of specific site factors on root and tree development. At 8 different sites featuring 36 Beuys-oaks and 15 Beuys-planes, topsoil gas diffusivity, soil CO2 concentration and soil respiration of different soil cover types were measured and correlated with fine root density and tree growth. Topsoil gas diffusivity and soil respiration depend on soil cover type. The lowest gas diffusivities and respiration rates were found at sealed sites, and the highest values were measured at vegetated sites such as lawn or flower beds. Soil gas diffusivity primarily controls soil respiration. Soil CO2 concentration is not strictly linked to the coverage type and does not show a strictly directed dependence on top soil gas diffusivity and soil respiration. Tree root density and height as well as diameter at breast height (1.3 m) of the oaks were decisively shaped by the gas diffusivity of the soil cover, whereas the investigated planes were not affected by soil aeration deficiencies. The vitality of urban trees can be controlled by the design of the tree site and the choice of the species. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

LOUD.) in the southern boreal forest of British Columbia, Canada, analyses how site conditions modify the coarse root-shoot dynamics of trees. The allometric relationship between diameter growth of coarse roots and trunk is scrutinised for long-term site dependence, and short-term reactions to periodic climate conditions. Along a gradient from poor to rich sites, we analysed 54 trees. The sampling scheme provided two increment cores each from the three main roots and the shoot at breast height per tree. From the year-ring series, we calculated diameter time series for each shoot and each root. With these data, we show (1) that the trees' coarse root diameter and shoot diameter are linearly related in a double-logarithmic coordinate system, thus representing constant allometry on the long run. Statistical analysis of these long-term trajectories reveals that (2) the relative allocation to coarse roots versus shoot is much higher on poor sites compared to rich sites. A closer look at the short-term reaction to stress events in the period from 1995 to 2000, where several dry years occurred, underpins that (3) a lack of water supply triggers biomass allocation in favour of coarse roots at the expense of shoot growth most pronouncedly on poor sites. Implications of this morphological plasticity for allometric theory, method development, tree and stand dynamics and carbon storage assessment are discussed.","[Pretzsch, Hans; Uhl, Enno; Biber, Peter; Schuetze, Gerhard] Tech Univ Munich, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Coates, K.

Climate scenarios predict a decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature for Northern Patagonia (Argentina). The long-term assessment of the effect of water shortage on allocation patterns of Prosopis alpataco provides insights into how climate change could affect this dominant shrub of the Monte Desert. A single-factor (water supply) field experiment was conducted. Phenotypic plasticity in biomass partitioning and allocation to storage and defense was assessed over the course of pre-reproductive growth during five years. Water-effect and size-dependent effects were sorted out. Our results indicate that as plants grow larger, root:shoot ratio increases, as well as total non-structural carbohydrates pool, irrespective of water treatment. Increasing belowground allocation through partitioning to reserves instead of allocation to non-storage mass, favors carbohydrate forms that later can be mobilized. Spine mass ratio increased 3-fold in response to drought. These conservative strategies might facilitate the persistence of Prosopis alpataco in a novel and drier environment, through the production of drought-tolerant juvenile individuals.

Further, it has been hypothesised, but not confirmed, that established Kunzea ericoides (a native Myrtaceae tree with both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal associations) could serve as an alternative host for ectomycorrhizal fungi and thus facilitate mycorrhizal infection of Nothofagus. To confirm and quantify these hypotheses, first we used an ex situ, intact-soil-core bioassay of soils collected near Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides forest, near established Kunzea, and in grassland distant from trees of either species. Second, we collected soils along transects of increasing distance from Nothofagus forest into adjacent grasslands. Mycorrhizal infection of Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides seedlings was high in soils from Near-Nothofagus and Near-Kunzea (74% and 67% of root tips, respectively) and lower in soils Distant from trees (28% of root tips). Seedlings in soils from Near-Nothofagus also had 3.4 x greater biomass than those in soils Distant from trees. In the transects, mycorrhizal infection declined in a stepwise fashion at approximately 16 m distance from the forest edge, and seedling biomass was positively correlated with mycorrhizal infection. These data confirm that a lack of mycorrhizal inoculum can limit seedling establishment and show that Kunzea can provide an alternative host for Nothofagus-compatible mycorrhizal inoculum. Further, they provide quantitative data for spatially explicit models of woody establishment. Forty percent of seedlings in soils collected distant from trees had greater than 20% infection, suggesting that a lack of mycorrhizal inoculum is not a complete barrier to woody establishment, but instead may act as one of multiple environmental filters slowing beech spread.","[Dickie, Ian A.; Carswell, Fiona E.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Davis, Murray] Scion, Christchurch 8540, New Zealand","Dickie, IA (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 40, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",dickiei@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128",MAF - SLMACC (Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change) Fund [C04X1002],"N.

This was done based on inventoried damage and observed wind speeds and snow loading in storms Pyry and Janika in 2001 and Mielikki in 2002 together with mechanistic model. First, we studied which factors explain the observed damage in individual trees. Secondly, we studied how well the mechanistic model (HWIND) could predict the wind speed needed to uproot individual trees at the margins of permanent upwind edges. We found that Pyry stoma caused 70% and Janika and Mielikki 18 and 12% of observed damage. In Janika storm, all trees uprooted. In other storms, both uprooting and stern breakage occurred. Scots pine suffered the most damage. Recently thinned stands on the upwind edges of open areas suffered the most damage. But, damage occurred also on soils with relatively shallow anchorage. HWIND predicted correctly damage for 69% of all uprooted trees. No-uprooting was correctly predicted for 45 and 19% of standing trees (all Scots pines), which were measured within and at the immediate upwind edge of same stands. HWIND model needs further validation at the permanent edges and/or on soils with shallow rooting to improve its prediction accuracy in such conditions.","[Zubizarreta-Gerendiain, Ane; Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Agr, Forest Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pellikka, Petri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland; [Ikonen, Veli-Pekka; Peltola, Heli] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Joensuu, Finland","Zubizarreta-Gerendiain, A (reprint author), Univ Tecn Lisboa, Sch Agr, Forest Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal.",heli.peltola@uef.fi,"Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi/H-9221-2013; Zubizarreta-Gerendiain, Ane/A-6970-2013","Garcia-Gonzalo, Jordi/0000-0001-9946-5753; Zubizarreta-Gerendiain, Ane/0000-0001-5071-2629","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [121623]; FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH / BPD / 63979 / 2009), FECYT (EX2009-0397)]; ForEAdapt project; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [426 PIRSES-GA-2010-269257]","This work was related to the research carried out under the project on ""Impacts of temporal and spatial variability of critical weather events and forest management on the risk of wind and snow induced damage in forest stands"", led by Dr Heli Peltola, University of Eastern Finland ((Project No. 121623 funded by the Academy of Finland, 2008-2010).

A two-year field study was carried out in north-eastern Italy to evaluate the turf canopy quality and root system architecture of three seeded bermudagrass cultivars (La Paloma, Princess-77 and Yukon), and a zoysiagrass (Companion) under non-irrigated conditions. Plots (1.6 x 4.5 m) were established in July 2005 and arranged in a randomized complete block with three replicates. Visual quality ratings were assessed weekly from April to November in 2006 and 2007. Soil cores were collected at depths of 0-3, 3-8, 8-15, 15-25 and 25-40 cm in August 2006, January 2007, May 2007 and September 2007 to measure main rooting characteristics: root length density (RLD), root mass density (RMD) and root diameter. Companion zoysiagrass had higher canopy quality than bermudagrass cultivars in early spring and in the late growing season, while it displayed poorest quality from June to October. Among the bermudagrass cultivars, Yukon showed the highest quality in both years. Differences in RLD among grasses appeared to be related to seasonal changes in air temperature and precipitation. In August 2006 Companion zoysiagrass averaged 3.5-4.4 cm cm(-3) less RLD than bermudagrass cultivars La Paloma and Princess-77. Visual turf quality was positively correlated to the RLD and RMD in the 25-40 cm soil layer, whereas no correlations were found with root diameters nor any parameter collected in the upper soil layers. Deep-rooting cultivars may have an advantage in deficit soil moisture periods resulting in higher quality turf throughout the year.","[Rimi, Filippo; Macolino, Stefano; Ziliotto, Umberto] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy","Macolino, S (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, AGRIPOLIS, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.",stefano.macolino@unipd.it,,,"Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (MIUR)Ministero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR)","Appreciation is given to Marisa Cossu for her technical assistance in the performance of the experiments.

As ecosystem engineers, earthworms are capable of causing dramatic changes in above- and belowground forest composition, but whether they have the same effects in all forests remains unclear. Forest compositional changes caused by earthworms may be mediated by interactions between earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi. Specifically, tree seedling growth may be altered by the presence of exotic earthworms and their subsequent impact on mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we investigate the effects of exotic earthworms on ectomycorrhizal colonization and seedling growth of the conifer Picea glauca (white spruce) in gray luvisolic soils from the Boreal Plains. Anecic Lumbricus terrestris and epigeic Dendrobaena octaedra earthworms were added to mesocosms each containing a white spruce seedling in a greenhouse experiment. Impacts on the composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the mesocosms were determined using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques, and effects on seedling growth were assessed through above- and belowground measurements. The proportion of ectomycorrhizal root tips and ectomycorrhizal community composition did not vary as a function of earthworm species or density. Similarly, exotic earthworms had no significant effect on spruce seedling growth or survival.","[Cameron, Erin K.; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Integrated Landscape Management Grp, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Cameron, EK (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Integrated Landscape Management Grp, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",ecameron@ualberta.ca,,"Karst, Justine/0000-0003-0497-1552; Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",Alberta Conservation Association; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Vanier Canada; Alberta Ingenuity Scholarship; Izaak Walton Killam Memorial Postdoctoral Fellowship,"Thanks to K.

In degraded areas, native rhizobial strains are often undetectable, therefore, the restoration of natural vegetation associated with an effective nodulation of the leguminous trees is mostly appropriate. Sinorhizobium americanum is a native nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from nodules of the native Acacia species in the region. Acacia farnesiana is a multipurpose leguminous shrub from Mexican seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF). In this study we analyzed the effect of inoculation with S. americanum on A. farnesiana growth in a greenhouse and in a very degraded area and compared with non-inoculated seedlings. In a greenhouse, we measured the biomass dry weight of different parts of the plant, using destructive sampling after 15, 20, 30,45 and 120 days of growth. We also calculated the relative growth rate (RGR) and the resources allocation (root/shoot weight ratio and root length/root dry weight) of seedlings. In a degraded area we measured the seedling length and survival and calculated the RGR. in the greenhouse and in the degraded area, the inoculation positively affected the growth of seedlings. However in the greenhouse, the inoculation did not have effect on resource allocation patterns. Therefore, the inoculation with Sinorhizobium americanum could improve the A. farnesiana growth and the re-establishment of important plant-soil interactions in degraded areas, being a recommendable technique for land restoration and the improvement of fuelwood production.","[Ceccon, Eliane] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico; [Almazo-Rogel, Anayeli] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico; [Martinez-Romero, Esperanza; Toledo, Ivonne] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Genom, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico","Ceccon, E (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Reg Invest Multidisciplinarias, Av Univ S-N,Circuito 2, Cuernavaca 62210, Morelos, Mexico.",ececcon61@gmail.com; aniupa@hotmail.com; emartine@ccg.unam.mx; toledo.ivonne@gmail.com,"Ceccon, Eliane/G-1853-2012","martinez-romero, esperanza/0000-0002-2295-2606", [PAPIIT- UNAM: IN118306];  [IN304409],We are in debt to Dr. Michael Dunn and Tara Fehling Fraser for the English revision and to Eng.

Both life forms differ in aboveground and belowground traits. We hypothesized that grazing disturbance leads to the replacement of grass by shrub fine roots in the upper soil, and this is reflected in changes in the seasonal dynamics of shallow fine roots at the community level. In two sites representative of non-grazed and grazed vegetation states in the Patagonian Monte, we assessed the canopy structure, and the fine root biomass, N concentration, production, and turnover during two consecutive years. The non-grazed site exhibited higher total, grass, and shrub cover than the grazed site. The grazed site had larger or equal fine root biomass than the non-grazed site except for late spring of the second year. This could be associated with the ability of shrubs to develop dimorphic-root systems occupying the soil freed by grasses at the grazed site, and with the larger contribution of grass than shrub fine roots in relation to an extraordinary precipitation event at the non-grazed site. This was consistent with the N concentration in fine roots. Fine root production was positively correlated to temperature at the grazed site and with precipitation at the non-grazed site. Fine root turnover did not differ between sites. Our results indicate that grazing leads to a shifting in the seasonality and main climatic controls of fine root production, while fine root turnover is mostly affected by changes in soil water conditions.","[Larreguy, Cecilia; Carrera, Analia L.; Bertiller, Monica B.] Ctr Nacl Patagon CENPAT CONICET, Chubut, Argentina; [Larreguy, Cecilia; Carrera, Analia L.; Bertiller, Monica B.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Chubut, Argentina","Larreguy, C (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CENPAT CONICET, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACV Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",larreguy@cenpat.edu.ar,,,"National Agency for Scientific, Technological Promotion [PICT 08-20454, 02-02192]; Chubut Province [PIP-112-200801-01664-CONICET, PID 2011 8-18]; CONICET (National Research Council of Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Provincia de Chubut (Argentina)","This research was funded by PICT 08-20454 and 02-02192 of the National Agency for Scientific, Technological Promotion and PIP-112-200801-01664-CONICET, and PID 2011 8-18 Chubut Province.

However, there has been no detailed study to investigate the effect of asymmetrical warming on root dynamics at the level of terrestrial ecosystems. To understand the effects of day and night warming on root lifespan in the semiarid temperate steppe in northern China, a field study with a full factorial design including control, day warming, night warming and continuous warming was conducted using modified rhizotron technique during three growing seasons in 2007-2009. Our results show that day, night and continuous warming had different effects on longevity of roots born in spring, summer and autumn, and that day warming significantly prolonged overall lifespan for the roots born in the three growing seasons, while night warning had no effect on overall lifespan. Day and night warming had different effects on root non-structural carbohydrate content, suggesting that allocation of photoassimilate may account for the differential responses of root lifespan to day and night warming. These results differ from other processes associated with ecosystems C cycle such as total ecosystem productivity, net ecosystem productivity and soil respiration. Our findings highlight that it is essential to incorporate the differential effects of day and night warming on root dynamics into simulating and predicting the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems C cycling to global warming.","[Bai, W.

In North America, N deposition rates are highest in the central US, yet there are few studies that examine whether N availability has been increasing to different tree species in the forests of the region. To determine the species-specific trajectories of N availability in secondary temperate forests experiencing high N deposition, we measured the N concentrations and composition of stable N isotopes in wood of four tree species from six hardwood forest remnants in northern Indiana, USA. Annual nitrogen deposition rates averaged 5.8 kg ha(-1) from 2000 to 2008 in this region. On average, wood delta N-15 values in Quercus alba have been increasing steadily over the past 100 years. In contrast, wood delta N-15 values have been declining in three other hardwood species - Acer saccharum, Carya ovata, and Fagus grandifolia - over the same time period. The species-specific trends suggest a change in the partitioning of ammonium and nitrate among species, due to an increase in nitrification rates over time. With no apparent net change in wood delta N-15 over the past century at the stand level, there is currently little evidence for consistent trends in stand-level N availability over time in the Indiana forests.","[McLauchlan, K.

However, many factors can influence the symbiotic relationship between plant and fungus, potentially obscuring experimental treatments and ecosystem impacts. In a field experiment, we assessed AMF colonization levels of individual ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) plants growing in grassland plots that were originally sown with 15 or 4 plant species, or were unsown. We measured the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), and assessed the presence of aboveground insect herbivores on the sampled plants. Total AMF colonization and colonization by arbuscules was lower in plots sown with 15 species than in plots sown with 4 species and unsown plots. AMF colonization was positively related to the cover of oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) and a positive relationship between colonization by arbuscules and the occurrence of a specialist seed-feeding fly (Pegohylemyia seneciella) was found. The occurrence of stem-boring, leaf-mining and sap-sucking insects was not affected by AMF colonization. Total PA concentrations were negatively related to colonization levels by vesicles, but did not differ among the sowing treatments. No single factor explained the observed differences in AMF colonization among the sowing treatments or insect herbivore occurrence on S. jacobaea. However, correlations across the treatments suggest that some of the variation was due to the abundance of one plant species, which is known to stimulate AMF colonization of neighbouring plants, while AMF colonization was related to the occurrence of a specialist insect herbivore. Our results thus illustrate that in natural systems, the ecosystem impact of AMF through their influence on the occurrence of specialist insects can be recognised, but they also highlight the confounding effect of neighbouring plant species identity. Hence, our results emphasise the importance of field studies to elucidate interactions between AMF and organisms of different trophic levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

I found that (i) the spatial heterogeneity across the transect was greater than the temporal heterogeneity at any given microsite on the transect for both light and water and there was a positive correlation between them, (ii) Couepia obovata Ducke, the largest seeded and the only subcanopy tree, survived the best and showed both the largest relative height growth rate (RHGR) and the largest specific leaf area (SLA), while among the two early successional trees, Tapirira guianensis J.B. Aublet had the largest leaf area ratio (LAR) and the largest leaf mass ratio (LMR) and Duguethia spixiana Mart. had the largest root to shoot ratio (RTOS), (iii) for T. guianensis, SLA increased with increasing light and soil water potential predicted both increasing LMR and decreasing RTOS with increasing soil water, and (iv) soil water potential could also predict increasing LAR with increasing water for D. spixiana and, for C. obovata, soil water potential predicted more survivorship, LMR, and RHGR but less RTOS, all with increasing soil water. I conclude that some subcanopy trees may survive and grow more than open-canopy trees when presented with water stress in the forest understory and that within the ranges of light and soil water sampled here, plants responded more to spatial variation in water compared with light.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Oklahoma City, OK 73107 USA","Myster, RW (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Oklahoma City, OK 73107 USA.",rwmyster@gmail.com,,,Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Ecuador,"I wish to thank Daniel Kneeshaw for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

These fungi can penetrate root cells and form pelotons, hyphal coils responsible for providing simple sugars for the orchid embryo. During the achlorophyllous seedling stage, orchids depend on fungi; and some species remain dependent through life, while others establish photosynthesis but, to varying degrees, remain facultatively dependent or responsive to fungal colonization as adults. The aim of this study was to identify how many clades of fungi can establish mycorrhizal associations with Coppensia doniana, a widespread orchid in Campos do Jordao (Brazil) and to demonstrate how morphological features can be useful to group and identify these fungi. Plants were collected during the dry season of 2009 near Campos do Jordao State Park. Fungi were isolated by transferring root segments containing pelotons to media. Three main clades of fungi were formed by either qualitative or quantitative morphological data. We identified these fungi as two morphotypes of Ceratorhiza (anamorphic stage of Ceratobasidium) and one uninucleate Rhizoctonia. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing data corroborated the morphological features showing the same three clades; all isolates showed a high similarity with Ceratobasidium ITS sequences in GenBank. Thus, it was possible to demonstrate a high affinity between this orchid species of Oncidiinae and Ceratobasidium. Morphological data associated with multivariate statistics proved to be a useful tool in multilevel taxonomy of these orchid-associated fungi.","[Valadares, Rafael B.; Cardoso, Elke J.] Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Coll Agr Luiz Queiroz ESALQ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pereira, Marlon C.] Fed Univ Vicosa UFV, Biol Sci & Hlth Inst, Rio Paranaiba, Brazil; [Otero, Joel T.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Inst Estudios Ambientales, Dept Ciencias Biol, UNAL Palmira,Sede Palmira, Bogota, Colombia","Valadares, RB (reprint author), Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Coll Agr Luiz Queiroz ESALQ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",rafaelbsvaladares@gmail.com,"Valadares, Rafael/B-9463-2012; Cardoso, Elke J.B.N./E-5039-2013; Pereira, Marlon/H-1669-2014","Valadares, Rafael/0000-0003-4481-982X",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); Coordenadoria de Pessoal do Ensino Superior (CAPES); CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"We wish to thank Dr. Samantha Koehler for helping in orchid sampling, Americo D.

Both the host plant species and soil properties have been suggested as potentially important factors structuring AM fungal communities based on studies within local field sites. However, characterizations of the communities in relation to both host plant identity and soil properties in natural plant communities across both local and broader geographic scales are rare. We examined the AM fungal spore communities associated with the same C-4 grasses in two Eastern serpentine grasslands, where soils have elevated heavy metals, and two Iowa tallgrass prairie sites. We compared AM fungal spore communities among host plants within each site, looked for correlations between fungal communities and local soil properties, and then compared communities among sites. Spore communities did not vary with host plant species or correlate with local soil chemical properties at any site. They did not differ between the two serpentine sites or between the two prairie sites, despite geographic separation, but they did differ between serpentine and prairie. Soil characteristics are suggested as a driving force because spore communities were strongly correlated with soil properties when data from all four sites are considered, but climatic differences might also play a role.","[Ji, Baoming] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ji, Baoming; Casper, Brenda B.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bentivenga, Stephen P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA","Ji, BM (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St,Jordan Hall 149, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",baoji@indiana.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 03-50091],"Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation grant DEB 03-50091.

Although much research has been conducted at the species level, very little is understood about how genetic variation within and among interacting species may drive these processes. Using clones of both Solidago altissima and Solidago gigantea, we found that genotypic variation in a plants neighbours affected both above- and belowground plant traits, and that genotype by genotype interactions between neighbouring plants impacted associated pollinator communities. The traits for which focal plant genotypic variation explained the most variation varied by plant species, whereas neighbour genotypic variation explained the most variation in coarse root biomass. Our results provide new insight into genotypic and species diversity effects in plantneighbour interactions, the extended consequences of diversity effects, and the potential for evolution in response to competitive or to facilitative plantneighbour interactions.","[Genung, Mark A.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Bailey, Joseph K.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Genung, MA (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",mgenung@utk.edu,"Genung, Mark/K-5897-2012","Genung, Mark/0000-0002-9383-667X",Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0743437]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT0991727],"Special thanks to Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency for access to and maintenance of the field site.

We asked whether correlations exist among extrafloral nectary traits to attract arthropod bodyguards and floral traits to attract pollinator mutualists. For 37 species in the cotton genus (Gossypium), we evaluated correlations among six extrafloral nectary traits and four floral traits in a common greenhouse environment, with and without correction for phylogenetic non-independence. Across Gossypium species, greater investment in extrafloral nectary traits was positively correlated with greater investment in floral traits. Positive correlations remained after accounting for the evolutionary history of the clade. Our results demonstrate that traits to maintain multiple mutualist guilds can be positively correlated across related species and build a more general understanding of the constraints on trait evolution in plants.","[Chamberlain, Scott A.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Chamberlain, SA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6100 Main St,MS 170, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",schamber@rice.edu,,"Chamberlain, Scott/0000-0003-1444-9135",Rice University,"We thank J.

However, its accurate determination is difficult because of the multiplicity of sources and considerable spatial and temporal variability. Although the contribution of root and rhizosphere respiration varies between 10% and 90% of soil CO2 efflux (depending on vegetation and season), it is usually at the higher end of that range in temperate forests. The relationship between estimated fine root biomass (FRB) and soil CO2 efflux was investigated within an old-growth temperate deciduous forest in the Hainich National Park in central Germany. A heuristic model for estimating FRB, originally developed for Norway spruce was adapted and modified to predict relative FRB for two broad-leaved tree species (Fagus sylvatica L and Fraxinus excelsior L). The model is based on easily assessable aboveground parameters of stand structure, such as tree species, diameter at breast height (dbh), and tree location. It relies on the assumption that FRB decreases with a decrease in tree diameter; this decrease is species-specific. Location and dbh were recorded for 3478 trees, and soil CO2 efflux, moisture, and temperature were measured biweekly from August 2005 until June 2007 at 76 randomly distributed measurement locations within an area of 6 ha. The adapted FRB prediction model was parameterized for each tree species using data from 24 soil cores derived in the same forest close to the study site. Since highly significant model fits between predicted and measured FRBs were observed for beech (R-2 = 0.90) and ash (R-2 = 0.78), the parameterization of the model was considered successful. However, this did not allow the prediction of annual or seasonal soil CO2 efflux rates using regression kriging with the map of modeled total FRB as ancillary data. Significant model fits could only be established when the estimated FRB of ash-dominated locations was used as ancillary data in regression kriging to predict monthly averages of hourly soil CO2 efflux rates for June. August, and September 2006. Considering the often found low spatial variation in total FRB, species-specific estimates of FRB may offer the opportunity to address seasonal and spatial variations in the contribution of root and rhizosphere respiration to soil CO2 efflux. The extrapolation of pointwise soil CO2 efflux measurements by regression kriging using maps of modeled FRB as ancillary data may be an interesting approach if it is possible to include further ancillary data on abiotic variables such as soil carbon and soil moisture.

Seedlings were grown in even-aged monospecific stands under ambient and warming (ambient + 2.2 degrees C) temperature in climate control chambers. Warming caused statistically significant increases in the specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, root biomass, leaf biomass, branch biomass, stem biomass, and total mass of the seedlings, and reduced the root/shoot ratio. Warming also increased total chlorophyll concentrations, specific chlorophyll pigments, and Chlorophyll a/b ratios in both studied needle age classes. In addition, C/N ratios of current-year and 1-year-old needles increased by warming. In contrast, warming decreased the levels of N, sugar, cellulose, and starch in needles, while warming had no effect on the height, stem diameter, needle mass ratio, root mass ratio, and root/needle ratio. We conclude that warming increases branch growth and changes needle chemistry, which enhances the light capture potential of seedlings.","[Wang, Jinchuang; Duan, Baoli; Zhang, Yuanbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Zhang, YB (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",zhangyb@cib.ac.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30871999, 30972338]","The financial support was provided by the Natural Science Foundation of China (30871999, 30972338).",,51,17,31,4,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JAN,2012,213,1,,,,,47,55,,10.1007/s11258-011-0005-1,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,865ST,WOS:000298331300005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Luan, JW; Liu, SR; Zhu, XL; Wang, JX; Liu, K",,,,"Luan, Junwei; Liu, Shirong; Zhu, Xueling; Wang, Jingxin; Liu, Kuan",,,Roles of biotic and abiotic variables in determining spatial variation of soil respiration in secondary oak and planted pine forests,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Soil CO(2) efflux; Soil properties; Spatial variation; Forest stand structure; Fine root biomass; Light fraction organic carbon; Forest management,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; FLOOR CO2 EFFLUX; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; TEMPORAL VARIATIONS; PATTERNS; PLANTATION; COMPONENTS; FLUXES; N2O; VARIABILITY,"Monoculture pine plantation (PP) was widely established after clear-cutting of natural forests last century in China. However, its effects on soil CO(2) efflux (R(S)) temporally and spatially are still poorly understood. Biotic and abiotic factors that control spatio-temporal variation of R(S) were assessed in a naturally regenerated oak forest (OF) and a nearby PP in a warm temperate area of China. We hypothesized that spatial variation of R(S) in PP is lower than that in OF and is less influenced by biotic factors due to its homogeneous stand structure compared to the regenerated OF. R(S) measurement campaigns were conducted in two 40 m x 60 m plots in OF and PP from Oct. 2008 to Oct. 2009. Soil temperature at 5 cm depth (T(5)) exerted considerable influence on the temporal variation in R(5). However, the spatial variation of R(S) was not affected by T(5) in either PP or OF. The observed spatial pattern of R(S) remained comparatively consistent throughout the measurement campaigns for both forests. Soil chemical and physical parameters such as soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), total nitrogen (TN), bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), water-filled pore space (WFPS), and water-holding capacity (WHC) had significant impact on the spatial variation of R(S) for both OF and PP. We found that biotic factors such as fine root biomass (FR) and stand structure parameters including basal area (BA), maximum diameter at breast height (max. DBH), and mean DBH within 4-5 m of the measurement points had significant influence on the spatial variation of R(S) in OF, while no similar significant correlation was found in PP. A stepwise multi-linear regression showed that water-holding capacity (WHC), max. DBH within 4 m of the measurement points (max. DBH(4)), and total porosity (TP) contributed 68.7% to the spatial variation of R(S) in OF, while light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and bulk density (BD) accounted for 46.9% of the spatial variation of R(S) in PP. These differentiated the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in controlling the spatial variation of R(S) between the naturally regenerated OF and the artificially regenerated monoculture PP. Therefore, compared to OF, relatively lower coefficients of spatial variation for R(S) were observed in PP across the year, which was partly attributed to its simple stand structure of PR Our findings are valuable for accurately estimating regional carbon fluxes by considering the spatio-temporal variation of R(S) in artificially and naturally regenerated forests.

P., and Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest, Sagar, M. P. Root and rhizosphere soil samples, collected near different trees species were analyzed for root colonization, spore count, extramatrical hyphae, vesicles, Paris coil and intraradical spores. VAM spores were isolated by wet sieving and decanting method and estimation of spores was carried out. In evergreen forest vegetation (Site-I), maximum root colonization (33 +/- 0.35 %) was observed in Terminalia myrocarpa Henrck & Mull. and minimum in Walsura robusta Roxb. (19 +/- 0.61 %). VAM spore count per 25g of soil was also highest (133 +/- 0.41) in Terminalia myrocarpa Henrck & Mull. while it was low in Mesua ferrea Linn. (48 +/- 0.21). In tropical moist forest (Site-II), Bridelia retusa Spreng. was observed to support least root colonization (33 +/- 0.4 per cent) and spore density (43 +/- 0.25/25 g soil). Maximum root colonization (64 +/- 0.49%) and spores density (167 +/- 0.46) were found in Lagerastroemia parviflora Roxb. In tropical dry deciduous forest (Site-III), root colonization (62 +/- 0.62 %) and spores density (121 +/- 0.31) were maximum in Albizzia lebbek Benth.-highest among all the three sites. Interestingly, these attributes were also lowest at this site in Wrightia tinctoria Linn. In all, 25 VAM species were identified from all the three forest sites. Out of these, 5 VAM species were common to three forest sites. More number of exclusive VAM species (6) were recorded at site-II. Glomus spp. was found as dominant VAM at all the three forest sites. Besides, the other morphological details of different VAM fungi, the results of present investigation envisage that diverse conditions of the habitat i.e. Tropical Moist Forest, support more VAM species not only in terms of numbers but also as the root association and potential propagules in the form of spores.","[Tripathi, P.; Khare, P.

Our objective was to evaluate SOM storage in density fractions and the relative contribution of the light fraction to total SOM pool under four different vegetations, including evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBF), coniferous forest (CF), dwarf forest (DF) and alpine meadow (AM), along an altitude gradation in the Wuyi Mountains of southeastern China, and to investigate the factors controlling the pool size in density fractions. Here we separated light and heavy fractions using 1.7 g cm(-3) sodium iodide solution. The concentrations of C and N in light and heavy fractions were the highest in AM soils, while the C/N ratios in density fractions were the highest in CF soils across soil depths. The amounts of C and N in the heavy fractions increased with increasing silt plus clay content in the corresponding soil depth. Greater SOM storages in light and heavy fractions under AM suggested that the accumulation of SOM at higher altitude (lower soil temperature and higher soil moisture) mainly depends on slower decomposition rate despite lower organic matter inputs rate. The relatively larger contribution of the light fraction to total SOM under CF than that under the other three vegetation types is mainly attributed to its higher amount and quality of litterfall input and greater fine root biomass. Significant correlation existed between light fraction C and N, dissolved organic C. microbial biomass C and N, indicating considerable cycling of C and N between these pools. A stronger correlation between heavy fraction C and microbial biomass C suggested that the heavy fraction organic matter could be associated with most microbial biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Plant cover, DTW and relative elevations were jointly measured along 67 vegetation transects throughout the Owens Valley, CA, USA. These transects were dominated by major species of the area: Artemisia tridentata, Atriplex torreyi, Ericameria nauseosa, Distichlis spicata, Juncus arcticus, Leymus triticoides, Sarcobatus vermiculatus and Sporobolus airoides. Plant species occurrence was associated with different DTW. J. arcticus and D. spicata occurred more frequently in areas with the shallowest groundwater (< 1.5 m). A. torreyi, L. triticoides and E. nauseosa dominated areas with intermediate DTW (1.5-2.0 m); whereas S. airoides, S. vermiculatus and A. tridentata dominated areas with deeper water tables (> 2.0 m). Species were also linked to different microtopographic positions: L. triticoides and J. arcticus were mainly restricted to depressions whereas A. torreyi and A. tridentata were widely distributed in higher positions on the microtopographical gradient. Only 6% of the variation in vegetation cover was accounted for by DTW throughout the study area (N = 820). Cover of individual species was usually unaffected by DTW variation. Results suggest that species distribution is linked to groundwater conditions, but cover of vegetation is only partially affected by DTW variation. This is possible because water tables in our study area are within the rooting depth of most species and plants appear to be well adapted to shallow DTW variations.

As a result, it is often assumed that external factors inducing greater root N concentration, such as chronic N deposition, will lead to increased respiration rates. However, enhanced N availability also alters root biomass, making the ecosystem-level consequences on whole-root-system respiration uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of chronic experimental N deposition on root N concentrations, specific respiration rates, and biomass for four northern hardwood forests in Michigan. Three of the six measurement plots at each location have received experimental N deposition (3 g NO3 --N m-2 yr-1) since 1994. We measured specific root respiration rates and N concentrations of roots from four size classes (<0.5, 0.51, 12, and 210 mm) at three soil depths (010, 1030, and 3050 cm). Root biomass data for the same size classes and soil depths was used in combination with specific respiration rates to assess the response of whole-root-system respiration. Root N and respiration rate were greater for smaller diameter roots and roots at shallow depths. In addition, root N concentrations were significantly greater under chronic N deposition, particularly for larger diameter roots. Specific respiration rates and root biomass were unchanged for all depths and size classes, thus whole-root-system respiration was not altered by chronic N deposition. Higher root N concentrations in combination with equivalent specific respiration rates under experimental N deposition resulted in a lower ratio of respiration to tissue N. These results indicate that relationships between root respiration rate and N concentration do not hold if N availability is altered significantly. For these forests, use of the ambient respiration to N relationship would over-predict actual root system respiration for the chronic N deposition treatment by 50%.","[Burton, Andrew J.; Jarvey, Julie C.; Jarvi, Mickey P.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Burton, Andrew J.] Michigan Technol Univ, Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pregitzer, Kurt S.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Burton, AJ (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",ajburton@mtu.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0814623, 0814864, 1059720]; Research Experiences for Undergraduate supplement [DEB 0814864]","We thank Rachel McDonald, Jennifer Eikenberry, Gabrielle Trudeau, Andrew Beebe, Ofori Lartey, and Alisha Autio for their help in the field and lab.

Tree-pulling experiments that simulated flood action were conducted, and the resulting damage was examined to assess the effects of physical tree characteristics and root architecture on the maximum resistive bending moment (M (max)) for overturning. In situ soil shear strength tests were conducted to measure soil strength parameters. The effects of species differences on the M (max) were examined by analyzing root architecture. S. babylonica has a heart-root system that produces a greater overturning moment due to the strong root anchorage and the large amount of substrate that must be mobilized during overturning. J. ailanthifolia has a plate-root system that produces a smaller overturning moment. However, trees with the plate-root system may withstand overturning better due to an increased root:shoot ratio. The results of the study show that the M (max) of a tree for overturning had significant (P < 0.05) correlations with a tree's physical characteristics, including height (H), trunk diameter at breast height (D (bh)), D (bh) (2) , height multiplied by the second power of D (bh) (trunk volume index H x D (bh) (2) ), and root-soil plate depth (R (d)), and root-soil plate radius (R (r)). Considering the strategy of J. ailanthifolia to increase the root:shoot ratio for anchoring in the substrate, the trunk volume index (H x D (bh) (2) ) is a better parameter than D (bh) (2) because it indirectly involves the difference in below-ground volume and surface area. Different soil cohesion values were found at different experimental sites, and the average M (max) for overturning each species decreased linearly with increasing soil cohesion.","[Tanaka, Norio; Samarakoon, M.

In India, little is known about the genetic resources and diversity of rhizobia nodulating soybean. Indigenous bradyrhizobia isolated from root nodules of soybean plants, collected from traditional cultivating regions of two states (Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) of India, were screened for bacteriophage sensitivity to identify successful broad host range symbiotic effectivity. Of 172 rhizobial isolates, 91 showed sensitivities to eight lytic phages and form ten groups on the basis of sensitivity patterns. The genetic diversity of 23 isolates belonging to different phage groups was assessed along with that of strains USDA123 and USDA94 by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S rDNA, intergenic spacer (IGS) (16S-23S rDNA), and DnaK regions. RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA formed 5 groups, whereas 19 and 9 groups were revealed by IGS and the DnaK genes, respectively. The IGS regions showed many amplified polymorphic bands. Nine isolates which revealed high RFLP polymorphism in the abovementioned regions (16S rRNA, IGS, DnaK) were used for 16S rRNA sequence analyses. The results indicate that taxonomically, all isolates were related to Rhizobium etli, Bradyrhizobium spp., and Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense. The doubling time of isolates varied from 9 h (MPSR155) to 16.2 h (MPSR068) in YM broth. Five isolates which did not show cross infectivity with isolated phage strains were studied for symbiotic efficiency. All isolates showed broad host range symbiotic effectiveness forming effective nodules on Vigna mungo, Vigna radiata, Vigna unguiculata, and Cajanus cajan. The present study provides information on genetic diversity and host range symbiosis of indigenous soybean rhizobia typed by different phages.","[Jaiswal, Sanjay Kumar; Anand, Akhil; Dhar, Banshi; Vaishampayan, Akhouri] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Microbiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India","Jaiswal, SK (reprint author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Microbiol Lab, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sanjaysiswa@gmail.com,,"JAISWAL, SANJAY/0000-0003-2745-9949","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New DelhiDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaGovernment of India [BT/PR7251/AGR/21/209/2006]","This work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, (grant no.

Root colonization and spore biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from different altitudes were analyzed. Of the 146 plant species representing 45 families investigated, 72.2% of plant species were colonized by AMF and formed typical AM structures. A broad range of AM fungal taxa, 62 taxa representing all 4 orders of AMF were isolated from the soil. The composition of the AMF spore community was quite different at different positions along the elevation gradient. Some AM fungi, such as Scutellospora, preferred some specific elevations, or a range of elevation. Intensity of root colonization (M%) and spore density were negatively correlated with the altitude of the study sites. Species richness showed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation but the Shannon-Weiner index was unaffected by elevation. Isolate frequency and relative abundance of AMF also showed quite different distribution patterns among taxonomic families. The drivers of these changes in the AM fungal assemblages is not known and cannot be determined conclusively using such a comparative study along an environmental gradient. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Based on fossil data, this event probably occurred some 480-430 million years ago, during the Ordovician and the early Silurian and initiated the explosive evolution that led to the modern diversity of photosynthetic organisms living on Earth. The chronological steps are still puzzling, but the great advances in genetics have allowed some of them to be positioned on the time axis. Chloroplastic organisms evolving towards terrestrialization have had to solve many problems: limited water supply, scarcity of mineral and especially phosphorus, harmful effect of ultraviolet and cosmic rays, pronounced fluctuations of temperature and attacks from new and diversified microbes. Many adaptations, such as the modification of the life cycle (sporophytes, seeds), organ diversification (root and leaves), the appearance of complex phenolic compounds (lignin, flavonoids), vascularization, the accumulation of new compounds (cutin, suberin), the development of specialized cells and the establishment of symbiotic interactions, have all played major roles during the transition from water to land and have resulted in the rich plant biodiversity of today. Some molecular and biochemical aspects putatively associated with land plant emergence are summarized here. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Methods Soil C, N and fine root (< 2 mm) stocks were determined from soil cores. Above ground biomass, C and N stocks were estimated from biomass clipping, inventory and allometric biomass equations developed for ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.) in the 5-year-old forest plantation. Results Five years after grassland afforestation, the mean fine root stock of 0.31 kg m(-2) in the forest was about half that of 0.64 kg m(-2) in the grassland. This decrease was offset by an additional gain of 0.36 kg m(-2) in tree biomass since afforestation. The above- to below ground biomass ratio shifted from 0.20 in the grassland to 1.59 in the forest. From May to October, mean net N mineralization was significantly lower in the forest compared to the grassland. Soil C and N concentrations in the 0-10 cm soil layer were significantly higher in the forest (62 mg C g(-1); 5.7 mg N g(-1)) compared to the grassland (45 mg C g(-1); 3.6 mg N g(-1)). However, the bulk density in the upper forest soil layer was lower than in the grassland. As a result, no differences existed between the respective total (0-30 cm depth) soil C and N stocks. Total ecosystem C and N storage was also similar for the forest (9.5 kg C m(-2); 0.75 kg N m(-2)) and the grassland (9.3 kg C m(-2); 0.77 kg N m(-2)). Conclusions A significant change in total ecosystem C and N following afforestation of this intensively managed grassland was not observed. Nevertheless, this study highlights immediate implications from such land-use change activities on biomass, C and N reallocation among the above- and belowground ecosystem pools which may subsequently affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles.","[Peichl, Matthias; Leava, Natalie Anne; Kiely, Gerard] Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Hydrol Micrometeorol & Climate Change, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Peichl, Matthias] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Peichl, M (reprint author), Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Hydrol Micrometeorol & Climate Change, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland.",m.peichl@ucc.ie,"Kiely, Gerard/I-8158-2013; Peichl, Matthias/A-2087-2014","Kiely, Gerard/0000-0003-2189-6427","Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) programme [2008-CCRP-1.1A]; COFORD","This study was financed by: the Science, Technology, Research and Innovation for the Environment (STRIVE) programme 2007-2013 (Grant No. 2008-CCRP-1.1A) which is managed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and the COFORD funded research project, FORESTC: Soil Carbon Stock Changes and Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Irish Forests (2007-2011).

To better understand the mechanisms and characteristics associated with invasive success, we studied competition between two Acer species. In a greenhouse, we tested (1) the effect of forest soil type (beneath an invasive and native stand) on seedling growth of the invasive Acer platanoides (Norway maple) and native A. rubrum (red maple), and the (2) effects of full (above-and below-ground) and partial inter-specific competition on species growth. We found A. rubrum growth was negatively affected by soil from the invaded stand, as it had lower above-ground (32%) and below-ground (26%) biomass, and number of leaves (20%) than in the native soil. The root: shoot resource allocations of A. platanoides depended on soil type, as it had 14% greater root: shoot mass allocation in the native soil; this ability to change root: shoot allocation may be contributing to the ecological success of the species. Widely published as having a large ecological amplitude, A. rubrum may be a useful species for ecological restoration where A. platanoides has been present, but the impacts of A. platanoides on soil functioning and subsequent plant interactions must be addressed before protocols for native reintroductions are improved and implemented.","[Galbraith-Kent, Shannon L.] Thomas More Coll, Dept Biol, Crestview Hills, KY 41017 USA; [Galbraith-Kent, Shannon L.] Rutgers State Univ, Grad Program Ecol & Evolut, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Handel, Steven N.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Galbraith-Kent, SL (reprint author), Thomas More Coll, Dept Biol, Crestview Hills, Crestview Hills, KY 41017 USA.",Shannon.galbraith-kent@thomasmore.edu,,,SLG-K through New Jersey Forestry Foundation; Garden Club of America; Duke Farms Foundation,"We thank John Dighton, Claus Holzapfel, Mikael L.

We conducted a laboratory experiment to determine the effects of soil frost on C and N fluxes from forest floor soils during snowmelt. Soil cores were collected from a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and a red spruce (Picea rubens)-balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, U.S.A. Soils were exposed to one of three temperature treatments, including severe (-15 degrees C), mild (-0.5 degrees C), and no soil frost (+5 degrees C) conditions. After one week the soils were incubated at +5 degrees C and snow was placed on top of the soils to simulate spring snowmelt. NO3- losses were up to 5.5 mg N kg(-1) soil greater in the mild soil frost treatment than the severe soil frost treatment. Net losses of NH4+ and DON in leachate were up to 19 and 18 mg N kg(-1) soil greater in the no soil frost and mild soil frost treatments, respectively, than the severe soil frost treatment. In contrast, soil frost did not have a significant impact on dissolved organic C or cumulative gaseous fluxes of C and N throughout the snowmelt period. However, the total cumulative flux of C (i.e. dissolved organic C + CO2 + CH4) and N (i.e. dissolved organic N + NH4 + NO3 + N2O) in the severe soil frost treatment were between one quarter and one half that observed in the no soil frost treatment for both forest types. Together, the results of this study show that total fluxes of N in leachate, as well as total cumulative C and N fluxes (gases + leachate), were significantly reduced following severe soil frost. We conclude that the extent to which C and N cycling during snowmelt is altered in response to changes in winter climate depend on both the presence and severity of soil frost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To explain the unique susceptibility of yellow-cedar in contrast to co-occurring species, yellow-cedar roots would need to be less cold tolerant and/or more concentrated in upper soil horizons that are prone to freezing. We measured the root cold tolerance and used concentrations of foliar cations as an assay of rooting depth for five species in one forest in Ketchikan, Alaska. Species evaluated were yellow-cedar, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Roots were collected in November 2007 and January, March and May 2008; foliage was collected in January 2008. Soil samples from surface and subsurface horizons were analyzed for available calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al) to compare with foliar cation concentrations. Across all dates the sequence in hardiness from the least to most cold tolerant species was (1) yellow-cedar, (2) western redcedar, (3) western and mountain hemlock, and (4) Sitka spruce. Yellow-cedar and redcedar roots were less cold tolerant than roots of other species on all sample dates, and yellow-cedar roots were less cold tolerant than redcedar roots in January. Yellow-cedar roots were fully dehardened in March, whereas the roots of other species continued to deharden into May. Yellow-cedar roots exhibited the highest electrolyte leakage throughout the year, a pattern that suggests the species was continuously poised for physiological activity given suitable environmental conditions. Yellow-cedar and redcedar had higher foliar Ca and lower Al concentrations, and greater Ca:Al ratios than the other species. Yellow-cedar had higher foliar Ca and Ca:Al than redcedar. Soil measurements confirmed that the upper horizon contained more extractable Ca, less Al and higher Ca:Al than the lower horizon. Considering the distribution of Ca and Al in soils, we propose that concentrations of Ca and Al in yellow-cedar and redcedar foliage reflect a greater proportional rooting of these species in upper soil horizons compared to other species tested. Greater Ca and Ca:Al in the foliage of yellow-cedar suggests shallower rooting compared to redcedar, but broad similarities in foliar cation profiles for these species also highlight some overlap in rooting niche. Our data indicate that both limited root cold tolerance and shallow rooting likely contribute to the unique sensitivity of yellow-cedar to freezing injury and decline relative to sympatric conifers.

However, in diverse mixed forest stands we expect tree species specific responses to water shortage, as tree species are highly variable in rooting depth and physiological traits related to the water balance. Here, we assessed the drought sensitivity of the water relations of six deciduous forest tree species at four sites with contrasting water availability by airborne thermal imagery of canopy foliage temperature, sap flow and soil water potential. Canopy architecture had a consistent influence on canopy foliage temperature with 'dense canopy' species (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fagus sylvatica and Tilia platyphyllos) being warmer (0.5-1.5 K) than 'open canopy' species (Fraxinus excelsior, Prunus avium and Quercus petraea). While the canopy foliage was close to air temperature at the beginning of the drought period (Delta TC-A = -0.1 to 0.7 K) it strongly warmed up with ongoing drought, especially at the two 'dry' sites with a Delta TC-A of 3.5-5K. The pronounced canopy foliage warming at the 'dry' sites after 22 days of drought was associated with reduced transpiration rates as sap flow was curtailed by 20-35% in all species except F. excelsior and Q. petraea. Based on canopy foliage temperature and sap flow data, we considered A. pseudoplatanus the most drought sensitive species followed by F. sylvatica, T. platyphyllos and P. avium and the two ring-porous species F. excelsior and Q petraea being clearly the least sensitive ones. At drier sites, increasing summer temperatures and drought might change the competitive abilities of tree species in favour of those that are able to maintain transpirational fluxes and cooler canopies such as F. excelsior and Q petraea.

These soil conditions in turn can influence plant growth conditions, which is called plant-soil feedback. Plant-soil feedback is known to be operative in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from temperate grasslands to tropical rain forests. However, little is known about how it operates in arid environments. We examined the role of plant-soil feedbacks on tree seedling growth in relation to water availability as occurring in arid ecosystems along the west coast of South America. Methods In a two-phased greenhouse experiment, we compared plant-soil feedback effects under three water levels (no water, 10% gravimetric moisture and 15% gravimetric moisture). We used sterilized soil inoculated with soil collected from northwest Peru (Prosopis pallida forests) and from two sites in north-central Chile (Prosopis chilensis forest and scrublands without P. chilensis). Important Findings Plant-soil feedbacks differed between plant species and soil origins, but water availability did not influence the feedback effects. Plant-soil feedbacks differed in direction and strength in the three soil origins studied. Plant-soil feedbacks of plants grown in Peruvian forest soil were negative for leaf biomass and positive for root length. In contrast, feedbacks were neutral for plants growing in Chilean scrubland soil and positive for leaf biomass for those growing in Chilean forest soil. Our results show that under arid conditions, effects of plant-soil feedback depend upon context. Moreover, the results suggest that plant-soil feedback can influence trade-offs between root growth and leaf biomass investment and as such that feedback interactions between plants and soil biota can make plants either more tolerant or vulnerable to droughts. Based on dissecting plant-soil feedbacks into aboveground and belowground tissue responses, we conclude that plant-soil feedback can enhance plant colonization in some arid ecosystems by promoting root growth.","[Meijer, Seline S.; Holmgren, Milena] Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Meijer, Seline S.] Univ Coll Dublin, Agr & Food Sci Ctr, Univ Coll Dublin Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Meijer, Seline S.] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Holmgren, M (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",Milena.Holmgren@wur.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",Foundation for Research on Nature Conservation [S072.65]; Dutch NWO Meervoud [836.05.021]; NWO ALW-ViciNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [865.05.002],"This work was financed by a Foundation for Research on Nature Conservation (S072.65) grant to S.S.M., a Dutch NWO Meervoud (836.05.021) grant to M.H. and a NWO ALW-Vici (865.05.002) grant to W.H.v.d.P.",,46,8,8,1,97,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

However, there is a gap of knowledge on interactive effects of functionally dissimilar organisms on plant communities that is needed to be filled to better understand and predict the general impact of biotic factors on plant communities. Methods We conducted a full-factorial mesocosm study to investigate the individual and combined impacts of above-and belowground functionally dissimilar organisms on a grassland plant community. We studied the effects of aboveground herbivores (Helix aspersa, Gastropoda), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomus spp., Glomero-mycota) and endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea spp., Lumbricidae) on the diversity, structure and productivity of an experimental grassland plant community and each other. Important Findings Aboveground herbivory by snails decreased, AMF increased and earthworms had no effects on the diversity of the grassland plant community, while their combined effects were additive. The biomass of the plant community was negatively affected by snails and AMF, while no effects of earthworms or interaction effects were found. The plant species were differently affected by snails and AMF. No effects of the above-and belowground organisms on each other's performance were detected. Since the effects of the functionally dissimilar organisms on the grassland plant community were mainly independent, the results indicate that their combined effects may be predicted by knowing the individual effects, at least under the conditions used in the present mesocosm study.","[Wurst, Susanne; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Wurst, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",s.wurst@fu-berlin.de,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",,,,44,11,11,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,,,J PLANT ECOL-UK,J.

The preference for N forms was tested using three pine species (Pinus densata, Pinus tabuliformis and Pinus yunnanensis). Pinus densata is a natural diploid hybrid between P. tabuliformis and P. yunnanensis. Methods Seedlings of three pine species were supplied with nitrate-N, ammonium-N (at two different pH regimes) or combined ammonium and nitrate as a nitrogen source in perlite culture in a controlled environment. Important Findings Seedlings of P. densata had higher total biomass and net photosynthesis when supplied with nitrate-N and ammonium nitrate than with ammonium-N. In parental species, total biomass and net photosynthesis for P. yunnanensis seedlings was higher in ammonium-N than in nitrate-N, whereas the other parental species P. tabuliformis had the highest total biomass among species for all treatments except ammonium with CaCO3. Most morphological traits in P. densata seedlings were intermediate between its two parental species. However, N-use efficiency and photosynthetic N-use efficiency of P. densata significantly exceeded both parents when supplied with nitrate-N and ammonium nitrate. The results suggested that the diploid hybrid tree species P. densata has a preference for nitrate and is not well adapted to ammonium-N as a sole nitrogen source regardless of the growth medium pH. Based on changes in environmental conditions, such as predicted future temperature increases in high altitude areas associated with climate change, P. densata is likely to be increasingly competitive and have wide adaptation in high altitude regions.","[Yao, Buqing; Cao, Jing; Zhao, Changming] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Rengel, Zed] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Cao, J (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",caojng@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30671666]; Ministry of Education, People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Education, China","This study has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no: 30671666) and University Key Teacher funds from the Ministry of Education, People's Republic of China.",,51,5,12,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,,,J PLANT ECOL-UK,J.

Soil CO2-efflux rates in situ were correlated with key soil biotic (e.g., fungal, bacterial, and actinomycetes populations) and abiotic (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, pH, organic C) variables. Two kinds of measurement plots were selected: one under the crown of a living Populus euphratica tree and the other under a dead standing Populus euphratica tree. Diurnal variations in soil respiration in these plots were measured both before and after the occurrence of the first frost. Soil respiration of the dead standing Populus euphratica (Rd) was assumed to be a measure of heterotrophic respiration rate (Rh), and root respiration rate (Rr) was estimated as the difference between soil respiration under living (Rl) minus soil respiration under dead standing Populus euphratica. Daily variation of Rr contribution to the total soil respiration in Populus euphratica forests were analyzed before and after the frost. The contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration before and after frost varied from 22% to 45% (mean 30%) and from 38% to 50% (mean 45%), respectively. In addition, Rh was significantly correlated with soil temperature both before and after frost. In contrast, Rr was not significantly correlated with soil temperature. Change in Q10 of Rr was different from that of Rh from before the frost to after the frost. Variation of Q10 of Rr from before the frost to after the frost was larger than that of Q10 of Rh. Thus, the results indicate that different soil respiration models are needed for Rr and Rh because different factors control the two components of soil respiration.","[Zhao, ZhiMin; Zhao, ChengYi; Mu, YiliHa; Yu, Sheng; Li, Jun] Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Oasis Ecol & Desert Environm, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zhao, ZhiMin] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Zhao, CY (reprint author), Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Oasis Ecol & Desert Environm, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",zcy@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,National 973 ProjectNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB421302]; National Project [2007BAC03A0604]; Key National Natural Science Foundation [40830640],"The study was supported by the National 973 Project (2009CB421302), the National Project (2007BAC03A0604), and the Key National Natural Science Foundation (40830640).

The species is widely used for afforestation because of its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. In this study, genetic diversity of rhizobia isolated from black locust nodules and spatial distribution of their genotypes were examined. From a coastal forest, six black locust saplings including the whole root systems were collected and positions of nodules on the roots were recorded. Bacteria were isolated from each nodule and then genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Dendrogram analysis based on PCR-RFLP and sequencing analysis indicated that Mesorhizobium species dominantly colonized black locust roots in this forest, occupying at least 77% of living nodules. Positions and PCR-RFLP genotypes of the nodules revealed that rhizobia isolated from neighbouring nodules tended to have the same genotype in some cases. Statistical analysis has supported this fact. The clustering distribution of nodules in the same RFLP groups should be considered to contribute to the large genetic diversity of rhizobia.","[Shiraishi, Ayami; Komatsu, Masabumi; Matsushita, Norihisa; Hogetsu, Taizo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Shiraishi, A (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",ayamis@hawaii.edu,,"Komatsu, Masabumi/0000-0003-4826-4219","Japan Society of the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Dr. Takahide Ishida, a postdoctoral fellow at the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, and Sakie Nohara from the Chiba Prefectural Forestry Research Center, for their assistance.

After germination in agar medium, tea seedlings together with medium were placed on agar containing 0.4 mM Al with 0.2% hematoxyline (hematoxylin-Al medium). The purple color of the hematoxylin-Al medium was observed to fade gradually, until none of the color remained 6 days later. The tea seedlings were then treated with simple calcium solution (0.2 mM, at pH 4.2) containing AlCl(3), which ranged-in concentration from 0 to 0.8 mM, for 24 hrs. The amount of oxalate secreted into the medium increased as the external Al concentration increased, while the concentrations of malate and citrate in the medium remained unchanged. Oxalate secretion started within 30 min after Al exposure and increased linearly thereafter. The findings demonstrated that oxalate was a key compound in the Al-tolerance mechanism employed by the tea plant, which detoxifies Al(3+) externally in the rhizosphere. In addition to oxalate, caffeine was also secreted by tea roots in response to Al exposure. It is possible that caffeine excretion from the roots of tea plants may stimulate root growth through the inhibition of callose deposition in root tips.","[Morita, Akio; Yanagisawa, Osamu; Maeda, Setsuko; Takatsu, Satoshi; Ikka, Takashi] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Funct Plant Physiol, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan","Morita, A (reprint author), Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Funct Plant Physiol, 836 Ohya, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan.",aamorit@ipc.shizuoka.ac.jp,,"Ikka, Takashi/0000-0002-1845-5658",,,,34,26,30,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Karst.] and their influence on diameter and height growth of underplanted beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) saplings were studied on experimental plots in the Soiling Mountains (Germany). The aims of this study were to investigate how overstory fine root density varies with stand density, and how it influences growth of the underplanted saplings to changes in belowground resources availability in connection with simultaneously changing light availability. Most fine roots were concentrated in the humus layer (more than 45%) and in the top mineral soil (0-5 cm, about 15%). Fine root biomass increases with overstory basal area and decreases with rising distance from the nearest overstory tree, reaching about zero within ca. 8 m distance. Over the whole two-year study period, light availability alone was the decisive factor for growth of the beech saplings (5 resp. 6 years of age) while growth of the Douglas-fir saplings in the first study year (6 years of age) was additionally affected by a shortage of belowground resources due to root competition in a season with less than average rainfall. This species-specific response of underplanted saplings to changes in above and belowground resources is of silvicultural importance for the establishment of a mixed stand beneath a mature canopy: the more sensitive Douglas-fir should be planted on the central parts of openings with little or none belowground competition while the less sensitive beech can be placed below the denser parts of the overstory.","[Petritan, I.

In this contribution we hypothesize that species with higher resprouting vigour will show a larger enhancement of photosynthesis in resprouting shoots. We test this hypothesis by comparing gas exchange and leaf parameters between resprouting and mature plants in Erica scoparia and E. australis. These two Erica species co-occur in Mediterranean heathlands of the Strait of Gibraltar. Erica scoparia has a higher rate of post-disturbance starch recovery than E. australis, which makes it more resistant to recurrent disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that enhancement of photosynthesis and water use characteristics of resprouting shoots compared with mature plants should be more pronounced in E. scoparia. In both species, resprouts had higher efficiency in the use of light and higher maximum net photosynthesis than mature shoots. However, contrary to expectations, differences in the photosynthetic performance between resprouts and mature plant shoots were larger in E. australis. Higher root to shoot ratios in resprouting E. australis plants, determined by their slower above-ground recovery, together with stronger demand from carbon sinks might explain this result.","[Goorman, Roald; Bartual, Ana; Ojeda, Fernando] Univ Cadiz, Dept Biol, Puerto Real 11510, Spain; [Paula, Susana] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Tierra & Evoluc, Valdivia, Chile","Ojeda, F (reprint author), Univ Cadiz, Dept Biol, Campus Rio San Pedro, Puerto Real 11510, Spain.",fernando.ojeda@uca.es,"Ojeda, Fernando/L-1626-2014","Ojeda, Fernando/0000-0001-5480-0925; Bartual Magro, Ana/0000-0003-2382-6393","Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [BOS2002-00609, AGL2005-07440-C02-02/FOR]","The authors thank Marco Antonio Tena, former director of Los Alcornocales Natural Park, for kindly providing facilities for field work; Mike Scott, Mike Lawes and two anonymous reviewers for assisting with the English grammar and also providing useful comments on the manuscript.

To do this we sampled roots < 2 mm in diameter for 5 soil pits equidistant between two coexisting species, a shrub and a grass. Using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of fine roots we determine both photosynthetic pathway and rooting depth. We also examine the distribution of soil moisture and nitrogen relative to root biomass. Our results for root biomass and stable isotope ratios of fine roots demonstrate both niche separation and competition for resources. Root biomass is highest at the top of the profile where soil nitrogen is highest and soil moisture is lowest. We conclude that while there is competition for resources in the middle of the profile, competition is mitigated by photosynthetic pathway. The facultative CAM shrub grows whenever the soil at the surface is wet enough. The C-4 photosynthetic pathway of the grass is more nitrogen and water use efficient making it better adapted to the low nitrogen in the middle of the profile and low summer rainfall.","[February, Edmund Carl; Shabane, Tirello; Hattas, Dawood] Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Allsopp, Nicky] S African Environm Observat Network, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa","February, EC (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Edmund.February@uct.ac.za,,"Hattas, Dawood/0000-0003-4699-3055",BIOTA Southern Africa; German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01 LC 0024A]; South Africa NRF; Mellon Foundation,Funding from BIOTA Southern Africa sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under promotion number 01 LC 0024A is acknowledged.

For analysis individual barley root segments were obtained by the gradual cutting of each root from the tip to the base 1, 2, 3 or 6 h after short-term treatments. Already a short 30 min exposure of barley roots to Cd induced significant root growth inhibition in a Cd concentration dependent manner, which was accompanied by a marked reduction of AAO activity. At Cu concentration which had no effect on the root growth a significant increase in AAO activity was observed. This increased AAO activity was detected only in ionically-bound CW fraction. In contrast, Cu at higher concentration and IAA inhibited both ionically-bound CW AAO isozymes. Prompt inhibition of AAO activity immediately after short-term treatment was observed only in the case of H(2)O(2) treatment suggesting that H(2)O(2) may act as an inhibitor of AAO. This was further supported by the observation that all Cd-, Cu- or IAA-induced root growth and AAO activity inhibition in barley roots was connected with an elevated production of H(2)O(2).","[Zelinova, Veronika; Haluskova, L'ubica; Mistrik, Igor; Tamas, Ladislav] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Bot, SK-84523 Bratislava, Slovakia","Tamas, L (reprint author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dubravska Cesta 9, SK-84523 Bratislava, Slovakia.",Ladislav.Tamas@savba.sk,,"Liptakova, Lubica/0000-0003-0269-2314",Grant agency VEGAVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [2/0050/10],"We wish to thank Margita Vaskova for excellent technical assistance.

In this work, a pilot-scale (10 m(3) day(-1)) and a demonstration-scale (200 m(3) day(-1)) stratified reactor, containing the aged refuse excavated from an 8-year-old closed landfill cell, were used as a medium by which to treat landfill leachate generated in the Shanghai Refuse Landfill (SRL). The preliminary-treated leachate with initial CODcr, NH(3)-N and total-N concentrations of 2387-8592, 1431-2145 and 1290-2188 mg L(-1), respectively, was intermittently sprayed over the refuse surface eight times a day with 3 h per interval in the pilot study. The results from the pilot operation showed that on average 89.5% of COD, 98.8% of NH(3)-N and 52.6% of total N could be removed from a hydraulic load of 0.267-0.444 m(3) m(-3) refuse day(-1). Additionally, similar results were observed for the demonstration system even with the leachate of low BOD(5)/COD ratios (0.17-0.19). The investment and operational costs of this stratified process were about 20 000 yuan (E2200) and 1-2 yuan (E0.11-0.22) per m(3) leachate treated, respectively. Taken together, the stratified process has some significant advantages including low operation cost, easy maintenance and good adaptability to the leachate of variable quality, which makes this process a viable alternative for the treatment of landfill leachate.","[He, Yan; Huang, Minsheng] E China Normal Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [He, Yan; Zhao, Youcai; Zhou, Gongming] Tongji Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","He, Y (reprint author), E China Normal Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, 3663 N Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",yhe@des.ecnu.edu.cn,,,Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [05DZ12003]; National High-tech R&D Program(863 Program) of China [2007AA06Z349],This work was carried out with financial support from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality for Key Project (No. 05DZ12003) and National High-tech R&D Program(863 Program) of China (No. 2007AA06Z349).,,25,7,10,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0734-242X,,,WASTE MANAGE RES,Waste Manage.

Policy and practice currently in place emphasize water quality and soil stability but do not consider upland soil health. Here we report soil organic carbon (SOC) measurements and other soil quality indicators for reclaimed soils in the Southern Appalachian forest region to quantify the health of the soil ecosystem. The SOC sequestration rate of the MCM soils was 1.3 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) and stocks ranged from 1.3 +/- 0.9 to 20.9 +/- 5.9 Mg ha(-1) and contained only 11% of the SOC of surrounding forest soils. Comparable reclaimed mining soils reported in the literature that are supportive of soil ecosystem health had SOC stocks 2.5-5 times greater than the MCM soils and sequestration rates were also 1.6-3 times greater. The high compaction associated with reclamation in this region greatly reduces both the vegetative rooting depth and infiltration of the soil and increases surface runoff, thus bypassing the ability of soil to naturally filter groundwater. In the context of environmental sustainability of MCM, it is proposed that the entire watershed ecosystem be assessed and that a revision of current policy be conducted to reflect the health of both water and soil.","[Acton, Peter M.; Fox, James F.; Martin, Darren; Bryson, Sebastian] Univ Kentucky, Dept Civil Engn, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Campbell, J.

When fertilized with complex protein N we found increases in N-degrading enzyme concentrations only when root in-growth was allowed. No response was observed when complex N was added to root-free treatments.

The invasive success of A. petiolata has been partly attributed to its production of allelopathic compounds that can limit the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Although such effects are well known, specific effects on the richness and community composition of AMF associated with woody species have not been explored. We collected sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings from eight natural forest sites in Ohio and Massachusetts, containing areas either invaded or uninvaded by A. petiolata. We measured AMF root colonization of seedlings, isolated DNA from the roots and performed PCR-TRFLP analysis to assess the richness and community composition of AMF. As expected, we found reduced AMF colonization in A. petiolata invaded patches. A. petiolata did not alter the detected TRF richness, but was associated with significant changes in the composition of AMF communities in half of the sites monitored in each region. Our results suggest that although AMF colonization was reduced in A. petiolata patches, many indigenous AMF communities include AMF that are tolerant to allelopathic effects of A. petiolata.","[Barto, E.

AITC can disrupt beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with native plant roots, which limits their soil resource uptake. However, AITC and its precursor, sinigrin, have never been detected in garlic mustard-invaded forest soils. Here, we use high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to assess the concentration and bioactivity of these putative allelochemicals in paired forest plots uninvaded or invaded by garlic mustard. Our methods detected AITC and sinigrin only where garlic mustard was present and our recovery of AITC/sinigrin coincided with adult senescence. A bioassay of in situ fungal hyphae abundance revealed significantly reduced hyphal abundance in the presence of garlic mustard relative to uninvaded soils. Finally, the lowest concentration of AITC measured in the field (similar to 0.001 mM) is highly inhibitory to the spore germination of a forest AMF species, Glomus clarum. Together, our data provide the first direct evidence of garlic mustard-produced sinigrin and AITC in forest soils and demonstrate that even low levels of these chemicals have the potential to significantly suppress AMF growth and spore germination, strengthening their status as allelopathic novel weapons.","[Cantor, Aaron; Hale, Alison; Aaron, Justin; Traw, M.

(1) The theory of games with asymmetrical information shows that the right incentives allow hosts to screen-out parasites and screen-in mutualists, explaining successful partner choice in the absence of signalling. Applications range from ant-plants to microbiomes. (2) Contract theory distinguishes two longstanding but weakly differentiated explanations of host response to defectors: host sanctions and partner fidelity feedback. Host traits that selectively punish misbehaving symbionts are parsimoniously interpreted as pre-adaptations. Yucca-moth and legume-rhizobia mutualisms are argued to be examples of partner fidelity feedback. (3) The theory of public goods shows that cooperation in multi-player interactions can evolve in the absence of assortment, in one-shot social dilemmas among non-kin.

We compiled an up-to-date global database covering 186 stands from the literature and estimated fine root production (FRP) and fine root turnover (FRT) for boreal, temperate and tropical forests in order to study the relationships between FRP or FRT and environmental and stand variables. FRP for all plants (trees + understorey) was 311 +/- 259 (n = 39), 428 +/- 375 (n = 71) and 596 +/- 478 g m(-2) a(-1) (n = 32) in the boreal, temperate and tropical forests, respectively, and the corresponding annual FRT rates were 0.77 +/- 0.70, 1.21 +/- 1.04 and 1.44 +/- 0.76, respectively. When the FRP and FRT of trees were estimated separately for boreal and temperate forests the differences between the two biomes were insignificant. The mean FRP of trees for the two biomes combined was 306 240 g m-2 a-1 (n = 86) and the annual FRT was 1.31 +/- 1.43. Fine root biomass (FRB) was the most significant factor explaining the variation in FRP, and more so at the tree level than at the stand level, explaining 53% of the variation in FRP for trees at the tree level. The corresponding proportions at the stand level were 21% for all plants and 12% for trees. Latitude, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation each explained <20% of the variation in FRP or FRT. Fine root production and FRT estimates are highly dependent on the species included in the sampling, the sampling depth and the methods used for estimating FRP or calculating FRT. The results indicate that the variation in FRP on a global scale can be explained to a higher degree if we focus on tree roots separately from the roots of the understorey vegetation and on FRP at the tree level instead of FRP at the stand level or on FRT.

Is the establishment success of newcomer plants enhanced by these soil organisms and their interactions? Methods: We grew a native ruderal plant community composed of different functional groups (grasses, legumes and forbs) in the presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and endogeic earthworms in mesocosms. We introduced seeds of five, mainly exotic, plant species from the same functional groups after a disturbance simulating mowing. The effects of the soil organisms on the native ruderal plant community and seedling establishment of the newcomer plants were assessed. Results: After disturbance, the total above-ground regrowth of the native plant community was not affected by the soil organisms. However, AMF increased plant diversity and shoot biomass of forbs, but decreased shoot biomass of grasses of the native plant community. Earthworms led to a reduction in total root biomass. Establishment of the introduced newcomer plants increased in the presence of AMF and earthworms. Especially, seedling establishment of the introduced non-native legume Lupinus polyphyllus and the native forb Plantago lanceolata was promoted in the presence of AMF and earthworms, respectively. The endogeic earthworms gained more weight in the presence of AMF and led to increased extraradical AMF hyphal length in soil. However, earthworms did not seem to modify the effect of AMF on the plant community. Conclusion: The present study shows the importance of mutualistic soil organisms in mediating the establishment success of newcomer plants in a native plant community. Mutualistic soil organisms lead to changes in the structure and diversity of the native plant community and might promote newcomer plants, including exotic species.","[Wurst, Susanne; Gebhardt, Kristin; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, DCPS, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Wurst, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, DCPS, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",s.wurst@fu-berlin.de; Kr.gebhardt@gmx.de; rillig@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",Freie Universitat Berlin,We thank Veruschka Vender for help with analysing the hyphal length in soil.

In this study, the function of rhizobia in P acquisition from P sources for soybean was studied. Four rhizobial strains were employed to evaluate their phosphate-solubilizing (PS) activity, their ability to mediate pH changes in growth medium for different P sources, and IAA production. A sand culture experiment using different P sources was carried out to characterize P acquisition changes of soybean plants with or without rhizobium inoculation. Rhizospheric acidification in soybean was further analyzed in hydroponics. Our results showed that all the tested rhizobial strains exhibited significant PS activity for different P sources in the order of Ca-P > Al-P > Phy-Pa parts per thousand yenFe-P as indicated by the halo/colony ratio technique and increased Pi percentage in the solid and liquid phases, respectively. Furthermore, all of the rhizobial strains could acidify the growth medium for all P sources except Phy-P, but only three of them produced IAA. Compared to non-nodulated plants, the nodulated plants had greater plant biomass and P content in sand culture for all the tested P sources, especially for Ca-P. Moreover, H+ and total acid exudation was more significantly enhanced in the nodulated plants in hydroponics. Our results suggested that the PS ability of rhizobia is more related to acidification of the growth medium than IAA production. Rhizobium inoculation could enhance P acquisition in soybean, especially on soils where Ca-P is the primary P source, and the primary mechanism for rhizobial-mediated P solubilization appears to be via Pi remobilization of nodulated roots through rhizospheric acidification.","[Qin, Lu; Jiang, Hui; Tian, Jiang; Zhao, Jing; Liao, Hong] S China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Root Biol Ctr, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Liao, H (reprint author), S China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Root Biol Ctr, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hliao@scau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30890132],This research was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30890132).,,63,20,31,2,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2011,349,2-Jan,,,SI,,25,36,,10.1007/s11104-011-0947-z,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,857SE,WOS:000297738400004,,,,,10/31/19J,"De Meyer, SE; van Hoorde, K; Vekeman, B; Braeckman, T; Willems, A",,,,"De Meyer, Sofie E.; van Hoorde, Koenraad; Vekeman, Bram; Braeckman, Tamara; Willems, Anne",,,Genetic diversity of rhizobia associated with indigenous legumes in different regions of Flanders (Belgium),SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rhizobia; Indigenous legumes; Symbiotic genes nodC and nifH; Flanders; Belgium; Bradyrhizobium; Ensifer; Mesorhizobium; Rhizobium; Root nodules,MULTILOCUS SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; LEGUMINOSARUM BIOVAR VICIAE; COMMON NODULATION GENES; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; MEDICAGO-SATIVA; ROOT-NODULES; SP-NOV.; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES; ROBINIA-PSEUDOACACIA; ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA,"We investigated the diversity of rhizobia isolated from different indigenous legumes in Flanders (Belgium). A total of 3810 bacterial strains were analysed originating from 43 plant species. Based on rep-PCR clustering, 16S rRNA gene and recA gene sequence analysis, these isolates belonged to Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer (Sinorhizobium), Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium. Of the genera encountered. Rhizobium was the most abundant (62%) and especially the species Rhizobium leguminosarum, followed by Ensifer (19%), Bradyrhizobium (14%) and finally Mesorhizobium (5%). For two rep-clusters only low similarity values with other genera were found for both the 16S rRNA and recA genes, suggesting that these may represent a new genus with close relationship to Rhodopseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium. Primers for the symbiotic genes nodC and nifH were optimized and a phylogenetic sequence analysis revealed the presence of different symbiovars including genistearum, glycinearum, loti, meliloti, officinalis, trifolii and viciae. Moreover, three new nodC types were assigned to strains originating from Ononis, Robinia and Wisteria, respectively. Discriminant and MANOVA analysis confirmed the correlation of symbiosis genes with certain bacterial genera and less with the host plant. Multiple symbiovars can be present within the same host plant, suggesting the promiscuity of these plants. Moreover, the ecoregion did not contribute to the separation of the bacterial endosymbionts. Our results reveal a large diversity of rhizobia associated with indigenous legumes in Flanders. Most of the legumes harboured more than one rhizobial endosymbiont in their root nodules indicating the importance of including sufficient isolates per plant in diversity studies.

We measured biological and chemical traits of soil beneath live trees or trees recently killed by a mountain-pine-beetle outbreak in a subalpine coniferous forest in the Front Range of Colorado. We focused on the top 5 cm of mineral soil just beneath the O horizon and measured microbial biomass, soil invertebrate abundance and composition, and soil chemical characteristics. With the termination of inputs from rhizodeposition, mycorrhizal fungal turnover and fine root turnover, soil total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at three sites decreased by 38-49% and 26-45%, respectively. Tree mortality was associated with reduced soil microbial biomass but soil nematode and microarthropod densities were unchanged. Nematode trophic structure was altered with an increased proportion of bacterial feeders. Soil inorganic N concentrations were inversely correlated to microbial C:N ratios. Tree death was associated with increased soil pH, a possible loss of calcium (Ca(2+)), but an accumulation of soil inorganic N, largely as NH(4)(+). Our results suggest that forest dieback results in rapid C and N loss from surface mineral soils and that the accumulation of soil inorganic N, the reduction in microbial biomass, and the more bacterial-based soil food web increase the potential of enhanced N loss from affected ecosystems.

The experimental site is located in the south part of the Bukk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary. This forest is a semi-natural stand (Quercetum petraeae-cerris community) without forest management The six treatments established are as follows: three treatments involving detritus removal (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs), two treatments involving detritus duplication (Double Litter, Double Wood) and a control treatment The study intends to present the results of saccharase and arylsulphatase activity examinations. Our hypothesis was that detritus reduction causes significantly greater influence on soil enzyme activities than detritus increase of the same extent. The general purpose of the project is to reveal the connection between modifications of detritus production and changes of climatic conditions and land use. It also studies how the modifications, decreases or increases in detritus production influence organic material content, and physical, chemical or biological processes of soils. Saccharase and arylsulphatase activities were measured three and a half years after the establishment of the plots; thus having enough time for the development of different ecological conditions at our disposal. Significant differences were detectable between the treatments for both enzymes. Two separate groups of treatments could be distinguished. The treatments with additional aboveground inputs (Double Litter, Double Wood) and the control (C) revealed higher activities, while a lower sometimes significantly lower enzyme activity characterized the other three, removal treatments (No Litter, No Roots, No Inputs). As for the Double Litter, Double Wood and Control treatments, no significant difference was detectable, although the latter two revealed higher values of enzyme activities than the former one. We found that soil moisture content was correlated with the two soil enzyme activities, especially that of the arylsulphatase. A much weaker correlation was found between the enzyme activities and soil moisture content in the soils that were wetter and poorer in substrates (No Roots and No Inputs treatments). Seasonal differences also involved the diverse moisture contents, while the effect of temperature could hardly be observed during the examinations (due to the nature of methods). In the case of both enzymes, the highest activities were detected during the wetter period, in spring. The three detritus removal treatments influenced enzyme activities in different ways. As for saccharase, it was the removal of belowground detritus that caused the greatest influence. However, in the case of arylsulphatase, it was the soil moisture content that influenced activity to the greatest extent in detritus removal treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

KX2 trees in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii to predict above- and belowground biomass and the regrowth potential of pollarded trees. Models were used to compare tree growth rates in an experimental agroforestry system with different pollarding frequencies and additions of tree pruning residues as mulch. For all allometric equations, a simple power model (Y = aX(b)) provided the optimal prediction of biomass or regrowth after pollarding. For aboveground biomass components (stem, branches, leaves, and seed and pods), stem diameter alone was the best predictor variable. Stump diameter provided the best prediction of coarse root biomass and aboveground regrowth after pollarding. Predictions of biomass from generalized allometric models often fell outside the 95% confidence intervals of our site-specific models, especially as biomass increased. The combination of pollarding trees once per year plus the addition of tree mulch resulted in the greatest aboveground regrowth rates as well as accumulation of biomass and C in the stump plus coarse roots. Although optimal prediction required the development of site-specific allometric relationships, a simple power model using stem or stump diameter alone can provide an accurate assessment of above- and belowground tree biomass, as well as regrowth potential under specific management scenarios.","[Youkhana, Adel H.; Idol, Travis W.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Coll Trop Agr & Human Resources, Sherman Lab 101, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Youkhana, AH (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Coll Trop Agr & Human Resources, Sherman Lab 101, 1910 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",adel@hawaii.edu; idol@hawaii.edu,,,,,,67,8,10,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Partial genome sequences of 12 isolates were obtained by Roche 454 shotgun sequencing (average 5.3Mb per isolate) and compared with the published sequence of S. medicae WSM 419. Homologous recombination appears to have less impact on the polymorphism patterns of the chromosome than on the chromid pSMED01 and megaplasmid pSMED02. Moreover, pSMED02 is a hot spot of insertions and deletions. The whole chromosome is characterized by low sequence polymorphism, consistent with the high density of housekeeping genes. Similarly, the level of polymorphism of symbiosis genes (low) and of genes involved in polysaccharide synthesis (high) may reflect different selection. Finally, some isolates carry genes that may confer adaptations that S. medicae WSM 419 lacks, including homologues of genes encoding rhizobitoxine synthesis, iron uptake, response to autoinducer-2, and synthesis of distinct polysaccharides. The presence or absence of these genes was confirmed by PCR in each of these 12 isolates and a further 27 isolates from the same population. All isolates had rhizobitoxine genes, while the other genes were co-distributed, suggesting that they may be on the same mobile element. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of Medicago symbionts and in the perspective of population genomics studies.

This study was carried out during two growing seasons (2004-2005) on two typical desert shrub species, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron, co-occurring in the Gurbantonggut Desert (Central Asia), to investigate their hydraulic responses to seasonal variations in water availability. The root distribution was studied by excavating the intact root systems. Leaf-specific apparent hydraulic conductance (K (l)) for the two species was calculated based on leaf water potential (psi (l)) and transpiration rate (T (r)), which were monitored during the growing seasons. T. ramosissima had a deeper taproot (3.1 vs. 2.6 m) and a larger root surface area (3.02 vs. 1.28 m(2)) than H. ammodendron. Combined with a higher psi (l), this meant that it maintained a better water status in general. For the deep-rooting T. ramosissima, the seasonal pattern of its predawn leaf water potential (psi (pd)) was in high accordance with the seasonal changes in soil moisture at a depth of 2.6-2.8 m, which was largely influenced by the upflow of groundwater through capillary ascent, and barely responded to rain events. For the shallow-rooting H. ammodendron, the seasonal pattern of psi (pd) was closely related to soil moisture in the upper layer at a depth of 0-0.2 and 0.6-0.8 m, which was recharged periodically by rain events and responded acutely to rainfall above 5 mm. The two species differed in their maximum transpiration rates (T (rmax)) and psi (pd): in T. ramosissima, T (rmax) gradually dropped with decreasing psi (pd); in H. ammodendron, T (rmax) showed no significant response to psi (pd). For T. ramosissima, the major water resource was groundwater and vadose zone water, and psi (l) contributed significantly to transpiration regulation. For H. ammodendron, the primary water resource was precipitation input, which was not sufficient to keep the psi (l) for this species outside the critical range of leaf shedding in summer. Thus, for these two representative species that share the same habitat, contrasting response strategies to water limitation were observed in relation to water acquisition and root distribution characteristics.","[Xu, Gui-Qing; Li, Yan; Xu, Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 S Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",liyan@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Xu, Hao/Q-3590-2016","Xu, Hao/0000-0003-2976-5667","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40971042, 40725002]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 40971042 and 40725002).

Analysis of these signatures can help to identify many ecological processes involved in the uptake, transport and utilization of different water sources. In August 2003, we collected soil water samples throughout the soil profile from a subalpine shrub ecosystem in Wolong Nature Reserve, West China, along with stem water samples from the two dominant shrub species, Quercus aquifolioides and Salix luctuosa. Stable isotope contents of the different water samples were determined in conjunction with rootlet biomass distribution of each species and soil water content throughout the soil profile. Results indicated that these subalpine non-phreatophytic shrubs utilized soil water primarily from the top 30 cm of the soil profile. Water uptake patterns were significantly positively correlated with rootlet biomass distribution as well as the soil water content profile. Hence, the two shrubs could play an important role in keeping rainwater from entering river channels quickly, thereby reducing risk of flooding.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and ammonia oxidizers (AO) represent key soil microbial groups regulating nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Both utilize soil ammonium-N reserves for N assimilation, whilst the latter, through autotrophic nitrification, drive ammonia oxidation to highlymobile nitrate-N. 2. An incompatible interaction between root symbiotic AM fungi and AO was hypothesized and evaluated in plant-species-rich, N-limited Mediterranean grassland soils. Such an outcome would be manifested in a negative relationship between plant mycotrophy and local soil potential nitrification rates (PNR), a standard functional measure of ammonia-oxidizing activity in soils. 3. In three independent mesocosm experiments, grassland soils that supported monocultures of mycotrophic, as opposed to weakly and non-mycotrophic, plants exhibited significantly lower PNR. Under field conditions in a fourth experiment, we verified that soils from stands of weakly mycotrophic Agrostis capillaris sustained higher PNR than counterparts supporting highly mycorrhizal Prunella vulgaris and Fragaria vesca. 4. Discussion of mycotrophy-related modulation of AO activity centres on whether the observed relationships highlight evidence for either direct competition or a functionally important example of plant-microbial allelopathy. 5. Synthesis. Substantial evidence has been presented confirming (i) plant species identity-related regulation of PNR and (ii) negative relationships between plant mycotrophy and plant species-mediated impact on PNR in N-limited Mediterranean grassland soils. Likely mechanisms (i. e. competition and/or allelopathy) that underpin this functionally significant plant-microbe-soil relationship controlling the fate of ammonium-N require urgent elucidation in N-deficient ecosystems.","[Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Sen, Robin] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Mamolos, Andreas P.; Veresoglou, Demetrios S.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Agr, Lab Ecol & Environm Protect, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece","Veresoglou, SD (reprint author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, John Dalton Bldg,Chester St, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",seby31@zeroone.net,"Veresoglou, Stavros D/D-5087-2011; Mamolos, Andreas/D-5301-2011; Sen, Robin/G-3263-2011","Veresoglou, Stavros D/0000-0001-6387-4109; Mamolos, Andreas/0000-0002-1052-337X; Sen, Robin/0000-0002-1914-2178",Chloros trust,"The authors would like to thank Mr Vasilis Fabrikis, Mr Kostas Athanasiadis, Mr Panagiotis Skederidis and Miss Olga Voulgari for technical support throughout the study and Dr Georgios Menexes for statistical help on the meta-analytical approaches.

It was investigated here in the Zn hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri and the nonaccumulator A. petraea. Plant growth on hydroponic solution allowed us to measure the isotope fractionation between source Zn (with Zn(2+) as dominant form), shoot and root. Zn isotope mass balance yields mean isotope fractionation between plant and source Zn Delta(66)Zn(in-source) of -0.19 +/- 0.20 parts per thousand in the nonaccumulator and of -0.05 +/- 0.12 parts per thousand in-source in the hyperaccurnulator. The isotope fractionation between shoot Zn and bulk Zn incorporated (Delta(66)Zn(shoot-in)) differs between the nonaccumulator and the hyperaccumulator and is function of root-shoot translocation (as given by mass ratio between shoot Zn and bulk plant Zn). The large isotope fractionation associated with sequestration in the root (0.37 parts per thousand) points to the binding of Zn(2+) with a high affinity ligand in the root cell. We conclude that Zn stable isotopes may help to estimate underground and aerial Zn storage in plants and be useful in studying extracellular and cellular mechanisms of sequestration in the root.","[Aucour, A.

Variation in size originates at the seedling stage based on differences in seedling vigour and time of emergence, ensuing asymmetrical intraspecific competition between early- and late-established plants. The effects of the order of seedling emergence on characteristics of barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) were studied. In the first experiment, competition between pairs of plants, one of which was sown and emerged 0, 3, 6 or 12 days earlier than the other, was determined. In the second experiment, competition between two plants that were sown at the same time, but emerged at different times because of variation in seed quality, was determined. Competition decreased plant mass, tillering, height and the number of caryopses per panicle, but not time to earing or root/shoot ratio. Plants that were sown 3 days after the first plants in competing pairs grew to 32% of the size of solitary control plants, with the effect of competition accounting for 40% and asymmetrical competition 28% of the total reduction in size. When a 3-day lag in germination was determined intrinsically, plant size was reduced to 19% of the control, with the effect of competition accounting for 34%, asymmetrical competition 15% and poor intrinsic quality of the plant 32% of the total reduction in size.

In this experiment, we identified several organic acids in the root exudates of watermelon. Chemotaxis and swarming assays were performed to investigate the ability of these organic acids to induce the motility of P. polymyxa SQR-21. Oxalic acid, malic acid and citric acid were present in the root exudates but only the intermediate products in tricarboxylic acid cycle, i.e., malic acid and citric acid, could significantly induce motility in P. polymyxa SQR-21. The maximal inducing ability was obtained with malic acid. Values for malic acid were 3.9 and 1.5 times higher than the control in the chemotaxis assay and the swarming assay, respectively. An in vitro experiment further confirmed that these intermediate products in tricarboxylic acid cycle could promote recruitment to P. polymyxa SQR-21, thereby increasing the population in the rhizosphere. In conclusion, some of the organic acids secreted by roots could play an important role in root colonization of SQR-21.

The symbiosis between Rhizobium galegae and its host plant Galega is an interesting case where the plant species G. orientalis and G. officinalis form effective, nitrogen-fixing, symbioses only with the appropriate rhizobial counterpart, R. galegae bv. orientalis and R. galegae bv. officinalis, respectively. The symbiotic properties of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia are well studied, but more information is needed on the properties of the host plants. The Caucasus region in Eurasia has been identified as the gene centre (centre of origin) of G. orientalis, although both G. orientalis and G. officinalis can be found in this region. In this study, the diversity of these two Galega species in Caucasus was investigated to test the hypothesis that in this region G. orientalis is more diverse than G. officinalis. The amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting performed here showed that the populations of G. orientalis and R. galegae bv. orientalis are more diverse than those of G. officinalis and R. galegae bv. officinalis, respectively. These results support the centre of origin status of Caucasus for G. orientalis at a genetic level. Analysis of the symbiosis-related plant genes NORK and Nfr5 reveals remarkable diversity within the Nfr5 sequence, although no evidence of adaptive evolution could be found.","[Osterman, J.; Chizhevskaja, E.

This study aimed to identify perennial herbaceous legumes with greater resistance to drought stress and explore their adaptive strategies. Ten herbaceous perennial legume species/accessions were grown in deep pots in a sandy, low-phosphorus field soil in a glasshouse. Drought stress was imposed by ceasing to water. A companion M. sativa plant in each pot minimised differences in leaf area and water consumption among species. Plants were harvested when stomatal conductance of stressed plants decreased to around 10% of well watered plants. A range of responses to drought stress were identified, including: reduced shoot growth; leaf curling; thicker pubescence on leaves and stems; an increased root:shoot ratio; an increase, decrease or no change in root distribution with depth; reductions in specific leaf area or leaf water potential; and osmotic adjustment. The suite of changes differed substantially among species and, less so, among accessions. The inter- and intra-specific variability of responses to drought-stress in the plants examined suggests a wide range of strategies are available in perennial legumes to cope with drying conditions, and these could be harnessed in breeding/selection programs.","[Pang, Jiayin; Ward, Phil; Lambers, Hans; Ryan, Megan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Yang, Jiyun] NE Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Pang, Jiayin; Ward, Phil] CSIRO Plant Ind, Ctr Environm & Life Sci, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Pang, Jiayin; Siddique, Kadambot H.

Current estimates of AM fungal distributions are mainly inferred from the individual distributions of plant biomes, and climatic factors. However, dispersal limitation, local environmental conditions,and interactions among AM fungal taxa may also determine local diversity and global distributions. We assessed the relative importance of these potential controls by collecting 14,961 DNA sequences from 111 published studies and testing for relationships between AM fungal community composition and geography, environment, and plant biomes. Our results indicated that the global species richness of AM fungi was up to six times higher than previously estimated, largely owing to high beta diversity among sampling sites. Geographic distance, soil temperature and moisture, and plant community type were each significantly related to AM fungal community structure, but explained only a small amount of the observed variance. AM fungal species also tended to be phylogenetically clustered within sites, further suggesting that habitat filtering or dispersal limitation is a driver of AM fungal community assembly. Therefore, predicted shifts in climate and plant species distributions under global change may alter AM fungal communities.

This study evaluated the direct and interactive effects of three climate change factors-elevated CO2, altered amounts of precipitation, and elevated air temperature-on soil microbial communities from an old-field climate change experiment being conducted at Oak Ridge, TN. Soil microbial community composition and biomass were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and neutral lipid fatty acid composition. We found that the interactive effects of precipitation and temperature treatments, as well as the interactive effects of precipitation and CO2 treatments, had significant impacts on microbial community composition. We found that total soil PLFA concentration, a measure of microbial biomass, was greater in the low-precipitation treatments, especially when low precipitation was combined with ambient CO2 concentrations or ambient temperature. Ordination analysis indicated that temperature was the most significant predictor of shifts in the soil microbial community composition, explaining approximately 12% of the variance in relative abundance of PLFA biomarkers. The elevated-temperature treatment increased the abundance of Firmicutes (low-guanine-cytosine Gram positive) and decreased the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria. Elevated temperature also reduced the abundance of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi PLFA biomarker 16:1 omega 5c and saprophytic fungal PLFA biomarker 18: 2 omega 6,9. Overall, our data indicate that the interactions among climate change factors alter the composition of soil microbial communities in old-field ecosystems, suggesting potential for changes in microbial community function under predicted future climate conditions.","[Gray, Sharon B.; Yermakov, Zhanna; Miller, R.

The objective was to study temporal carbon dynamics, in particular carbon sequestration in the soil and woody biomass production, in common forest management systems in eastern Austria along with stand development. The chronosequence approach was used to substitute time-for-space to enable coverage of a full rotation period in each system. Carbon content was determined in the following compartments: aboveground biomass, litter, soil to a depth of 50 cm, living root biomass and decomposing residues in the mineral soil horizons. Biomass carbon pools, except fine roots and residues, were estimated using species-specific allometric functions. Total carbon pools were on average 143 Mg ha(-1) in the high forest stand (HF) and 213 Mg ha(-1) in the coppice with standards stand (CS). The mean share of the total organic carbon pool (TOC) which is soil organic carbon (SOC) differs only marginally between HF (43.4%) and CS (42.1%), indicating the dominance of site factors, particularly climate, in controlling this ratio. While there was no significant change in O-layer and SOC stores over stand development, we found clear relationships between living biomass (aboveground and belowground) pools and C:N ratio in topsoil horizons with stand age. SOC pools seem to be very stable and an impact of silvicultural interventions was not detected with the applied method. Rapid decomposition and mineralization of litter, indicated by low O-horizon pools with wide C:N ratios of residual woody debris at the end of the vegetation period, suggests high rates of turnover in this fraction. CS, in contrast to HF benefits from rapid resprouting after coppicing and hence seems less vulnerable to conditions of low rainfall and drying topsoil. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Plant water availability depends on the precipitation regime, but also on the physical properties of the soil. Higher survival rates result when seedlings are soil acclimated. Our main goal was to describe the morpho-physiological responses of 6-, 10- and 18-month-old Quercus coccifera seedlings growing in a natural soil (terra rossa) or a standard nursery growing medium, and to assess in the nursery if seedlings growing in natural soil were more resistant to deficit irrigation. The high growth rate achieved after 10-18 months by terra rossa-grown seedlings in contrast with those grown in the nursery substrate suggests that the former were acclimated to the soil. Higher photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were observed in terra rossa seedlings, mainly during the first months. The higher carbon availability may account for the higher root nitrogen concentration in terra rossa-grown seedlings, which could favor their later field growth. Low-watered seedlings showed a certain degree of hardening, since after 18 months, they showed higher A, E, g(s) and lower photoinhibition than well-watered seedlings, likely attributable to the sharp leaf-to-root biomass ratio reduction. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) values were similar to those of well-watered plants and indicated a non-stomatal component as the main factor controlling photosynthesis in these leaves. Eighteen-month-old low irrigated seedlings had the highest mortality. Overall, results suggest that nursery terra rossa-acclimated Q. coccifera seedlings with improved physiological status and hydraulic soil-root continuity would have a higher survival rate in the field.","[Verdaguer, Dolors; Vilagran, Joaquim] Univ Girona, Area Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Girona 17071, Catalunya, Spain; [Lloansi, Sara; Fleck, Isabel] Univ Barcelona, Unitat Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Verdaguer, D (reprint author), Univ Girona, Area Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Campus Montilivi Sn, Girona 17071, Catalunya, Spain.",dolors.verdaguer@udg.edu,"Verdaguer, Dolors/AAB-3213-2019","Verdaguer, Dolors/0000-0002-4422-9195","Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y TecnicaMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN); Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia.

Root diameter distribution (a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 5 mm), root biomass density (RBD), root length density (RLD), soil pH, soil electrical conductivity and dry soil bulk density were measured on soil core samples (217) collected from a trench wall using a 20 x 20-cm grid sampling. Approximately 90% of the RBD (mean +/- standard error: 0.27 +/- 0.027 kg m(-3)) and RLD (1.57 +/- 0.023 cm cm(-3)) occurred in the top 40 cm, decreasing exponentially to a maximum rooting depth of 150 cm. RBD exhibited a vertical spatial structure associated with soil pH (p < 0.05; r(2) = 0.48), and a random lateral distribution. Coefficients of variation (CV) of RBD were high irrespective of orientation (vertical: 79-200%, lateral: 50-236%). The root extinction parameter beta (0.944) for the global model was lower (p < 0.05) than that of woodlands (beta = 0.964-0.976), indicating a shallow root distribution resembling that of grasslands (beta = 0.943). The superficial root distribution indicated subsoil chemical constraints to root growth, while high lateral variability was attributed to sparse vegetation. The findings stress the need to account for both vertical and lateral variability of roots for accurate modelling of water use and productivity on certain artificial ecosystems with sparse vegetation.","[Gwenzi, Willis; Hinz, Christoph] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Gwenzi, Willis; Veneklaas, Erik J.; Bleby, Timothy M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Holmes, Karen W.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Ecohydrol, Sch Environm Syst Engn, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Holmes, Karen W.] Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Phillips, Ian R.] Alcoa World Alumina Australia, Pinjarra, WA 6208, Australia","Gwenzi, W (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway Crawley, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",wgwenzi@yahoo.co.uk,"Hinz, Christoph/I-5455-2014; Veneklaas, Erik J/C-8907-2009","Hinz, Christoph/0000-0003-0691-7402; Veneklaas, Erik J/0000-0002-7030-4056; Gwenzi, Willis/0000-0003-3149-1052",Ex-Australian Centre for Mining Environmental Research; University of Western Australia; University Postgraduate Award (International Student) (UPAIS); Ad-hoc top-up scholarship,"The authors thank the anonymous reviewers whose insightful critique of the manuscript significantly improved it.

Studies related to soil quality are needed in the reserve management plans, which aim to maintain or to improve the environmental sustainability of these areas. Thus, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) in samples of typical soil of that reserve. The quantifcation of propagules of this microbial group that establishes mutualistic symbiosis with most plant species, it is important for assessing the soil quality of the reserve. Three areas inside and one outside the Reserve were set to study, where soil samples were removed at depth 0 to 10 cm, in two seasons, winter 2008 and summer 2009. The samples were sent to the Laboratory of Microbiology of the University of 'Itajuba' for quantification of the following microbiological attributes related to AM fungi: lengths of total and active extra-radical mycelium by the method of induced fluorescence with fluorescein diacetate, density and phenotypic diversity (morphotypes) of spores, percentage and intensity of root colonization. The average results were compared by Duncan 5% and subjected to multivariate analysis. The results showed that the potential for MA fungal inoculum had a higher effect of areas in relation to the studied periods, with greater length of active and total extra-radical mycelium, a higher proportion of active mycelium in relation to the total and a greater diversity of spores in soil from the City Biological Reserve of 'Serra dos Toledos', compared to the outside soil under pasture. The inoculum potential is not directly related to the soil fertility, where that outside the reserve, pasture, despite the best fertility were found smaller values of mycelium and diversity of MA fungal spores.","[Melloni, Rogerio; Guida, Elisa da Costa; de Andrade, Marielle Rezende; Pereira Melloni, Eliane Guimaraes] Univ Fed Itajuba, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil","Melloni, R (reprint author), Univ Fed Itajuba, Av BPS,1303,Bairro Pinheirinho,Caixa Postal 50, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil.",rmelloni@unifei.edu.br; elisaeam@gmail.com; mareleandrade@hotmail.com; elianegp@unifei.edu.br,,,,,,38,1,1,0,15,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

Seed germination ranged from 55 to 66% and remained constant after 6 months of storage under ambient conditions or cold storage. C. odorata seedling morphology was sensitive to irradiation and watering in the nursery growing period. Deep shade reduced seedling biomass and leafiness and increased specific leaf area and root-to-shoot ratio. Water shortage increased root mass ratio and root-to-shoot ratio and decreased leaf mass ratio. Post-transplantation success was favored by weeding, and was the highest for seedlings grown under deep shade and water restrictions.","[Andres, Pilar; Espelta, Josep M.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Salgado, Cloribel] Natl Autonomous Univ Nicaragua UNAN Managua, Multidisciplinary Reg Fac FAREM Esteli, Esteli, Nicaragua","Andres, P (reprint author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Edifici C, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",pilar.andres@uab.cat,"Espelta, Josep M/I-3891-2016","Espelta, Josep M/0000-0002-0242-4988; Andres, Pilar/0000-0002-1290-1864",Catalan Agency for Development and Cooperation (ACCD),"This work was funded by the Catalan Agency for Development and Cooperation (ACCD) and is part of the research project ""Social multicriteria evaluation for the sustainable management and conservation of the Miraflor-Moropotente Protected Terrestrial Landscape"".

Mechanisms facilitating its invasion are not fully understood, including whether associations with mycorrhizal fungi are related to its invasion success. We grew C. orbiculatus in a greenhouse and compared growth responses when mycorrhizal fungi or a fungistatic were added to growth media that was either phosphorus-limiting or non-limiting. Results indicated C. orbiculatus forms association with native endomycorrhizal but not with native ectomycorrhizal fungi regardless of phosphorus level. Plants grown with sufficient phosphorus had significantly higher above-ground morphological and physiological traits but significantly lower root biomass compared to plants grown in low phosphorus conditions. Although above-ground traits did not vary significantly between mycorrhizal versus fungistatic added treatments, root biomass was significantly less in plants inoculated with mycorrhizae compared to plants receiving fungistatic. Under low phosphorus conditions, mycorrhizae appeared to be beneficial to the plant although being mycorrhizal did not fully compensate for insufficient phosphorous in the greenhouse situation where pot size limited soil exploration. Our results suggest that in the presence of mycorrhizae or sufficient phosphorus, C. orbiculatus can respond by preferentially allocating energy to above-ground growth, thus supporting its liana growth form onto trees and allowing the exotic to outcompete native species for light resources. If mycorrhizal fungi aid in acquisition of phosphorus, this association could be related to the invasion success of C. orbiculatus.","[Lett, Carly N.; DeWald, Laura E.] Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA; [Horton, Jonathan] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","DeWald, LE (reprint author), Western Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA.",ldewald@wcu.edu; jhorton@unca.edu,,,NC State University Mountain Research Station,The authors would like to thank the staff at the NC State University Mountain Research Station for the use of their greenhouse and support during this project.

However, many prairie restorations or Conservation Reserve Program sites have been seeded with warm-season grasses, leading to grass-dominated, low-diversity restorations not representative of native grasslands. These dominant grasses are strongly mycotrophic, while many subordinate forb species appear to be less dependent on mycorrhizal symbiosis. Therefore, manipulating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may be useful in promoting establishment and growth of forb species in grass-dominated prairie restorations. To assess the potential role of mycorrhizae in affecting the productivity and community composition of restored tallgrass prairie, we conducted a 4-year field experiment on an 8-year-old grassland restoration at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas, USA. At the initiation of our study, seeds of 12 forb species varying in degree of mycorrhizal dependence were added to established grass-dominated plots. Replicate plots were treated biweekly with a soil drench of fungicide (Topsin-M (R)) over four growing seasons and compared to non-treated control plots to assess the role of AMF in affecting plant species composition, productivity, leaf tissue quality, and diversity in restored tallgrass prairie. Topsin applications successfully reduced mycorrhizal colonization of grass roots to approximately 60-80% relative to roots in control plots. Four years of mycorrhizal suppression reduced productivity of the dominant grasses and increased plant species richness and diversity. These results highlight the importance of mycorrhizae as mediators of plant productivity and community dynamics in restored tallgrass prairie and indicate that temporarily suppressing AMF decreases productivity of the dominant C4 grasses and allows for establishment of seeded forb species.","[McCain, Kathryn N.

Schindl. are two co-dominant species of great importance in reducing soil and water loss and maintaining the distinctive natural scenery of the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. Our aim was to determine the growth and interspecific competition between these species under water stress to facilitate the prediction of community succession and guide the selection of appropriate methods of conservation and use in the area. A pot experiment was designed to investigate the effects of water stress and competition on biomass production and allocation, relative competitive ability and water use efficiency of the two species. Bothriochloa ischaemum (a C-4 perennial herbaceous grass) was planted in the same pot with L. davurica (a C-3 perennial leguminous subshrub) at density ratios of 12: 0, 10: 2, 8: 4, 6: 6, 4: 8, 2: 10, and 0:12. The response of the species to their mutual presence at the different ratios was evaluated at three levels of soil moisture (80%+/- 5% field capacity, FC (HW), 60%+/- 5% FC (MW) and 40%+/- 5% FC (LW)). Indices of aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR) and relative yield totals (RYTs) were calculated from the dry shoot, root and total weight data. Water stress decreased the biomass production by both species whether in monoculture or mixture, but B. ischaemum was more sensitive to water deficit. Across moisture levels, the growth of L. davurica was more adversely affected by mixed planting. Bothriochloa ischaemum had significantly (P<0.05) smaller root: shoot ratios than L. davurica and the root mass of both species tended to increase relative to shoot mass as soil water deficit increased. The aggressivity (A), competitive ratio (CR) and relative yield totals (RYTs) of B. ischaemum were positive across treatments. Bothriochloa ischaemum had much higher CR under each water treatment, but water stress considerably reduced its relative CR while increasing that of L. davurica. The RYT values of the two species indicated some degree of resource complimentarity under both water sufficient and deficit conditions. Our results suggest that it is advantageous to grow the two species together to maximize biomass production. We recommend a mixture ratio of 8: 4 of B. ischaemum to L. davurica because it gave significantly higher RYT and transpiration water use efficiency under deficit water conditions.","[Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] NW A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Huang, Jin; Shan, Lun] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Weizhou] NW A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Fengmin] Lanzhou Univ, MoE Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Xu, BC (reprint author), NW A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Bcxu@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"Xu, Bingcheng/I-5854-2019; Li, Fengmin/K-8740-2012","Xu, Bingcheng/0000-0002-1702-491X; Li, Fengmin/0000-0002-2144-3498",CASDefence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-QN412]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41071339]; International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China [2010DFA91930],"We are particularly grateful to Prof. A.

Furthermore, many strains exhibit a remarkable biotechnological potential. To study the ecosystem function and lifestyle of B. terricola, we analysed the interactions with plants and survival in soil as well as the mechanisms behind it. We used a combination of in vitro and ad planta assays to study Burkholderia-plant interaction and assess the role of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Additionally, DsRed-labelled bacteria were analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to study root colonisation. B. terricola ZR2-12 treatment resulted in enhanced growth of sugar beet plants with a more than doubled biomass relative to the non-treated control. The strain was a remarkable good root coloniser, which was found in rhizosphere as well as endorhiza of sugar beet up to 10 log(10) CFU g(-1). Using CLSM, we observed that ZR2-12 cells form large micro-colonies along the apoplastic spaces of the root. Xylem vessels were colonised by smaller aggregates and single cells, whereas in root tips mainly single cells were present. The colonisation patterns differed strongly between older and younger parts of the roots. PHB production of ZR2-12 (up to 70% (w/w) of cell dry mass) provided a competitive advantage for rhizosphere colonisation. B. terricola ZR2-12 belongs to the plant-associated Burkholderia cluster with biotechnological potential due to its excellent root colonisation and plant growth promotion.","[Gasser, Ilona; Cardinale, Massimiliano; Mueller, Henry; Berg, Gabriele] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Environm Biotechnol, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Heller, Stefanie; Eberl, Leo] Univ Zurich, Inst Plant Biol, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lindenkamp, Nicole; Kaddor, Chlud; Steinbuechel, Alexander] Univ Munster, Inst Mol Mikrobiol & Biotechnol, Munster, Germany","Berg, G (reprint author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Environm Biotechnol, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",gabriele.berg@tugraz.at,"Cardinale, Massimiliano/B-8269-2014","Cardinale, Massimiliano/0000-0003-1421-722X; Berg, Gabriele/0000-0001-9423-3101","fForte-Wissenschafterinnenkolleg ""FreChe Materie""; Austrian Ministry BMVIT; Austrian Ministry BMWFJ; Austrian Ministry BM.W_f; Land Steiermark (Styria, Austria); Austrian Science Foundation (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF)","This research was funded in frame of the fForte-Wissenschafterinnenkolleg ""FreChe Materie"", by the Austrian Ministries BMVIT, BMWFJ and BM.W_f as well as from the Land Steiermark (Styria, Austria) and by a grant of the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) to G.

The chronosequence consisted of three 40-year-old, 48-year-old, 80-year-old, and 143-year-old oak stands, respectively. R(S) measurements were conducted using a Li-8100 soil CO2 flux system from October 2008 to October 2009. Temporal variations of R(S) of all the four forests largely depended on soil temperature of 5 cm depth (T(5)) (R(2) = 0.738-0.825). The mean RS for 40-year-old, 48-yearold, 80-year-old, and 143-year-old forests were 2.37, 2.59, 2.99, and 3.32 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) respectively. Both top soil organic carbon (SOC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) stocks were significantly correlated to R(S) variation, while only significant different LFOC among stands was found. This indicated that cumulated labile organic carbon was a better indicator on R(S) variation, which was further illustrated by a better relationship between R(10) and LFOC than that of R(10) and SOC. We found that the variation of mean R(S) among stands was well correlated with basal area (BA). Marginal correlation between R(S) and fine root biomass (FR) demonstrated the relationship between R(S) and belowground metabolism. We also found total porosity (TP) negatively influenced the mean R(S) and this negative effect may mainly be attributed to the capillary porosity (CP). Forest growth and yield could be contributed to R(S) variation among stands. Forest succession also changed soil labile carbon stock and soil physical properties that influenced the CO(2) efflux.","[Luan, Junwei; Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Luan, Junwei; Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Luan, Junwei] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Wetland, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xueling] Baotianman Nat Reserve Adm, Neixiang 474350, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingxin] W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",luan_jw@yahoo.com.cn; liusr@caf.ac.cn; zhubt110@hotmail.com; jxwang@wvu.edu,"Junwei, Luan/E-2706-2017","Junwei, Luan/0000-0002-3848-4747","China's National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30590383]; China's Ministry of Finance [200804001, 201104006]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2008DFA32070, 2006BAD03A04]; Baotianman National Nature Reserve","We gratefully acknowledge the support from Baotianman National Nature Reserve for field monitoring and sampling, they are Yin Wu, Ye Tian, Xinfang Yang, Xiaojing Liu, and Jiguo Liu.

To our knowledge there are no reports of above-and below-ground production in these forest systems. We quantified litter and fine root production in 6-yr old Schizolobium-based plantation forests (monospecific: MON, mixture: MIX, and agroforestry system: AFS) and in similar to 25-yr old regrowth forest (REG) over 812 months. We used litter traps and ingrowth cores to quantify litter and fine root production, respectively. Annual litter production was significantly lower in Schizolobium-based plantations (mean +/- standard error, MON = 5.92 +/- 0.15, MIX = 6.08 +/- 0.13, AFS = 6.63 +/- 0.13 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) than in regrowth forest (8.64 +/- 0.08 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). Schizolobium-based plantations showed significantly higher litter stock (MON = 7.7 +/- 1.0, MIX = 7.4 +/- 0.1 Mg ha(-1)) than REG (5.9 +/- 1.3 Mg ha(-1)). Total fine root production over an 8-month period was significantly higher in Schizolobium-based plantations (MON = 3.8 +/- 0.2, MIX = 3.4 +/- 0.2, AFS = 2.7 +/- 0.1 Mg ha(-1)) than in REG (1.1 +/- 0.03 Mg ha(-1)). Six-yr old Schizolobium-based plantations and similar to 25-yr old regrowth forests showed comparable rates of litter + fine root production, suggesting that young forest plantations may be an interesting alternative to restore degraded areas due to early reestablishment of organic matter cycling under the studied conditions.","[Vasconcelos, Steel Silva; Reis de Carvalho, Claudio Jose] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Lab Ecofisiol Vegetal, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Leal Silva, Antonio Kledson] Fed Univ Para, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Castro Coimbra Cordeiro, Iracema Maria] Tramontina Belem SA, Belem, Para, Brazil","Vasconcelos, SS (reprint author), Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Lab Ecofisiol Vegetal, Belem, Para, Brazil.",steel@cpatu.embrapa.br,"Vasconcelos, Steel/I-2067-2012","Vasconcelos, Steel/0000-0003-2364-8822",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES; Project Carboagro,"We thank Guilherme Cordeiro for his logistical support and Thiago Sozinho, Carolina Shizue, and Aline Faria, for their field and laboratory assistance.

Trenched plots are an inexpensive but labor-intensive method of separating the R-S flux into its root (autotrophic) and soil (heterotrophic) components. This study tested if various methods of plant suppression in trenched plots affected R-S fluxes, quantified the R-S response to soil temperature and moisture changes, and estimated the heterotrophic contribution to R-S. It was performed in a boreal black spruce (Picea mariana) plantation, using a randomized complete block design, during the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons. Trenched plots had significantly lower R-S than control plots, with differences appearing similar to 100 days after trenching; spatial variability doubled immediately after trenching but then declined throughout the experiment. Most trenching treatments had significantly lower (by similar to 0.5 umol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) R-S than the controls, and there was no significant difference in R-S among the various trenching treatments. Soil temperature at 2 cm explained more R-S variability than did 10-cm temperature or soil moisture. Temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) declined in the control plots from similar to 2.6 (at 5 degrees C) to similar to 1.6 (at 15 degrees C): trenched plots values were higher, from 3.1 at 5 degrees C to 1.9 at 15 degrees C. We estimated R-S for the study period to be 241 +/- 40 g C m(-2), with live roots contributing 64% of Rs after accounting for fine root decay, and 293 g C m(-2) for the entire year. These findings suggest that laborious hand weeding of trenched plot vegetation may be replaced by other methods, facilitating future studies of this large and poorly-understood carbon flux.

Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen decreased but pH increased with increased aridity. Aboveground plant biomass, spore abundance, and colonization of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi also declined as the aridity increased. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were positively correlated with aboveground plant biomass, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore number and root colonization were positively correlated with soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and aboveground plant biomass but were negatively correlated with soil pH. A structural equation model suggested that aridity affected soil organic carbon and total nitrogen by limiting aboveground plant biomass. Aridity exerted a large direct effect and smaller indirect effects (via changes in aboveground plant biomass) on the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Soil pH also directly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance. These results suggest that aboveground plant biomass could be a key factor driving the changes of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance along this aridity gradient in China.

Here we demonstrate that the diversity of belowground plant-associated soil fungi promotes plant productivity and plant coexistence. Using additive partitioning of biodiversity effects developed in plant biodiversity studies, we demonstrate that this positive relationship can be driven by complementarity effects among soil fungi in one soil type and by a selection effect resulting from the fungal species that stimulated plant productivity the most in another soil type. Selection and complementarity effects among fungal species contributed to improving plant productivity up to 82% and 85%, respectively, above the average of the respective fungal species monocultures depending on the soil in which they were grown. These results also indicate that belowground diversity may act as insurance for maintaining plant productivity under differing environmental conditions.","[Wagg, Cameron; van der Heijden, Marcel G.

Allelopathic plant invasion studies have revealed declines in AMF inoculation potential of invaded soils, and lost opportunities for plants to form new AMF associations. Yet, if allelochemicals also kill AMF external hyphae already associated with plant roots, this mutualism disruption should result in physiological stress for native plants. We previously demonstrated that forest soils infested with garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), an allelopathic invader, exhibit reduced fungal hyphal abundance. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that treatment with garlic mustard tissue reduces soil respiration rates and diminishes physiological function of false Solomon's seal (Maianthemum racemosum), an AMF-dependant forest understory native. Treated plants exhibited reduced stomatal conductance and photosynthesis relative to controls, consistent with the proposed loss of AMF function. Such physiological declines, if sustained over several growing seasons, could decrease native understory perennials' growth rates and increase their susceptibility to environmental stresses. These data provide an explicit mechanism that can help explain the loss of established native perennials from invaded mature forests. We propose that the physiological costs of mutualism disruption may be a widespread but previously untested mechanism enhancing the invasion of undisturbed ecosystems by allelopathic species.","[Hale, Alison N.; Tonsor, Stephen J.; Kalisz, Susan] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Hale, AN (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",alison.n.hale@gmail.com,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0958676, IOS 0809171]; Botany-in-Action Fellowship from Phipps Conservatory; Andrew Mellon Pre-doctoral Fellowship; Darbaker/Pape grants from the Pymatuning Laboratoy of Ecology (PLE); Sigma-Xi Grants-in-Aid of Research","This research was supported by NSF award DEB 0958676 to SK, NSF award IOS 0809171 to SJT, and by a Botany-in-Action Fellowship from Phipps Conservatory, an Andrew Mellon Pre-doctoral Fellowship, Darbaker/Pape grants from the Pymatuning Laboratoy of Ecology (PLE), and a Sigma-Xi Grants-in-Aid of Research to AH.

Thus, wind-induced mechanical perturbation (MP) and soil water availability are likely to interact to affect plant growth. Since high water availability and MP can induce responses that are in the opposite direction, we hypothesized that MP effects on perennial grasses might be mitigated by increased soil water availability in the Mu Us Sandland. We counducted an experiment in which seedlings of Psammochloa villosa were subjected to two levels of MP (non-MP vs. MP 1 min d(-1)) and two levels of water availability (200 ml d(-1) vs. 400 ml d(-1)) and measured three plant traits. MP significantly decreased plant height, total biomass, and root/shoot ratio. There were significant interactions between MP and soil water availability on plant height and root/shoot ratio. These findings imply that MP alone is a stressful factor for P. villosa and MP effects on its growth can be partially mitigated by increased soil water availability, and also suggest that P villosa may respond to MP in a way that allows plants to survive in the windy semiarid environments.

A growing body of evidence suggests that this asymmetrically diurnal warming has great impacts on aboveground ecological processes. However, little is known about the effect of the asymmetrically diurnal warming on belowground biotic organisms. This study was conducted as part of a field manipulative experiment with day (6:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.), night (6:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m.) and diurnal warming (24 h) in a temperate steppe, to assess shifts in soil microbial community composition and physiology in response to asymmetrically diurnal warming. Our results show that contrasting hydrothermal conditions of the two experimental years (2006-2007) reshaped microbial community structure and modified C use patterns in the grassland ecosystem. Consistent with our hypothesis, day and night warming had different effects on some specific microbial groups and microbial C utilization potential. Significant reductions in the relative proportion of total bacteria, gram-positive bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and microbial C utilization potential, were observed under conditions of night warming only. The close association of microbial C utilization patterns with ecosystem C exchange and coupled responses of plant and microbe to night warming highlight physiological continuity in plant microbe soil system.

To this end, we studied the root-shoot allometry of trees and its dependence on site conditions. Along a gradient in water supply in Southern Germany from dry to moist sites we selected 43 Norway spruce trees (Picea abies [L.] H. Karst.) aged 65-100 years. Increment cores were taken from stem and main roots revealing aboveground and belowground growth course over the last 34 years. Annual growth rates in roots and stems and their allometric relationships were applied as surrogate variables for tree resource allocation to aboveground and belowground organs. The mean sensitivities of both stem and root chronologies were found to be site-specific, and increased from the moist through the dry sites. No temporal offset between aboveground and belowground growth reactions to climate conditions was found in Norway spruce at any of the sites. These results suggest that the root-shoot allometry depends on the specific site conditions only at the driest site, following the optimal biomass partitioning theory (the more restricted the water supply, the more organic matter allocation into the belowground organs).","[Nikolova, Petia Simeonova; Zang, Christian; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Zang, Christian] Univ Appl Sci Weihenstephan, Fac Forestry, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Nikolova, PS (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",nikolova@wzw.tum.de,"Zang, Christian/G-6291-2013; Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Zang, Christian/0000-0002-9843-854X; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868","Technische Universitat Munchen, Life Science Centre; Bavarian State Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (board of trustees of the Bavarian State Institute of Forestry LWF) [E 45]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG)","The authors would like to thank the communicating editor and four anonymous reviewers for their helpful contributions for improving the previous version of this manuscript.

To examine the relationship between C and N for soil microbial dynamics and N dynamics, we conducted long-term laboratory incubation (150 days) after C and N amendment and measured changes in C and N mineralization, microbial biomass C, and dissolved C and N throughout the incubation period. The study soil was volcanic immature soil from the southern part of Japan, which contains lower C and N compared with other Japanese forest soils. Despite this, the area is covered by well-developed natural and plantation forests. Carbon amendment resulted in an increase in both microbial biomass and respiration, and net N mineralization decreased, probably due to increasing microbial immobilization. In contrast, N amendment resulted in a decrease in microbial respiration and an increase in net N mineralization, possibly due to decreased immobilization by microbes. Amendment of both C and N simultaneously did not affect microbial biomass and respiration, although net N mineralization was slightly increased. The results suggested that inhibitory effect on microbial respiration by N amendment should be reduced if carbon availability is higher. Thus, soil available C may limit microbial biomass and respiration in this volcanic immature soil. Even in immature soil where C and N substrate is low, soil C, such as plant root exudates and materials from above- and belowground dead organisms, might help to maintain microbial activity and N mineralization in this study site.","[Yamasaki, Ayaka; Tateno, Ryunosuke] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Agr, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Shibata, Hideaki] Hokkaido Univ, No Forestry Res & Dev Off, Forest Res Stn, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Nayoro, Hokkaido 0960071, Japan","Tateno, R (reprint author), Kagoshima Univ, Fac Agr, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan.",tateno@agri.kagoshima-u.ac.jp,"Shibata, Hideaki/N-9974-2019; Shibata, Hideaki/A-6909-2008","Shibata, Hideaki/0000-0002-8968-3594; Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19380078, 20780120]","We would like to thank technical staffs of Takakuma experimental forest of Kagoshima University and Nayoro station of Field Science Research Center of Hokkaido University, and the members of Laboratory of Silviculture, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagoshima University for support of fieldworks and chemical analysis.

In Ireland, managed Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) forests account for 52.3% of the total forest estate. To determine the stock and decay dynamics of above and belowground CWD, field surveys using fixed area sample plots, were conducted in six even-aged Sitka spruce stands, representing the young, intermediate and mature stages of a typical commercial rotation. The volume, mass, density loss and C:N ratio of all CWD types (logs, stumps, and coarse roots) were determined using a five-decay class (DC) system. The decay rates and half life of CWD was also determined. To estimate CWD coarse root mass; roots associated with stumps classified in different decay classes were excavated. The coarse roots were categorised into small (2-10 mm), medium (10-50 mm) and large (>50 mm) diameter classes. CWD C-mass ranged from 6.98 to 18.62 Mg ha(-1) and was highest in an intermediate forest (D35), while the aboveground volume varied from 6.31 to 42.27 m(3) ha(-1). Coarse roots accounted for 21% to 85% of the total CWD C-pool in the surveyed stands. The total CWD C-mass was poorly correlated with the number of thinning events (R(2) = 0.29), when data from D35 was excluded. The density loss was significant in logs (45%), stumps (58%), and small- (38%), medium- (50%) and large roots (38%) as decay progress from DC 0 to 4. There was a 46%, 41%, 51%, 72% and 57% decline in C:N ratio of logs, stumps, small-, medium- and large roots, respectively, as decay progressed from DC 0 to 4. The density decay rates were 0.059, 0.048 and 0.036 kg m(-3) year(-1) for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively. The size classification of roots did not significantly affect their decay rate. The half life (50% decomposition) of CWD was estimated has 12-, 14- and 19 years for logs, stumps and roots of Sitka spruce. Regression curves showed a strong correlation between the density and C:N ratio (R(2) = 0.69, 0.74 and 0.93 for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively). The long term storage of C and its slow rate of decomposition make CWD a vital structural and functional component of the CWD C-pool and a major controller of forest ecosystem C-retention.

There has been significant controversy associated with the risks and benefits of food additives. The effect of different concentrations of food additives viz, boric acid and sunset yellow on the chromosomes of Trigonella foenum-graecum L. was investigated. Four concentrations of the two food additives (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1%) were used for 3 hours. All concentrations of boric acid and sunset yellow showed mitoinhibitory effect in root tips of Trigonella foenum-graecum and increase in chromosomal aberrations. Various types of metaphasic and anaphasic aberrations were scored and it was found that metaphasic aberrations were more prominent than the anaphasic aberrations. The most observed aberrations induced by boric acid were stickiness at metaphase, bridges at anaphase, stickiness at anaphase, and scattering at metaphase, while the most prevalent aberrations caused by sunset yellow were precocious movement, unorientation at anaphase, scattering at metaphase and unorientation at metaphase.

Single chemicals and mixtures of the chemicals detected from the substrata were also effective in microcosms. The mixtures were more effective than were the individual chemicals. Microplot evaluation of fresh and waste lavender and lavandin was also made in comparison to BioFence (TM) and water controls. Lavandin waste was compared to BioFence (TM) and untreated controls at three sites in field plots that were subsequently planted to strawberry. Disease incidence and severity were measured over time in the field. All of the Lavandula-based materials could be associated with large reductions in the numbers of viable of microsclerotia recovered in all but one experiment with greatest effect in microcosms and smaller effects in microplots and field plots, as could BioFence (TM) pellets. Due to the high levels of inoculum found at all field sites the reduction in pathogen inoculum density was not necessarily associated with a corresponding reduction in disease incidence, nor with severity as determined by yield. The monoterpenoids associated with the Lavandula spp. are of lower volatility than the isothiocyanates associated with crucifer decomposition and were detected for more than one week after materials were incorporated in soil. This suggests both differences in mode of action and the possibility of combining either the chemicals or the materials that produce them in order to further enhance efficacy. Several non-target effects were considered: numerosity and diversity of bacterial and fungal populations; infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; and functional diversity of soil microflora. No persistent non-salient effects were detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

ERIC-PCR analysis revealed no correlation between observed fingerprints and the geographical origin of isolates. Despite the commercial strain U510 has been used for decades to inoculate L. corniculatus, none of the isolates corresponded to this strain. Phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA and atpD genes, and ITS sequences clustered all the isolates within genus Mesorhizobium. A great majority of the isolates likely belong to the species M. huakuii, as does the commercial strain U510. The remaining isolates were closely related to either M. septentrionale or M. caraganae. Although no M. Ion-like bacteria were identified, all isolates carried symbiotic genes closely related to M. loti and other narrow host range Lotus rhizobia. A significant portion of the Uruguayan isolates were as efficient as the reference strain U510 in symbiosis with L. corniculatus. A few of the isolates were also capable of nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with L. uliginosus, albeit with lower efficiency than reference strains. Our results indicate that rhizobia nodulating L. corniculatus in Uruguay are genetically and phenotypically diverse, and that the commercial strain U510 is probably not adapted to survive the Uruguayan edaphoclimatic conditions.

Plants were monitored for five consecutive years in six study plots in Oulanka, northern Finland. Sex ratio, spatial distribution of sexes, flowering frequency, number of floral shoots and the number and weight of inflorescences were recorded. In addition, intensity of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots was assessed. Both sexes flowered each year with a similar frequency, but the overall genet sex ratio was strongly female-biased. The bivariate Ripley's analysis of the sex distribution showed that within most plots sexes were randomly distributed except for one plot. Sexual dimorphism was expressed as larger floral and inflorescence production and heavier inflorescences in males. In addition, the roots of both sexes were colonised to a similar extent by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The female sex-biased flowering ratios reported are not consistent among years and cannot be explained in terms of spatial segregation of the sexes or sex lability. The possible reasons for the female-biased sex ratio are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We studied the interaction between drought and eC(a) in a whole-tree chamber experiment with Eucalyptus saligna. Trees were grown for 18 months in their C-a treatments before a 4-month dry-down. Trees grown in eC(a) were smaller than those grown in ambient C-a (aC(a)) due to an early growth setback that was maintained throughout the duration of the experiment. Pre-dawn leaf water potentials were not different between C-a treatments, but were lower in the drought treatment than the irrigated control. Counter to expectations, the drought treatment caused a larger reduction in canopy-average transpiration rates for trees in the eC(a) treatment compared with aC(a). Total tree transpiration over the dry-down was positively correlated with the decrease in soil water storage, measured in the top 1.5 m, over the drying cycle; however, we could not close the water budget especially for the larger trees, suggesting soil water uptake below 1.5 m depth. Using neutron probe soil water measurements, we estimated fractional water uptake to a depth of 4.5 m and found that larger trees were able to extract more water from deep soil layers. These results highlight the interaction between rooting depth and response of tree water use to drought. The responses of tree water use to eC(a) involve interactions between tree size, root distribution and soil moisture availability that may override the expected direct effects of eC(a). It is essential that these interactions be considered when interpreting experimental results.","[Duursma, Remko A.; Ellsworth, David S.; Tissue, David T.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Barton, Craig V.

Simulations were performed using the HYDRUS-1D model to quantify isothermal and thermal water fluxes in the unsaturated zone of a mature pecan orchard in Las Cruces, NM, with and without root water uptake. Simulated water contents and soil temperatures correlated well with measured data at each depth. Isothermal water flux dominated the soil water movement in bare soil immediately aft er irrigation, while the contribution of vapor flux increased with increasing soil drying because of upward isothermal and much smaller thermal water and vapor fluxes within the 20-cm depth. In contrast, isothermal water flux was predominant throughout the under-canopy soil profile. Actual evaporation from bare soil displayed two distinct stages, immediately aft er irrigation and aft er evaporation continued to fall off with soil drying. Immediately aft er irrigation, trends of under-canopy actual and potential evaporation rates were similar. With the depletion of surface soil water, evaporation losses were lower and actual transpiration due to root water extraction substantially contributed to actual evapotranspiration. Relative evapotranspiration (actual/potential ratio) correlated (P < 0.05) with the pecan stem water potential. The root water uptake pattern followed the root length density distribution immediately aft er irrigation. Patterns of uncompensated (water stress index [omega] = 1.0) and compensated (0.0 < omega < 1.0) root uptake were similar during early periods aft er irrigation. Compensated uptake remained higher under water-stressed conditions, and the compensation from the deeper soil profile generally increased for lower values of., although not consistently for 0.1 < omega < 0.5.","[Deb, Sanjit K.; Shukla, Manoj K.; Mexal, John G.] New Mexico State Univ, Dep Plant & Environm Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Deb, SK (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dep Plant & Environm Sci, MSC 3Q,POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",sanjit@nmsu.edu,,,New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station; Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI); USDA-CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"We thank New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station for support.

Location Global. Methods A bibliographic review of the rhizobial diversity associated with Australian Acacia species was performed to assess symbiotic promiscuity for invasive and non-invasive species. The rhizobial diversity associated with Acacia dealbata and A. saligna in Australia and Portugal and with A. pycnantha in Australia and South Africa was assessed by 16S rDNA and intergenic spacer sequencing of bacteria isolated from field-collected nodules. Results All studied Australian acacias are nodulated by strains in the genus Bradyrhizobium, which appears to be the dominant group of acacia symbionts in native and non-native soils. Both literature and experimental data from this study suggest that Australian bradyrhizobia might have been co-introduced with acacias to new geographical regions. The studied Acacia species can also harbour other root-nodulating alpha and betaproteobacteria genera, although these are less abundant than Bradyrhizobium. Main conclusions There is no clear difference in the diversity of rhizobial species associated with invasive and non-invasive Australian acacias. All studied invasive acacias nodulate in both native and non-native regions, harbouring predominantly Bradyrhizobium strains but showing some degree of symbiotic promiscuity. The co-introduction of compatible root-nodulating bacteria from Australia might explain the establishment of invasive populations, but novel associations with rhizobia from the invaded soils are also possible. Invasive legumes might use both strategies but species with low symbiotic promiscuity would become invasive only if compatible bacteria are co-introduced in the new regions. The progress of invasion and the impacts on the invaded ecosystems might also differ depending on the nodulation strategy.","[Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana; Crisostomo, Joao A.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Dept Life Sci, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Le Roux, Johannes J.; Ndlovu, Joice] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Rodriguez-Echeverria, S (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Dept Life Sci, POB 3046, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",susanare@ci.uc.pt,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/I-1730-2015; Crisostomo, Joao/E-1910-2016","Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/0000-0002-2058-3229; Crisostomo, Joao/0000-0001-7939-3553; Le Roux, Johannes/0000-0001-7911-9810",Portugal MUTUALNET [PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; South Africa Working for Water Programme; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Oppenheimer Memorial Trust; Stellenbosch University,"We thank Christina Birnbaum, Elizabeth Wandrag and three anonymous reviewers for their comments on earlier versions of the manuscript and Prof. Rob Reid and Prof. Andrew Lowe of the University of Adelaide (Australia) for the use of their laboratory for J.N.'s work.

The light competition hypothesis to explain loss of diversity has received much attention. The aim of the present paper was to test this hypothesis. Methods Fertilization was used to control above- and belowground resources simultaneously, while shade was used to control aboveground resource in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Univariate general linear models was used to estimate the effects of fertilization and shade on above- and belowground vegetation characteristics, including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the understory, aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, R:S ratio, species richness and Simpson's diversity index. Important findings PAR was similar in the understory of shaded and fertilized plots, but only fertilization reduced species richness and diversity, suggesting that light competition alone could not explain diversity loss after fertilization. The root biomass and R:S ratio had a significant increase in shaded plots, but the richness and diversity did not change, suggesting that root competition alone also could not explain diversity loss after fertilization in this community. Our results illustrated that the root shoot competition interactions, investigated from a functional groups perspective, should be the most reasonable explanation leading to the diversity loss due to fertilization.","[Li, Wei; Wen, Shujun; Hu, Wenxiang; Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, MOE Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China","Du, GZ (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, MOE Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",guozdu@lzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40930533],Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40930533).,,68,29,32,1,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Assimilating observed data into models is an effective way to reduce uncertainties in ecological forecasting. However, influences of measurement errors on parameter estimation and forecasted state changes have not been carefully examined. This study analyzed the parameter identifiability of a process-based ecosystem carbon cycle model, the sensitivity of parameter estimates and model forecasts to the magnitudes of measurement errors and the information contributions of the assimilated data to model forecasts with a data assimilation approach. Methods We applied a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to assimilate eight biometric data sets into the Terrestrial ECOsystem model. The data were the observations of foliage biomass, wood biomass, fine root biomass, microbial biomass, litter fall, litter, soil carbon and soil respiration, collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment facilities from 1996 to 2005. Three levels of measurement errors were assigned to these data sets by halving and doubling their original standard deviations. Important Findings Results showed that only less than half of the 30 parameters could be constrained, though the observations were extensive and the model was relatively simple. Higher measurement errors led to higher uncertainties in parameters estimates and forecasted carbon (C) pool sizes. The long-term predictions of the slow turnover pools were affected less by the measurement errors than those of fast turnover pools. Assimilated data contributed less information for the pools with long residence times in long-term forecasts. These results indicate the residence times of C pools played a key role in regulating propagation of errors from measurements to model forecasts in a data assimilation system. Improving the estimation of parameters of slow turnover C pools is the key to better forecast long-term ecosystem C dynamics.","[Weng, Ensheng; Luo, Yiqi; Gao, Chao] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yluo@ou.edu,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019; Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847","Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0078325, DEB 0743778]","This research was financially supported by the Office of Science (BER), Department of Energy (DE-FG02-006ER64319) and through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University, under Award Number DE-FC02-06ER64158 and by National Science Foundation (DEB 0078325 and DEB 0743778).

In cold environments, tree cavities are often proposed as the best winter nest choice because of the superior protection they offer from precipitation, wind, cold temperatures, and predators. As such, they represent a critical resource, which has the potential to limit population size of non-excavating species. We assessed factors affecting site occupancy in the boreal forest by northern flying squirrels, a secondary user of tree cavities, and to identify which nest type is preferred during the colder days of the autumn-winter period. We trapped flying squirrels twice in 59 aspen-dominated stands in the autumn period using low-(1.5 m above ground-level) and high-mounted (4 m) traps to determine site occupancy. A total of 85 individuals were captured on 2,880 trap-nights. During the winter period, we radio-tracked 26 individuals to 87 diurnal nests in 220 locations. None of the habitat variables considered (cavity availability, woody debris, and lateral cover) explained site occupancy. Detectability decreased with precipitation, and was lower using high traps than low traps. Both females and males used tree cavities (26%), external nests (39%), and ground nests (35%). In cold weather, females preferred ground nests, whereas males preferred external nests. Our results do not support the hypothesis that tree cavities represent a limiting factor to northern flying squirrels in cold environments. Instead, this species seems to be a generalist and is opportunistic, using a variety of nest types. Nevertheless, practices ensuring the persistence of large diameter live cavity trees, providing better insulative properties, are likely to increase the relative use of tree cavities as nest sites by northern flying squirrels.

Responses of plant community structure and composition to N addition and increased precipitation were examined in a temperate steppe in northern China. Increased precipitation and N addition stimulated and suppressed community species richness, respectively, across 6 years (2005-2010) of the manipulative experiment. N addition and increased precipitation significantly altered plant community structure and composition at functional groups levels. The significant relationship between species richness and soil moisture (SM) suggests that plant community structure is mediated by water under changing environmental conditions. In addition, plant height played an important role in affecting the responses of plant communities to N addition, and the effects of increased precipitation on plant community were dependent on species rooting depth. Our results highlight the importance and complexity of both abiotic (SM) and biotic factors (species traits) in structuring plant community under changing environmental scenarios.

The average number of spores of those fungi was 374.7 per 100 g of soil and colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) was 20.2 %. Most percentages of colonization by EMF were observed in areas with younger plantations, but it greatest diversity was observed in older plantation areas. It can be concluded that sampling period, age of the plantation and soil management practices affect mycorrhizal colonization and also ECM fungi diversity and succession of eucalyptus with AM-ECM is not a rule and it is strongly affected by management.","[da Silva Campos, Daniela Tiago] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Dept Fitotecnia & Fitossanidade, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Soares da Silva, Marliane de Cassia; Rodrigues da Luz, Jose Maria] Univ Fed Vicosa, Programa Posgrad Microbiol Agr, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Megumi Kasuya, Maria Catarina] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Campos, DTD (reprint author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Dept Fitotecnia & Fitossanidade, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",camposdts@yahoo.com.br; mcassiabio@yahoo.com.br; josemarodrigues@yahoo.com.br; rosenvalcosta@yahoo.com.br; mkasuya@ufv.br,"da Luz, Jose Maria/B-2276-2018","da Luz, Jose Maria/0000-0001-9826-7982",,,,21,8,9,1,15,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

In this work, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the distribution gradients of root exudates and phenanthrene and pyrene, as selected PAHs, in rhizosphere soil close to (0-8 mm) the root surface of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as the host plant. Rhizosphere soil from the root surface (0-8 mm) was divided into three layers: the rhizoplane and strongly and loosely adhering soil. Root exudates were characterized as soluble organic C, organic acids, and total soluble sugars. In PAH-spiked rhizosphere soils, the concentration of root exudates decreased with distance from the roots. In a sterilized treatment, the amounts of root exudates in the three rhizosphere layers were higher than when the soil was not sterilized, indicating that microbial consumption contributed significantly to the loss of root exudates in the rhizosphere. The residual concentrations of phenanthrene and pyrene clearly increased in the order of rhizoplane to loosely adhering soil aft er 40 to 50 d, which was significantly and negatively correlated with the amount of root exudates in the rhizosphere. In total, 87 to 97% of phenanthrene and 69 to 79% of pyrene dissipated in all three layers of rhizosphere soil after 40 d, and > 99% of phenanthrene and 93% of pyrene dissipated after 50 d.

Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO(2) exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C(4) pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C(3) vs. C(4) plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (-442 gCm(-2), negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (-450 gCm(-2)). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261 gCm(-2)), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C(4) pasture to C(3) afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate.","[Wolf, Sebastian; Eugster, Werner; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Potvin, Catherine] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Potvin, Catherine; Turner, Benjamin L.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Wolf, S (reprint author), ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",sewolf@ethz.ch,"Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Turner, Benjamin L/E-5940-2011; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Wolf, Sebastian/B-4580-2010","Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Turner, Benjamin L/0000-0002-6585-0722; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Wolf, Sebastian/0000-0001-7717-6993","North-South Centre (former Swiss Centre for International Agriculture) of ETH Zurich; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Meteorology and Hydrology Branch of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), Republic of Panama; SENACYT","Funding for this project was provided by the North-South Centre (former Swiss Centre for International Agriculture) of ETH Zurich.

With the legume Chamaecrista fasciculata, we asked to what extent the availability and quality of rhizobia beyond the range edge limits host range expansion. We tested the effect of rhizobia availability on plant growth by transplanting seed from three locations into five sites spanning C. fasciculata's range (interior, at the northern and western range edges, and beyond the range edges), and inoculating half the seeds with rhizobia. We recorded growth of all surviving plants, and, for the uninoculated plants, whether they had formed nodules or not. We isolated rhizobia from nodules collected on the uninoculated plants, and cross-inoculated seed from four populations (both range edge and interior populations) in the greenhouse to determine whether the quality of rhizobia differed between regions. We found that seeds transplanted beyond the range edge were less likely to be nodulated when they were not experimentally inoculated, and there was benefit to inoculation at all sites. In the greenhouse, the three inocula that formed nodules on plants, from the range interior, northern edge and beyond the northern edge, did not detectably differ in their effect on plant growth. These results suggest that low densities of suitable rhizobia beyond the range edge may limit range expansion of legume species.","[Stanton-Geddes, John] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Anderson, Carolyn G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Stanton-Geddes, J (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol Bldg,1987 Upper Buford Cir, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",stant067@umn.edu,,"Anderson, Carolyn/0000-0003-4211-5765; Stanton-Geddes, John/0000-0003-4667-2542",University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; Center of Community Genetics; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0515466],"We thank Peter Tiffin, William Ratcliff and Ruth Shaw for helpful discussion and comments, Larissa Mottl at Conard Environmental Research Area, Jean Knops at University of Nebraska, Shawn Schottler at St. Croix Watershed Research Area, Bryan Wood at the Audubon Center of the Northwoods for the use of field sites, and Konza Prairie, Tyson Research Station, Conard Environmental Research Area and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for seed collection, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

There are few root-development models in the literature, and there is a specific lack of dynamic models. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a 3D growth-development model for coarse roots, which is species independent, as long as annual rings are formed. In order to implement this model, the objectives are (I) to interpolate annual growth layers, and (II) to evaluate the interpolations and annual volume computations. The model developed is a combination of 3D laser scans and 2D tree-ring data. A FARO laser ScanArm is used to acquire the coarse-root structure. A MATLAB program then integrates the ring-width measurements into the 3D model. A weighted interpolation algorithm is used to compute cross sections at any point within the model to obtain growth layers. The algorithm considers both the root structure and the ring-width data. The model reconstructed ring profiles with a mean absolute error for mean ring chronologies of < 9% and for single radii of < 20%. The interpolation accuracy was dependent on the number of input sections and root curvature. Total volume computations deviated by 3.5-6.6% from the reference model. A new robust root-modelling tool was developed which allows for annual volume computations and sophisticated root-development analyses.","[Wagner, Bettina; Gaertner, Holger] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Wagner, Bettina; Ingensand, Hilmar] ETH, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Santini, Silvia] ETH, Inst Pervas Comp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Wagner, B (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",bettina.wagner@wsl.ch,"Gartner, Holger W/J-7887-2013","Gartner, Holger W/0000-0001-6243-9578",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021-113450],"The authors wish to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for funding the project (No.: 200021-113450).

(inga) seedlings from an organically-grown cacao plantation to inoculation with native arbuscular mycorrhizae forming fungi (AMF) was studied in a cross-inoculation assay under greenhouse conditions. Seedlings of inga and cacao were grown in pots filled with heat-treated soil from the plantation. Control was heat-treated soil without inoculum and roots of cacao and inga from the plantation were applied as AMF inocula. Undisturbed soil blocks were used as a ""positive control"" of the inoculation potential of untreated soil and roots combined. No AMF structures were observed in the roots of either species in the heat-treated control. All inocula were infective in both hosts and the differences in the total AMF colonization percentage between the hosts were not significant but inga had significantly higher colonization by hyphal coils and arbuscules. Cacao roots but neither inga roots nor soil block inocula stimulated cacao growth. All inocula significantly increased growth of inga, which had higher relative mycorrhizal responsiveness than cacao. Thus, in spite of the strong infectivity of the inocula in both hosts, cacao and inga responded differently to the same AMF populations. The strong conspecific preference of cacao suggests that attention must be paid to the AMF inoculum used for this species. However, the strong response of inga to cacao root inoculum indicates that the two species may share same AMF symbionts, thus enabling positive interactions between them, including formation of common mycelial networks.","[Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Iglesias, Luis] Univ Nacl, Escuela Ciencias Agr, Heredia, Costa Rica; [Salas, Eduardo] Corp Bananera Nacl CORBANA SA, Guapiles 3907210, Costa Rica; [Leblanc, Humberto A.] EARTH Univ, San Jose 44421000, Costa Rica","Nygren, P (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.nygren@helsinki.fi,,,Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [111796]; EARTH University Research Committee,We thank the staff of the Academic Farm of the EARTH University for daily maintenance of the greenhouse experiment.

Much of the Great Basin, U.S. is currently dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate (Rydb.) Boivin) ecosystems. Sagebrush ecosystems are increasingly influenced by pinyon (Pinus monophylla Torr. & Frem and Pinus edulis Engelm.) and juniper (Juniperus osteosperma Tort. and Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) expansion. Some scientists and policy makers believe that increasing woodland cover in the intermountain western U.S. offers the possibility of increased organic carbon (OC) storage on the landscape; however, little is currently known about the distribution of OC on these landscapes, or the role that nitrogen (N) plays in OC retention. We quantified the relationship between tree cover, belowground OC, and total below ground N in expansion woodlands at 13 sites in Utah, Oregon, Idaho, California, and Nevada, USA. One hundred and twenty nine soil cores were taken using a mechanically driven diamond tipped core drill to a depth of 90 cm. Soil, coarse fragments, and coarse roots were analyzed for OC and total N. Woodland expansion influenced the vertical distribution of root OC by increasing 15-30 cm root OC by 2.6 Mg ha(-1) and root N by 0.04 Mg ha(-1). Root OC and N increased through the entire profile by 3.8 and 0.06 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Woodland expansion influenced the vertical distribution of soil OC by increasing surface soil (0-15 cm) DC by 2.2 Mg ha(-1). Woodland expansion also caused a 1.3 Mg ha(-1) decrease in coarse fragment associated OC from 75 -90 cm. Our data suggests that woodland expansion into sagebrush ecosystems has limited potential to store additional belowground DC, and must be weighed against the risk of increased wildfire and exotic grass invasion.

Because the sizes of C pools result from the integrated effects of primary production, age-effects, changes in climate, atmospheric CO(2) concentration, N deposition, and disturbances, a modeling scheme that interactively considers these processes is important. We used the InTEC model, driven by various spatio-temporal datasets to simulate the long-term C-balance in a boreal landscape in eastern Canada. Our results suggested that in this boreal landscape, mature coniferous stands had stabilized their productivity and fluctuated as a weak C-sink or C-source depending on the interannual variations in hydrometeorological factors. Disturbed deciduous stands were larger C-sinks (NEP(2004) = 150 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) than undisturbed coniferous stands (e.g. NEP(2004) = 8 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). Wetlands had lower NPP but showed temporally consistent C accumulation patterns. The simulated spatio-temporal patterns of BCPs and SCPs were unique and reflected the integrated effects of climate, plant growth and atmospheric chemistry besides the inherent properties of the C pool themselves. The simulated BCPs and SCPs generally compared well with the biometric estimates (BCPs: r = 0.86, SCPs: r = 0.84). The largest BCP biases were found in recently disturbed stands and the largest SCP biases were seen in locations where moss necro-masses were abundant. Reconstructing C pools and C fluxes in the ecosystem in such a spatio-temporal manner could help reduce the uncertainties in our understanding of terrestrial C-cycle. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We cultured fungal endophytes from surface-sterilized Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizae of Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca from two boreal sites in eastern Canada. Isolates were initially grouped on the basis of cultural morphology and then identified by internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA sequencing or by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data revealed 31 distinct phylotypes among the isolates, comprising mainly members of the ascomycete families Helotiaceae, Dermateaceae, Myxotrichaceae, and Hyaloscyphaceae, although other fungi were also isolated. Multivariate analyses indicate a clear separation among the endophyte communities colonizing each host tree species. Some phylotypes were evenly distributed across the roots of all three host species, some were found preferentially on particular hosts, and others were isolated from single hosts only. The results indicate that fungal root endophytes of boreal trees are not randomly distributed, but instead form relatively distinct assemblages on different host tree species.","[Kernaghan, Gavin; Patriquin, Glenn] Mt St Vincent Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3M 2J6, Canada","Kernaghan, G (reprint author), Mt St Vincent Univ, Dept Biol, 166 Bedford Hwy, Halifax, NS B3M 2J6, Canada.",gavin.kernaghan@msvu.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [341671-2007],"This work was made possible by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (341671-2007).

To search for compounds that regulate root branching, a forward chemical genetics screen was employed, and 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a coumarin derivative, was found to be a potent regulator of lateral root formation. Exogenous application of 4-MU to Arabidopsis thaliana seeds affected germination and led to reduced primary root growth, the formation of bulbous root hairs, and irregular detached root caps accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in root tips before seedling establishment. Abundant lateral roots formed after exposure to 125 mu M 4-MU for 22 days. Molecular, biochemical, and phytochemical approaches were used to determine the effect of 4-MU on root growth and root branching. Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the presence of 4-MU accumulated this compound only in roots, where it was partially transformed by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) into 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucoside (4-MU-Glc). The presence of 4-MU-Glc in seedling roots was consistent with the upregulation of several genes that encode UGTs in the roots. This shows that UGTs play an integral role in the detoxification of 4-MU in plants. The increased expression of two auxin efflux facilitator genes (PIN2 and PIN3) in response to 4-MU and the lack of response of the auxin receptor TIR1 and the key auxin biosynthetic gene YUCCA1 suggest that auxin redistribution, rather than auxin biosynthesis, may directly or indirectly mediate 4-MU-induced root branching.","[Li, Xiang; Gruber, Margaret Y.; Hegedus, Dwayne D.; Lydiate, Derek J.; Gao, Ming-Jun] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Saskatoon Res Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada; [Li, Xiang] Jilin Univ, Coll Plant Sci, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China","Gao, MJ (reprint author), Agr & Agrifood Canada, Saskatoon Res Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada.",Ming-Jun.Gao@agr.gc.ca,,,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [NCET-09-0423]","X.

The N uptake and de novo biosynthesis of amino acids were analyzed using stable isotopic labeling with mass spectrometric detection. High-performance liquid chromatography-based analysis was used to measure amino acid levels. In the absence of exogenous N sources and in the presence of 25 mL L-1 CO2, the germinating AM fungal spores utilized internal N storage as well as C skeletons derived from the degradation of storage lipids to biosynthesize the free amino acids, in which serine and glycine were produced predominantly. The concentrations of internal amino acids increased gradually as the germination time increased from 0 to 1 or 2 weeks. However, asparagine and glutamine declined to the low levels; both degraded to provide the biosynthesis of other amino acids with C and N donors. The availability of exogenous inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) and organic N (urea, arginine, and glutamine) to the AM fungal spores using only CO2 for germination generated more than 5 times more internal free amino acids than those in the absence of exogenous N. A supply of exogenous nitrate to the AM fungal spores with only CO2 gave rise to more than 10 times more asparagine than that without exogenous N. In contrast, the extra supply of exogenous glucose to the AM fungal spores generated a significant enhancement in the uptake of exogenous N sources, with more than 3 times more free amino acids being produced than those supplied with only exogenous CO2. Meanwhile, arginine was the most abundant free amino acid produced and it was incorporated into the proteins of AM fungal spores to serve as an N storage compound.","[Jin Hai-Ru; Jiang Dong-Hua; Zhang Ping-Hua] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China","Jin, HR (reprint author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China.",hrjin@zjnu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30970101],Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30970101).,,28,4,5,1,43,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,AUG,2011,21,4,,,,,432,442,,10.1016/S1002-0160(11)60145-8,,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,798JQ,WOS:000293202400003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sharif, M; Claassen, N",,,,"Sharif, M.; Claassen, N.",,,Action Mechanisms of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Phosphorus Uptake by Capsicum annuum L.,PEDOSPHERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,hyphae; mechanistic model; phosphorus influx; root infection; root morphology,GLOMUS-FASCICULATUM; PHOSPHATE-UPTAKE; UPTAKE KINETICS; WHITE CLOVER; ROOT; GROWTH; HYPHAE; SOIL; INFECTION; SYMBIOSES,"A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the action mechanisms of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in phosphorus (P) uptake of Capsicum annuum L. in a sterilized fossil Oxisol. Three P levels of 0, 10 and 200 mg kg(-1) soil (PO, P10 and P200, respectively) without and with AM fungal inoculation were applied as Ca(H(2)PO(4))(2)center dot H(2)O. Shoot dry matter yields and shoot P uptake increased significantly (P > 0.05) by the inoculation of AM fungi at PO and P10. Root length and P concentration in soil solution increased with the inoculation of AM fungi but the root:shoot ratio decreased or remained constant. Around 50% roots of inoculated plants were infected by AM and the external hyphae amounted to 20 m g(-1) soil at P10 and P200. The hyphae surface area of the infected root cylinder amounted to 11 and 2 cm(2) cm(-2) root at PO and P10, respectively. The increased P uptake of inoculated plants was mainly because of an up to 5 times higher P influx of the infected root. Model calculations showed that the root alone could not have achieved the measured P influx in both infected and non-infected roots. But the P influx for hyphae calculated by the model was even much higher than the measured one. The P uptake capacity of hyphae introduced in the model was too high. Model calculations further showed that the depletion zone around roots or hyphae was very narrow. In the case of the root only 7% of the soil volume would contribute P to the plant, while in the case of hyphae it would be 100%. The results together with the model calculations showed that the increased P uptake of AM inoculated plants could be explained partly by the increased P concentration in the soil solution and by the increased P absorbing surface area coming from the external hyphae.","[Sharif, M.] NW Frontier Prov Agr Univ, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Claassen, N.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci Plant Nutr, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Sharif, M (reprint author), NW Frontier Prov Agr Univ, Dept Soil & Environm Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan.",msharif645@yahoo.com,,,Higher Education Commission of PakistanHigher Education Commission of Pakistan,Supported by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.,,42,14,16,0,20,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,AUG,2011,21,4,,,,,502,511,,10.1016/S1002-0160(11)60152-5,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,798JQ,WOS:000293202400010,,,,,10/31/19J,"He, YR; Wang, JY; Wang, ET; Feng, G; Chang, YL; Sui, XH; Chen, WX",,,,"He, Yu Rong; Wang, Jing Yu; Wang, En Tao; Feng, Gu; Chang, Yue Li; Sui, Xin Hua; Chen, Wen Xin",,,Trigonella arcuata-associated rhizobia-an Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti population adapted to a desert environment,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ephemeral plant; Trigonella arcuata; Desert; Rhizobia; Divergent evolution,SAND DUNE LEGUMES; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SOUTHWEST COAST; ANNUAL MEDICAGO; ROOT-NODULE; SP-NOV; DNA; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION,"With the aim of systematically investigating rhizobia associated with the Trigonella arcuata-an ephemeral legume native to the Gurbantunggut Desert-66 bacterial strains were isolated from root nodules and characterized with PCR-based RFLP of 16S rRNA and nodC genes, RFLP of ribosomal IGS, BOX-PCR, and sequencing of housekeeping (16S rRNA, recA, atpD) and symbiotic (nodC and nifH) genes, numerical taxonomy and nodulation tests.

We focused on two phenotypic traits that are not functionally linked: flowering time and perception of symbiotic microbes. Phenology is an important fitness component, especially for annual plants, and many instances of molecular adaptation have been reported for genes involved in flowering pathways. While perception of symbiotic microbes is also integral to adaptation in many plant species, very few reports of molecular adaptation exist for symbiotic genes. Here we used data from 57 individuals and 53 gene fragments to quantify the overall strength of both positive and purifying selection in M. truncatula and asked if footprints of positive selection can be detected at key genes of rhizobia recognition pathways. Results: We examined nucleotide variation among 57 accessions from natural populations in 53 gene fragments: 5 genes involved in nitrogen-fixing bacteria recognition, 11 genes involved in flowering, and 37 genes used as control loci. We detected 1757 polymorphic sites yielding an average nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.003 per site. Non-synonymous variation is under sizable purifying selection with 90% of amino-acid changing mutations being strongly selected against. Accessions were structured in two groups consistent with geographical origins. Each of these two groups harboured an excess of rare alleles, relative to expectations of a constant-sized population, suggesting recent population expansion. Using coalescent simulations and an approximate Bayesian computation framework we detected several instances of genes departing from selective neutrality within each group and showed that the polymorphism of two nodulation and four flowering genes has probably been shaped by recent positive selection. Conclusion: We quantify the intensity of purifying selection in the M. truncatula genome and show that putative footprints of natural selection can be detected at different time scales in both flowering and symbiotic pathways.","[Bataillon, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [De Mita, Stephane] IRD, UMR Divers Adaptat & Dev Plantes Cultivees DIADE, Montpellier, France; [Chantret, Nathalie; Loridon, Karine; Ronfort, Joelle] IRD, UMR Ameliorat Genet & Adaptat Plantes Mediterrane, Montpellier, France; [Bataillon, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Inst Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Bataillon, T (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",tbata@birc.au.dk,,"Bataillon, Thomas/0000-0002-4730-2538",Danish Research CouncilDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF); INRAInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA),"We thank Peter Tiffin for suggestions and stylistic comments on this manuscript.

The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two-and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.","[Flynn, Dan F.

Intraspecific genetic diversity, measured as the number of genotypes, can enhance plant primary productivity and have cascading effects at higher trophic levels, such as an increase in herbivore and predator richness. The positive effects of genotypic mixtures are not only determined by additive effects, but also by interactions among genotypes, such as facilitation or inhibition. However, so far there has been no effort to predict the extent of such effects. In this study, we address the question of whether the magnitude of the effect of genotype number on population performance can be explained by the extent of dissimilarity in key traits among genotypes in a mixture. We examine the relative contribution of genotype number and phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes to population performance of the soil arthropod, Orchesella cincta. Nearly homogeneous genotypes were created from inbred isofemale lines. Phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes was assessed in terms of three life-history traits that are associated with population growth rate, i.e., egg size, egg development time, and juvenile growth rate. A microcosm experiment with genotype mixtures consisting of one, two, four, and eight genotypes, showed that genotypic richness strongly increased population size and biomass production and was associated with greater net diversity effects. Most importantly, there was a positive log-linear relationship between phenotypic dissimilarity in a mixture and the net diversity effects for juvenile population size and total biomass. In other words, the degree of phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes determined the magnitude of the genotypic richness effect, although this relationship leveled off at higher values of phenotypic dissimilarity. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for these effects are currently unknown, similar advantages of trait dissimilarity have been found among species.

It has been severely affected by degradation and deforestation and has been heavily fragmented over the past 4-5 decades. Despite the recognized overall ecological importance of the Cerrado, there are only few studies focusing on the quantification of biomass in this biome. We conducted such a case study in the South-East of Brazil in a cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado s.s.) with the goal to produce estimates of above- and belowground biomass and to develop allometric equations. A number of 120 trees from 18 species were destructively sampled and partitioned into the components: leaves, branches and bole. Five models with DBH (D), height (H), D(2)H and wood density (WD) as independent variables were tested for the development of allometric models for individual tree aboveground biomass (leaves + branches + bole). One model based on basal area (BA) as a stand parameter was also tested as an alternative approach for predicting aboveground biomass in the stand level. Belowground biomass was estimated by subsampling on 10 sample plots. Mean aboveground tree biomass (bole, branches and leaves) was estimated to be 62,965.5 kg ha(-1)(SE = 14.6%) and belowground biomass accounted for 37,501.8 kg ha(-1) (SE = 23%). The best-fit equation for the estimation of individual tree aboveground biomass include DBH and wood density as explanatory variables (R(2) = 0.898; SEE = 0.371) and is applicable for the diameter range of this study (5.0-27.6 cm) and in environments with similar conditions of the cerrado s.s. sampled. In the stand level, the model tested presented a higher goodness of fit than the single tree models (R(2) - 0.934; SEE = 0.224). Our estimates of aboveground biomass are higher than reported by other studies developed in the same physiognomy, but the estimates of belowground biomass are within the range of values reported in other studies from sites in cerrado s.s. Both biomass estimates, however, exhibit relatively large standard errors. The root-to-shoot ratio of the sample trees is in the magnitude of reported values for savanna ecosystems, but smaller than estimated from other studies in the cerrado s.s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Soil micro-organisms play important roles in ecosystems and respond quickly to environmental changes. We examined how understory removal and tree girdling influence the composition of soil microbial community and the litter decomposition in two subtropical plantations. 2. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize soil microbial community. Redundancy analysis and principal response curves (PRC) were used to investigate the relationships between soil microbial community and environmental factors. 3. Understory removal significantly reduced the amount of fungal PLFAs, the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs, and the litter decomposition but did not affect bacterial PLFAs and total PLFAs. In contrast, tree girdling did not affect the soil microbial characteristics. The changes in soil microbial community caused by understory removal were mainly attributed to the indirect effects such as increased soil temperature and soil NO(3)(-) -N availability. In addition, PRC analysis showed that the relative abundance of most PLFAs increased in response to understory removal in the 2-year-old plantation but decreased in the 24-year-old plantation. 4. We propose that understory plants are important components in subtropical forest ecosystems, and play different roles in maintaining soil microbial community and driving litter decomposition processes in young vs. old plantations. The functions of understory plants should be considered in forest management and restoration. The negligible effect of tree girdling on the soil micro-organisms can be attributed to the resprouting trait and mycorrhizal interactions of Eucalyptus.","[Wu, Jianping; Liu, Zhanfeng; Wang, Xiaoling; Zhou, Lixia; Lin, Yongbiao; Fu, Shenglei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianping; Wang, Xiaoling; Sun, Yuxin] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuxin] Acad Sinica, State Key Lab Organ Geochem, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China","Fu, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sfu@scbg.ac.cn,"Wu, Jianping/H-9150-2012; Sun, Yuxin/E-4770-2013; Fu, Shenglei/B-2729-2012","Wu, Jianping/0000-0002-5784-834X; Sun, Yuxin/0000-0003-0674-8709; ","National Basic Research Programme of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2011CB403200, 2009CB421101]; National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young ScholarsNational Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [30925010]; Guangdong Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [9451065005003254]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-G-074-02, KSCX2-EW-J-28]","This work was funded by National Basic Research Programme of China (No. 2011CB403200 and No. 2009CB421101), National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. 30925010), Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (9451065005003254), and the Knowledge Innovation Programme of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-YW-G-074-02 and KSCX2-EW-J-28).

Rhizobium-inoculated plants grown on 100% flyash showed marked increase in relation to root-shoot length, biomass yield, photosynthetic pigment, ""protein content and nodulation frequency compared to uninoculated plant grown in control (100% flyash). Inoculation of fly-ash-tolerant Rhizobium increased the accumulation of Fe, Zn, Cu Cd and Cr in different tissues vis-a-vis enhanced translocation of metals to the aboveground part of plant. Although inoculation of fly-ash-tolerant Rhizobium strains (VR-1 and VA-1) enhanced the translocation of more Fe to shoot parts, nevertheless, the amount of Rhizobium inoculants supplied to the plant was found to be very important since it has a positive role in increasing plant growth through increased N-2 supply via nitrogenase activity. Results suggest that an integrated approach employing biotechnological means and inoculation of plants with host-specific fly-ash-tolerant Rhizobium strain may prove a stimulus to a fly-ash management programme.

However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (Si) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47% from Si to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from Si to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor ""conversion phase"". We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.

Cool-season grasses can be simultaneously infected by foliar fungal endophytes and colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the integrated functions of which are strong predictors of plant fitness within grassland ecosystems. Evidence has been presented previously that infection of grass species with foliar endophytes can negatively affect mycorrhizal colonisation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mycorrhizal colonisation in turn adversely affects Neotyphodium endophyte concentrations and that the competitive interaction between the two endosymbionts is affected by resource supply. 2. Specifically, we report how competition between Glomus (G. mosseae - GM, G. intraradices GI) mycorrhizal fungi and N. lolii (common strain (CS) and AR1) foliar endophytic strains is affected by P supply and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in two Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) cultivars: a high sugar grass, AberDart, and a conventional (control) grass, Fennema. 3. The presence of Glomus mycorrhizae reduced the concentrations of endophytes and alkaloids in leaf blades and pseudostems. The reduction depended on P supply, ryegrass cultivar (notably WSC content) and endophyte strain. Conversely, foliar endophyte infection reduced mycorrhizal colonisation rates and concentrations in the roots of the control cultivar Fennema, although not in the high sugar cultivar, AberDart. 4. Neither GM nor N. lolii infection had an effect per se on the yield of root or blade compared with mycorrhiza-free (M-) and endophyte-free (E-) plants, respectively; though, yield of roots and blades was reduced by GI infection and at low P. 5. Competitive interactions between ecologically widespread foliar endophytes (valuable for plant protection) and mycorrhizal endosymbionts (valuable for P acquisition) as seen in this study are of critical importance especially in areas of high pest prevalence and low P availability. Our work stresses the need for elucidating the physiological/metabolic basis for such interactions between endosymbionts to understand how these processes contribute to plant performance and fitness in grassland ecosystems.","[Liu, Qianhe; Parsons, Anthony J.; Xue, Hong; Fraser, Karl; Rasmussen, Susanne] AgResearch, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Ryan, Geraldine D.; Newman, Jonathan A.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Rasmussen, S (reprint author), AgResearch, PB 11008, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",susanne.rasmussen@agresearch.co.nz,"Fraser, Karl/V-6856-2019; Parsons, Anthony John/E-7226-2011; Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008; Rasmussen, Susanne/D-4526-2017","Fraser, Karl/0000-0002-1136-4024; Parsons, Anthony John/0000-0001-7441-1855; Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084; Rasmussen, Susanne/0000-0001-5464-8978","NZ Foundation of Research, Science and Technology [AGRX0501, C10X0203, PROJ 10333-ECOS-AGR]; Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","This work has been partially funded by the NZ Foundation of Research, Science and Technology (contracts AGRX0501, C10X0203 and PROJ 10333-ECOS-AGR) and was conducted at AgResearch Grasslands, New Zealand.

The study was conducted at three coastal dune zones: embryonic, mobile and stabilized dunes. At each dune zone we chose five dominant plant species, collected roots and determined the percent of mycorrhizal colonization. We also took five soil samples at each dune zone to evaluate AMF spore density and number of infective propagules. The overall AMF colonization ranged from 15 to 19 % depending on the dune zone and the season. The density of spores in 50 g soil was higher during the rainy (11.1 +/- 2.6) compared to the dry season (1.55 +/- 0.2). AMF were present in root samples of all the plants studied, and infective propagules were present in all dune zones; this held true for both sampling seasons. The presence of viable AMF propagules across the successional vegetation gradient indicates the important role of this interaction on plant survivorship in stressful conditions such as that present in Sisal.

To compare the susceptibility of 22 temperate deciduous tree and shrub species to hydraulic failure during a record drought in the southeastern USA, we quantified leaf desiccation, native embolism, wood density, stomatal conductance and predawn and midday leaf water potential at four sites with varying drought intensities. At the two driest sites, there was widespread leaf wilting and desiccation, and most species exhibited predawn leaf water potentials of <= 3MPa and >60% loss of xylem conductivity in branches. Although species with high wood density were more resistant to cavitation, they had higher levels of native embolism and greater canopy dieback than species with low wood density. This unexpected result can be explained by the failure of species with dense wood to avert a decline in water potential to dangerous levels during the drought. Leaf water potential was negatively correlated with wood density, and the relationship was strongest under conditions of severe water deficit. Species with low wood density avoided catastrophic embolism by relying on an avoidance strategy that involves partial drought deciduousness, higher sensitivity of stomata to leaf water potential and perhaps greater rooting depth. These species therefore maintained water potential at levels that ensured a greater margin of safety against embolism. These differences among species may mediate rapid shifts in species composition of temperate forests if droughts intensify due to climate change.","[Hoffmann, William A.; Marchin, Renee M.; Abit, Pamela; Lau, On Lee] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Hoffmann, WA (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",wahoffma@ncsu.edu,"Hoffmann, William A./E-8894-2010","Hoffmann, William A./0000-0002-1926-823X; Marchin, Renee/0000-0002-4154-8924",North Carolina State University; Andrew W.

However, little is known about the magnitude or extent to which storms affect carbon efflux. We compared soil CO2 fluxes in wind-thrown forest stands with different time periods since a storm event, and with different management practices (deadwood cleared or left on-site). This study examined changes in soil CO2 efflux in two windthrow areas in north-eastern Estonia and one area in north-western Latvia, which experienced severe wind storms in the summers of 2001, 2002 and 1967, respectively. We measured soil CO2 fluxes in stands formerly dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) with total and partial canopy destruction (all trees or roughly half of the trees in stand damaged by storm), in harvested areas (material removed after the wind storm) and in control areas (no damage by wind). Removal of wind-damaged material decreased instantaneous CO2 flux from the soil surface. The highest instantaneous fluxes were measured in areas with total and partial canopy destruction (0.67 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in both cases) compared with fluxes in the control areas (0.51 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)), in the new storm-damaged areas where the material was removed (0.57 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and in the old storm-damaged area where wood was left on site (0.55 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). The only factor affecting soil CO2 flux was location of the measuring collar (plastic collar with diameter 100 mm, height 50 mm) - either on undamaged forest ground or on the uprooted tree pit, where the mineral soil was exposed after disturbance. New wind-thrown stands where residues are left on site would most likely turn to sources of CO2 for several years until forest regeneration reaches to substantial assimilation rates. New wind-thrown stands where residues are left on site would most likely tend to have elevated CO2 fluxes for several years until forest regeneration reaches to substantial assimilation rates. However, forest managers might be concerned about the amounts of CO2 immediately released into the atmosphere if the harvested logs are burned. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Morphological characterization and analysis of conserved sequences of genomic DNA are frequently employed in the identification and study of fungi diversity. However, phytopathogenic Rhizoctonia-lilke fungi have been reliably and accurately characterized and identified through the examination of the fatty acid composition. To evaluate the efficacy of fatty acid composition in characterizing and identifying Rhizoctonia-like mycorrhizal fungi in orchids, three Epulorhiza spp. mycorrhizal fungi from Epidendrum secundum, two unidentified fungi isolated from Epidendrum denticulatum, and a phytopathogenic fungus, Ceratorhiza sp. AGC, were grouped based on the profile of their fatty acids, which was assessed by the Euclidian and Mahalanobis distances and the UPGMA method. Dendrograms distinguished the phytopathogenical isolate of Ceratorhiza sp. AGC from the mycorrhizal fungi studied. The symbionts of E. secundum were grouped into two clades, one containing Epulorhiza sp.1 isolates and the other the Epulorhiza sp.2 isolate. The similarity between the symbionts of E. denticulatum and Epulorhiza spp. fungi suggests that symbionts found in E. denticulatum may be identified as Epulorhiza. These results were corroborated by the analysis of the rDNA ITS region. The dendrogram constructed based on the Mahalanobis distance differentiated the clades most clearly. Fatty acid composition analysis proved to be a useful tool for characterizing and identifying Rhizoctonia-like mycorrhizal fungi.","[Pereira, Marlon Correa] UFV, Biol Sci & Hlth Inst, BR-38810000 Rio Paranaiba, MG, Brazil; [Vieira, Nivea Moreira] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Plant Biol, Tech Plant Anat Lab, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Totola, Marcos Rogerio; Megumi Kasuya, Maria Catarina] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Pereira, MC (reprint author), UFV, Biol Sci & Hlth Inst, Campus Rio Paranaiba,MG 230,Km 7,Caixa Postal 22, BR-38810000 Rio Paranaiba, MG, Brazil.",marlon.pereira@ufv.br; nimvieira@gmail.com; totola@ufv.br; mkasuya@ufv.br,"Pereira, Marlon/H-1669-2014; Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/E-1123-2013","Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/0000-0002-9539-9370",FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [475554/2008-6],"Part of the Doctoral Thesis of the first author approved by the Agricultural Microbiology Programme of the Microbiology Department, Federal University of Vicosa (UFV).

Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse, using 1.5 kg vases, for up to 120 days. The experimental design for each arboreal species was completely randomized, with ten replicates in a 2x2 factorial design (inoculated and noninoculated seedlings, and two levels of phosphorus (P) in the soil solution). Arboreal plants of the Cerrado biome showed increased mycorrhizal colonization from inoculation with Glomus clarum, except chicha, as this species showed a high indigenous colonization, not differing from the colonization promoted by inoculated fungi. Inoculation promoted increased growth in baru, gabiroba, inga, caroba and chicha, increasing shoot thy matter (MSPA) and root dry matter (MSR). In caroba, this effect was synergistic with application of P to the soil. Baru and jatoba showed increased thy matter with application of P to the soil only. The mycotrophy (mycorrhizal dependence) of species and their response to inoculation and to phosphorus are discussed. In order to produce quality seedlings of caroba, gabiroba, chicha and inga, combining inoculation with Glomus clarum and phosphate fertilization of the soil is recommended, while for jatoba and baru only the application of P to the soil is recommended.","[Pereira Lacerda, Kenia Alves] Inst Fed Ensino Jatai, BR-7580000 Jatai, Go, Brazil; [de Souza Silva, Marcelle Moreira; Carbone Carneiro, Marco Aurelio; dos Reis, Edesio Fialho] UFG, BR-75800000 Jatai, Go, Brazil; [Saggin Junior, Orivaldo Jose] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil","Lacerda, KAP (reprint author), Inst Fed Ensino Jatai, Rua Riachuelo 2090, BR-7580000 Jatai, Go, Brazil.",keniaapl@bol.com.br; marcelleagro@hotmail.com; carbonecarneiro@pq.cnpq.br; edesio7@brturbo.com.br; saggin@cnpab.embrapa.br,"Carneiro, Marco Aurelio C/M-3085-2014; Carneiro, Marco Aurelio Carbone/Q-2721-2019","Carneiro, Marco Aurelio C/0000-0003-4349-3071; Carneiro, Marco Aurelio Carbone/0000-0003-4349-3071",,,,21,11,11,0,20,UNIV FEDERAL LAVRAS-UFLA,LAVRAS,"CAIXA POSTAL 3037, LAVRAS, MG 37200-000, BRAZIL",0104-7760,,,CERNE,Cerne,JUL-SEP,2011,17,3,,,,,377,386,,10.1590/S0104-77602011000300012,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,827GQ,WOS:000295417200012,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Velazquez, S; Cabello, M",,,,"Velazquez, Silvana; Cabello, Marta",,,Occurrence and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in trap cultures from El Palmar National Park soils,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Trap culture; El Palmar National Park,ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; AGROECOSYSTEMS; PLANTS; GLOMEROMYCOTA; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; SPORULATION; ECOSYSTEMS; EVOLUTION,"The objective of this study was to assess and compare the diversity of arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) obtained from five vegetation types-gallery forest, grassland, marsh, palm forest, and scrubland-within El Palmar National Park (Entre Rios province, Argentina) through trap cultures with soil as the source of inoculum. Three different plant species-Lolium perenne L., Plantago lanceolata L., and Trifolium pratense L.-were used as trap plants. The experiment, conducted for two years under glasshouse conditions, showed that spore number increased during the second year in all the trap cultures from the five vegetation types, with Glomeraceae being most abundant in the last year. A total of 34 morphospecies were identified at the species level (32 morphospecies during the first year and 26 during the second). The species richness and biodiversity index decreased in the second year and were significantly different between the marsh and the palm forest. The soil-based trap culture isolation procedure indicated the presence of Glomeromycota species not registered from field samples: three belonging to the Acaulospora genus, one to the Glomus genus, and three to the Gigaspora genus.

The composition and the amount of essential oil produced may vary depending on the microbial community associated with vetiver roots. This study aimed to evaluate the structure of total and diazotrophic bacterial communities inside the roots and in the rhizosphere of vetiver RAROS genotype at five plant growth stages by molecular methods (PCR-DGGE and sequencing). The predominant bacterial community varied depending on plant age (mainly in the roots) and origin (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and roots). Sequencing of DGGE bands (16S rRNA) demonstrated that the most dominant group associated with vetiver RAROS genotype was affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria (65.4% of the sequences). The diazotrophic population varied with early root growth, being more stable after the third month of plant growth, and seemed to be more influenced by root exudates than the total bacterial community. Alphaproteobacteria class was dominant among the nifH-harboring population (58.3% of the sequences analyzed). This study provides important information for the isolation and selection of strains that may promote the vetiver RAROS genotype growth and, consequently, improve the essential oil production.

Here, we estimate carbon stocks in an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, by identifying the major carbon stocks and their variability. Data on the biomass of tree stems and roots, saplings, and soil carbon stocks are reported and compared with other savannas systems around the globe. A new allometric relationship between stem diameter and tree stem and root biomass is presented, based on the destructive harvest of 29 trees. These allometrics are combined with an inventory of 12,733 trees on 58 plots over an area of 27 ha. Ecosystem carbon stocks totaled 110 tC/ha, with 76 tC/ha in the soil carbon pool (to 50 cm depth), 21.2 tC/ha in tree stem biomass, 8.5 tC/ha in tree coarse root biomass, and 3.6 tC/ha in total sapling biomass. Plot-level tree root:stem (R:S) ratio varied from 0.27 to 0.58, with a mean of 0.42, slightly higher than the mean reported for 18 other savanna sites with comparable aboveground biomass (R:S = 0.35). Tree biomass (stem + root) ranged from 3.1 to 86.5 tC/ha, but the mean (32.1 tC/ha) was well constrained (95% CI 28-36.6). In contrast, soil carbon stocks were almost uniformly distributed and varied from 32 to 133 tC/ha. Soil carbon stocks are thus the major uncertainty in the carbon storage of these woodlands. Soil texture explained 53 percent of the variation in soil carbon content, but only 13 percent of the variation in woody carbon stocks. The history of disturbance (fire, elephants, logging/charcoal production, and shifting cultivation) is likely to decouple changes in woody carbon stocks from soil carbon stocks, mediated by tree grass interactions.","[Ryan, Casey M.; Williams, Mathew; Grace, John] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","Ryan, CM (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Crew Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland.",casey.ryan@ed.ac.uk,"Ryan, Casey/B-7967-2008; Grace, John/N-9280-2013; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Ryan, Casey/0000-0002-1802-0128; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208",,,,40,77,83,0,66,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",6-Jun,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUL,2011,43,4,,,,,423,432,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00713.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,793EV,WOS:000292804100006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ray-Mukherjee, J; Jones, TA; Adler, PB; Monaco, TA",,,,"Ray-Mukherjee, Jayanti; Jones, Thomas A.; Adler, Peter B.; Monaco, Thomas A.",,,Immature Seedling Growth of Two North American Native Perennial Bunchgrasses and the Invasive Grass Bromus tectorum,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,absolute growth rate; bluebunch wheatgrass; relative growth rate; Snake River wheatgrass; specific leaf area; specific root length,ROOT LENGTH; BLUEBUNCH WHEATGRASS; GERMINATION; CHEATGRASS; DYNAMICS; PLANT; MASS; TEMPERATURE; COMPETITION; EMERGENCE,"Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love and Elymus wawawaiensis J. Carlson & Barkworth are two native perennial grasses widely used for restoration in the Intermountain West. However, the rapid establishment and spread of Bromus tectorum L., an invasive annual grass, has led to a decline in the abundance of native perennial grasses. Proliferation of B. tectorum has been attributed to its early germination, superior cold-temperature growth, profuse root production, and high specific leaf area (SLA). To enhance restoration success, we compared B. tectorum to commercially available plant materials of two perennial rangeland bunchgrasses, P. spicata (cv. Whitmar, cv. Goldar, and Anatone Germplasm) and E. wawawaiensis (cv. Secar), for germination, seedling morphological traits, and growth rates at the immature seedling stage. We monitored germination and immature seedling growth in a growth chamber in two separate experiments, one under low (5/10 degrees C) and the other under high (15/20 degrees C) day/night temperatures. Compared to the average of the two perennials, B. tectorum was 93% (77%) greater at high (and low) temperature for root:shoot length ratio, but only 14% (14%) greater for root:shoot biomass ratio and 12% (19%) lower for SLA. This suggests that B. tectorum's substantial investment in surface area of roots, rather than in shoot length, root biomass, or leaf area, may be responsible for the annual's success at the early seedling stage. Compared to E. wawawaiensis, P. spicata averaged 65% (41%) higher shoot biomass, 39% (88%) higher root biomass, and 70% (10%) higher absolute growth rate, but 25% (15%) lower SLA and 15% (36%) lower specific root length (SRL) at high (and low) temperatures, respectively. Although P. spicata's greater productivity may initially make for better seedling establishment than E. wawawaiensis, it may also prove disadvantageous in competitive or highly resource-limited environments where high SLA or SRL could be an advantage.","[Ray-Mukherjee, Jayanti] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Jones, Thomas A.; Monaco, Thomas A.] Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Forage & Range Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Ray-Mukherjee, J (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",plants@scientist.com,"Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009",,Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project,"This research has been partially funded by the Great Basin Native Plant Selection and Increase Project, and we gratefully acknowledge this contribution by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station.",,35,10,11,0,32,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Previous work has shown that as plant communities develop, AMF density is a good predictor of what type of plant community is supported. However, interactions between plants, particularly facultative hosts, and AMF are often assumed from plant growth responses and lack concomitant AMF growth response data. We examined both plant and AMF responses in association using early- and mid-seral plant hosts and a homogenous AMF community. The goal was to determine how variable interactions are between facultative plant hosts and an AMF community. Plant responsiveness was measured using field soil with and without AMF. AMF density was measured by observing root colonization by AMF in a bioassay host plant grown in soils trained by the individual host plant species used in the plant responsiveness study. Plant species studied were highly variable in their interactions with AMF, and mutualisms, parasitisms, amensalisms and commensalisms were all prevalent. The presence of certain AMF facilitators may have a strong founder effect on plant communities and, where such feedbacks exist, identifying and utilizing these key interactions might facilitate the restoration of degraded ecosystems.

In this study, we examine how effectively forecasts of a forest carbon cycle can be improved by assimilating observations with the EnKF. We used the EnKF to assimilate into the terrestrial ecosystem (TECO) model eight data sets collected at the Duke Forest between 1996 and 2004 (foliage biomass, fine root biomass, woody biomass, litterfall, microbial biomass, forest floor carbon, soil carbon, and soil respiration). We then used the trained model to forecast changes in carbon pools from 2004 to 2012. Our daily analysis of parameters indicated that all the exit rates were well constrained by the EnKF, with the exception of the exit rates controlling the loss of metabolic litter and passive soil organic matter. The poor constraint of these two parameters resulted from the low sensitivity of TECO predictions to their values and the poor correlation between these parameters and the observed variables. Using the estimated parameters, the model predictions and observations were in agreement. Model forecasts indicate 15 380-15 660 g C/m(2) stored in Duke Forest by 2012 (a 27% increase since 2004). Parameter uncertainties decreased as data were sequentially assimilated into the model using the EnKF. Uncertainties in forecast carbon sinks increased over time for the long-term carbon pools (woody biomass, structure litter, slow and passive SOM) but remained constant over time for the short-term carbon pools (foliage, fine root, metabolic litter, and microbial carbon). Overall, EnKF can effectively assimilate multiple data sets into an ecosystem model to constrain parameters, forecast dynamics of state variables, and evaluate uncertainty.","[Gao, Chao; Weng, Ensheng; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Wang, Han] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Lakshmivarahan, S.] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Comp Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Yanfen] Univ Oklahoma, Newbourne Coll Earth & Energy, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yluo@ou.edu,"Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012","Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847","Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778]","We greatly appreciate two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Recently, data assimilation has been applied to improve these models for ecological forecasting. It is not clear what the relative information contributions of model (structure and parameters) vs. data are to constraints of short-and long-term forecasting. In this study, we assimilated eight sets of 10-year data (foliage, woody, and fine root biomass, litter fall, forest floor carbon [C], microbial C, soil C, and soil respiration) collected from Duke Forest into a Terrestrial Ecosystem model (TECO). The relative information contribution was measured by Shannon information index calculated from probability density functions (PDFs) of carbon pool sizes. The null knowledge without a model or data was defined by the uniform PDF within a prior range. The relative model contribution was information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools minus that in the uniform PDF, while the relative data contribution was the information content in the PDF of modeled carbon pools after data was assimilated minus that before data assimilation. Our results showed that the information contribution of the model to constrain carbon dynamics increased with time whereas the data contribution declined. The eight data sets contributed more than the model to constrain C dynamics in foliage and fine root pools over the 100-year forecasts. The model, however, contributed more than the data sets to constrain the litter, fast soil organic matter (SOM), and passive SOM pools. For the two major C pools, woody biomass and slow SOM, the model contributed less information in the first few decades and then more in the following decades than the data. Knowledge of relative information contributions of model vs. data is useful for model development, uncertainty analysis, future data collection, and evaluation of ecological forecasting.","[Weng, Ensheng; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Weng, ES (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",wengensheng@gmail.com,"Weng, Ensheng/E-4390-2012","Weng, Ensheng/0000-0002-1858-4847","Office of Science, Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI 0850290, DEB 0840964, DEB 0743778]; Office of Science, U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-95ER62083]; Southeast Regional Center of the National Institute for Global Environmental Change [DE-FC02-03ER63613]","This research was financially supported by the Office of Science, Department of Energy, Grant No. DE-FG02-006ER64319, and through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University, under Award Number DE-FC02-06ER64158, and by the National Science Foundation under DBI 0850290, DEB 0840964, and DEB 0743778.

Root diameter distribution (a parts per thousand currency sign5 mm), root biomass density (RBD), root length density (RLD), soil pH, soil electrical conductivity and dry soil bulk density were measured on soil core samples (217) collected from a trench wall using a 20 x 20-cm grid sampling. Approximately 90% of the RBD (mean +/- standard error: 0.27 +/- 0.027 kg m(-3)) and RLD (1.57 +/- 0.023 cm cm(-3)) occurred in the top 40 cm, decreasing exponentially to a maximum rooting depth of 150 cm. RBD exhibited a vertical spatial structure associated with soil pH (p < 0.05; r(2) = 0.48), and a random lateral distribution. Coefficients of variation (CV) of RBD were high irrespective of orientation (vertical: 79-200%, lateral: 50-236%). The root extinction parameter beta (0.944) for the global model was lower (p < 0.05) than that of woodlands (beta = 0.964-0.976), indicating a shallow root distribution resembling that of grasslands (beta = 0.943). The superficial root distribution indicated subsoil chemical constraints to root growth, while high lateral variability was attributed to sparse vegetation. The findings stress the need to account for both vertical and lateral variability of roots for accurate modelling of water use and productivity on certain artificial ecosystems with sparse vegetation.","[Gwenzi, Willis; Hinz, Christoph] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Gwenzi, Willis; Veneklaas, Erik J.; Bleby, Timothy M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Holmes, Karen W.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Ecohydrol, Sch Environm Syst Engn, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Holmes, Karen W.] Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Phillips, Ian R.] Alcoa World Alumina Australia, Pinjarra, WA 6208, Australia","Gwenzi, W (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway Crawley, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",wgwenzi@yahoo.co.uk,"Veneklaas, Erik J/C-8907-2009; Hinz, Christoph/I-5455-2014","Veneklaas, Erik J/0000-0002-7030-4056; Gwenzi, Willis/0000-0003-3149-1052; Hinz, Christoph/0000-0003-0691-7402",Ex-Australian Centre for Mining Environmental Research; University of Western Australia through the Scholarship for International Research Fees (SIRF); University Postgraduate Award (International Student) (UPAIS); Ad-hoc top-up scholarship,"The authors thank the anonymous reviewers whose insightful critique of the manuscript significantly improved it.

We tackle these questions with a model of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis that regards the mutualism outcome as a result of biochemical negotiations between the plant and its nodules. We explore the fitness consequences of this mechanism to the plant and rhizobia and obtain four main results. First, negotiations permit the plant to differentially reward more-cooperative rhizobia-a phenomenon termed ""plant sanctions""-but only when more-cooperative rhizobia also provide the plant with good outside options during negotiations with other nodules. Second, negotiations may result in seemingly paradoxical cases where the plant is worse off when it has a ""choice"" between two strains of rhizobia than when infected by either strain alone. Third, even when sanctions are effective, they are by themselves not sufficient to maintain cooperative rhizobia in a population: less cooperative strains always have an advantage at the population level. Finally, partner fidelity feedback, together with genetic correlations between a rhizobium strain's cooperativeness and the outside options it provides, can maintain cooperative rhizobia. Our results show how joint control over the outcome of a mutualism through the proximate mechanism of negotiation can affect the evolutionary dynamics of interspecific cooperation.","[Akcay, Erol] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Simms, Ellen L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Akcay, E (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",erol@nimbios.org,"Akcay, Erol/G-3167-2011","Akcay, Erol/0000-0001-8149-7124",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0645791]; U.S. Department of Homeland SecurityUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS); U.S. Department of Agriculture through National Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0832858],"The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), where E.

However, the relative importance of each covariate on root survivorship is not clear. Here, we used minirhizotron-based data from 18 woody species to evaluate the relative strength of influence on root survivorship by root diameter, branch order, soil depth, and season of root birth, and to examine how the relationship between each covariate and root survivorship differed across species. We extracted hazard ratio estimates for 16 species from published studies that performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and from our own unpublished data for two Chinese temperate tree species. The mean change in hazard ratio (CHR) and corresponding coefficient of variation for each factor were calculated across species. On average, root diameter and season of root birth had stronger effects on root survivorship than branch order and soil depth. However, the effects of season varied with species and were stronger in temperate forests, whereas the influence of diameter and order were relatively consistent across species. These results suggest that root structures such as diameter and branch order should be carefully considered in root classification and sampling, and adding season of birth (particularly in temperate forests) as a covariate in root survivorship analysis should further enhance our ability in achieving a better understanding of root demography and more accurate estimates of root turnover in forests of different climate zones.","[Guo, Dali] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dali] Peking Univ, Key Lab Sci & Technol Urban Environm, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jiacun; Wang, Zhengquan] NE Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Tree Genet Improvement & Biotechno, Minist Educ, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shuiqiang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Resources & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, NE Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China","Guo, DL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",dlguo@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012; Guo, Dali/G-2158-2014",,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DL09BA07]; National Basic Research ProjectNational Basic Research Program of China [2008ZX07314-005-003]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30870418, 30130160]; One-hundred Talent Program of Shenzhen","This work was supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (DL09BA07), National Basic Research Project (2008ZX07314-005-003), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30870418 and 30130160), and the One-hundred Talent Program of Shenzhen.

We aimed to describe AM fungal communities associating with a single host-plant species across a wide geographical area, including the plant's native, invasive and experimentally introduced ranges. We hypothesized that an alien AM plant associates primarily with the geographically widespread generalist AM fungal taxa present in a novel range. Location Europe, China. Methods We transplanted the palm Trachycarpus fortunei into nine European sites where it does not occur as a native species, into one site where it is naturalized (Switzerland), and into one glasshouse site. We harvested plant roots after two seasons. In addition, we sampled palms at three sites in the plant's native range (China). Roots were subjected to DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 454 sequencing of AM fungal sequences. We analysed fungal communities with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and cluster analysis and studied the frequency of geographically widespread fungal taxa with log-linear analysis. We compared fungal communities in the roots of the palm with those in resident plants at one site in the introduced range (Estonia) where natural AM fungal communities had previously been studied. Results We recorded a total of 73 AM fungal taxa. AM fungal communities in the native and introduced ranges differed from one another, while those in the invasive range contained taxa present in both other ranges. Geographically widespread AM fungal taxa were over-represented in palm roots in all regions, but especially in the introduced range. At the Estonian site, the palm was colonized by the same community of widespread AM fungal taxa as associate with resident habitat-generalist plants; by contrast, resident forest-specialist plants were colonized by a diverse community of widespread and other AM fungal taxa. Main conclusions AM fungal communities in the native, invasive and experimentally introduced ranges varied in taxonomic composition and richness, but they shared a pool of geographically widespread, non-host-specific taxa that might support the invasion of a generalist alien plant. Our dataset provides the first geographical overview of AM taxon distributions obtained using a single host-plant species.","[Moora, Mari; Davison, John; Oepik, Maarja; Vanatoa, Elise; Zobel, Martin] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Berger, Silje] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Geobot, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Bommarco, Riccardo] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Kuehn, Ingolf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Kunin, William E.] Univ Leeds, Earth & Biosphere Inst, IICB, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Metsis, Madis; Truusa, Merilin] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ctr Biol Integrated Syst, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Metsis, Madis; Truusa, Merilin] BiotaP LLC, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Rortais, Agnes] CNRS, Lab Evolut Geomes & Speciat, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Vanatoa, Alo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Stout, Jane C.] Trin Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Westphal, Catrin] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Working Grp Anim Populat Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Walther, Gian-Reto] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Moora, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",mari.moora@ut.ee,"Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Westphal, Catrin/F-9560-2015; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Kuhn, Ingolf/B-9756-2009; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Zobel, Martin/H-1336-2015; Bommarco, Riccardo/E-7109-2016; Stout, Jane C/B-1631-2010","Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Westphal, Catrin/0000-0002-2615-1339; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Kuhn, Ingolf/0000-0003-1691-8249; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Zobel, Martin/0000-0001-7957-6704; Bommarco, Riccardo/0000-0001-8888-0476; Stout, Jane C/0000-0002-2027-0863","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [GOCE-CT-2003-506675]; Estonian Science Foundation, (University of Tartu)Eesti Teadusfond (ETF) [7371, 7366, 7738, SF0180098s08]; BiotaP LLC [EU 27552]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [GLOBAM, PERG03-GA-2008-231034]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence FIBIR)European Union (EU); Tallinn University of Technology; BEF-China; German Science Foundation (DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 891/1]","This research was funded by the European Commission within the FP 6 Integrated Project ALARM 'Assessing LArge scale environmental Risks for biodiversity with tested Methods' (GOCE-CT-2003-506675), by the Estonian Science Foundation grants 7371, 7366, 7738, SF0180098s08 (University of Tartu), an Enterprise Estonia grant EU 27552 (BiotaP LLC), a Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme (GLOBAM, PERG03-GA-2008-231034) and by the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence FIBIR).

The somatic chromosome number of B. auricomum (2n = 38) is reported for the first time. Polysomaty was prevalent in all seed-derived plants studied except two (SC34 and SC42). It was noted that in addition to normal diploid cells occurring in different frequencies (60% in SC21 to 89% in SC22, SC35), root tip cells also showed chromosome numbers < 38 (in 0-37% metaphases) and > 38 (in 0-33% metaphases). The chromosomes of B. auricomum are very small (0.7-2.7 mu m) in size. The karyotype of diploid B. auricomum showed 34 chromosomes with primary constriction (14 M + 16 m + 4sm) and 4 chromosomes with secondary constrictions (sm:sm). Of the 50 plants analyzed, 2 (SC34 and SC42) were polyploid, showing 70 and 62 chromosomes in the root tip cells. The polyploidization in seed-derived plants clearly indicates the heterogeneous nature of orchid seed stock. Early detection of polyploidization in in vitro-propagated B. auricomum is valuable for conservation of this native endangered orchid species. On the other hand, the clonally propagated plants retained the chromosomal status of parent plants. This protocol could be exploited to protect this native endangered orchid species from natural extinction.","[Myo Ma Ma Than; Jha, Sumita] Univ Calcutta, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Studies, Kolkata 700019, India; [Pal, Amita] Bose Inst, Div Plant Biol, Kolkata 700054, India; [Myo Ma Ma Than] Mingalardon Orchid Garden, Yangon, Myanmar","Jha, S (reprint author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Bot, Ctr Adv Studies, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, India.",sjbot@caluniv.ac.in,"Jha, Sumita/D-3319-2016; Pal, Amita/H-7660-2019; Jha, Sumita/B-6786-2014","Jha, Sumita/0000-0002-1375-2768; Jha, Sumita/0000-0002-1375-2768","OWSDW (Formerly the Third World Organization for Women in Science, TWOWS), Italy","M.

Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey (bottlebrush squirreltail) is an important component of sagebrush-steppe communities in the northern Intermountain West, United States. We evaluated 32 accessions of E. elymoides subspecies C, a newly recognized unnamed taxon, in the field and greenhouse. Our objectives were to assess genetic diversity for putatively adaptive traits, to elucidate biological relationships among biomass, morphological, and phenological traits through correlation analysis, and to gather evidence suggesting whether these traits might be truly adaptive, that is, related to collection-site variables. We observed a positive correlation (r = 0.73; p < 0.01) between greenhouse shoot and root biomass among accessions, suggesting that shoot and root biomass are not in an inherent trade-off relationship across accessions. In addition, accessions with higher greenhouse shoot biomass possessed lower specific leaf area (r = -0.43; p < 0.05) and lower specific root length (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). Correlations between greenhouse and field-measured productivity traits were not significant (p > 0.05), indicating seedling performance is not predictive of mature-plant performance. Elevation was the collection-site variable most closely correlated with plant-measured traits, particularly phenological dates, whereas average annual precipitation was the least significant variable. Therefore, elevation may be used as an easily applied metric to match subspecies C plant material to restoration site in the northern Intermountain West.","[Parsons, Matthew C.; Jones, Thomas A.; Monaco, Thomas A.] Utah State Univ, Forage & Range Res Lab, ARS, USDA, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Jones, TA (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Forage & Range Res Lab, ARS, USDA, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Thomas.Jones@ars.usda.gov,,,Bureau of Land Management; United States Forest Service through the Great Basin Native Plant Selection; Increase Project,"We would like to thank the many helpers and collaborators who had a hand in making this study possible.

One example is the soil organic amendment sugar beet waste. The fermented Aspergillus niger-sugar beet waste (ASB) increases growth and P uptake by the AM mycelium in soil whereas non-fermented waste (SB) had a strong inhibitory effect. The underlying mechanisms are not understood. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify differences in composition of water extracts of ASB and SB. The chromatograms showed that ferulic acid was present in SB and absent in ASS. We compared the effects of the water extracts of SB and ASB and ferulic acid upon the growth of Glomus intra radices in in vitro monoxenic cultures. Hyphal growth of the AM fungus G. intraradices was extremely reduced in ferulic acid and SB treatments. Moreover, AM hyphae appeared disorganized, undulated and tangled. In contrast, ASB increased hyphal length and numbers of branched absorbing structures and of spores. We conclude that ferulic acid is one compound in SB which is responsible for its inhibition of AM extraradical growth. The relevance of these findings is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities have not been well studied in this context. AM fungi are abundant in most soils, forming symbiotic root-associations with many plant species. Commercial AM fungal inocula are increasingly spread worldwide, because of potentially beneficial effects on plant growth. In contrast, some invasive plant species, such as the non-mycorrhizal Alliaria petiolata, can negatively influence AM fungi. In a greenhouse study we examined changes in the structure of a local Canadian AM fungal community in response to inoculation by foreign AM fungi and the manipulated presence/absence of A. petiolata. We expected A. petiolata to have a stronger effect on the local AM fungal community than the addition of foreign AM fungal isolates. Molecular analyses indicated that inoculated foreign AM fungi successfully established and decreased molecular diversity of the local AM fungal community in host roots. A. petiolata did not affect molecular diversity, but reduced AM fungal growth in the greenhouse study and in a in vitro assay. Our findings suggest that both introduced plants and exotic AM fungi can have negative impacts on local AM fungi.","[Koch, Alexander M.; Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia, Irving K Barber Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Biol & Phys Geog, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Koch, Alexander M.; Antunes, Pedro M.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Barto, E.

Reducing photoperiod did not result in bud formation or shoot inhibition although it increased the number of lateral shoots.

The module includes simulations of bacteria, mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi. The inclusion of these soil organisms allows for the simulation of several soil biological processes in a more mechanistic way. In this paper the soil module is used in combination with the forest model ANAFORE (ANAlysing Forest Ecosystems) a stand-scale forest model that simulates wood tissue development, carbon (C) and water (H(2)O) fluxes dynamically from physiological principles. Although the main purpose of this paper is the model description, a showcase run of the new soil model was performed using a Bayesian parameterization procedure for 16 forest sites (pedunculate oak, beech, Scots pine and poplar) on different soils in Belgium. Emphasis was on the soil organic horizons formation. The results show that one single parameter set could be used for the different forests in the study, and yielded reasonably close fits for most sites concerning pH and formation of the humus layer. Although running the Bayesian procedure to obtain good input parameter distributions was time-consuming (several months), runs using the developed parameter set are reasonably fast (days). These results are promising. However, the high uncertainty of both the input and the output of the model indicates that it is mainly useful as an experimental tool, rather than a predictive instrument. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our results showed that the AMF species Glomus diaphanum stimulated host plant growth more than the other three AMF species did when the plants were grown individually.

Irrigation is necessary for high productivity of poplar plantations in semi-arid northwest China. Moreover, plowing is essential for improving soil quality and reducing evaporation. In the present study, the influences of irrigation and plowing on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux were investigated in poplar plantations in 2007 and 2008. The experiments included three stand age classes receiving three treatments: control, irrigation, and plowing. Mean soil respiration in irrigation treatment stands was 5.47, 4.86, and 4.43 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) in 3-, 8-, and 15-year-old stands, respectively, during the growing season. In contrast, mean soil respiration in control stands was 3.71, 3.83, and 3.98 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) in 3-, 8-, and 15-year-old stands, respectively. During the entire observation period, mean soil respiration in plowing treatment stands increased by 36.2% compared with that in the control stands. Mean soil respiration in irrigation treatment stands was significantly higher than that in the control stands; this was mainly because fine root growth and decomposer activities were greatly depressed by soil drought, since natural precipitation could not meet their water demands. The results also suggest that plowing management can greatly increase soil CO2 emission by modifying soil structure. After plowing, soil bulk density decreased and soil aeration was greatly improved, leading to greater rates of oxidation and mineralization.","[Yan, Meifang; Zhang, Xinshi] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yan, Meifang; Zhang, Xinshi; Jiang, Yuan; Zhou, Guangsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Yan, MF (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",b09100@bnu.edu.cn,,,"Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology [2009-TD-03]; Beijing Normal University; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40625015, 30770413]","This work was jointly supported by the Project of the Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (2009-TD-03), Beijing Normal University, and the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 40625015, 30770413).

We investigated the impact of these factors for the community assembly of the root-symbiont arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) by sampling roots from geothermal and nonthermal grasslands in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), followed by sequencing and RFLP of AMF ribosomal DNA. With the exception of an apparent generalist RFLP type closely related to Glomus intraradices, a distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that the AMF community composition correlated with soil pH or pH-driven changes in soil chemistry. This was unexpected, given the large differences in soil temperature and plant community composition between the geothermal and nonthermal grasslands. RFLP types were found in either the acidic geothermal grasslands or in the neutral to alkaline grasslands, one of which was geothermal. The direct effect of the soil chemical environment on the distribution of two AMF morphospecies isolated from acidic geothermal grasslands was supported in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Paraglomus occultum and Scutellospora pellucida were more beneficial to plants and formed significantly more spores when grown in acidic than in alkaline soil. Distance among grasslands, used as an estimate of dispersal limitations, was not a significant predictor of AMF community similarity within YNP, and most fungal taxa may be part of a metacommunity. The isolation of several viable AMF taxa from bison feces indicates that wide-ranging bison could be a vector for at least some RFLP types among grasslands within YNP. In support of classical niche theory and the Baas-Becking hypothesis, our results suggest that AMF are not limited by dispersal at the scale of YNP, but that the soil environment appears to be the primary factor affecting community composition and distribution.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Meadow, James; Zabinski, Catherine A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Redecker, Dirk] Univ Bourgogne, INRA, UMR MSE, F-21000 Dijon, France","Lekberg, Y (reprint author), MPG Ranch, 725 W Alder St,Suite 11, Missoula, MT 59802 USA.",ylva.lekberg@gmail.com,,"Meadow, James/0000-0002-5568-1283","Thermal Biology Institute; Montana Space Grant Consortium; Marie CurieEuropean Union (EU); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516227]; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STARUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R833835]","We are grateful to the Thermal Biology Institute and the Montana Space Grant Consortium for financial support, to Yellowstone National Park permit personnel for help with research permits, to Jonas Mulder-Rosi for help during fieldwork, and to Karin Neff for conducting the plant identification.

Objectives The goal of this study was to characterize the response of beech seedlings to planting stress and to test if soil amendment with a mixture of hydrogel and the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus could rescue the establishment of stressed plants. For this purpose, bare-rooted, dormant seedlings were exposed for 0, 2 and 6 h to air before planting. Results Water loss in response to air exposure caused increasing concentrations of soluble carbohydrates in buds and fine roots suggesting only passive of osmoprotection. Short-term exposure for 2 h delayed bud burst in spring, whereas long-term stress for 6 h also increased mortality. Growth of the seedlings in amended soil improved plant performance compared with plant grown in untreated soil. In particular, mycorrhizal colonization, plant water status and biomass increased, whereas carbohydrate storage pools were decreased. Total plant nitrogen allocated to leaves but not the nitrogen or carbohydrate concentrations were correlated with the degree of ectomycorrhizal colonization. Conclusion This suggests that soil amendment enhanced nitrogen uptake via ectomycorrhizals, which in turn stimulated growth, thereby, increasing carbon consumption and preventing starch accumulation. In conclusion, soil amendment with hydrogel and an ectomycorrhizal fungus significantly improved the performance of both stressed and unstressed young beech trees.","[Beniwal, Rajender S.; Polle, Andrea] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Polle, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",apolle@gwdg.de,,,"Bundesland Rheinland-Pfalz; KLIFF (Klimafolgenforschung, Federal Government of Lower Saxony via the VW Stiftung); Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)","We are grateful to the Bundesland Rheinland-Pfalz and to KLIFF (Klimafolgenforschung, Federal Government of Lower Saxony via the VW Stiftung) for providing financial support to the beech project and to the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) for funding the doctoral research for R.

Predictions were made from 18 trembling aspens (Populus tremuloides Michx.) equally distributed on six sampling sites using multiple linear regressions with soil Al, Cu, and Zn speciation data and chemical and microbial properties as explanatory variables. Fine root Al, Cu, and Zn concentrations ranged, respectively, from 2137 to 7480, from 7.03 to 206, and from 41.2 to 360 mu g.g dry root mass(-1). No significant prediction was obtained for Al. The soil total water-soluble Cu and Zn concentrations better predicted the metal concentrations in fine roots than the concentration of labile metal species. The concentrations of reactive Zn, water-soluble organic C, and NH4(+) together with microbial biomass of N were the other significant explanatory variables. The best regression models for Cu and Zn were obtained in the rhizosphere and explained, respectively, 79.2% and 95.7% of the variation of metal concentrations in fine roots.

The gopher rockfish, Sebastes carnatus, and black-and-yellow rockfish, S. chrysomelas, are sympatrically distributed temperate marine species inhabiting rocky reefs and kelp forests on the west coast of the United States. Prior studies documented low levels of genetic divergence between the two species, except at a single microsatellite locus that displayed high divergence, Sra.7-2. To better characterize genome wide divergence, we scored 25 additional microsatellite loci. Mean neutral divergence between species (F-ST = 0.01) changed little from prior estimates. Sra.7-2 continued to be an extreme divergence outlier. Five novel microsatellites within +/- 15 kb of Sra.7-2 were characterized. High divergence, consistently low diversity in S. chrysomelas, and linkage disequilibrium were detected at these loci, suggesting the influence of recent selection. However, coalescent modelling of divergence at neutral and Sra.7-2 regions showed that initial divergence at Sra.7-2 was ancient, likely predating divergence at neutral regions. It is therefore unlikely that Sra.7-2 divergence represents solely recent ecological divergence within one species and may represent the action of recurrent selection. Introgressive gene flow (2N(E)m) was much higher (>> 1) at neutral than Sra.7-2 regions (<< 1) despite evidence that two S. carnatus individuals have recently mixed ancestry at the Sra.7-2 region. The Sra.7-2 genomic region is likely one of several regions containing genes involved in initiating and maintaining species integrity. Completion of the final stages of speciation appears to be a slow and ongoing process for these species.","[Buonaccorsi, Vincent P.; Karkoska, Kristine A.; Gregory, Steven; Deptola, Travis; Weimer, Alexander B.] Juniata Coll, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA; [Narum, Shawn R.] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, Hagerman, ID 83332 USA","Buonaccorsi, VP (reprint author), Juniata Coll, 1700 Moore St, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA.",buonaccorsi@juniata.edu,,,Juniata College; William J. von Liebig Foundation,"Samples were kindly provided from Russ Vetter, John Hyde, Eric Lynn, and Carol Kimbrell at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, La Jolla CA.

Shrub encroachment of these open woodlands is currently recommended to guarantee the persistence of the system, due to the nursery effect of shrubs on tree seedling. However, the increase in abundance and cover of a shrub understory in these water limited woodlands could bring consequences to tree overstory functioning. The present study analyzes the physiological status of scattered Quercus ilex L trees in paired adjacent plots with and without the presence of a shrubby understory in CW Spain. Two contrasting shrub strategies were addressed in order to take into account possible species-specific effects: a dense-shallow rooting shrub (Cistus landanifer L) and a sparse-deep rooting shrub (Retama sphaerocarpa (L) Boiss). Leaf water potential (at predawn and midday), leaf gas exchange parameters (net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance), leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll fluorescence transients (maximum photochemical efficiency and performance index, sensu Strasser et al., 2004) were measured during three consecutive summers. Trees growing with Cistus as understory showed significant lower leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange parameters, leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll photochemical efficiency than trees growing without shrub competence. However, the presence of the legume Retama did not affect significantly the physiological state of Q. ilex. Thus, we conclude that the presence of a shrubby understory has the potential to modify the functioning of scattered trees, but these effects are species-specific. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In a greenhouse experiment in French Guiana we studied the combined effects of the presence of tropical tree seedlings and of distinct litter composition on mass and nitrogen (N) loss from decomposing litter and on microbial biomass. Different litter mixtures decomposed for 435 days in pots filled with sand and containing an individual seedling from one of four different tree species. We found both additive and negative non-additive effects (NAE) of litter mixing on mass loss, whereas N loss showed negative and positive NAE of litter mixing. If litter from the two tree species, Platonia insignis and Goupia glabra were present, litter mixtures showed more positive and more negative NAE on N loss, respectively. Overall, decomposition, and in particular non-additive effects, were only weakly affected by the presence of tree seedlings. Litter mass loss weakly yet significantly decreased with increasing fine root biomass in presence of Goupia seedlings, but not in the presence of seedlings of any other tree species. Our results showed strong litter composition effects and also clear, mostly negative, non-additive effects on mass loss and N loss. Species identity of tree seedlings can modify litter decomposition, but these live plant effects remain quantitatively inferior to litter composition effects.","[Coq, Sylvain; Haettenschwiler, Stephan] CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Weigel, Jean] ENGREF AgroParisTech Kourou, UMR Ecol Forets Guyane, F-97387 Kourou, Guyane, France; [Butenschoen, Olaf] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bonal, Damien] INRA, UMR Ecol Forets Guyane, F-97387 Kourou, Guyane, France","Coq, S (reprint author), CNRS Univ Joseph Fourier, LECA, BP 53, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France.",sylvain.coq@gmail.com,,"Butenschoen, Olaf/0000-0003-1866-9805",CNRS (SDV)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"We thank Bruno Buatois, Raphaelle Leclerc and Laurette Sonie for laboratory support, Pascal Petronelli, Jocelyn Cazal, and Audin Patient for their help in seed, seedling and litter collections, Patrick Schevin, Jocelyn Cazal, Nicolas Fanin, Jeremy Cigna, Audin Patient, and Saintano Dufort for help during the final harvest, Benoit Burban for the light measurements in the greenhouse, and Sandra Barantal and Tanya Handa for stimulating discussions.

Our objective was to determine the effect of land management on the root distribution and herbage production of mountain grassland. A field experiment was conducted on the Haplic Cambisol Dystric soil from 2004 to 2007. The treatments considered the use of separate meadows as follows: one without any fertilizers (MC), one with mineral fertilization (MM), another with organic fertilization (MSM), a sheep-grazed pasture (PP) and an abandoned meadow (MA). Botanical composition, herbage yield and root morphology in terms of root length density, mean root diameter, specific root length and root dry matter were determined. The different land management regimes used in the experiment affected the herbage production. Sheep pens (PP) and all treatments with mineral or organic fertilization (MM and MSM) increased dry matter yields (5.95 t DM ha(-1) in average) in comparison with meadow without any fertilization (3.08 t DM ha(-1)). The highest herbage production was obtained from the meadow with mineral fertilization, which was 6.51 t DM ha(-1). The land management treatments also affected the botanical composition. Mineral N fertilization decreased the percentage of legume and small grass species which were replaced by tall grasses such as Festuca pratensis, Poa pratensis and Agropyron repens. Sheep manure decreased the occurrence of Deshampsia ceaspitosa. At the untreated control there was observed the increasing in percentage of Festuca rubra. The treatments applied in the experiment resulted not only in above ground plant yields and botanical composition but also affected root distribution and morphology. The effect of land management on root dry matter distribution was observed only in the upper, 0-5 cm, soil layer. The highest values (above 0.0100 g cm(-3)) were observed for the MC, PP and MA treatments with respect to 0.0067 g cm(-3) from plants with sheep manure fertilization (MSM). The non-fertilized control (MC) had the highest root length (56.27 cm cm(-3)) but only in the 0-10 cm soil layer, whereas for the other treatments (MM, MSM, PP and MA) it was usually below 40 cm cm(-3). Root diameter was greater (0.26 mm in average) in the MM, PP and MA treatments with respect to roots from non-fertilized plots and those receiving sheep manure (0.22 mm in average).

Plants were grown in Cu-treated soils (0, 100 or 500 mg Cu kg(-1)), either with or without SB application, and inoculated with: (i) Cu-adapted Glomeromycotan fungi (GA); (ii) Glomus claroideum (GC); or (iii) no fungus (uninoculated). Application of SB amendment increased shoot biomass 2-8-fold with respect to the unamended soils, and allowed the survival of non-mycorrhizal- and GC-inoculated plants, even at the highest Cu level. Additionally, SB application increased shoot Cu content at higher Cu levels and shoot P content especially at lower Cu levels. In general, compared to GC-inoculated plants, GA inoculation caused a decrease in both superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase antioxidant enzyme activities in shoots (up to levels of 100 mg Cu kg(-1)), as well as glutathione reductase and catalase activities (up to 500 mg Cu kg(-1)). Finally, in SB treated plants, GA colonization was higher as compared to GC-inoculated plants, especially at the highest Cu level. These results suggest a relevant role of Glomeromycotan fungal populations isolated from Cu-polluted environments in the alleviation of Cu toxicity that could allow their use in remediation programs for Cu-polluted soils.

After 33 weeks, the seedlings were outplanted into a plantation as monocultures (monocrops) or interplanted with Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden (polycrops). Observations on root nodulation, tree growth and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (N(2) fixation) were made during the nursery phase and for 5 y (1998-2003) after outplanting. Four benefits of inoculation were identified. First, it led to the production of tubed stock that was significantly (P < 0.05) superior to uninoculated plants in abundance of nodulation, in the proportion of total shoot nitrogen (N) derived from atmospheric N(2) and in shoot dry matter. Second, after outplanting, survival of inoculated plants was significantly higher than survival of uninoculated tubed stock. Third, after outplanting, the difference in size between inoculated and uninoculated acacias that had been observed in the nursery was maintained in the plantation. (However, differences were not significant from 2002, i.e. 4 y after outplanting.) Fourth, E. nitens interplanted with inoculated A. mearnsii grew significantly better than eucalypts grown with uninoculated acacias. Acacias that were interplanted with eucalypts had consistently greater diameters than monocropped acacias; by 2003 (5 y after outplanting), the difference was statistically significant. In addition, interplanting of inoculated acacias with eucalypts (polycropping) conferred a growth benefit on the E. nitens by comparison with eucalypts grown as a monocrop. In terms of total timber production, the treatment in which E. nitens was interplanted with inoculated A. mearnsii was more productive than any other. These differences were attributed to the improved N economy within the inoculated treatments stemming from the nitrogen-fixing ability of the three original inoculant strains. Eucalypts also benefitted from interplanting with uninoculated acacias. It is concluded that the use of well-nodulated, N(2)-fixing nursery-grown tubed stock provides opportunities for efficient establishment of acacias in plantations and farm forestry and for revegetation, especially in riparian situations.","[Brockwell, John] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Mitchell, Peter A.] SE Fibre Exports, Eden, NSW 2551, Australia; [Leach, Elainne M.

It has been observed that in northern NSW most seedling deaths occur within the first four weeks of planting. Reducing the rate that plants become stressed is important as less-stressed plants are more capable of exploiting available soil moisture required for survival beyond this four-week period. The health (leaf gas exchange, visual symptoms of leaf and stem wilt) and survival of Eucalyptus pilularis Smith seedlings and cuttings were examined following the application of water in the form of either a hydrogel solution or as irrigation. The main findings were that the rate at which stress developed was slower for cuttings than for seedlings; and that supplying more water, either as hydrogel or irrigation, reduced transplant stress and prolonged survival. Differences in morphology between seedlings and cuttings may explain why cuttings developed stress more slowly than did seedlings. Compared with seedlings, cuttings had reduced leaf area, an increased root : shoot ratio and lower leaf area : root dry mass ratio, all of which are traits that enhance water uptake and reduce water loss. The most effective treatments for reducing stress of seedlings and cuttings were either removing individual seedlings or cuttings from nursery trays and dipping the root ball into a 100% saturated hydrogel solution which coated it with a layer of saturated hydrogel, or supplying the equivalent volume of water as irrigation when transplanting the plants. Drenching nursery trays in 25% and 50% unsaturated hydrogel solutions prior to the removal of the plants delayed stress of transplanted cuttings to a similar extent as the 100% saturated hydrogel solution, but these solutions were ineffective in delaying stress in seedlings. It is thought the more open structure of the soil medium used for cuttings allowed the unsaturated hydrogel solutions to enter the root-ball during root drenching, and because the hydrogel solutions are more viscous than water the drainage of the solutions after removing the nursery trays from the root drench was reduced.","[Thomas, D.

Recent research has shown increases in species richness of mutualistic soil fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to be related to increases in aboveground productivity of plant communities. However, the impact of AMF richness on plant-plant interactions has not been determined. Moreover, it is unknown whether species-rich AMF communities can act as insurance to maintain productivity in a fluctuating environment (e.g., upon changing soil conditions). We tested the impact of four different AMF taxa and of AMF diversity (no AMF, single AMF taxa, and all four together) on competitive interactions between the legume Trifolium pratense and the grass Lolium multiflorum grown under two different soil conditions of low and high sand content. We hypothesized that more diverse mutualistic interactions (e.g., when four AMF taxa are present) can ease competitive effects between plants, increase plant growth, and maintain plant productivity across different soil environments. We used quantitative PCR to verify that AMF taxa inoculated at the beginning of the experiment were still present at the end. The presence of AMF reduced the competitive inequality between the two plant species by reducing the growth suppression of the legume by the grass. High AMF richness enhanced the combined biomass production of the two plant species and the yield of the legume, particularly in the more productive soil with low sand content. In the less productive (high sand content) soil, the single most effective AMF had an equally beneficial effect on plant productivity as the mixture of four AMF. Since contributions of single AMF to plant productivity varied between both soils, higher AMF richness would be required to maintain plant productivity in heterogeneous environments. Overall this work shows that AMF diversity promotes plant productivity and that AMF diversity can act as insurance to sustain plant productivity under changing environmental conditions.","[Wagg, Cameron; Stadler, Marina; van der Heijden, Marcel G.

In this study, we examined the relationship between exploration types of ectomycorrhizal fungi and root density. We did so by sampling across a root density gradient formed by the edge-interior transition on 'tree islands', patches of ectomycorrhizal forest in a non-ectomycorrhizal vegetation matrix. We found evidence that long-distance exploration types were more prevalent in areas of low root density while short-distance exploration types were more common in areas of high root density. Gradients in root density are common in ectomycorrhizal forests and change predictably at forest edges, within a soil profile, or over early succession. Based on these results, we propose a general model using the concept of exploration types that could explain some of the spatial or temporal patterns commonly observed in ectomycorrhizal assemblages.

The disturbance regime can be natural or anthropogenic with varying intensity and frequency that differ temporally and spatially the boreal forest. The objective of this review was to synthesize the literature on C dynamics of North American boreal forests after most common disturbances, stand replacing wildfire and clearcut logging. Forest ecosystem C is stored in four major pools: live biomass, dead biomass, organic soil horizons, and mineral soil. Carbon cycling among these pools is inter-related and largely determined by disturbance type and time since disturbance. Following a stand replacing disturbance, (1) live biomass increases rapidly leading to the maximal biomass stage, then stabilizes or slightly declines at old-growth or gap dynamics stage at which late-successional tree species dominate the stand; (2) dead woody material carbon generally follows a U-shaped pattern during succession; (3) forest floor carbon increases throughout stand development; and (4) mineral soil carbon appears to be more or less stable throughout stand development. Wildfire and harvesting differ in many ways, fire being more of a chemical and harvesting a mechanical disturbance. Fire consumes forest floor and small live vegetation and foliage, whereas logging removes large stems. Overall, the effects of the two disturbances on C dynamics in boreal forest are poorly understood. There is also a scarcity of literature dealing with C dynamics of plant coarse and fine roots, understory vegetation, small-sized and buried dead material, forest floor, and mineral soil.","[Seedre, Meelis; Chen, Han Y.

SON also affects the amounts and turnover rates of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pools. Although there is increasing awareness of the impact of the nitrogen (N) cycle on the carbon (C) cycle, the extent of this interaction and the implications for soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics are still under debate. Therefore, present knowledge about the inter-relationships of the soil cycles of C and N as well as current ideas about SON stabilization are summarized in this paper in order to develop an advanced concept of the role of N on C sequestration. Modeling global C-cycling, it was already recognized that SON and SOC are closely coupled via biomass production and degradation. However, the narrow C/N ratio of mature soil organic matter (SOM) shows further that the impact of SON on the refractory SOM is beyond that of determining the size of the active cycling entities. It affects the quantity of the slow cycling pool and as a major contributor it also determines its chemical composition. Although the chemical nature of SON is still not very well understood, both improved classical wet chemical analyses and modern spectroscopic techniques provide increasing evidence that almost the entire organic N in fire-unaffected soils is bound in peptide-like compounds and to a lesser extent in amino sugars. This clearly points to the conclusion, that such compounds have greater importance for SOM formation than previously assumed. Based on published papers, I suggest that peptides even have a key function in the C-sequestration process. Although the mechanisms involved in their medium and long-term stabilization are far from understood, the immobilization of these biomolecules seems to determine the chemistry and functionality of the slow cycling SOM fraction and even the potential of a soil to act as a C sink. Pyrogenic organic N, which derives mostly from incomplete combustion of plant and litter peptides is another under-rated player in soil organic matter preservation. In fire-prone regions, its formation represents a major N stabilization mechanism, leading to the accumulation of heterocyclic aromatic N, the stability of which is still not elaborated. The concept of peptide-like compounds as a key in SOM-sequestration implies that for an improved evaluation of the potential of soils as C-sinks our research focus as to be directed to a better understanding of their chemistry and of the mechanisms which are responsible for their resistance against biochemical degradation in soils.

We tested this hypothesis in the context of soil microbial communities by comparing the effects of Centaurea stoebe and the root exudate (+/-)-catechin, on ammonification and nitrification in both the non-native and native ranges of this species. In a non-native range (Montana), soil nitrate (NO(3) (-)) concentrations were lower in invaded than uninvaded grasslands. This did not appear to be due only to higher uptake rates as both C. stoebe plants and catechin significantly reduced resin extractable NO(3) (-), the maximum rate of nitrification, and gross nitrification in Montana soils. Thus, reduced NO(3) (-) in invaded communities may be due in part to the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria by secondary metabolites produced by C. stoebe. The effects of C. stoebe on N-related processes were different in Romanian grasslands, where C. stoebe is native. In Romanian soil, C. stoebe had no effect on resin extractable NH(4) (+) or NO(3) (-) (compared to other plant species), the maximum rate of nitrification, nor gross nitrification. A relatively high concentration of catechin reduced the maximum rate of nitrification in situ, but substantially less than in Montana. In vivo, gross ammonification was lowest when treated with catechin. Our results suggest biogeographic differences in the way a plant species alters nitrogen cycling through the direct effects of root exudates and adds to a growing body of literature demonstrating the important belowground effects of invasive plants.","[Thorpe, Andrea S.] Inst Appl Ecol, Corvallis, OR 97339 USA; [Thorpe, Andrea S.; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Thorpe, AS (reprint author), Inst Appl Ecol, POB 2855, Corvallis, OR 97339 USA.",andrea@appliedeco.org,,,Montana Department of Agriculture Noxious Weeds Trust; John W.

Image comparison and similarity evaluation has become part of the information market and it is today a common part of, for example, web search engines. The cork oak tree (Quercus suber L.), the dominant species of the 'montado' woodland system is, due to its cultural and socio-economic value, protected by law that prevents extensive destructive studies on an essential part of the tree-the root. Especially in the Mediterranean zone, where the water is the limiting growth factor, the root development studies are of significant interest. In this work we present a method of using digital images for cork oak coarse root systems-evaluation by means of digital imaging. Acquired images of structural roots are processed automatically to prevent subjective decisions by the human observer. The performance of the method, its potential for semantic retrieval and similarity assessment is demonstrated, having as example eight young cork oak root systems, and critical issues for evaluation and conclusion-making, are discussed.","[Surovy, P.; Ribeiro, N.

Plants of this family are multiplied by in vitro assimbiotic conditions and little is known about the role of these microorganisms for ex vitro acclimatization. Four auxin-producing rhizobacteria isolated from the specie Cattleya walkeriana were evaluated for their ability to promote survival and growth of in vitro germinated plantlets during ex vitro acclimatization. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of bacteria cultures from root velamen of this epiphytic species identified them as Bacillus, Burkholderia, Enterobacter and Curtobacterium. The presence of indole compounds in the filtered supernatants of liquid cultures was quantified by colorimetric assay and confirmed by HPLC. Indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld) were present in high quantities, except in Enterobacter sp. cultures, where in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) were more prevalent. These rhizobacteria were inoculated into asymbiotically-germinated plantlets of the host orchid, acclimatized in greenhouse for 90 days and assessed for their growth-promoting ability. The lowest ability to promote growth was observed for Burkholderia sp. and Curtobacterium sp., while Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. improved growth in all evaluated characteristics and increased the percentage of plantlet survival. This study highlights the role of auxin-producing rhizobacteria and their benefits for growth promotion of a Brazilian orchid germinated in asymbiotic conditions, during acclimatization, when plant mortality is high, limiting orchid propagation.","[Galdiano Junior, Renato Fernandes; Nascimbem Pedrinho, Eliamar Aparecida; Luque Castellane, Tereza Cristina] FCAV UNESP, Lab Biochem Microrganisms & Plants, Program Agron Genet & Plant Breeding, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Galdiano Junior, Renato Fernandes; Nascimbem Pedrinho, Eliamar Aparecida; Luque Castellane, Tereza Cristina] FCAV UNESP, Lab Biochem Microrganisms & Plants, Program & Microbiol, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [de Macedo Lemos, Eliana Gertrudes] FCAV UNESP, Lab Biochem Microrganisms & Plants, Dept Technol, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil","Galdiano, RF (reprint author), FCAV UNESP, Lab Biochem Microrganisms & Plants, Program Agron Genet & Plant Breeding, Via Acesso Prof Paulo Donato Castellane Sn, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.",renatofgaldianojr@yahoo.com.br; egerle@fcav.unesp.br,"LEMOS, ELIANA/A-3604-2008","LEMOS, ELIANA/0000-0002-1119-7748","FapespFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); State research foundation of Sao Paulo; Capes, the Brazilian Federal AgencyCAPES; Evaluation of Graduate Education","The authors are indebted to the Fapesp, a State research foundation of Sao Paulo, and to Capes, the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education for post-graduate scholarships.",,35,12,15,1,20,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

Grazed Mediterranean open woodlands, as Iberian dehesa, are an outstanding example of silvopastoral system where shrub encroachment has been proposed as an effective means to facilitate tree seedling recruitment and ensure the system persistence. Shrubs also may interact with pasture understorey and tree overstorey, thereby affecting the overall system productivity. We tested the effects of shrub encroachment on pasture yield, tree growth and acorn production in years of contrasting rainfall in Quercus ilex L dehesas of central-western Spain. We compared the effects of two prominent Mediterranean shrub species that differ in their ecological strategies: a N-2-fixing and sparse deep-rooting shrub (Retama sphaerocarpa (L) Boiss), and a dense shallow-rooting shrub (Cistus ladanifer L). In intermediate and dry years, pasture yield beneath tree canopy was lower by 21-35% than in open grassland. Pasture yield beneath tree canopy was not significantly affected during the wet year. C. ladanifer encroachment significantly reduced pasture yield by 68-98%, tree growth by 17-29%, and acorn yield by 6-44%. In contrast, R. sphaerocarpa significantly increased pasture yield by 11-157% and tree growth by 6-13%, but had a neutral effect on acorn yield. Our results suggest that pasture is more sensitive to shrub encroachment and annual rainfall variation than is Q. ilex. The importance of C. ladanifer competition and R. sphaerocarpa facilitation on pasture yield increased in the driest year. We conclude that the sign and intensity of shrub encroachment effects on pasture and tree production in Mediterranean dehesas are species-specific and depend on temporal variation as a function of climate.

Such constraints enhance plant speciation and the emergence of endemic species. Thymus granatensis is an example of an endemic species from Southern Spain (Mediterranean climate) and a bioindicator of dolomitic soils that can be found in the Sierra de Baza Natural Park on pure dolomite (PD) soils (those containing more than 90% dolomite). Acknowledging the beneficial role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis against abiotic stress factors, this research was established to ascertain the importance of the AM community in supporting the growth of T. granatensis in PD soils. To study this, another Thymus species i.e., T. mastichina, was chosen for comparison. T. mastichina does not grow naturally in PD soils, but it is able to grow in a wide range of soil types including those having lower dolomite content. The results showed that: (i) AM establishment increases the biomass production of both species; (ii) the AM fungal community from PD soil might be fundamental for the growth of T. granatensis in the PD soil, particularly under drought conditions; (iii) the inoculation with AM fungi from the PD soil lowered the shoot Mg and Ca concentrations of both Thymus species growing in PD soil. Accordingly, AM fungi management could be used as a biotechnological tool to address the restoration and conservation of Mediterranean dolomitic habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

IBA applied at the time of setting accelerated root formation, elevating the percentage of cuttings with roots at 13 weeks post-setting from 45 to 78% and from 83 to 93% for a low- and a high-rooting clone, respectively. Final rooting percentages for the same treatments and clones (78 and 85%, and 88 and 100%, respectively, at 20 weeks post-setting) were not significantly affected by IBA application. IBA increased the root:shoot ratio of rooted cuttings by decreasing shoot weight compared with untreated cuttings, without affecting root weight, root length, root surface area or root volume. IBA was only effective when applied at the time of setting. A simple IBA treatment for cuttings from 8-year-old clonal hedges, by accelerating root production, has potential for reducing nursery costs and increasing the root system quality of containerised pine cuttings.","[Rasmussen, Amanda] Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hunt, Mark A.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Gympie, Qld 4570, Australia; [Hunt, Mark A.] Agrisci Queensland, Gympie, Qld 4570, Australia; [Trueman, Stephen J.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Trueman, Stephen J.] Agrisci Queensland, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia","Rasmussen, A (reprint author), Univ Queensland, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",mhunt@usc.edu.au; strueman@usc.edu.au; razda5@gmail.com,,"Hunt, Mark/0000-0001-6762-5740; Rasmussen, Amanda/0000-0002-9204-8030",,,,63,26,29,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,MAY,2011,41,3,,,,,349,360,,10.1007/s11056-010-9227-7,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,764EW,WOS:000290612700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Liu, Q; Yin, HJ; Chen, JS; Zhao, CZ; Cheng, XY; Wei, YY; Lin, B",,,,"Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun; Chen, Jinsong; Zhao, Chunzhang; Cheng, Xinying; Wei, Yunyan; Lin, Bo",,,Belowground responses of Picea asperata seedlings to warming and nitrogen fertilization in the eastern Tibetan Plateau,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Picea asperata; Root; Rhizosphere microbial process; Rhizosphere soil process,SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; FINE-ROOT DYNAMICS; TEMPERATE STEPPE; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; EXTRACTION METHOD; NORWAY SPRUCE; GLOBAL CHANGE; GROWTH; CARBON,"The impacts of global climatic change on belowground ecological processes of terrestrial ecosystems are still not clear. We therefore conducted an experiment in the subalpine coniferous forest ecosystem of the eastern edges of the Tibetan Plateau to study roots of Picea asperata seedlings and rhizosphere soil responses to soil warming and nitrogen availability from April 2007 to December 2008. The seedlings were subjected to two levels of temperature (ambient; infrared heater warming) and two nitrogen levels (0 or 25 g m(-2)year(-1) N). We used a free air temperature increase from an overhead infrared heater to raise both air and soil temperature by 2.1 and 2.6A degrees C, respectively. The results showed that warming alone significantly increased total biomass, coarse root biomass and fine root biomass of P. asperata seedlings. Both total biomass and fine root biomass were increased, but coarse root biomass was significantly decreased by nitrogen fertilization and warming combined with nitrogen fertilization. Warming induced a prominent increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) and NO(3) (-)-N of rhizosphere soil, while nitrogen fertilization significantly decreased SOC and NH(4) (+)-N of rhizosphere soil. The warming, fertilization and warming x N fertilization interaction decreased soil microbial C significantly, but substantially increased soil microbial N. These results suggest that nitrogen deposition combined with warmer temperatures under future climatic change possibly will have no effect on fine root production of P. asperata seedlings, but could enhance the nitrification process of their rhizosphere soils in subalpine coniferous forests.","[Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun; Chen, Jinsong; Zhao, Chunzhang; Cheng, Xinying; Lin, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Studies, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Studies, Chengdu Inst Biol, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",liuqing@cib.ac.cn; yinhj@cib.ac.cn; chenjs@cib.ac.cn; zhaochzh04@126.com; xinying9@yahoo.com.cn; yan_yun1985@163.com; linbo@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30800165, 31070533]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-Z1023]; Chengdu Institute of Biology, the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [Y0B2021100]","This study was funded jointly by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30800165, 31070533), the program of ""Knowledge Innovation Engineering'' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KSCX2-YW-Z1023), the forefront project of Chengdu Institute of Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y0B2021100).

Here we compared mutualistic and antagonistic biota in soils collected in the native, expanded, and invasive range of the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia. Robinia formed nodules in all soils with a broad phylogenetic range of N-fixing bacteria, and leaf N did not differ among the different sources of soil. This suggests that the global expansion of Robinia was not limited by the lack of appropriate mutualistic N-fixers. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from the native range stimulated stronger positive feedbacks than AMF from the expanded or invasive ranges, a biogeographic difference not described previously for invasive plants. Pythium taxa collected from soil in the native range were not more pathogenic than those from other ranges; however, feedbacks produced by the total soil biota were more negative from soils from the native range than from the other ranges, overriding the effects of AMF. This suggests that escape from other pathogens in the soil or the net negative effects of the whole soil community may contribute to superior performance in invaded regions. Our results suggest that important regional evolutionary relationships may occur among plants and soil biota, and that net effects of soil biota may affect invasion, but in ways that are not easily explained by studying isolated components of the soil biota.","[Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Bedmar, Eulogio J.; Gomez Silvan, Cinta] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, E-18080 Granada, Spain; [Reinhart, Kurt O.] ARS, USDA, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol & Phys Geog Unit, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ray.callaway@mso.umt.edu,"Gomez-Silvan, Cinta/F-7350-2016; Reinhart, Kurt/A-6730-2010","Gomez-Silvan, Cinta/0000-0001-5534-5784; Reinhart, Kurt/0000-0002-7985-6738; Gomez-Silvan, Cinta/0000-0002-9410-4577",National Parks Ecological Research Fellowship Program; USFS Fire Sciences Laboratory; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [SERDP]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Andrew W.

We investigated whether Elymus multisetus (big squirreltail) is evolving in response to invasion and what traits contribute to increased performance. Seedlings from invaded areas exhibited significantly greater tolerance to B. tectorum competition and a greater ability to suppress B. tectorum biomass than seedlings from adjacent uninvaded areas. To identify potentially adaptive traits, we examined which phenological and phenotypic traits were correlated with seedling performance within the uninvaded area, determined their genetic variation by measuring sibling resemblance, and asked whether trait distribution had shifted in invaded areas. Increased tolerance to competition was correlated with early seedling root to shoot ratio, root fork number, and fine root length. Root forks differed among families, but none of these traits differed significantly across invasion status. Additionally, we surveyed more broadly for traits that varied between invaded and uninvaded areas. Elymus multisetus plants collected from invaded areas were smaller, allocated more biomass to roots, and produced a higher percentage of fine roots than plants from uninvaded areas. The ability of native populations to evolve in response to invasion has significant implications for the management and restoration of B. tectorum-invaded communities.","[Leger, Elizabeth A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Rowe, Courtney L.

Plant T is a dynamic and often dominant component of ET, and is affected by a variety of processes controlled by land use changes superimposed onto edaphic conditions. We propose the following three principles that determine whether T will vary with changes in vegetation: variation will result if energy balance partitioning has been altered, if deeper or shallower active rooting depth has changed the amount of soil moisture accessible to plants, or if temporary changes in water use add up over longer time scales. Clearly these concepts are not new; however, they are often overlooked in favor of blanket assumptions that large changes in vegetation inevitably alter T. Not so. Our suggested framework incorporates both edaphic and plant traits that determine whether T will vary or not in response to altered land cover conditions. We suggest that this simple set of principles unifies results of wide-ranging studies of T following land use change and can explain underlying causes of T variation. These principles are illustrated through case studies from four different environments: Pacific Northwest forest, Texas mesquite brushland, Texas savanna and woodland, and Middle Rio Grande riparian forest. The proposed principles seem broadly applicable, should he further evaluated, and are directly relevant for land management.

Considering that mycorrhizal plants are known to be effective colonizers of degraded habitats, the influence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in plant growth was studied in fifteen psammophilic plant species: Lotus creticus, Dorycnium pentaphyllum, Otanthus maritimus, Thymbra capitata, Armeria maritima, Halimium halimifolium, Ononis natrix, Medicago marina, Genista umbellata, Crucinella maritima, Elymus farctus, Ammophila arenaria, Pancratium maritimum, Glaucium flavum and Limoniastrum monopetalum. Wild seeds were used in this study to compare the effect of plant inoculation with a consortium of native AM fungi isolated from a coastal sand dune and with the selected isolate Glomus intraradices BEG 72 versus non mycorrhizal plants. After six months growth, we found that eleven of the fifteen psammophilic species responded positively to AM fungi inoculation and both root and shoot development benefited considerably from the presence of the AM fungi. We can conclude that many of the psammophilic species produced after the germination of the wild seeds collected in their natural habitats show limited growth due in part to the lack of adequate AM fungal inoculum in the plants growing substrate. AM inoculation seems to be critical for their survival. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

While rarely tested, the rarity of a species may be linked to the rarity of symbiotic partners. The requirement of many terrestrial plants to form a symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi may limit the distribution and abundance of plant species. Here, in just the second test of the role of mycorrhiza in host species rarity, we investigate the influence of mycorrhizal specificity, distribution and ecological requirements in the genus Drakaea (Orchidaceae). 2. In situ seed baiting was used to resolve the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi for three common and two co-occurring rare species of Drakaea. Mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from wild adult orchids and protocorms and the ITS nrDNA regions sequenced. An in vitro study tested the range of Drakaea species of which each fungus can support germination. 3. All Drakaea species studied used a narrow monophyletic clade of Tulasnella endophyte for protocorm, seedling and adult plant stages. In situ seed baiting revealed that germination of Drakaea is largely restricted to the same microhabitat as that of the orchid. However, within this habitat Drakaea exhibit comparable germination to other Western Australian orchid genera. Rare and common Drakaea exhibited no difference in germination rates and both germinated in suitable habitat not currently occupied. 4. Synthesis. In contrast to the previous study of the role of mycorrhiza in plant rarity, there was no evidence that mycorrhizal specificity contributed to rarity in Drakaea. However, the formation of mycorrhiza being mostly restricted to a specific microhabitat may limit the abundance of Drakaea in some landscapes. In Drakaea, the highly specific pollination system of sexual deception may contribute to rarity. A trend towards high specificity in orchid mycorrhizal associations in southern Australia is hypothesized to result from the predominance of old landscapes affording the opportunity for specialization on a single or few mycorrhiza(s) best adapted to the landscape conditions.","[Phillips, Ryan D.; Barrett, Matthew D.; Dixon, Kingsley W.] Kings Pk & Bot Gardens, Bot Garden & Pk Author, Perth, WA 6005, Australia; [Phillips, Ryan D.; Dixon, Kingsley W.; Hopper, Stephen D.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Phillips, Ryan D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hopper, Stephen D.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England","Phillips, RD (reprint author), Kings Pk & Bot Gardens, Bot Garden & Pk Author, Fraser Ave, Perth, WA 6005, Australia.",ryan.phillips@bgpa.wa.gov.au,"Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011; dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Hopper, Stephen D/G-4222-2012; Barrett, Matthew D/H-8435-2012; AC, Stephen D.

All the strains except one were symbiotic bacteria classified into nine genospecies in the genera of Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium. Surveys on the distribution of these rhizobia in different regions showed that Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii strains were found only in neutral to slightly alkaline soils whereas Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense-related strains and strains of five Sinorhizobium genospecies were found in alkaline-saline soils. Correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses on the relationship of rhizobial distribution and their soil characteristics reveal that high soil pH, electrical conductivity, and potassium content favor distribution of the B. yuanmingense and the five Sinorhizobium species but inhibit B. japonicum and B. elkanii. High contents of available phosphorus and organic matters benefit Sinorhizobium fredii and B. liaoningense-related strains and inhibit the others groups mentioned above. The symbiotic gene (nifH and nodC) lineages among B. elkanii, B. japonicum, B. yuanmingense, and Sinorhizobium spp. were observed in the strains, signifying that vertical gene transfer was the main mechanism to maintain these genes in the soybean rhizobia. However, lateral transfer of symbiotic genes commonly in Sinorhizobium spp. and rarely in Bradyrhizobium spp. was also detected. These results showed the genetic diversity, the biogeography, and the soil determinant factors of soybean rhizobia in Hebei province of China.","[Li, Qin Qin; Wang, En Tao; Zhang, Yun Zeng; Zhang, Yan Ming; Tian, Chang Fu; Sui, Xin Hua; Chen, Wen Feng; Chen, Wen Xin] China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, En Tao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Microbiol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico","Chen, WF (reprint author), China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",chenwf@cau.edu.cn,"Tian, Chang Fu/C-2507-2012","Tian, Chang Fu/0000-0002-0479-363X","973 programNational Basic Research Program of China [2010CB126500]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30970004, 30870004]; SKLAB [2009SKLAB05-1, 2010SKLAB01-1];  [SIP20100067];  [PICS08-3]","This work was financed by the ""973"" program (grant no. 2010CB126500), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project no. 30970004 and 30870004), and funds from SKLAB (2009SKLAB05-1 and 2010SKLAB01-1).

The root distribution in the soil was also compared to assess the degree of overlap in the potential use of soil resources. Regressions between the combined sizes of interspecific, nearest-neighbour species and the distance between them showed significant positive correlations for S. brevifolia and R. robusta, which suggest the presence of competition. We infer from individual species regressions that the grass exerted a stronger competitive force on the shrub R. robusta than R. robusta on the grass. There was also evidence for strong intraspecific competitive relationships within S. brevifolia and R. robusta. There was no evidence of competition between S. brevifolia and L. pauciflora or among L. pauciflora individuals. S. brevifolia had the deepest root system, and was recorded at depths of 70 cm. Most of this root mass occurred between 10 and 40 cm. Ruschia robusta roots were recorded as deep as 55 cm, but more than 90% was found in the top 20 cm of the soil, creating a degree of overlap with the vertical root distribution of S. brevifolia. A clear separation in rooting depths occurred between S. brevifolia, and L. pauciflora which had only 3% of the total root mass below 10 cm. The partial overlap in the vertical root distribution between S. brevifolia and R. robusta may account for the observed competitive relationship, but each species dominates in a different layer, potentially minimising the net competition between S. brevifolia and R. robusta. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of a two-layer water-obtaining strategy in a semi-desert ecosystem, where the succulent shrubs seem to be playing the typical ""grass"" role described in most models of water partitioning between grass and woody plants. The stronger competitive effect of S. brevifolia on R. robusta at all the sites is of significance to species dynamics, and might be related to winter/summer rainfall dynamics at the climatic transition.","[Shiponeni, Ndafuda; Carrick, Peter J.; Hoffman, M.

Interventions in these degraded areas could accelerate the revegetation process. The objective of this research was to evaluate the association of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in tree species, microbial activity (basal respiration) and fertility of 'cerrado' degraded areas. Soil from two areas, pasture soil and exposed subsoil, were utilized. Organic and mineral fertilization, and liming, were added to the pit for better seedlings' initial growth, where 50 mL of preserved cerrado soil was applied as inoculum of microorganisms. Seedlings of 11 tree species were planted: Anadenanthera falcata (Benth.) Speg ('angico-preto'), Acacia polyphylla D. C. ('monjoleiro'), Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville ('barbatimao'), Dimorphandra mollis Benth ('faveiro'), Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne ('jatoba-de-cerrado'), Dipteryx alata Vog. ('baru'), Machaerium acutifolium Vogel ('jacaranda-do-campo'), Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi ('aroeirapimenteira'), Magonia pubescens St. Hil. ('tingui'), Lafoensia pacari St. Hil. ('dedaleira') and Tabebuia aurea (Manso) Benth. & Hook ('ipe-amarelo'). Twelve months later, root samples were colleted at the depth of 0-0.10 m and used for evaluations. The subsoil, as compared to pasture soil, was poor in organic matter and presented less microbial activity. The highest mycorrhizal colonization was seen in the species Acacia polyphylla D. C. (monjoleiro), Magonia pubescens St. Hil. (tingui), Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne (jatoba-de-cerrado) and Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (aroeira-pimenteira). These species could be indicated in revegetation projects in 'cerrado' degraded areas. Plants from both areas showed seedlings form high mycorrhizal colonization and low numbers of spores.","[Scabora, Marcia Helena] Univ Estadual Paulista, Programa Posgrad Agron, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil; [Maltoni, Katia Luciene; Rodrigues Cassiolato, Ana Maria] Univ Estadual Sao Paulo, Dept Fitossanidade Engn Rural & Solos, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil","Scabora, MH (reprint author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Programa Posgrad Agron, Av Brasil 56,Caixa Postal 31, BR-15385000 Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil.",scaboramh@yahoo.com.br; maltoni@agr.feis.unesp.br; anamaria@bio.feis.unesp.br,"Maltoni, Katia/B-6694-2012; Cassiolato, Ana Maria Rodrigues R/F-5040-2012","Maltoni, Katia/0000-0001-6619-4504; Cassiolato, Ana Maria R/0000-0002-2021-2647",,,,49,5,6,0,14,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

In the northwestern U.S., these changes will likely decrease snowpack, cause earlier snowmelt, increase summer evapotranspiration, and increase the frequency and severity of droughts. Elevated [CO2] and warmer temperatures may have positive effects on growth and productivity where there is adequate moisture or growth is currently limited by cold. However, the effects of climate change are generally expected to reduce growth and survival, predispose forests to disturbance by wildfire, insects, and disease; and ultimately change forest structure and composition at the landscape scale. Substantial warming will likely decrease winter chilling resulting in delayed bud burst, and adversely affect flowering and seed germination for some species. The extent of these effects will depend on the magnitude of climate change, the abilities of individual trees to acclimate, and for tree populations to adapt in situ, or to migrate to suitable habitats. These coping mechanisms may be insufficient to maintain optimal fitness of tree populations to rapidly changing climate. Physiological responses to climatic stresses are relatively well-understood at the organ or whole-plant scale but not at the stand or landscape scale. In particular, the interactive effects of multiple stressors is not well known. Genetic and silvicultural approaches to increase adaptive capacities and to decrease climate-related vulnerabilities of forests can be based on ecophysiological knowledge. Effective approaches to climate adaptation will likely include assisted migration of species and populations, and density management. Use of these approaches to increase forest resistance and resilience at the landscape scale requires a better understanding of species adaptations, within-species genetic variation, and the mitigating effects of silvicultural treatments.

Natural regeneration of forest stands can assure reproduction of healthy, high-productive and steady forests. If all natural prerequisites for flowering and fructification are in good accordance, a rich mast year may occur over a large part of beech natural range. The critical period for seedling's survival is the period from germination to rooting in the soil layer. The regeneration works with links between physiological and growth processes and mechanisms driving biomass allocation. Assimilates are allocated according to certain priorities. As for biomass production, the response of beech seedlings to light was positive in all aboveground components (leaves, branches, stem). Relative ratio of leaf biomass to the total aboveground biomass (LMR) and so also leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased with light supply. LAR is the main factor explaining variations in growth intensity. Advance growth of beech manifests good adaptation ability to light conditions from which it takes profits for its growth. The number of one-year-old seedlings was the highest in the densest stands with the highest numbers of fructifying trees; the number of older individuals, however, showed a different trend. The most abundant natural regeneration developed after medium shelterwood cut (stocking degree 0.5).","Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia","Barna, M (reprint author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Sturova 2, SK-96053 Zvolen, Slovakia.",barna@savzv.sk,"Barna, Milan/A-5939-2017","Barna, Milan/0000-0002-8389-7997",Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA) of the Ministry of Education of Slovak RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA); Slovak Academy of Sciences [2/0055/10],Supported by the Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA) of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences - Grant No. 2/0055/10.,,96,14,14,1,49,OSTERREICHISCHER AGRARVERLAG,VIENNA 1,"BANKGASSE 13, 1014 VIENNA 1, AUSTRIA",0379-5292,,,AUSTRIAN J FOR SCI,Austrian J.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess how inorganic N application to switchgrass affects soil structural properties, which may feed back to affect the sustainability of biomass production. Soil was sampled at depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 cm in April and November 2008 during the fifth year of switchgrass growth in Milan, TN. Nitrogenous fertilizer was applied as NH(4)NO(3) at rates of 0, 67, and 202 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) beginning in the second year. Root weight density (RWD), root length density (RLD) and SOC concentration were measured under different N treatments as factors potentially influencing soil structural properties. Measured soil structural parameters included soil moisture characteristic curve (SMCC), and aggregate stability through wet-sieving. At 0-5 cm depth, spring RWD (3.8 mg cm(-3)) was significantly lower with 202 kg N ha(-1) application compared to 0 and 67 kg N ha(-1) (14.1 and 17.0 mg cm(-3), respectively). Although fall RWD did not vary among N treatments, RLD under 202 kg N ha(-1) (7.1 cm cm(-3)) was less than half of that at 0 kg N ha(-1) (15.7 cm cm(-3)). The SOC concentration was greater in both fertilized treatments than in the unfertilized treatment. Although SMCC varied somewhat between seasons, it did not exhibit any consistent trends attributable to N application. The proportion of macroaggregates for 0-10 cm depth were significantly greater in the 0 and 67 kg N ha(-1) treatments than in the 202 kg N ha(-1) treatment. These data suggest that excessive N application to switchgrass could have negative impacts on soil structural properties by reducing root biomass and length, crucial determinants of soil structure despite an increase in SOC.

Concerns have been raised that the use of heavy machinery is creating soil disturbances that are negatively affecting the growth and survival of remaining trees. The aim of the study was to determine if heavy machinery is affecting the growth, morphology, and architecture of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) fine roots in and around machinery tracks left after selection logging. The study site, a sugar maple dominated stand, was located in southern Quebec. Root ingrowth bags and standard root cores were used to compare fine root growth, morphology, and architecture in and around machinery tracks one year after logging. Fine root growth of maple was reduced fivefold in both primary (multiple trip) and secondary (only one trip) machinery tracks compared with the control. There was a nonstatistical reduction in fine root growth within 1 m of the tracks. Because machinery tracks cover between 15% and 25% of a stand after selection logging, such reduction in fine root growth could be significant for the growth and survival of the remaining mature maple trees.","[Malo, Catherine; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, CEF, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Messier, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, CEF, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",messier.christian@uqam.ca,,,Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies (FQRNT)FQRNT; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors thank Maryse Desrochers, Lea Lang lois, Eric Harvey, Isabelle Witte, Vincens Cote, Ame lie Poitras-Lariviere, and Maryse Marchand for assistance in the field and the laboratory, Stephane Daigle for statistical help, and Lana B.

In Australian tropical savannas, there has been recent, large-scale implementation of fire management that aims to decrease Kyoto-compliant non-CO(2) greenhouse gas emissions by reducing late dry season intense fires through strategic early dry season burning. However, there is no accounting for changes to soil C stocks resulting from changes to savanna fire management, although impacts on these pools may be considerable. We present a hypothesis that soil C storage is greatest under low intensity fires with an intermediate fire return interval. Simulations using the CENTURY Soil Organic Matter Model confirmed this hypothesis with greatest soil C storage under a fire regime of one low intensity fire every 5 years. Key areas of uncertainty for CENTURY model simulations include fine root dynamics, charcoal production and nitrogen (N) cycling, and better understanding of these processes could improve model predictions. Soil C stocks measured in the field after 5 years of annual, 3 year and unburned fire treatments were not significantly different (range 41-58 t ha(-1)), but further CENTURY modelling suggests that changes in fire management will take up to 100 years to have a detectable impact (+4 t ha(-1)) on soil C stocks. However, implementation of fire management that reduces fire frequency and intensity within the large area of intact savanna landscapes in northern Australia could result in emissions savings of 0.17 t CO(2)-e ha(-1) y(-1), four times greater than reductions of non-CO(2) emissions.","[Richards, Anna E.; Cook, Garry D.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; [Lynch, Brian T.] No Terr Dept Nat Resources Environm, Palmerston, NT 0831, Australia","Richards, AE (reprint author), CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, PMB 44, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia.",Anna.Richards@csiro.au,"Richards, Anna E/G-5863-2010; Cook, Garry D/F-9270-2010","Richards, Anna/0000-0002-2934-5497",,,,98,27,27,1,69,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2011,14,3,,,,,503,518,,10.1007/s10021-011-9428-8,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762PU,WOS:000290492700012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Coll, L; Schneider, R; Berninger, F; Domenicano, S; Messier, C",,,,"Coll, Lluis; Schneider, Robert; Berninger, Frank; Domenicano, Susy; Messier, Christian",,,Quantifying the effect of nitrogen-induced physiological and structural changes on poplar growth using a carbon-balance model,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon-balance model; functional-balance hypothesis; growth; hybrid poplar; photosynthesis; pipe model ratios,WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; POPULUS-DELTOIDES HYBRIDS; SCOTS PINE; NET PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SOIL-NITROGEN; ROOT BIOMASS; GAS-EXCHANGE; DOUGLAS-FIR,"We evaluate the importance of changes in photosynthetic capacity, respiration rates, root shoot ratio, pipe model parameters and specific leaf area in the early-growth response of hybrid poplar to nitrogen availability. Juvenile growth simulations for trees with three different levels of leaf nitrogen concentration (N(leaf)) (low (1.2%), medium (2.4%) and high (3.6%)) were conducted with the carbon-balance model CROBAS. Five-year growth simulations showed the diameter and height of poplar trees to be, respectively, four and three times larger in plants with 2.4% N(leaf) compared with those with 1.2% N(leaf). Increasing N(leaf) from 2.4 to 3.6% resulted in 34 and 16% higher diameter and height growth of trees. According to the model, changes in the photosynthetic capacity accounted for most of the differences in growth between trees with different levels of N(leaf); the other parameters were much less influential. This suggests that in fast-growing early-successional broadleaved species such as poplars, physiological rather than allocational and morphological traits predominate in determining growth, at least under non-limiting light conditions.","[Coll, Lluis] CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Schneider, Robert] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Coll, Lluis; Berninger, Frank; Domenicano, Susy; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, CEF, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Coll, L (reprint author), CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc Morunys Km 2, Solsona 25280, Spain.",lluis.coll@ctfc.cat,"Berninger, Frank/A-8891-2010; Coll, Lluis/E-8724-2015","Berninger, Frank/0000-0001-7718-1661; Coll, Lluis/0000-0002-8035-5949","NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Domtar, Inc.; Ramon y Cajal, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion of SpainMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain [RYC-2009-04985]","This research was supported primarily by NSERC and Domtar, Inc., with additional input from the Ligniculture Quebec Network (Reseau Ligniculture Quebec) and the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources.

Forest carbon stocks are usually estimated indirectly through biomass equations applied to forest inventories, frequently considering different tree biomass components. The aim of this study is to develop systems of equations for predicting tree biomass components for the main forest softwood species in Spain: Abies alba Mill., A. pinsapo Boiss., Juniperus thurifera L., Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng., P halepensis Mill., P nigra Arn., P. pinaster Ait., P pinea L., P sylvestris L., P uncinata Mill. For each species, a system of additive biomass models was fitted using seemingly unrelated regression. Diameter at the breast height and total height were used as independent variables. Diameter appears in all component models, while tree height was included in the stem component model of all species and in some branch component equations. Total height was included in order to improve biomass estimations at different sites. These biomass models were compared to previously available equations in order to test their accuracy and it was found that they yielded better fitting statistics in all cases. Moreover, the models fulfil the additivity property. We also developed root:shoot ratios in order to determine the partitioning into aboveground and belowground biomass. A number of differences were found between species, with a minimum of 0.183 for A. alba and a maximum of 0.385 for P uncinata. The mean value for the softwood species studied was 0.265. Since the Spanish National Forest Inventory (NFI) records species, tree diameter and height of sample trees, these biomass models and ratios can be used to accurately estimate carbon stocks from NFI data.","[Ruiz-Peinado, R.; del Rio, M.; Montero, G.] CIFOR INIA, Dept Selvicultura & Gest Sistemas Forestales, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ruiz-Peinado, R.; del Rio, M.; Montero, G.] Univ Valladolid INIA, Inst Univ Invest Gest Forestal Sostenible, Valladolid, Spain","Ruiz-Peinado, R (reprint author), CIFOR INIA, Dept Selvicultura & Gest Sistemas Forestales, Ctra Coruna,Km 7,5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",ruizpein@inia.es,"del Rio, Miren/F-2196-2013; Ruiz-Peinado, R./G-6751-2012","del Rio, Miren/0000-0001-7496-3713; Ruiz-Peinado, R./0000-0003-0126-1651", [OT-03-002];  [PSS-310000-2009-22],"We would like to thank all those who participated in the field work, especially M.

In this review we explore whether fungi that respond differently to N deposition also differ in functional traits, including organic N use, hydrophobicity and exploration type (extent and pattern of extraradical hyphae). Cortinarius, Tricholoma, Piloderma, and Suillus had the strongest evidence of consistent negative effects of N deposition. Cortinarius, Tricholoma and Piloderma display consistent protein use and produce medium-distance fringe exploration types with hydrophobic mycorrhizas and rhizomorphs. Genera that produce long-distance exploration types (mostly Boletales) and contact short-distance exploration types (e.g., Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae, some athelioid genera) vary in sensitivity to N deposition. Members of Bankeraceae have declined in Europe but their enzymatic activity and belowground occurrence are largely unknown. Bankeraceae produce a distinct hydrophobic mat exploration type that may also be important in N acquisition under conditions of low N availability.

We examined fungal communities on dead roots in a sugar-maple dominated northern hardwood forest to test the hypothesis that community development is sensitive to rhizosphere disruption. We generated cohorts of dead fine roots in root windows and disturbed the rhizosphere microbial community in half of the windows by moving roots into sieved bulk soil. We sampled root fragments repeatedly over time and cultured fungi from these fragments to explore temporal patterns of fungal species composition. Disturbing the root rhizosphere prior to initiating decomposition changed the dominant fungal taxa, the distribution of dominant species within the community, and the temporal development in the culturable fungal community. Dominance in control roots shifted from Neonectria in early decay to Umbelopsis in later decay. Disturbance roots were more evenly dominated over time by Trichoderma, Neonectria, another species of Umbelopsis, and Pochonia. Our results suggest that species interactions are important in the ecology of fine root decay fungi, with the rhizosphere community of the living root influencing development of the decay community.","[Fisk, Melany C.; Crist, Thomas O.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Fahey, Timothy J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sobieraj, James H.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Staniec, Andria Costello] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Fisk, MC (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",fiskmc@muohio.edu,,"Fisk, Melany/0000-0003-4248-0180",United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2002-00498]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Cindy Wood and Jess Taybolt for assistance in the laboratory.

Yet, total root length (TRL), total root surface area (TRS), and root distribution in the soil better determine water uptake. These morphological traits were studied on 3 oil palm genotypes displaying a contrasting drought tolerance. A new concept of potential root water extraction ratio (PRER) was developed using measured half-distances between roots and some assumptions about the distance of water migration from soil to root. PRER was determined in conjunction with soil moisture extraction efficiency (SMEE). The presumed tolerant genotype (T) had higher TRL, TRS and PRER than the susceptible genotype (S), whilst the performance of the control genotype (I) was intermediate. Surprisingly, during a period of moderate water deficit, T had a lower SMEE than S, which was interpreted successfully with PRER, as the result of a better access to a large volume of soil and of a slower drying out of the soil around the roots. PRER appears as a helpful indicator for comparing or ranking genotypes, and for addressing better the complexity of the genetic variability of drought tolerance.","[Roupsard, Olivier; Jourdan, Christophe] CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols, SupAgro, INRA,IRD, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 02, France; [Nodichao, Leifi] Ctr Rech Agr Plantes Perennes CRA PP, INRAB, Pobe, Benin; [Chopart, Jean-Louis] CIRAD, UPR 102, Stn Roujol, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe; [Roupsard, Olivier] CATIE, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; [Vauclin, Michel] UJF, CNRS, UMR 5564, LTHE,INPG,IRD, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Ake, Severin] Univ Cocody Abidjan, UFR Biosci, Lab Physiol & Pathol Vegetales, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire","Jourdan, C (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols, SupAgro, INRA,IRD, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 02, France.",christophe.jourdan@cirad.fr,"JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019; Roupsard, Olivier/C-1219-2008","JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; Roupsard, Olivier/0000-0002-1319-142X",Cooperation and Cultural Action Service at the French Embassy in Benin; Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement; Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du Benin (INRAB); Cooperation and Cultural Action Service at the French Embassy in Benin; Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement; Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du Benin (INRAB),"We thank the Cooperation and Cultural Action Service at the French Embassy in Benin, Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement and Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du Benin (INRAB), for financial assistance that enabled this study to go ahead.

Here we show that consistently enhanced rates of net primary production (NPP) are sustained by a C-cascade through the root-microbe-soil system; increases in the flux of C belowground under elevated CO2 stimulated microbial activity, accelerated the rate of soil organic matter decomposition and stimulated tree uptake of N bound to this SOM. This process set into motion a positive feedback maintaining greater C gain under elevated CO2 as a result of increases in canopy N content and higher photosynthetic N-use efficiency. The ecosystem-level consequence of the enhanced requirement for N and the exchange of plant C for N belowground is the dominance of C storage in tree biomass but the preclusion of a large C sink in the soil.","[Drake, John E.; Gallet-Budynek, Anne; Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Drake, John E.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Gallet-Budynek, Anne] INRA, TCEM UMR 1220, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; [Hofmockel, Kirsten S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA USA; [Bernhardt, Emily S.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Billings, Sharon A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Billings, Sharon A.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Jackson, Robert B.; McCarthy, Heather R.; Oren, Ram; Palmroth, Sari; Pippen, Jeffrey S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt S.] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Lichter, John] Bowdoin Coll, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [McCarthy, Heather R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [McCormack, M.

These aridlands are often distinguished by large but variable precipitation events (monsoons). We sought to compare the composition and fungal load of the RAF community inhabiting the roots of Sporobolus cryptandrus, a dominant forage grass, exposed to variable precipitation events. We used a rainfall manipulation experiment at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) to examine the abundance and composition of the RAF communities using molecular and microscopic techniques. Molecular data reveals that the RAF communities are dominated by Ascomycetes and few sequences were related to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF). The most dominant group (Paraphaeosphaeria spp.) clearly increased in abundance in response to water amendments and the addition of similar volumes of water appeared to increase similarity among the RAF communities, irrespective of size and distribution of precipitation events. Microscopic examinations of the roots also revealed an increased fungal load when exposed to elevated moisture, irrespective of rainfall frequency. We suggest that the increase in these cosmopolitan and abundant groups of Ascomycete fungi, in part, represents a common but complicated strategy of water translocation in a variety of soil types, similar to that proposed and shown in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Additional work should examine whether many (or most) members of the Ascomycete RAF also can facultatively broker water in the larger biological network in the soil.","[Herrera, Jose; Poudel, Ravin; Nebel, Katherine A.] Truman State Univ, Dept Biol, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA; [Collins, Scott L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Herrera, J (reprint author), Truman State Univ, Dept Biol, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA.",jherrera@truman.edu,"Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014","Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Poudel, Ravin/0000-0003-2622-3889",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0715746]; NSF-Research Opportunity AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Undergraduates Amy Wiley, Paige Allen and Kadie Webster helped assess the large number of roots for fungal hyphae.

Yet we have little understanding of how drought structures grassland communities and the degree to which physiological drought tolerance advantages plants in grasslands. We characterized physiological drought tolerance (Psi(crit)) for a large number of species in a mesic grassland community (Konza Prairie, KS, USA). We then examined the relationships between Psi(crit) and a number of other key functional traits, and tested whether physiological tolerance of drought underlay success across a number of ecological contrasts-topographic position, burn frequency, and grazing-with 17 years of abundance data. Physiological drought tolerance of Konza species covered almost the full range known to plants globally. Consistently, physiologically drought-tolerant species had thin roots, while associations with other traits were inconsistent across functional groups. In this mesic grassland, physiological drought tolerance appears to increase the abundance of plants in xeric uplands, but does not in the mesic lowlands. Physiological drought tolerance did not alter species responses to changes in burning or grazing. In contrast to Psi(crit), species with high root tissue density were more abundant in uplands and lowlands than species with low root tissue density largely irrespective of grazing or burning regimes. In all, drought appears to have a limited role in structuring the Konza plant community. As such, more severe or frequent droughts in the region would likely restructure the Konza plant community in ways that are currently not observable.","[Tucker, Sally S.; Craine, Joseph M.; Nippert, Jesse B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Tucker, SS (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jcraine@ksu.edu,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0823341, DEB-0816629]","The Konza Prairie LTER data set analyzed here is PVC02, which was collected by Gene Towne during the 17 years for which we analyzed.

This uncertainty complicates predicted responses to future climate, as higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations may amplify the carbon (C)-sink in temperate forests if GPP controls the decline in NPP, but increased temperatures may decrease this C-sink if R-a controls the NPP decline. We quantified NPP in forests dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) in North Carolina, USA that varied from 14 to 115 years old. We used a sap-flow approach to quantify summer canopy photosynthesis by pines and later-successional hardwood trees, and measured wood CO2 efflux to investigate age-related changes in pine R-a. Despite increasing production by later-successional hardwoods, an 80% decline in pine NPP caused ecosystem NPP to decline with age by similar to 40%. The decline in pine NPP was explained by reduced stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, supporting the hypothesis that increasing hydraulic limitation and declining GPP drove the age-related decline of NPP in this species. The difference between GPP and NPP indicated that pine R-a also declined with age; this was corroborated by measurements of reduced stem CO2 efflux with increasing age. These results indicate that C cycling in these successional temperate forests is controlled by C input from GPP, and elements of global change that increase GPP may increase the C-sink in aging warm-temperate pine forests.","[Drake, J.

We tracked fungal abundance, fungal community composition, and soil carbon across 4 years in long-term field manipulations of rainfall in northern California. Fungi responded directly to rainfall levels, with more abundant, diverse, and consistent communities predominating under drought conditions, and less abundant, less diverse, and more variable communities emerging during wetter periods and in rain-addition treatments. Soil carbon storage itself did not vary with rainfall amendments, but increased decomposition rates foreshadow longer-term losses of soil carbon under conditions of extended seasonal rainfall. The repeated recovery of fungal diversity and abundance during periodic drought events suggests that species with a wide range of environmental tolerances coexist in this community, consistent with a storage effect in soil fungi. Increased diversity during dry periods further suggests that drought stress moderates competition among fungal taxa. Based on the responses observed here, we suggest that there may be a relationship between the timescale at which soil microbial communities experience natural environmental fluctuations and their ability to respond to future environmental change.","[Hawkes, Christine V.; Rocca, Jennifer D.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Huguet, Valerie] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Thomsen, Meredith A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Suttle, Kenwyn Blake] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, London SW7 2AZ, England","Hawkes, CV (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",chawkes@mail.utexas.edu,,"Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0528416]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; Canon National Parks,"We thank the following for their support and assistance: P.

The fossils investigated were not only limited to arthropods preserved in amber, but also included microorganisms, plant debris and vertebrate remains. This plethora of analyses provided important data about the ecology of the overall system, including sources of litter input into the soil and of the above-ground ecology. More precisely, they showed that most of the microfossils were those of soil organisms or organisms that participated in the ecology of the forest soil. This new discovery provided the opportunity to study the ecology of the soil as preserved in the 100 million years old Charentes amber. Indeed, the trophic links of the fossil forest soil have been reconstructed on the basis of the fossil assemblage discovered in amber outcrops and overlayed on a model ecological forest soil food web. We relied on existing phylogenetic information to discuss the absence of certain taxonomic groups in the fossilized specimens. Our synthesis shows that although the organisms of this ancient forest of Charentes were different from those of modern soils, the soil food web was organized functionally the same as modern soils. It also demonstrated that trophic links of the soil community were already diverse, including various means of predation, parasitism and organic matter decomposition. The most obvious differences are the absence of evidence for symbiotic root nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present a free-air exposure system, named isoFACE, designed for long-term stable C isotope labeling in the canopy of 25 m tall forest trees. Labeling of canopy air was achieved by continuous release of CO2 with a delta C-13 of -46.9aEuro degrees. To this end, micro-porous tubes were suspended at c. 1 m distance vertically through the canopy, minimizing CO2 gradients from the exterior to the interior and allowing for C labeling exposure during periods of low wind speed. Target for CO2 concentration ([CO2]) increase was ambient +100 mu mol mol(-1). Canopy [CO2] stayed within 10% of the target during more than 57% of the time and resulted in a drop of delta C-13 in canopy air by 7.8aEuro degrees. After 19 labeling days about 50% of C in phloem sugars and stem CO2 efflux were turned over and 20-30% in coarse root CO2 efflux and soil CO2. The isoFACE system successfully altered delta C-13 of canopy air for studying turn-over of C pools in forest trees and soils, highlighting their slow turn-over rates.","[Grams, Thorsten E.
