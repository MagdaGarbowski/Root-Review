Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) was extracted from 1-g samples (four plots per treatment) with 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9.0, at 121 degrees C in three extraction cycles. Extracts were pooled and quantified by using the Bradford protein assay. Concentrations of GRSP and total carbon (C) in aggregates were linearly related across aggregate size classes for all treatments (GRSP = 0. 101C + 0.56, r(2) = 0.95). No tillage had significantly greater whole soil GRSP than did CT or ORG (P = 0.01). Mean values for GRSP in aggregates of NT were higher than for CT or ORG aggregates by 0.53 and 0.66 mg g(-1) aggregates, respectively. There were no differences among treatments in GRSP concentrations in fine material. In NT the concentration of GRSP increased as aggregate size increased in contrast to the disturbed treatments, CT or ORG, where there were no differences in GRSP concentration across aggregate size fractions. Larger proportions of GRSP were distributed in macroaggregates of NT compared to CT and ORG in contrast to larger proportions in microaggregates of CT and ORG than in NT. Although soil disturbance in ORG farming is greater than for CT farming, both treatments had similar GRSP concentrations and distributions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This creates a seedling bank with a potential advantage in reestablishing canopy disturbances. To manage primary forests more effectively, it is important to understand the basis of plant regeneration ecophysiology, and their plasticity to changes in environmental factors. The objective was to evaluate the photosynthetic plasticity of Nothofagus pumilio seedlings to light intensity and soil moisture gradients; and to relate them with silvicultural prescriptions. Six treatments with three light intensities (4, 26 and 64% of the natural incident irradiance) and two soil moistures levels (40-60 and 80-100% soil capacity) were assayed under greenhouse controlled conditions. CO, gas exchanges were measured every month on seedlings growing in each condition. In the shaded treatments seedlings grow below their optimum photosynthetic potential (leaf light-saturated net photosynthesis rate of 5.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) compared with the lighted treatments by improving their photosynthetic performance (8.3-8.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). Seedling growing under low soil moisture conditions had higher leaf light-saturated net photosynthesis rate than plants grown under 80-100% soil water capacity (7.8 and 6.6 mu mol .CO2 m(-2). s(-1), respectively). When light (up to 150-200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and soil moisture (40-60% soil capacity) levels were favourable, seedling plants could exhibit their maximum photosynthetic capacity. If one of these factors became limiting, the plants reduced their photosynthetic rate, e.g. N. pumilio seedlings with enough light and high levels of soil moisture, probably decreased their growth and fine roots activity. For this, application of silviculture systems must take into account the changes in both factors (light and soil moisture) for maximize the growth potential in the natural regeneration. These findings must be combined with morphological variables at a whole-plant, shoot, crown and leaf levels to determine the optimum growth conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon stocks in live aboveground and belowground biomass, necromass, and soils were measured in a heterogeneous landscape composed of secondary and primary forest. A total of 110 permanent plots were used to estimate the size of these carbon pools. Local biomass equations were developed and used to estimate aboveground biomass and coarse root biomass for each plot. Herbaceous vegetation, fine roots, coarse and fine litter, and soil carbon to 4 in depth were measured in subplots. In primary forests, mean total carbon stocks (TCS) were estimated as 383.7 +/- 55.5 Mg C ha(-1) (+/- S.E.). Of this amount, soil organic carbon to 4 m depth represented 59%, total aboveground biomass 29%, total belowground biomass 10%, and necromass 2%. In secondary forests, TCS was 228.2 +/- 13.1 Mg C ha(-1), and soil organic carbon to 4 m depth accounted for 84% of this amount. Total aboveground biomass represented only 9%, total belowground biomass 5%, and total necromass 1% of TCS in secondary forests. Monte Carlo methods were used to assess the uncertainty of the biomass measurements and spatial variation. Of the total uncertainty of the estimates of TCS, the variation associated with the spatial variation of C pools between plots was higher than measurement errors within plots. From this study it is concluded that estimates of aboveground biomass largely underestimate total carbon stocks in forest ecosystems. Additionally, it is suggested that heterogeneous landscapes impose additional challenges for their study such as sampling intensity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A special type of model of biological productivity (MBP) has been developed combining the above growth models and multi-dimensional regression equations of phytomass (living biomass). The latter have been parametrized for dominant tree species, site indexes and ecological regions based on 3507 sample plots collected in Northern Eurasia's forests. The MBP account for age dynamics of forest ecosystems and simulate dynamics of seven components of phytomass (stem wood over bark, bark, crown wood, foliage, understory, green forest floor, and roots) as well as net primary production. The model system could be used in different ecological applications, in forest inventory and forest management as a semi-empirical reference information on the growth and productivity of Northern Eurasia's forests.

In this study, restoration treatments aimed at approximating historical forest structure and disturbances included modified single-tree selection cutting, with and without prescribed burning. We compared the effectiveness of restoration treatments on growth, vigor, and composition of recruitment responses with untreated controls. We used a randomized block design to detect treatment differences in mean individual tree basal area increment (BAInc10), growth efficiency (GE), and recruitment abundance between two restoration treatments (Cut-only and Cut-burn) and a Control. We further examined treatment effects by tree age-class (Young, Mature, Presettlement) using a spatial ANOVA model that incorporates the spatial autocorrelation among trees within experimental units. Ten years after implementing restoration treatments, mean individual tree BAInc10 and GE were significantly higher for treated units relative to Control units; all three age-classes benefited similarly from restoration treatments relative to the Control, with the greatest response in the Cut-only and moderate response in the Cut-burn. When treated units were compared, Cut-burn negatively affected BAInc10 and GE relative to Cut-only. Presettlement trees responded positively to treatment relative to the Control, particularly for BAInc10, demonstrating the potential of these old trees to respond to reduced competition. The Cut-burn treatment, in contrast, negatively affected the BAInc10 and GE response of postsettlement trees when compared to Cut-only. Restoration treatments did not reduce the amount of Douglas-fir recruits. In addition, the recruitment of both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir species was associated with the proximate cover of woody debris in Cut-only and Control treatments. Finally, special consideration needs to be taken for spring Cut-burn treatments, which appeared to dampen growth and vigor, relative to Cut-only, particularly for Young and Mature trees, and increased recruitment of ponderosa pine and particularly Douglas-fir.

All seeds had high water content (WC, 31-33%), and the lipid content varied from 14 to 46%. Seedlings from seeds collected in 2001 were subjected to moderate water stress as a preconditioning treatment for severe stress. T-seeds collected in the dry season had high WC, rapid and high germination percentage; S and T-seeds collected in winter (2005) had also high WC but were dormant. GA(3) (250 ppm) broke this dormancy. S-seeds collected in the dry season or at the beginning of it had relatively low WC and low and delayed germination. Some 2001 S-seeds produced albino seedlings. The critical water content for maintaining ecological longevity in these seeds was similar to 15%. Seeds collected in 2005b that were dehydrated for 20 days in a moist and fresh atmosphere lost their viability, showing recalcitrant behavior. T-seeds with the lowest lipid content (2005a) after dehydration maintained low germination (15 +/- 18%). In all samples the seed size varied widely and was not predictive of seed WC. Embryos taken from dehydrated seeds had two to four times higher WC than the seeds, but germination did not take place. Laboratory and field germination of dormant seeds showed that viability may be maintained for at least 2-3 months on a moist substrate (soil or agar). Moderate water stress at the seedling stage reduced the efficiency of biomass production. Response to this water stress was expressed more in physiological traits than in morphological characters, consequently biomass allocation was maintained and plants retained most of their morphological characteristics (root:shoot ratio, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio). Moderate water stress did not increase the tolerance of seedlings to severe stress, causing leaf shedding and plant death. For restoration purposes we recommend that T-seeds be germinated immediately avoiding dehydration. The use of S-seeds could result in unhealthy seedlings. Seed recalcitrance and the response to moderate water stress restrict germination and establishment to small gaps, where this species naturally grows. We suggest that before introducing O. oleifera in restoration programs, a plant cover should be built to reduce soil water deficit. It is necessary to improve methods to increase potential seed longevity in storage. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We also investigated the vertical distribution of the fine-root biomass using soil coring. We also measured environmental factors such as air and soil temperature, soil moisture and leaf area indices (LAI) of trees and the understory Sasa canopy for comparison with the fine-root dynamics. Fine-root biomass to a depth of 60 cm in September 2003 totaled 774 g m(-2), of which 71% was accounted for by Sasa and 60% was concentrated in the surface soil layer (0-15 cm), indicating that understory Sasa was an important component of the fine-root biomass in this ecosystem. Fine-root production increased in late summer (August) when soil temperatures were high, suggesting that temperature partially controls the seasonality of fine-root production. In addition, monthly fine-root production was significantly related to Sasa LAI (P < 0.001), suggesting that fine-root production was also affected by the specific phenology of Sasa. Fine-root mortality was relatively constant throughout the year. Fine-root production, mortality, and turnover rates were highest in the surface soil (0-15 cm) and decreased with increasing soil depth. Turnover rates of production and mortality in the surface soil were 1.7 year(-1) and 1.1 year(-1), respectively.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Nayoro 0960071, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, No Forestry & Dev Off, Nayoro 0960071, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Toikanbetsu, Horonobe, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, So Forestry & Dev Off, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Fukuzawa, K (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, 250 Tokuda, Nayoro 0960071, Japan.",caribu@exfor.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Shibata, Hideaki/N-9974-2019; Shibata, Hideaki/A-6909-2008; Takagi, Kentaro/C-2222-2012; Koike, Takayoshi/A-5204-2012","Shibata, Hideaki/0000-0002-8968-3594; ",,,,52,24,32,2,26,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

GPR propagates electromagnetic waves directly into the soil and reflects a portion of the energy when a buried object is contacted. In our study, we utilized a 1500 MHz antenna to establish correlations between GPR signals and root biomass. A significant relationship was found between GPR signal reflectance and biomass (R-2 = 0.68). This correlation was applied to multiple GPR scans taken from each open-top chamber (elevated and ambient C0(2)). Our results showed that plots receiving elevated C02 had significantly (P = 0.049) greater coarse-root biomass compared to ambient plots, suggesting that coarse roots may play a large role in carbon sequestration in scrub-Oak ecosystems.

The elevated CO2 treatment increased both new and net root length production primarily when combined with atmospheric warming, where the constant warming treatment had a greater positive effect than the increased night-time warming treatment. Responses to elevated CO2 were greater when the swards were cut more frequently and responsiveness varied with season. For Phalaris swards, 17% of total net primary productivity went belowground. On account of root turnover, only one-third of the new roots produced in the year following establishment could be expected, on average, to be recovered from soil cores.

Most studies have focused on invasive plants and animals, although few have considered the effects of invasive microbes, or interactions of invasive plant and animal species with microbial communities. Here, we review effects of invasive plants on soil microbial communities and discuss consequences for plant performance, plant community structure and ecosystem processes. In addition, we briefly discuss effects of invasive soil microbes on plant communities, which has been less well studied, and effects of invasive animals on soil decomposers and ecosystem functioning. We do this by considering each of three important functional groups of microbes, namely soil microbial parasites and pathogens, mutualistic symbionts and decomposers. We conclude that invasive plants, pathogenic and symbiotic soil microbes will have strongest effects on the abundance of individual species, community diversity and ecosystem functioning. Invasive decomposer microbes probably have little impact, because of limited specificity and great functional redundancy. However, invasive plants and animals can have major effects on microbial decomposition in soil. We propose that understanding, predicting and counteracting consequences of enhanced global homogenization of natural communities through introducing exotic plants, animals and microbes will require future studies on how pathogenic, symbiotic and decomposer soil microbes interact, how they are influenced by higher trophic level organisms and how their combined effects are influencing the composition and functioning of ecosystems.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen, Nematol Lab, Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Landcare Res, Lincoln, NE USA","van der Putten, WH (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, POB 40,Boterhoeksestr 48, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",w.vanderputten@nioo.knaw.nl,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",,,,111,216,222,7,199,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK STREET, 9TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1751-7362,,,ISME J,ISME J.,MAY,2007,1,1,,,,,28,37,,10.1038/ismej.2007.9,,,10,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,206XI,WOS:000249215800006,18043611,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Hoeksema, JD; Thompson, JN",,,,"Hoeksema, J.

We used a cross-inoculation experiment to characterize the scales and patterns at which geographic structure has evolved in an interaction between three pine species and one ectomycorrhizal fungus species along the west coast of North America. We found substantial and contrasting patterns of geographic interaction structure for the plants and fungi. The fungi exhibited a clinal pattern of local adaptation to their host plants across the geographic range of three coastal pines. In contrast, plant growth parameters were unaffected by fungal variation, but varied among plant populations and species. Both plant and fungal performance measures varied strongly with latitude. This set of results indicates that in such widespread species interactions, interacting species may evolve asymmetrically in a geographic mosaic because of differing evolutionary responses to clinally varying biotic and abiotic factors.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Hoeksema, JD (reprint author), Natl Evolutionary Synth Ctr, 2024 W Main St,Suite A200, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",jason.hoeksema@gmail.com,,,,,,77,44,47,1,37,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1010-061X,,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Prior to planting, nursery-produced seedlings were placed in cold storage (-3 degrees C) and root growth potential (RGP) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) root reserves were tested at 0, 10, 75 and after 150 (container) and 190 days (BR) of storage. Both container and BR stock had much lower root to shoot ratios (RSRs) and root carbohydrate reserves compared to UR seedlings after 170 days. During storage, root reserves in container stock declined faster than in the BR and UR seedlings. RGP in all nursery stock was the highest after 75 days of storage, while longer storage resulted in shoot dieback and reduced root growth. After the first growing season, UR seedlings were one tenth the size of the nursery stock; however, in the second growing season they had no stem dieback and grew twice the height and stem diameter. The higher RSRs and root reserves in the UR seedlings was likely caused by early bud set in its first year of growth. This suggests that inducing bud set earlier in the growing regime might allow seedlings to increase root mass and carbohydrate reserves.","Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Landhausser, SM (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, 4-42 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",Simon.Landhausser@ualberta.ca,"Landhausser, Simon M/F-9910-2016","Landhausser, Simon M/0000-0002-4466-1607; Lieffers, Victor/0000-0001-6939-4093",,,,49,18,19,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,MAY,2007,33,3,,,,,281,295,,10.1007/s11056-006-9027-2,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,152KO,WOS:000245361100004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Anderson, B; Midgley, JJ",,,,"Anderson, Bruce; Midgley, Jeremy J.",,,Density-dependent outcomes in a digestive mutualism between carnivorous Roridula plants and their associated hemipterans,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,conflict; cost and benefit; density dependence; exploitation; trade-off,POPULATION-DYNAMICS; STABILITY; MODELS; EVOLUTION; SANCTIONS; COMMUNITIES; SELECTION; RHIZOBIA; BENEFITS; PATHWAY,"Recent studies have shown that mutualisms often have variable outcomes in space and time. In particular, the outcomes may be dependent on the density of the partners with unimodal or saturating outcomes providing stability to the mutualism. We examine density-dependent outcomes of an obligate, species-specific mutualism between a South African carnivorous plant (Roridula dentata) and a hemipteran (Pameridea) that facilitates prey digestion, but also sucks plant sap. Plants occur in sandy, leached, nitrogen-poor soils and have no digestive enzymes to digest prey. Instead they rely on obligately dependent hemipterans to supply nitrogen by digesting prey for them and defecating on their leaves. We documented the densities of Pameridea on Roridula in the field. In the greenhouse, we manipulated the hemipteran densities on Roridula and measured the mean relative growth rates of plants with differing hemipteran densities. Plants exhibited a unimodal response to the density of their mutualist partners. Those with no hemipterans had negative growth rates, suggesting that hemipterans are important in facilitating nitrogen absorption. Plants with intermediate hemipteran densities had positive growth rates but growth rates were negative under very high hemipteran densities. Our research provides support for variable and unimodal outcomes in mutualism. Unimodal outcomes may be particularly important in obligate mutualisms and this is one of the few studied outside of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms. In this system, extrinsic factors such as other predators may affect the mutualism by altering the numbers of hemipterans.","Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa","Anderson, B (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",banderso.bruce@gmail.com,"ANDERSON, BRUCE/E-5853-2011","Anderson, Bruce/0000-0002-7264-4505",,,,57,18,18,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2007,152,1,,,,,115,120,,10.1007/s00442-006-0640-8,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,158QR,WOS:000245808100012,17221256,,,,10/31/19J,"Stark, S; Kytoviita, MM; Neumann, AB",,,,"Stark, Sari; Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit; Neumann, Antje B.",,,The phenolic compounds in Cladonia lichens are not antimicrobial in soils,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,lichens; allelopathy; antibiotic; usnic acid; secondary compounds; plant phenols,NEW-JERSEY PINELANDS; USNIC ACID; SECONDARY METABOLITES; CLADINA-STELLARIS; (+)-USNIC ACID; MINERALIZATION; MICROORGANISMS; SUBSTANCES; EXCHANGE; DEFENSE,"According to classic text books on lichen biology, the phenolic secondary chemicals in lichens have antibiotic effects on soil microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystems. However, the experimental evidence for this under natural conditions is still relatively scarce. We examined some of the assumptions behind the concept of antimicrobial effects of lichen secondary substances: (1) the secondary substances of Cladonia stellaris, usnic and perlatolic acids, are leached out from the lichens by rainwater; (2) these substances inhibit the microbial activity of soil, and; (3) since they are extremely resistant to microbial decomposition, the soil underneath a continuous lichen mat is enriched in usnic and perlatolic acids. Our results did not support any of these assumptions. The evidence for the antimicrobial activity of lichen secondary substances seems to be weak in comparison to other suggested functions such as light filtering and herbivore protection. We suggest that it is time to re-evaluate the evidence for the antimicrobial ecological role of lichen secondary substances in natural systems.","Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, Rovaniemi 96301, Finland; Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu 90014, Finland","Stark, S (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Rovaniemi Res Unit, POB 16, Rovaniemi 96301, Finland.",sari.stark@metla.fi,"Stark, Sari/L-4440-2013","Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit/0000-0002-8928-6951",,,,51,28,29,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2007,152,2,,,,,299,306,,10.1007/s00442-006-0644-4,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,165AM,WOS:000246276200012,17294219,,,,10/31/19J,"Vanguelova, EI; Nortcliff, S; Moffat, AJ; Kennedy, F",,,,"Vanguelova, Elena Iordanova; Nortcliff, Stephen; Moffat, Andy J.; Kennedy, Fiona",,,"Short-term effects of manipulated increase in acid deposition on soil, soil solution chemistry and fine roots in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand on a podzol",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,aluminium; fine roots; Pinus sylvestris; root growth; soil acidification; soil solution,NORWAY SPRUCE; DOUGLAS-FIR; PICEA-ABIES; ALUMINUM; GROWTH; SEEDLINGS; BIOMASS; MYCORRHIZAL; IRRIGATION; ELONGATION,"A manipulated increase in acid deposition (15 kg S ha(-1)), carried out for three months in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand on a podzol, acidified the soil and raised dissolved Al at concentrations above the critical level of 5 mg l(-1) previously determined in a controlled experiment with Scots pine seedlings. The induced soil acidification reduced tree fine root density and biomass significantly in the top 15 cm of soil in the field. The results suggested that the reduction in fine root growth was a response not simply to high Al in solution but to the depletion of exchangeable Ca and Mg in the organic layer, K deficiency, the increase in NH4:NO3 ratio in solution and the high proton input to the soil by the acid manipulation. The results from this study could not justify the hypothesis of Al-induced root damage under field conditions, at least not in the short term.

Increasing evidence suggests that feedback of soil biota to invasive and native plants leads to successful exotic plant invasion. To examine this possible underlying invasion mechanism, soil microbial communities were studied where Ageratina adenophora was invading a native forest community. The plant-soil biota feedback experiments were designed to assess the effect of invasion-induced changes of soil biota on plant growth, and interactions between A. adenophora and three native plant species. Soil analysis showed that nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and available P and K content were significantly higher in a heavily invaded site than in a newly invaded site. The structure of the soil microbial community was clearly different in all four sites. Ageratina adenophora invasion strongly increased the abundance of soil VAM (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and the fungi/bacteria ratio. A greenhouse experiment indicated that the soil biota in the heavily invaded site had a greater inhibitory effect on native plant species than on A. adenophora and that soil biota in the native plant site inhibited the growth of native plant species, but not of A. adenophora. Soil biota in all four sites increased A. adenophora relative dominance compared with each of the three native plant species and soil biota in the heavily invaded site had greater beneficial effects on A. adenophora relative dominance index (20% higher on average) than soil biota in the non-invaded site. Our results suggest that A. adenophora is more positively affected by the soil community associated with native communities than are resident natives, and once the invader becomes established it further alters the soil community in a way that favors itself and inhibits natives, helping to promote the invasion. Soil biota alteration after A. adenophora establishment may be an important part of its invasion process to facilitate itself and inhibit native plants.","Ctr Management Invas Alien Species, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Biotechnol Res Inst, Fuzhou 350003, Peoples R China","Wan, FH (reprint author), Ctr Management Invas Alien Species, Minist Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wanfangh@public3.bta.net.cn,,,,,,67,84,129,1,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2007,294,2-Jan,,,,,73,85,,10.1007/s11104-007-9230-8,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,169TS,WOS:000246615300007,,,,,10/31/19J,"De Baets, S; Poesen, J; Knapen, A; Barbera, GG; Navarro, JA",,,,"De Baets, S.; Poesen, J.; Knapen, A.; Barbera, G.

Revegetation strategies for erosion control rely in most cases on the effects of the above-ground biomass on reducing water erosion rates, whereas the role of the below-ground biomass is often neglected. In a Mediterranean context, the above-ground biomass can temporally disappear because of fire or overgrazing and when concentrated flow erosion occurs, roots can play an important role in controlling soil erosion rates. Unfortunately, information on root characteristics of Mediterranean plants, growing on semi-natural lands, and their effects on the topsoil resistance to concentrated flow erosion is lacking. Therefore, typical Mediterranean grass, herb, reed, shrub and tree root systems of plants growing in habitats that are prone to concentrated flow erosion (i.e. in ephemeral channels, abandoned fields and steep badland slopes) are examined and their erosion-reducing potential was evaluated. Root density (RD), root length density (RLD) and root diameters are measured for 26 typical Mediterranean plant species. RD values and root diameter distribution within the upper 0.10-0.90 m of the soil profile are then transformed into relative soil detachment rates using an empirical relationship in order to predict the erosion-reducing effect of root systems during concentrated runoff. Comparing the erosion-reducing potential of different plant species allows ranking them according to their effectiveness in preventing or reducing soil erosion rates by concentrated flow. RD in the 0.10 m thick topsoil ranges between 0.13 kg m(-3) for Bromus rubens (L.) and 19.77 kg m(-3) for Lygeum spartum (L.), whereas RLD ranges between 0.01 km m(-3) for Nerium oleander (L.) and 120.43 km m(-3) for Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz.) Relative soil detachment rates, compared to bare soils, range between 0.3 x 10(-12) and 0.7 for the 0.10 m thick topsoil. The results show that grasses such as Helictotrichon filifolium ((Lag.) Henrard), Piptatherum miliaceum ((L.) Coss.), Juncus acutus (L.), Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz), Lygeum spartum (L.) and Brachypodium retusum ((Pers.) Beauv.) have the highest potential to reduce soil erosion rates by concentrated flow in the 0-0.1 m topsoil. But also shrubs such as Anthyllis cytisoides (L.) and Tamarix canariensis (Willd.), having high root densities in the topsoil, can reduce erosion rates drastically. Among the species growing in channels, Juncus acutus (L.) has the highest erosion reducing potential, whereas Phragmites australis (Cav.) is the least effective. On abandoned fields, Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz) and Plantago albicans (L.) are the most effective species in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates, while Thymelaea hirsuta (L. (Endl.)) and Bromus rubens (L.) perform the worst. On steep badland slopes, Helictotrichon filifolium ((Lag.) Henrard) and Anthyllis cytisoides (L.) perform the best in the analysis of erosion reducing potential, while Ononis tridentata (L.) is the least effective species. These findings have implications for ecological restoration and management of erosion-prone slopes.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Phys & Reg Geog Res Grp, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; CEBAS CSIC, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Murcia 30100, Spain","De Baets, S (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Phys & Reg Geog Res Grp, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",sarah.debaets@geo.kuleuven.be,"Barbera, Gonzalo Gonzalez/D-8386-2011; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/L-8281-2013","Barbera, Gonzalo Gonzalez/0000-0003-2166-0633; De Baets, Sarah/0000-0001-8245-8960; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8091-1063",,,,31,104,104,1,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2007,294,2-Jan,,,,,169,183,,10.1007/s11104-007-9244-2,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,169TS,WOS:000246615300015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Haan, MM; Russell, JR; Kovar, JL; Powers, WJ; Benning, JL",,,,"Haan, M.

Five forage management treatments were evaluated over 3 years in smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) pastures. Management practices were: ungrazed (U), hay harvest/fall stockpile grazing (HS), rotational stocking to residual sward heights of 10 (10R) or 5 (5R) cm, and continuous stocking to maintain sward height at 5 cm (5C). Forage samples were hand-clipped within and outside grazing exclosures monthly from April through November of each year and analyzed for mass and P concentration. Root samples were collected at the initiation and completion of the study for determination of root length density (RLD) and root surface area density (RSAD). Phosphorus concentrations of forage outside the grazing exclosures did not differ among 5C, 5R, and IOR treatments, which were greater than U paddocks in April and August and less than HS paddocks in June. Mean annual forage productivity was greater in HS, 10R, 5R, and 5C paddocks (6 744 +/- 62 kg center dot ha(-1) mean +/- SE) than in the U paddocks (1 872 +/- 255 kg center dot ha(-1)). Mean P concentration of forage outside exclosures was greatest during the spring (0.21 +/- 0.01%), and lowest during the fall (0.13 +/- 0.01%). Mean annual P uptake by forage followed the same trend as forage production, being greater in the HS, 10R, 5R, and 5C paddocks (13.9 +/- 2.0 kg center dot ha(-1)) than in the U paddocks (3.7 +/- 0.5 kg center dot ha(-1)). After 3 years, RLD decreased in the ungrazed paddocks, but was unchanged in the HS, 10R, 5R, and 5C paddocks. Forage production and P uptake by forage is stimulated by forage harvest, either by grazing or hay harvest in smooth bromegrass pastures.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50010 USA; USDA ARS, Natl Soil Tilth Lab, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Nebraska, Extens Water Qual Educator, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Russell, JR (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, 337 Kildee Hall, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",jrussell@iastate.edu,,,,,,49,10,10,0,21,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

After I year, four isolates with plasmid profiles distinct from those inoculated into the soils were recovered. One isolate in the control soil appeared to have lost a plasmid. Three isolates from heavy metal contaminated soils (one isolate from the soil with total Zn 208 mg kg(-1) and two isolates from the soil with total Zn 340 mg kg(-1)) had all acquired one plasmid. Plasmid transfer was confirmed using the distinct ITS-RFLP types of the isolates and DNA hybridization using probes specific to the transferred plasmid. The transconjugant of 2-8-27 which had gained a plasmid was found in one replicate after 2 years of the most contaminated soil but comprised more than 50% of the isolates. A similar type appeared in a separate replicate of the most contaminated soil after 3 years and persisted in both of these soils until the final sampling after 4 years. After 2 years isolates were recovered from four of the soil replicates with the chromosomal type of 2-8-27 which appeared to have lost one plasmid, but these were not recovered subsequently. Isolate 2-8-27 was among the isolates most sensitive to Zn in laboratory assays, whereas isolate 7-13-1 showed greater zinc tolerance. Acquisition of the plasmid conferred enhanced Zn tolerance to the recipients, but transconjugant isolates were not as metal tolerant as 7-13-1, the putative donor. Laboratory matings between 2-8-27 and 7-13-1 in the presence of Zn resulted in the conjugal transfer of the same small plasmid from 7-13-1 to isolate 2-8-27 and the transconjugant had enhanced metal tolerance. Our results show that transfer of naturally-occurring plasmids among rhizobial strains is stimulated by increased metal concentrations in soil. We further demonstrate that the transfer of naturally-occurring plasmids is important in conferring enhanced tolerance to elevated zinc concentrations in rhizobia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied whether the contrasting humus layers differed in microbial community structure, biomass and enzyme activity patterns. Microbial structure was analyzed as phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile and activity as enzyme activity patterns including arylsulphatase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, cellobiosidase, chitinase, phosphomonoesterase (PME, acid), phoshodiesterase (PDE), esterase, lipase and alanine- and leucine aminopeptidase (AP) activities. Samples from the humus layer were collected separately under Scots pine (Pinus silvestris) and alder (Alnus incana) at 2-week intervals. CO2 efflux was monitored continuously. The alder humus layer contained higher microbial biomass, estimated as the sum of PLFAs, and higher enzyme activities than the Scots pine humus layer. There were also differences in enzyme activity patterns between the two sites. In the humus layer under pines, all the enzyme activity potentials tended to increase when the humus layer temperature and CO2 efflux increased from the end of May to the end of July. The potential activities remained high in the autumn when the humus layer temperature decreased. Some of the enzyme activities under alder had minima but others maxima in the middle of summer when the humus layer was dry. The different patterns of enzyme activity maxima and CO2 efflux measured at the proximity of alder and pine trees are discussed, as well as the impact of root exudates and degradable litter.

The process-based PATCIS model was applied to a first rotation young Sitka spruce stand in order to simulate the seasonal contribution of soil respiration components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. We evaluated the performance of the model with observed measurements and compared it with empirically derived regressions. Once the model was parameterised, it explained 75% of the seasonal variation in total Soil CO2 efflux. Similar seasonal trends and annual estimates of soil CO2 efflux were obtained with either empirical or the process-based PATCIS models. Heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration contributed almost equally to total CO2 efflux during the early and late part of the year, while a larger contribution of autotrophic respiration to total CO2 efflux Occurred during the growing season. The overall annual contribution of autotrophic respiration to total Soil CO2 efflux was 54.7%. Most of root respiration took place in both the litter humus layer and the A, horizon as a result of their large concentrations of fine roots. We observed an accumulation of organic matter in the litter-humus layer, and a net loss from the mineral soil, which had much larger organic matter content compared to the litter-humus layer. The organic matter turnover rate calculated for the mineral soil was 45 years (mean residence time). The sensitivity analysis showed soil temperature as the most important factor controlling soil respiration. The influence of soil moisture was more variable and had an overall negative effect on soil respiratory rates, except for periods of low soil water content, such as summer drought. The episodic occurrence of very wet conditions at the deeper soil layers was responsible for their low contribution to total soil respiration. In general, gas transport within the soil was not an important constraint for soil CO2 efflux since most of soil respiration was produced in the highly porous litter-humus and top mineral layers. The autotrophic component was more affected than heterotrophic respiration by changes in soil water content. Other factors such as changes in litterfall inputs were shown to have a more limited impact on Soil CO2 efflux. This work shows that the use of a process-based model to simulate soil CO2 efflux may be a useful tool to separate soil respiration components. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Tree diameter and height were tested as proxy variables for plant size. For the xeric site, which had no understorey grass cover, both the height- and diameter-based models gave reasonable estimates of FRB. However, the height- model provided a better match to the measured data than the diameter-model. For the mesic site, which had a substantial ground cover dominated by C-4-grasses whose contribution to FRB could not be captured by the model, neither the height- nor the diameter-model was able to predict FRB satisfactorily. This was also the case even when the contribution of the C-4-grasses to FRB was estimated and accounted for after delta C-13 analysis of fine root samples. Overall, while it is evident that the model can be a useful tool for estimating FRB from aboveground stand inventory in both even-aged plantations and compositionally complex natural vegetation, it is also clear that it does not always provide satisfactory prediction, e. g., the mesic site. Thus, to improve the wider applicability of the model further work is needed to identify why it fails and situations it is likely to be useful.","Bavarian Forest Inst, Unit Silvicultural Res, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; NSW Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia; Univ Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia","Ammer, C (reprint author), Bavarian Forest Inst, Unit Silvicultural Res, Hochanger 11, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",cha@lwf.uni-muenchen.de,,"Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135",,,,26,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

However, positive soil feedback may also be due to enhanced benefit from the local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Few studies actually have tested pathogen effects, and none of them did so in arid savannas. In the Kalahari savanna in Botswana, we compared the soil feedback of the exotic grass Cenchrus biflorus with that of two dominant native grasses, Eragrostis lehmanniana and Aristida meridionalis. The exotic grass had neutral to positive soil feedback, whereas both native grasses showed neutral to negative feedback effects. Isolation and testing of root-inhabiting fungi of E. lehmanniana yielded two host-specific pathogens that did not influence the exotic C. biflorus or the other native grass, A. meridionalis. None of the grasses was affected by the fungi that were isolated from the roots of the exotic C. biflorus. We isolated and compared the AMF community of the native and exotic grasses by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel elecrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), targeting AMF 18S rRNA. We used roots from monospecific field stands and from plants grown in pots with mixtures of soils from the monospecific field stands. Three-quarters of the root samples of the exotic grass had two nearly identical sequences, showing 99% similarity with Glomus versiforme. The two native grasses were also associated with distinct bands, but each of these bands occurred in only a fraction of the root samples. The native grasses contained a higher diversity of AMF bands than the exotic grass. Canonical correspondence analyses of the AMF band patterns revealed almost as much difference between the native and exotic grasses as between the native grasses. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that release from soil-borne enemies may facilitate local abundance of exotic plants, and we provide the first evidence that these processes may occur in arid savanna ecosystems. Pathogenicity tests implicated the involvement of soil pathogens in the soil feedback responses, and further studies should reveal the functional consequences of the observed high infection with a low diversity of AMF in the roots of exotic plants.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, NIOO KNAW, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands; Free Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Harry Oppenheimer Okavango Res Ctr, Maun, Botswana; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands","van der Putten, WH (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, NIOO KNAW, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",w.vanderputten@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Kowalchuk, George/C-4298-2011; Brinkman, E.

DON PLANTATION; CHAMAECYPARIS-OBTUSA; NORTHERN JAPAN; DYNAMICS; TURNOVER,"To better understand the control of fine-root dynamics in Japanese forests, we reviewed studies conducted in Japan on fine-root biomass and production. Most of the data on fine-root biomass were obtained for conifer plantations in limited regions; the average fine-root biomass of dominant trees ranged from similar to 50 g m(-2) for Pinus species (n = 3) to similar to 600 g m(-2) for Cryptomeria japonica (n = 4) and Chamaecyparis obtusa (n = 3). These values are comparable with or less than those reported for other temperate forests mainly in North America or Europe. Information on fine-root production in Japanese forests remains limited. Fine-root production accounted for similar to 30% of the net primary productivity in two deciduous forests, but similar data was not reported for coniferous forests in Japan. In Japanese forests, slope position is a key parameter controlling fine-root biomass that is greater on upper slopes than on lower slopes, probably because soil resource availability decreases upslope. Studies in manipulated soil environments (e.g., removing throughfall to simulate drought) also suggested that fine-root biomass and production were greatly affected by altered soil environments. Physiological control of fine-root dynamics was recently discussed via anatomical analyses of Chamaecyparis obtusa. Findings from Japanese studies generally support data on fine-root biomass and production obtained from other temperate regions. Further attempts to elucidate the influence of slope position (soil resource availability) on fine-root production would be useful to gain a more detailed understanding of the fine-root dynamics in Japanese forests.","Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Zvolen, Slovakia; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan","Noguchi, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, 1 Matsumoto, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",kyotaro@affrc.go.jp,"Noguchi, Kyotaro/B-4137-2013; Takahashi, Masamichi/B-6584-2009","Takahashi, Masamichi/0000-0002-6109-0826",,,,77,48,51,1,52,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1341-6979,,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Changes in fine-root parameters caused by this drought treatment were examined by sequential soil coring. Drought effects on fine roots were analyzed separately for particular soil depths (0-5, 5-15, and 15-25 cm) and root diameters (< 1 and 1-2 mm). Generally, fine-root biomass and root tip numbers decreased by the drought treatment. Drought stress was most intense for fine roots in the topsoil and weakest for fine roots in the deepest soil layer. Fine roots less than 1 turn in diameter were affected more severely than 1- to 2-mm roots. The effect of drought treatment was most remarkable for the number of white root tips, which decreased to 17% of the control at the soil depth of 0-5 cm. These results suggest that white root tip is the most suitable indicator of drought stress. Simulated drought reduced production of fine roots less than 1 mm and 1-2 mm in diameter. Fine-root mortality was stimulated for roots less than 1 mm, but not for 1- to 2-mm roots. These results suggest that fine roots with larger diameters can survive drought stress at a level. simulated in this study, but processes of fine-root production were inhibited regardless of the diameter classes. The duration of drought stress and phenology of fine roots should also be considered in diagnosing the effects of drought on fine-root parameters.","Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, Dept Forest Protect & Game Management, Zvolen, Slovakia","Noguchi, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",kyotaro@affrc.go.jp,"Takahashi, Masamichi/B-6584-2009","Takahashi, Masamichi/0000-0002-6109-0826",,,,28,27,29,2,25,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1341-6979,,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

More specifically, we asked whether seasonal dynamics in soil water regime contributed to vegetation partitioning into distinct forest types. Location: Tropical rain forest in northwestern Mato Grosso, Brazil. Methods: We investigated the distribution of trees and lianas >= 1 cm DBH in ten transects that crossed distinct hydrological transitions. Soil water content and depth to water table were measured regularly over a 13-month period. Results: A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of 20 dominant species and structural attributes in 10 x 10 m subplots segregated three major forest types: (1) high-statured upland forest with intermediate stem density, (2) medium-statured forest dominated by palms, and (3) low-statured campinarana forest with high stem density. During the rainy season and transition into the dry season, distinct characteristics of the soil water regime (i.e. hydro-indicators) were closely associated with each vegetation community. Stand structural attributes and hydro-indicators were statistically different among forest types. Conclusions: Some upland species appeared intolerant of anaerobic conditions as they were not present in palm and campinarana sites, which experienced prolonged periods of saturation at the soil surface. A shallow impermeable layer restricted rooting depth in the campinarana community, which could heighten drought stress during the dry season. The only vegetation able to persist in campinarana sites were short-statured trees that appear to be well-adapted to the dual extremes of inundation and drought.","Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Univ Fed Mat Grosso, Fac Agron & Med Vet, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, MT, Brazil; Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Jirka, S (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Bradfield Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sj42@cornell.edu; ajm9@cornell.edu; msj8@cornell.edu; trj2@cornell.edu; couto@ufmt.br; sjr4@cornell.edu,"Couto, Eduardo Guimaraes/E-4240-2010; Feldpausch, Ted/D-3436-2009; Johnson, Mark S./B-4445-2008","Couto, Eduardo Guimaraes/0000-0002-5271-9709; Feldpausch, Ted/0000-0002-6631-7962; Johnson, Mark S./0000-0001-5070-7539",,,,72,33,34,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, two recent publications have reported arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF) colonisation in Ni-hyperaccumulators. In this work, 9 endemic Ni-accumulators of unknown mycorrhizal status, from New Caledonia, were studied. All were mycorrhizal, but some were poorly colonised by the symbiots. Only AMF were observed. We analysed the relationships between Ni-hyperaccumulation ability and AMF colonisation of the plants. The roots of the three strongest hyperaccumulators, namely Sebertiaacuminata, Psychotria douarrei and Phyllanthus favieri, were characterised by a lower mycorrhizal colonisation than the others. Mycorrhizal density varied with the level of Ni concentration in soil and plant. Root-colonisation by AMF was negatively correlated with leaf Ni content and with extractable-Ni concentration in soil. The roots of Ni-hyperaccumulators and the soils collected under these plants clearly inhibited germination of AMF spores. Hence, it appears that mycorrhizal colonisation is inhibited above a certain threshold of Ni concentration in soil and plant and becomes either absent or very low. However AMF isolated from the roots of strong Ni-hyperaccumulators have developed a very high level of Ni-tolerance and are then able to colonize at least parts of their roots.","Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Unite Mecan Adaptat & Biomol Plantes Endem Melane, Noumea, New Caledonia; Inst Rech Dev, UMR 161, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; Ctr Noumea, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Bot & Ecol Appl, Noumea, New Caledonia","Amir, H (reprint author), Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Unite Mecan Adaptat & Biomol Plantes Endem Melane, BP R4, Noumea, New Caledonia.",amir@univ-nc.nc,,,,,,40,32,32,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2007,293,2-Jan,,,,,23,35,,10.1007/s11104-007-9238-0,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,169BB,WOS:000246566600004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Karlinski, L; Ravnskov, S; Kieliszewska-Rokicka, B; Larsen, J",,,,"Karlinski, L.; Ravnskov, S.; Kieliszewska-Rokicka, B.; Larsen, J.",,,Fatty acid composition of various ectomycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhizas of Norway spruce,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomarker fatty acids; fungal sporocarps; gram-positive bacteria; molecular identification; mycorrhizosphere,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ESTER FAME PROFILES; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; EXTERNAL MYCELIUM; HELPER BACTERIA; FLUORESCENT PSEUDOMONADS; APHANOMYCES-EUTEICHES; ROOT PATHOGENS; IN-VITRO,"Whole cell fatty acid (WCFA) compositions of three different structures of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi: sporocarps, pure culture mycelia and ectomycorrhizas were analysed to evaluate the potential use of fatty acid profiles as biomarkers for ECM fungi and ectomycorrhiza-associated bacteria. Sporocarps of Amanita muscaria, Amanita rubescens, Lactarius rufus, Lactarius thejogalus, Leccinum scabrum, Paxillus involutus, Russula foetens, Russula rosea, Russula vesca, Suillus grevillei, Tylopilus felleus, Xerocomus badius, Xerocomus subtomentosus, pure cultures of A. muscaria, P. involutus, X badius, X. subtomentosus, Suillus bovinus Suillus luteus and seven ectomycorrhizal morphotypes of Norway spruce were examined. Our results revealed species-specific composition of fatty acids of fungal sporocarps and pure culture mycelia. Ectomycorrhizal morphotypes distinguished and identified by morphological and molecular methods (PCR-RLFP and sequencing) created specific fatty acid profiles. The dominating fatty acids in pure cultures and sporocarps were 18:2 omega 6,9, 18:1 omega 9 and 16:0, whereas ectomycorrhizas also contained plant and bacterial specific fatty acids. Especially, fatty acids specific to Gram-positive bacteria 15:0 anteiso and 17:0 anteiso were present in relatively high amounts and suggested that these bacteria are dominating in the examined Norway spruce mycorrhizosphere. In conclusion, our results show that fatty acid based methods can be useful in studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, both as a quick method for differentiation of fungal species and also in studies of mycorrhiza-associated microorganisms in the field.

In this study, by inoculating white clover (Trifolium ripens L.) with AMF at two pH levels (pH 5.0 and 6.0), we investigated the influences of low pH on the colonization, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and promoting effect of AMF, and also compared the different responses of native AMF community and exotic species (Gigaspora margarita) to low pH. PCR-DGGE profiles revealed the obvious difference in native AMF community structure between low and high pH. Compared to low pH, high pH decreased the total and vesicle colonization, external hyphae length density of native AMF, but exerted no effect on those of exotic AMF. For both native and exotic AMF, high pH enhanced the proportions of arbuscule and fungal structure with ALP activity in colonized roots. Both native and exotic AMF promoted the shoot biomass, with greater increase at low pH than at high pH. Plant growth was more dependent on exotic AMF than on native AMF at both pH levels. The same trends were observed in P uptake as in biomass. Our study suggested that the increase in pH can exert inhibitory effects on AMF species native to acidic soil, including ecological (community structure), functional (ALP activity) and developmental (hyphal length, vesicle and arbuscule percentage, total colonization) aspects, but have no effect on exotic species in the present experiment.

Conifer mortality tends to be more common in high-elevation forests where stress from weather, insects, and disease result in higher rates of mortality and in the drier interior forests where mortality from fire, insects, and disease are common. Immediate mortality from fire damage may be obvious, but currently there is considerable controversy about labeling fire-injured green trees as dead that have a high probability of experiencing delayed mortality. Trees die when carbohydrates used in respiration exceed those produced in photosynthesis or water movement is impaired, the tree desiccates, and photosynthesis ceases. Immediate or delayed tree mortality may be directly due to biotic or abiotic causes and may be affected by previous damage, current condition (vigor), and attack by secondary agents such as bark beetles. A particular pathogen or insect usually attacks, damages, or kills only one portion of a tree. Trees that are damaged or attacked by pests and expected to have a dead or nonfunctional root system or a nonfunctional stem within 5 years may be considered either dead or death is imminent. Numerous studies have produced logistic regression equations or other statistical models to help determine probability of tree survival. We define and propose that a ""dead tree"" designation is justified for most species when at least three of the four quadrants from around the base of the root collar has cambium, inner bark, or phloem that are discolored and dead. For large ponderosa pines, a dead tree has all four quadrants with dead cambium.","USDA Forest Serv, Portland, OR 97208 USA; USDA Forest Serv, Blue Mt Pest Management Serv Ctr, Forestry & Range Sci Lab, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Filip, GM (reprint author), USDA Forest Serv, Portland, OR 97208 USA.",gmfilip@fs.fed.us,,,,,,104,7,7,3,37,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0885-6095,,,WEST J APPL FOR,West.

The parameters under study were (i) the growth of the plant, (ii) the functional diversity of soil microflora and (iii) the rock phosphate (RP) solubilizing activity. C. atlantica growth was measured after 12 months of culture in plastic bags arranged in a randomised complete block design with 10 replicates per treatment. Fungal inoculation consisted of either Glomus intraradices alone or a mixture of native AM fungi. P amendment was supplied under the form of Khouribga Rock Phosphate (KRP) powder. Microbial catabolic diversity was assessed by measuring CO2 production of SIR (substrate induced respiration) responses. Results showed that: (i) the fungal symbionts were effective to improve the growth of C. atlantica, confirming the requirement of mycorrhizal symbiosis for the successful establishment of C. atlantica in a degraded soil; (ii) G. intraradices appeared to be the most effective in promoting growth of C. atlantica, whereas indigenous AM fungi were relatively ineffective. Native AM fungi inoculation strongly modified functional abilities of the soil microflora, and in the treatments with P amendment, growth stimulations of native AM fungi inoculation were significantly higher than those of G. intraradices inoculation for the shoot growth and leaf P content; (iii) C. atlantica plants inoculated with native AM fungi could mobilize P from KRP more efficiently than those mycorrhized with G. intraradices. A strong interaction between KRP amendment and fungus inoculation was detected for the leaf P content results. In conclusion, the use of a mixture of native AM fungi combination may increase the chance of including one very effective fungal isolate, but also, creates a more favourable environment for the development of ecosystems processes.

The enhanced carbon transfer to the root system may result in enhanced rhizodeposition and subsequent transfer to soil C pools. However, the impact of elevated CO2 On soil C contents has yielded variable results. The fate and function of this extra C into the soil in response to elevated CO, are not clear. The POPFACE experiment was initiated early 1999 with the objective to determine the functional responses of a short-rotation poplar plantation to actual and future atmospheric CO, concentrations. During the first 2 years of the second rotation (2002-2003), the increase of total soil C% was larger under FACE than under ambient CO2. Chemical fractionation revealed the presence of more labile soil C under FACE, which is in agreement with the larger input of plant litter and root exudates under FACE. In order to gain insight into the fate and function of this extra C into the soil and the dynamics of soil C, we incubated soil samples, measured respiration rates and used a simple soil C model to interpret the results. FACE increased the accumulated 28-day CO2 production and the initial C-slow pool content (metabolizable plant remains and partly decomposed SOM). FACE also increased the decomposition rates of the metabolizable C pools (C-fast + C-slow) in the top soil, while for the subsoil the opposite effect was observed. The modeled formation of humified SOM was also enhanced by FACE. Our results support the terrestrial feedback hypothesis, i.e. an increase of the long-term terrestrial C sink in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A reciprocal transfer experiment, in concert with coarse and fine mesh bags that allowed or excluded fine root in-growth, was used to examine how the composition of these forest floor microbial communities respond to changes in belowground inputs from fine roots, aboveground inputs (e.g. from litter and through-fall) and soil microclimatic conditions over I year. Neither the microbial biomass nor the microbial community structure (assessed using phospholipid fatty acid analyses and substrate-induced respiration techniques) of forest floors of ASPEN or SPRUCE origin were altered by reciprocal transfer to SPRUCE or ASPEN stands, with or without fine root inputs. Despite the lack of changes in microbial community structure, the stand type during incubation had a strong effect on forest floor moisture content and concentrations of nitrate, while mesh size had a significant effect on forest floor pH and the abundance of mesofauna. Thus, changes in microbial community structure did not co-occur with changes in other characteristics of these forest floors. The resistance of the forest floor microbial communities to change may be a function of the high C contents of these soils. Further treatment effects may have been detected if the study had been extended beyond I year. Reciprocal transfer studies using coarse and fine mesh bags allow transferred soils to respond to fluctuations in microclimate, organic inputs and soil biota and, therefore, hold considerable promise for studies examining the influence of disturbances on soil properties.

All isolates belonged to the same bacterial genus (Burkholderia) that predominates on M. pigra in its native geographic range in tropical America. However, the Australian Burkholderia strains represented several divergent lineages, none of which had a close relationship to currently known Burkholderia strains in American M. pigra populations. Inoculation of M. pigra with Australian strains resulted in equal or higher plant growth and nodule nitrogenase activity (measured by acetylene reduction assays) relative to outcomes with bacteria from M. pigra's native geographic region. The main difference in symbiotic phenotype for bacteria from the two regions involved responses to an alternate Mimosa host species: Central American strains failed to fix nitrogen in association with Mimosa pudica, while most Australian Burkholderia isolates tested had high nodule nitrogenase activity in association with both Mimosa species. Invasive M. pigra populations in Australia have therefore acquired a diverge assemblage of nodule bacteria that are effective nitrogenfixing symbionts, despite having a broader host range and a distant genetic relationship to bacterial strains found in the plant's ancestral region.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; CSIRO, Cooperat Res Ctr Australian Weed Management, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; Landcare Res Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand","Parker, MA (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",mparker@binghamton.edu,,,,,,48,47,50,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Mill.) woodland. Trenched and nontrenched plots were replicated in the woodland matrix, at gap edges, and in gap centers representing a range of overstory stocking. One-half of each plot received a herbicide treatment to remove the understory. We monitored pine survival and growth, understory productivity, light level (gap fraction), and soil resources. The overstory facilitated pine seedling survival. Pine seedling growth was reduced as overstory stocking increased. Reduced growth of seedlings was also observed in gaps when the understory was left intact. Understory plants competed with seedlings by filling the root gaps that developed as a result of overstory disturbance. Hardwood growth increased in gaps, owing to decreased belowground competition with adult pines, while growth of herbaceous plants and pine seedlings increased with light availability. Large overstory gaps are not required to initiate regeneration in Ion-leaf pine woodlands. Retaining overstory dispersed throughout the stand but variable in density, through single-tree selection approaches, may be an alternative to gap-based approaches.

Direct, experimentally controlled comparisons of endophyte free (E-) and endophyte containing (E+) plant tissues in T. cacao show that foliar endophytes ( FEF) that commonly occur in healthy host leaves enhance host defenses against foliar damage due to the pathogen ( Phytophthora palmivora). Similarly, root inoculations with commonly occurring AMF also reduce foliar damage due to the same pathogen. These results suggest that endophytic fungi can play a potentially important mutualistic role by augmenting host defensive responses against pathogens. There are two broad classes of potential mechanisms by which endophytes could contribute to host protection: (1) inducing or increasing the expression of intrinsic host defense mechanisms and (2) providing additional sources of defense, extrinsic to those of the host ( e. g., endophyte-based chemical antibiosis). The degree to which either of these mechanisms predominates holds distinct consequences for the evolutionary ecology of host-endophyte-pathogen relationships. More generally, the growing recognition that plants are composed of a mosaic of plant and fungal tissues holds a series of implications for the study of plant defense, physiology, and genetics.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Miami, FL 34002 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Herre, EA (reprint author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, APO AA,Unit 0948, Miami, FL 34002 USA.",HERREA@si.edu,"Van Bael, Sunshine/K-1930-2019; Van Bael, Sunshine/M-5370-2019","Van Bael, Sunshine/0000-0001-7317-3533; Mejia, Luis/0000-0003-2135-5241",,,,85,142,169,2,100,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2007,88,3,,,,,550,558,,10.1890/05-1606,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156SB,WOS:000245668500003,17503581,,,,10/31/19J,"Aldrich-Wolfe, L",,,,"Aldrich-Wolfe, Laura",,,Distinct mycorrhizal communities on new and established hosts in a transitional tropical plant community,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Brachiaria; common mycorrhizal network; Glomus; host specificity; internal transcribed spacer; reforestation; soil disturbance; T-RFLP; Terminalia amazonia; tropical forest; Urochloa,SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; FUNGI; DIVERSITY; FOREST; GRASSLAND; VEGETATION; ROOTS; SOIL; COLONIZATION,"The extent to which interspecific plants share mycorrhizal fungal communities depends on the specificity of the symbiosis. For tropical forest tree seedlings, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi associated with established vegetation could have important consequences for survival and growth. I used a novel molecular technique to assess the potential for sharing of mycorrhizas in forest and pasture in southern Costa Rica, by identifying arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi in roots of the forest canopy tree species Terminalia amazonia, pasture grasses Urochloa ruziziensis and U. decumbens, and seedlings of T. amazonia planted into experimental reforestation plots. I tested the hypotheses that experimental seedlings were colonized either by the AM fungal community of the forest T. amazonia ( suggesting host specificity) or of Urochloa ( suggesting absence of specificity/importance of local environment). After two years, pasture-grown T. amazonia seedlings were colonized by neither community, but rather by a species of Glomus that was rarely observed on the other plants. These results suggest that conspecific seedlings planted into existing vegetation generate a distinct mycorrhizal community that may influence competitive interactions and the relative costs and benefits of the AM fungal symbiosis at early stages in the life cycle of tropical trees.","Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Aldrich-Wolfe, L (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",law6@ksu.edu,,,,,,43,44,46,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2007,88,3,,,,,559,566,,10.1890/05-1177,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156SB,WOS:000245668500004,17503582,,,,10/31/19J,"McGuire, KL",,,,"McGuire, Krista L.",,,Common ectomycorrhizal networks may maintain monodominance in a tropical rain forest,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,common mycorrhizal network; Dicymbe corymbosa; distance dependence; ectomycorrhizal association; Guyana; monodominance; seedling survival; tropical rain forest diversity,MYCORRHIZAL NETWORKS; MONOSPECIFIC DOMINANCE; VEGETATIVE MYCELIUM; DIVERSITY; CARBON; TREES; PLANTS; FUNGI; SEEDLINGS; GROWTH,"Most tropical rain forests contain diverse arrays of tree species that form arbuscular mycorrhizae. In contrast, the less common monodominant rain forests, in which one tree species comprises more than 50% of the canopy, frequently contain ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associates. In this study, I explored the potential for common ECM networks, created by aggregations of ECM trees, to enhance seedling survivorship near parent trees. I determined the benefit conferred by the common ECM network on seedling growth and survivorship of an ECM monodominant species in Guyana. Seedlings with access to an ECM network had greater growth (73% greater), leaf number (55% more), and survivorship (47% greater) than seedlings without such access, suggesting that the ECM network provides a survivorship advantage. A survey of wild seedlings showed positive distance-dependent distribution and survival with respect to conspecific adults. These experimental and survey results suggest that the negative distance-dependent mechanisms at the seedling stage thought to maintain tropical rain forest diversity are reversed for ECM seedlings, which experience positive feedbacks from the ECM network. These results may in part explain the local monodominance of an ECM tree species within the matrix of high-diversity, tropical rain forest.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","McGuire, KL (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 830 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",mcguirek@umich.edu,,,,,,52,99,108,2,121,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2007,88,3,,,,,567,574,,10.1890/05-1173,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,156SB,WOS:000245668500005,17503583,,,,10/31/19J,"Ohtsuka, T; Mo, WH; Satomura, T; Inatomi, M; Koizumi, H",,,,"Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki; Mo, Wenhong; Satomura, Takami; Inatomi, Motoko; Koizumi, Hiroshi",,,Biometric based carbon flux measurements and net ecosystem production (NEP) in a temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest beneath a flux tower,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,AsiaFlux; carbon flux; dwarf bamboo; heterotrophic respiration; net ecosystem exchange; net primary production; soil organic matter; soil respiration; temperate deciduous forests,EDDY-COVARIANCE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; MIDLATITUDE FOREST; SOIL RESPIRATION; DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; CENTRAL JAPAN; WATER-VAPOR; SEQUESTRATION; CLIMATE; STORAGE,"Biometric based carbon flux measurements were conducted over 5 years (1999 - 2003) in a temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest of the AsiaFlux network to estimate net ecosystem production (NEP). Biometric based NEP, as measured by the balance between net primary production (including NPP of canopy trees and of forest floor dwarf bamboo) and heterotrophic respiration (RH), clarified the contribution of various biological processes to the ecosystem carbon budget, and also showed where and how the forest is storing C. The mean NPP of the trees was 5.4 +/- 1.07 t C ha(-1) y(-1), including biomass increment (0.3 +/- 0.82 t C ha(-1) y(-1)), tree mortality (1.0 +/- 0.61 t C ha(-1) y(-1)), aboveground detritus production (2.3 +/- 0.39 t C ha(-1) y(-1)) and belowground fine root production (1.8 +/- 0.31 t C ha(-1) y(-1)). Annual biomass increment was rather small because of high tree mortality during the 5 years. Total NPP at the site was 6.5 +/- 1.07 t C ha(-1) y(-1), including the NPP of the forest floor community (1.1 +/- 0.06 t C ha(-1) y(-1)). The soil surface CO2 efflux (RS) was averaged across the 5 years of record using open-flow chambers. The mean estimated annual RS amounted to 7.1 +/- 0.44 t C ha(-1), and the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) was estimated at 3.9 +/- 0.24 t C ha(-1). RH was estimated at 4.4 +/- 0.32 t C ha(-1) y(-1), which included decomposition of coarse woody debris. Biometric NEP in the forest was estimated at 2.1 +/- 1.15 t C ha(-1) y(-1), which agreed well with the eddy-covariance based net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The contribution of woody increment (Dbiomass + mortality) of the canopy trees to NEP was rather small, and thus the SOM pool played an important role in carbon storage in the temperate forest. These results suggested that the dense forest floor of dwarf bamboo might have a critical role in soil carbon sequestration in temperate East Asian deciduous forests.","Ibaraki Univ, Lab Ecol, Fac Sci, Mito, Ibaraki 3108512, Japan; Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Agro Meteorol Div, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan; Japanese Agcy Marine Sci & Technol, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; Gifu Univ, Inst Basin Ecosyst Studies, Gifu 5011193, Japan","Ohtsuka, T (reprint author), Ibaraki Univ, Lab Ecol, Fac Sci, 2-1-1 Bunkyo, Mito, Ibaraki 3108512, Japan.",toshi@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp,", _______/V-6687-2019",", _______/0000-0002-9032-7933",,,,57,49,57,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,MAR,2007,10,2,,,,,324,334,,10.1007/s10021-007-9017-z,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,191ML,WOS:000248135200011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Busso, CA; Bolletta, AI",,,,"Busso, Carlos Alberto; Bolletta, Andrea Ivana",,,Perennial grasses of different successional stages under various soil water inputs: Do they differ in root length density?,INTERCIENCIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Argentinian rangelands; competitive ability; herbivory tolerance; root growth; Stipa sp.; water stress,MEDICAGO-MINIMA; SEMIARID ARGENTINA; ERODIUM-CICUTARIUM; GROWTH; STRESS; DEFOLIATION; DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; COMPETITION; MICROSITES,"Information about root length density (RLD) on perennial grasses of different successional stages exposed to various soil water inputs is limited. The effects on RLD of different soil water inputs were evaluated in the late-seral Stipa clarazii Ball, the comparatively earlier-seral S. tenuis Phil, and the early-seral S. gynerioides Phil. Field studies were conducted in 1996 and early 1997, although treatments were imposed since 1995. S. clarazii and S. tenuis are two important palatable perennial tussock grasses in temperate, semiarid rangelands of central Argentina, where S. gynerioides is one of the most abundant, unpalatable perennial grass species. It was hypothesized that 1) S. clarazii and S. tenuis have a lower RLD under irrigated than under rainfed or water stress conditions, 2) S. clarazii has a greater RLD than S. gynerioides and S. tenuis under all water inputs and sampling dates, and 3) the RLD of the three species will vary with sampling date, within each species and soil water level. Results led to reject hypothesis 1 and accept hypotheses 2 and 3. Maintenance of root growth under all water inputs would allow these species a greater soil exploration and resource finding to sustain regrowth in their native, semi-arid environments. Also, the study demonstrated that late-seral perennial grasses (S. clarazii) should have a superior competitive ability than earlier seral grasses (S. tenuis and S. gynerioides) because of, at least in part, their greater average RLD under water stress, rainfed and irrigated conditions.","UNS, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Argentina; Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; INTA, Bordenave, Argentina","Busso, CA (reprint author), UNS, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Argentina.",cebusso@criba.edu.ar,,,,,,48,6,8,0,5,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,MAR,2007,32,3,,,,,206,212,,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,154CL,WOS:000245484300012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Palacio, S; Montserrat-Marti, G",,,,"Palacio, S.; Montserrat-Marti, G.",,,Above and belowground phenology of four Mediterranean sub-shrubs.

However, fine root growth phenology is rarely considered in most phenological studies. In this article we describe the above and belowground phenology of four species of Mediterranean sub-shrubs growing along a gradient of temperature and water availability, with special attention at the relationship between both processes. Observations were conducted monthly over a minimum of 12 months per species. Fine root growth varied significantly throughout the year, being higher in autumn than in spring and minimum in summer. In the species growing in cold areas, root growth was also reduced during winter. Shoot growth was maximum in spring for the four study species, buts its beginning was related to the site temperature, being earlier in those species growing in warmer sites. The species displaying a short vegetative period tended to separate root and shoot growth processes throughout the year. These results emphasize the importance of water availability and winter cold on fine root growth. A trade-off appears to exist between the duration of the vegetative period and the overlap between root and shoot growth processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, experiments on this phenomenon have manipulated not only the presence/absence of neighbours, but also substrate volume. Restricted substrate volume can itself affect plant growth, possibly through chemical self-inhibition of root growth. We conducted an experiment with oats (Avena sativa) to examine whether the experimental design used in previous studies on the tragedy of the commons in root competition might have confounded the effects of detection of neighbours and substrate volume. Six treatments combined two factors, namely the presence or absence of activated carbon, and either the presence of a plastic or a mesh partition, or the absence of a partition, between two plants in a pot. Activated carbon was used to adsorb root exudates and reduce their potential effects on root growth. In a seventh treatment, plants were grown alone in pots with half the substrate volume replaced by gravel, to fragment the distribution of available resources. We observed no tragedy of the commons in a comparison of the performance of plants grown with and without partitions; plants performed equally well in the presence and absence of root competition. In the treatment with gravel, plants displayed reduced tillering and shoot growth per unit root mass, and an earlier switch to reproduction. Pot partitioning was associated with inhibition of root growth that was mediated by root exudates. When activated carbon was present, plants in partitioned pots performed better than plants growing with a root competitor. We conclude that two processes could determine plant growth in the experimental design used in studies of the tragedy of the commons: (i) greater root self-inhibition in the more limited space of partitioned pots, and (ii) inefficient root placement in larger substrate volumes in unpartitioned pots that are shared with roots of a competitor. These findings provide a new challenge for experimental designs attempting to demonstrate the role of self/non-self discrimination in root competition.","Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Semchenko, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",marina.semchenko@ut.ee,,"John, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9281-536X",,,,39,67,72,1,66,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The ratio between the amounts of added P required for the same yield of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants is termed the relative effectiveness of the mycorrhiza. Variation in this relative effectiveness was examined for subterranean clover grown on a high P-fixing soil. Plants were either left non-mycorrhizal or inoculated with one of three AM fungal species with well-characterised differences in external hyphal spread. With no P added, plants from all treatments produced < 10% of their maximum growth achieved at non-limiting P supply. The growth response of non-mycorrhizal plants was markedly sigmoid. Mycorrhizal growth responses were not sigmoid but their shape was two-phased. The first phase was an asymptotic approach to 25-30% of maximum growth, followed by a second asymptotic rise to maximum growth. Growth effects of Glomus invermaium and Acaulospora laevis were quite similar. Plants in these treatments produced up to four times greater shoot dry biomass than non-mycorrhizal plants. Scutellospora calospora was less effective. The relative effectiveness of AM fungi varied with the level of P application. This is expected to apply to all soils on which a sigmoid response is obtained for growth of non-mycorrhizal plants. In a simple approximation the relative effectiveness was calculated to range from 1.46 to 15.57. Shoot P contents were increased by up to 25 times by A. laevis, significantly more than by the other two fungi. The further mycelial spread of this fungus is thought to have contributed to its relatively greater effect on plant P content.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Schweiger, PF (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",peter.schweiger@boku.ac.at,"Abbott, Lynette K/F-7489-2011","Abbott, Lynette K/0000-0001-8586-7858; Schweiger, Peter/0000-0003-2967-7835",,,,40,13,14,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2007,292,2-Jan,,,,,181,192,,10.1007/s11104-007-9214-8,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,149BP,WOS:000245121900014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Arkhipova, TN; Prinsen, E; Veselov, SU; Martinenko, EV; Melentiev, AI; Kudoyarova, GR",,,,"Arkhipova, T.

We asked if decreased cytokinin concentrations mediate these adaptive responses by lessening water loss and promoting root growth thereby favouring exploration for soil water. Our approach was to follow the consequences for 12-d-old lettuce seedlings of inoculating the growing medium with cytokinin-producing bacteria under conditions of water sufficiency and deficit. Inoculation increased shoot cytokinins as assessed by immunoassay and mass spectrometry. Inoculation also promoted the accumulation of shoot mass and shortened roots while having a smaller effect on root mass. Inoculation did not raise stomatal conductance. The possible promoting effect of these cytokinins on stomatal conductance was seemingly hampered by increases in shoot ABA that inoculation also induced. Inoculation lowered root/shoot ratios by stimulating shoot growth. The effect was greater in non-droughted plants but remained sufficiently strong for shoot mass of inoculated droughted plants to exceed that of well-watered non-inoculated plants. We conclude that compensating for the loss of natural cytokinins in droughted plants interferes with the suppression of shoot growth and the enhancement of root elongation normally seen in droughted plants.","RAS, Ufa Res Ctr, Inst Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Ufa, Russia; Univ Antwerp, Lab Plant Biochem & Physiol, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Bashkir State Univ, Fac Biol, Ufa, Russia","Kudoyarova, GR (reprint author), RAS, Ufa Res Ctr, Inst Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Pr Oktyabrya,69, Ufa, Russia.",guzel@anrb.ru,"Kudoyarova, Guzel/O-9782-2015; Alexander, Melentiev/P-3862-2015; Prinsen, Els/M-8973-2016; Arkhipova, Tatiana/O-8513-2017","Prinsen, Els/0000-0003-4320-1585",,,,32,109,130,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2007,292,2-Jan,,,,,305,315,,10.1007/s11104-007-9233-5,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,149BP,WOS:000245121900024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rowe, HI; Brown, CS; Claassen, VP",,,,"Rowe, Helen I.; Brown, Cynthia S.; Claassen, Victor P.",,,Comparisons of mycorrhizal responsiveness with field soil and commercial inoculum for six native montane species and Bromus tectorum,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bromus tectorum; commercial inoculum; field inoculum; mycorrhiza; native species; restoration,SEMI-ARID WEST; PLANT DIVERSITY; REVEGETATION PRACTICES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FUNGI; RESPONSES; HISTORY; ROOTS; ENDOMYCORRHIZAE; ASSOCIATIONS,"Reestablishing native perennial plants and reducing invasive species are pivotal for many ecological restoration projects. The interactions among plant species, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and soil P availability may be critical determinants of the success of native and non-native plants in restoration and species invasions. Here we assessed mycorrhizal responsiveness for three late-successional and three early-successional plant species native to Rocky Mountain National Park and for the non-native Downy brome, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) using field soil and commercial inoculum. Factorial greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare biomass of plant species with and without field soil and commercial inoculum treatments along a phosphorus (P) gradient, which ranged from ambient field levels to 12% of field levels, using dilutions of native soils. The two field soil inoculum treatments resulted in significant biomass differences for all species studied. Late-successional species responded positively to field inoculum, whereas early-successional species responded negatively. The two commercial inocula had low colonization rates (14 of 166 inoculated plants). The commercial inocula substrates had significant treatment effects on five of seven species included in the study in the apparent absence of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Soil P levels influenced mycorrhizal responsiveness in only one species, Smooth blue aster (Aster laevis L.). Our results show that, at least for the species studied here, locally collected field inoculum is the best choice for reestablishment of late-successional native plant species.","Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Rowe, HI (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, 915 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ivy@purdue.edu,"Brown, Cynthia/K-5814-2012","Rowe, Helen/0000-0002-1545-7658",,,,45,53,61,4,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

The experiment consisted of 50 species mixtures fertilized with N or P, at high or low levels. Results from the past 5 years were as follows: (1) aboveground biomass increased and year-to-year variability declined with increases in plant species and functional form richness, mostly as a result of substantial increases in minimum biomass (maximum biomass was unaffected). (2) Aboveground biomass and biomass stability increased when the species in the mixture had: (a) high relative growth rates, root density, root surface area per unit of root biomass, uptake rates of N or P per unit of root surface area, and N use efficiency and (b) low root to shoot ratio. (3) Invasion of nonseeded species declined with increases in plant species and functional form richness. (4) The results from this experiment did not provide a single specific criterion for selecting an optimal species mixture. However, if the objectives of the restoration were simply to achieve an aboveground biomass variability that is less than that of growing-season precipitation, then the seed mixtures need to have a minimum of nine species and three functional forms.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA","Biondini, M (reprint author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",mario.biondini@ndsu.edu,,,,,,50,22,24,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Yet, the use of this tool appears to have the unintended effect of favoring the regeneration of some introduced grasses. Although both native and introduced perennial grasses evolved under the influence of fire, it is their response to mycotrophy in the immediate postburn environment that appears to give some grasses such as Lovegrass the advantage. In an exploratory study, two greenhouse experiments were completed in conjunction with a larger field study. A bioassay of soil from the study site found that soil exposed to burning had a significantly (p <= 0.0001) lower mycorrhizal infection percentage than soil not exposed to burning, results which could not be explained by postburn erosion losses of inoculum alone. Results of the second greenhouse study revealed that differential response to mycotrophy clearly separated the Lovegrass (Eragrostis spp.) from the other genera studied. Lovegrass not infected by mycorrhizal fungi produced greater shoot biomass and inflorescence before the other noninfected studied grasses. Yet, infected Lovegrass did not develop inflorescence before harvest as the other genera infected by the mycorrhizal fungi did. Study results suggest that the lack of dependence by Lovegrass on mycorrhizal infection for reestablishing itself in the postburn environment gives it an advantage over those that do.","Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","O'Dea, ME (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources, Room 325 Biol Sci E, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",me_odea@hotmail.com,,,,,,43,6,6,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Analyzing natural EcM fungal communities has traditionally been a highly skilled, time-consuming process relying heavily on exacting morphological characterization of EcM root tips. Increasingly powerful molecular methods for analyzing EcM communities make this area of research available to a much wider range of researchers. Ecologists can gain from the body of work characterizing EcM while avoiding the requirement for exceptional expertise by carefully combining elements of traditional methods with the more recent molecular approaches. A cursory morphological analysis can yield a traditional quantification of EcM fungi based on tip numbers, a unit with functional and historical significance. Ectomycorrhizal root DNA extracts may then be analyzed with molecular methods widely used for characterizing microbiota. These range from methods applicable only to the simple mixes resulting from careful morphotyping, to community-oriented methods that identify many types in mixed samples as well as provide an estimate of their relative abundances. Extramatrical hyphae in bulk soil can also be more effectively studied, extending characterization of EcM fungal communities beyond the rhizoplane. The trend toward techniques permitting larger sample sets without prohibitive labor and time requirements will also permit us to more frequently address the issues of spatial and temporal variability and better characterize the roles of EcM fungi at multiple scales.","William Paterson Univ, Dept Biol, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA","Martin, KJ (reprint author), William Paterson Univ, Dept Biol, 300 Pompton Rd, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA.",MartinK31@wpunj.edu,,"Martin, Kendall/0000-0003-4833-4301",,,,76,12,12,0,11,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Here the effect of the holoparasitic endophyte Bdallophyton americanum (R. Br.) Harms on the root conductivity of Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. was studied. Parasitized and non-parasitized root segments were sampled in the rainy and dry seasons in a dry coastal forest in central Veracruz, Mexico. Root diameter, hydraulic (K (h)) and specific conductivity (K-s = K-h/root transverse area), percent loss of conductivity and reproductive specific conductivity (K-h/inflorescence or infructescense dry weight) data were obtained. The diameter and number of conductive and non-conductive vessels were recorded in parasitized and non-parasitized root segments in the dry season. Root diameters were not different between root types and seasons, but root specific conductivity was different both between seasons and root types. Specific conductivity on parasitized roots was 61% (wet season) and 85% (dry season) lower than that recorded for non-parasitized roots in the wet season. Root hydraulic conductivity was positively related with the biomass of reproductive structures of B. americanum in the wet season. The parasite appears to alter the xylem morphogenesis of the host, reducing vessel number by 40%, but not plugging or otherwise harming the conductive vessels, and resulted in no change in vessel diameter. Contrary to what has been reported to occur in some plant stems infected with hemiparasitic mistletoes, B. americanum decreases but does not eliminate conductivity to the distal plant parts.","Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Funct, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico; Inst Ecol, Dept Prod Forestales, Skopje 91000, Macedonia","Garcia-Franco, JG (reprint author), Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Funct, Apartado Pstal 63, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico.",franco@inecol.edu.mx,"Garcia-Franco, Jose G./Q-4574-2019; Angeles, Guillermo/O-9675-2019; Garcia-Franco, Jose G./M-3483-2014; Portillo, Jorge Lopez/L-2492-2014","Garcia-Franco, Jose G./0000-0003-0540-6045; Angeles, Guillermo/0000-0002-0455-4997; Garcia-Franco, Jose G./0000-0003-0540-6045; Portillo, Jorge Lopez/0000-0002-6827-3297",,,,30,2,5,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Here, we discuss the potential coevolutionary interdependence of the strength and specificity of symbiotic interactions with the complexity and productivity of their environment. We predict that interactions become less beneficial with increasing environmental quality and that the association of productivity with symbiont specificity depends on the relative strengths of tradeoffs between host range and other life-history parameters. However, as biotic complexity increases, pathogen specificity is predicted to decline, whereas mutualist specificity will increase. Testing these predictions on a geographical scale would contribute significantly to the predictive science of coevolution, and to our ability to manage biological interactions embedded in increasingly fragmented landscapes.","CSIRO, Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Thrall, PH (reprint author), CSIRO, Plant Ind, GPOB 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Peter.Thrall@csiro.au,"Burdon, Jeremy/B-9913-2009",,,,,80,192,196,5,164,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

In the second growing season, perennial grass cover and infiltration rates continued to be lower on the burned plots. There were also appreciable declines in fungal variables, water stable aggregates (WSA) and other variables indicating declines in surface soil structure that were not present in the first year. Significant correlative relationships were evident between plant, fungal and physical soil attributes.

The model plants were inoculated either with propagules of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Glomus mosseae BEG95, which represented the initial stages of succession, or were provided with the pre-established extraradical mycelium (ERM) network of the same AMF isolate, which simulated later succession stages. The plant species used-non-mycotrophic Atriplex sagittata and Sisymbrium loeselii, and mycotrophic Tripleurospermum inodorum, Calamagrostis epigejos and Elytrigia repens - represented succession dominants at those sites. Even though the grasses were colonised in both mycorrhizal treatments, the presence of an established ERM network increased the intensity of their colonisation and arbuscular abundance. No trace of colonisation of non-mycotrophic plants was found in the treatment inoculated with propagules. Surprisingly, marked colonisation, including abundant arbuscules, was observed when non-mycotrophic plants were grown in the presence of a pre-established ERM network. In A. sagittata, arbuscules were found at maturity and senescence of the plants after 16 weeks of growth. In S. loeselii, however, the arbuscules were found at the vegetative stage of the leaf rosette after 8 weeks and then completely disappeared during the following weeks. When the ability of propagules and ERM to induce mycorrhizal colonisation is compared, it seems that the established mycelium probably has an enhanced potential to colonise roots of plants, even if the plants belong to species usually not hosting mycorrhizal fungi.

Fire-related effects on aboveground ecosystem components are well established, and it is known that fire can have both a direct and an indirect influence on the edaphic environment, but the effects of fire on soil-dwelling fungi are poorly understood. We review the disparate literature relating to fire effects on soil fungi, with emphasis on forest environments. A variety of effects have been reported, including altered fungal community structure along with increased or decreased mycorrhizal colonization of roots. Such effects, along with their duration, appear to be site- and (or) fire-specific, but are likely to be greater in the upper soil horizons. Where repeated burning occurs, the effects on soil fungal communities appear to be more pronounced with more frequent burning. Although fire may effect structural changes in soil fungal communities, the functional significance of such changes at the ecosystem level remains difficult to assess.","Univ W Sydney, Ctr Plant & Food Sci, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia","Cairney, JWG (reprint author), Univ W Sydney, Ctr Plant & Food Sci, Parramatta Campus,Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",j.cairney@uws.edu.au,,,,,,85,76,80,7,67,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS,OTTAWA,"BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The effects of planting location and time were assessed in relation to subsequent seedling performance and ectomycorrhizal diversity. Application of advanced regeneration, where seedlings were planted one growing season before the clear-cut event, resulted in increased seedling growth in the clear-cut area over the subsequent 4 years. However, Counterparts planted in the interface zone in 1997, between the future uncut stand and the clear-cut area, exhibited poorer growth compared with those planted after clear-cut harvesting. The interface zone was generally richest in ectomycorrhizal diversity, and this was confirmed using complementary morphotyping and rDNA-based identification methods. Large numbers of ectomycorrhizal types were present on Scots pine seedling roots and instead of detecting dramatic changes in total number of types, species composition changes could be better related to changes in exploratory types of ectomycorrhizas with a trend towards less rhizomorphic types in the clear-cut treatment compared with the control forest.

We assessed the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in Mojave Desert soils using extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs), and gross N transformation rates. Soils were collected from unvegetated interspaces between plants and under the dominant shrub (Larrea tridentata) during the 2004-2005 growing season, an above-average rainfall year. Because most measured variables responded strongly to soil water availability, all significant effects of soil water content were used as covariates to remove potential confounding effects of water availability on microbial responses to experimental treatment effects of cover type, CO2, and sampling date. Microbial C and N activities were lower in interspace soils compared with soils under Larrea, and responses to date and CO2 treatments were cover specific. Over the growing season, EEAs involved in cellulose (cellobiohydrolase) and orthophosphate (alkaline phosphatase) degradation decreased under ambient CO2, but increased under elevated CO2. Microbial C use and substrate use diversity in CLPPs decreased over time, and elevated CO2 positively affected both. Elevated CO2 also altered microbial C use patterns, suggesting changes in the quantity and/or quality of soil C inputs. In contrast, microbial biomass N was higher in interspace soils than soils under Larrea, and was lower in soils exposed to elevated CO2. Gross rates of NH4+ transformations increased over the growing season, and late-season NH4+ fluxes were negatively affected by elevated CO2. Gross NO3- fluxes decreased over time, with early season interspace soils positively affected by elevated CO2. General increases in microbial activities under elevated CO2 are likely attributable to greater microbial biomass in interspace soils, and to increased microbial turnover rates and/or metabolic levels rather than pool size in soils under Larrea. Because soil water content and plant cover type dominates microbial C and N responses to CO2, the ability of desert landscapes to mitigate or intensify the impacts of global change will ultimately depend on how changes in precipitation and increasing atmospheric CO2 shift the spatial distribution of Mojave Desert plant communities.","USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA; Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Jin, VL (reprint author), USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, 808 E Blackland Rd, Temple, TX 76502 USA.",vjin@spa.ars.usda.gov,/A-8829-2010,/0000-0002-0446-2806,,,,64,40,40,4,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Location: Central Queensland, Australia. Methods: Patterns of tree death between eucalypt species were compared from field data collected after drought. Soil conditions during drought were described and compared with patterns of tree death for the Ironbark Eucalyptus melanophloia. The basal area and orientation of coarse roots were measured on upturned trees after broad-scale tree clearing, and compared between species, and between live and dead trees with tree size as a covariate. Results: Drought-induced tree death was higher for dominant Ironbark-Box than for sub-dominant Bloodwoods. During a moderate to severe drought in 2004, 41 % of 100 cm deep sub-soils had soil matric potential less than -5600 kPa. The drought hardy Bloodwoods had a greater root basal area and particularly so for vertical roots compared to the drought sensitive Ironbark-Box. Within species there was no significant difference in root basal area characteristics between trees that were recently killed by drought and those that remained relatively healthy. Surface soil moisture availability was lower where tree densities were high, and tree death increased as surface soil moisture became less available. Tree death was also greater as the clay content of sub-soils increased. Discussion: The study suggests species with roots confined to upper soil layers will suffer severe water stress. The results strongly indicate that root architecture, and the way it facilitates water use during drought, is important for the relative dominance of the tree species. Patchiness in drought-induced tree death seems to be at least partially a product of heterogeneity in sub-soil conditions and competition for soil moisture.","Environm Protect Agcy, Queensland Herbarium, Toowong, Qld 4066, Australia","Fensham, RJ (reprint author), Environm Protect Agcy, Queensland Herbarium, Mt Coottha Rd, Toowong, Qld 4066, Australia.",rod.fensham@epa.qld.gov.au; russell.fairfax@epa.qld.gov.au,,"Fensham, Roderick/0000-0003-3658-5867",,,,33,57,59,1,44,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-770 13 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

This study aimed at evaluating changes in soybean rhizobia due to adaptation to inhospitable environmental conditions (high temperatures, drought, and acid soils) in the Brazilian Cerrados. Both the host plant and combinations of four strains of soybean Bradyrhizobium were introduced in an uncropped soil devoid of rhizobia capable of nodulating soybean. After the third year, seeds were not reinoculated. Two hundred and sixty-three isolates were obtained from nodules of field-grown soybean after the seventh year, and their morphological, physiological, serological, and symbiotic properties determined, followed by genetic analysis of conserved and symbiotic genes. B. japonicum strain CPAC 15 (same serogroup as USDA 123) was characterized as having high saprophytic capacity and competitiveness and by the seventh year represented up to 70% of the cultivable population, in contrast to the poor survival and competitiveness of B. japonicum strain CPAC 7 (same serogroup as CB 1809). In general, adapted strains had increased mucoidy, and up to 43% of the isolates showed no serological reaction. High variability, presumably resulting from the adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions, was verified in rep-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) profiles, being lower in strain CPAC 15, intermediate in B. elkanli, and higher in CPAC 7. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR types of the 16S rDNA corresponded to the following: one type for B. elkanii species, two for B. japonicum, associated to CPAC 15 and CPAC 7, and unknown combinations of profiles. However, when node sequences and RFLP-PCR of the nifH region data were considered, only two clusters were observed having full congruence with B. Japonicum and B. elkanii species. Combining the results, variability was such that even within a genetically more stable group (such as that of CPAC 15), only 6.4% of the isolates showed high similarity to the inoculant strain, whereas none was similar to CPAC 7. The genetic variability in our study seems to result from a variety and combination of events including strain dispersion, genomic recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, the genetic variability appears to be mainly associated with adaptation, saprophytic capacity, and competitiveness, and not with symbiotic effectiveness, as the similarity of symbiotic genes was higher than that of conserved regions of the DNA.","Embrapa Soja, BR-86001970 Londrina, PR, Brazil; Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Microbiol, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil; Embrapa Cerrados, BR-73301970 Planaltina, DF, Brazil","Hungria, M (reprint author), Embrapa Soja, Cx Postal 231, BR-86001970 Londrina, PR, Brazil.",hungria@cnpso.embrapa.br,"Barcellos, Fernando/B-7948-2014; Batista, Jesiane/H-9554-2015; Mendes, Ieda/C-4513-2013","Batista, Jesiane/0000-0003-1292-9055; Mendes, Ieda/0000-0002-4011-7997; Hungria, Mariangela/0000-0002-5132-8685",,,,75,44,46,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

We examined competitive interactions between Rhizopogon occidentalis and R. salebrosus at Point Reyes National Seashore, California, USA. At three field sites, species abundances were compared in single- and two-species treatments on Pinus muricata seedlings inoculated with spores. Competition for root tips was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. In general, we found strong competitive exclusion of R. salebrosus by R. occidentalis, with >= 75% of the seedlings in the two-species treatment colonized exclusively by R. occidentalis after 5 and 10 months. However, on the seedlings that were co-colonized, we observed no significant difference in the abundances of R. salebrosus and R. occidentalis, suggesting that once R. salebrosus was established, it was no longer competitively inferior. There were no significant differences in survival, growth, or percentage leaf nitrogen of seedlings colonized with either Rhizopogon species, but both growth and percentage leaf nitrogen were significantly higher for ECM than non-ECM seedlings. We also observed strong positive correlations between actual ECM root tip weight and that inferred from real-time PCR for both species, indicating that this method provided an accurate assessment of root tip occupation and hence ECM competitive dynamics. In conjunction with a previous experiment, our results indicate that competition between these two Rhizopogon species occurs similarly in both field and laboratory settings and that when colonizing from spore, timing largely determines the outcome of initial competitive interactions.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci & Policy Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; IRTA, Dept Proteccio Vegetal, Cabrils 08348, Spain","Kennedy, PG (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, 321 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",pkennedy@berkeley.edu,,,,,,29,48,49,0,24,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We found that when grown in 7% soil moisture conditions, ectomycorrhizal plants had similar biomass, photosynthesis, conductance, and total leaf nitrogen as non-mycorrhizal plants. However, when grown at 13% soil moisture, ectomycorrhizal plants had significantly greater shoot biomass, higher photosynthetic and conductance rates, and higher total leaf nitrogen than non-mycorrhizal plants. The differences in plant response by mycorrhizal status in the two soil moisture treatments corresponded with evidence of water limitation experienced by the fungi, which had much lower colonization at 7% compared to 13% soil moisture. Our results suggest that the outcome of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis can be context-dependent and that fluctuating environmental conditions may strongly affect the way plants and fungi interact.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Peay, KG (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 321 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kpeay@nature.berkeley.edu,,"Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412",,,,59,45,47,1,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2007,291,2-Jan,,,,,155,165,,10.1007/s11104-006-9183-3,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,151OJ,WOS:000245299700013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Usol'tsev, VA",,,,"Usol'tsev, V.

Poor survival of rhizobia results in poor nodulation and yield of legumes. Selecting polymeric adhesives for inoculation of legume seed with rhizobia that provide protection during desiccation may improve survival and increase the potential for maximum legume yields. Vacuum-drying cells after suspension in selected polymers proved an effective method for screening the potential of polymers to improve the desiccation tolerance of rhizobia. The effect of different polymers on survival of desiccated rhizobia could be attributed to their different chemical and physical properties. The specific protective properties of polymers have been difficult to determine due to the variation in the chemical nature of polymers often compared. In this research polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with varying degrees of hydrolysis provided a useful range of measurable physical properties against which bacterial survival could be measured. PVA with a percent hydrolysis in the range 86.5-89% was better able to protect desiccated cells of a range of rhizobial strains than polymers with higher (98.5%) or lower (78.5-82%) degrees of hydrolysis. The percent hydrolysis affected the moisture properties of PVA and survival of rhizobia was not maximised with high moisture sorption or low water activity by the polymer but rather when moisture properties were at an intermediate level. In comparison, survival was poorest in highly hygroscopic polymers methyl cellulose (MC) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The survival profile of desiccated rhizobia stored at different relative humidities was altered when cells were embedded in different polymers and is probably related to moisture sorption by those polymers. The percent hydrolysis also affects the extent to which PVA is able to stabilise colloids against the precipitating action of KCl. The colloid-stabilising property and survival was highest at 86.5-89% indicating that this property may be manipulated to achieve better survival. There is an indication that highly stabilising PVA may lead to more evenly dispersed cells providing more colony forming units rather than better survival. However, survival was not strongly correlated to the colloid-stabilising properties of the other polymers and was very poor after suspension in highly stabilising MC indicating a strong interaction between factors. Synthetic polymers designed to improve survival of rhizobia exposed to desiccation stress should include properties that combine high stabilisation and optimum moisture sorption properties.

Allocation pattern was slightly influenced by temperature: leaf mass ratio and leaf area ratio decreased with increasing temperature (Delta 1 degrees C: 2.3% and 2.2% respectively), whereas stem mass/total mass increased (Delta 1 degrees C: 2.1%). Elevated [CO2] enhanced height growth by 8.8% and decreased coarse root mass/total mass by 10.3% and root/shoot ratio by 11.7%. Additional carbon was mainly invested in aboveground growth. At final harvest a synergistic interaction between elevated [CO2] and temperature yielded trees that were 3.2% taller at -4 degrees C and 12.7% taller at +4 degrees C than trees in ambient [CO2]. After 2.5 seasons, cross-sectional area of the oldest stem part was similar to 32% greater in the +4 degrees C treatment than in the -4 degrees C treatment, and in the last year similar to 67% more leaf area/unit tree ring area was produced in the highest temperature regime compared with the lowest. Elevated [CO2] decreased mean vessel area of the 120 largest vessels per mm(2) by 5.8%, causing a decrease in water conducting capacity. There was a positive interaction between temperature and elevated [CO2] for relative vessel area, which was similar to 38% higher at +4 degrees C than at -4 degrees C in elevated [CO2] compared with ambient [CO2], Overall, temperature had a greater effect on growth than [CO2], but elevated [CO2] caused quantitative changes in wood anatomy.","Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Okol Okol Geholze, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Overdieck, D (reprint author), Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Okol Okol Geholze, Konigin Laise Str 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",dieter.overdieck@tu-berlin.de,"Ziche, Daniel/I-8983-2016","Ziche, Daniel/0000-0001-9031-051X",,,,42,30,32,0,23,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2007,27,2,,,,,261,268,,10.1093/treephys/27.2.261,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,140HU,WOS:000244496300010,17241968,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Shakesby, RA; Wallbrink, PJ; Doerr, SH; English, PM; Chafer, CJ; Humphreys, GS; Blake, WH; Tomkins, KM",,,,"Shakesby, R.

The need for such an approach is exemplified here based on the fire-prone eucalypt forests in south-east Australia. Wildfire effects on vegetation, fauna, soil erodibility and erosion in this environment are evaluated and placed in the context of the global state-of-the-art for forest environments. In addition to expected variation resulting from, for example, geology, topography and climate of the area, it is argued that a distinctive post-fire behaviour is caused in these eucalypt forests by the interaction between specific characteristics of the vegetation, litter, soil properties, faunal activity and micro-scale surface features. Soil erosion limited only by post-fire rainfall intensity and quantity, or until bedrock is exposed, might be expected after wildfire on steep slopes in these forests given the non-cohesive character of the often sandy soils and their universally water repellent character. That this scenario is not realised, except possibly under extreme rainfall conditions, which rarely occur during the vulnerable post-fire period, can be attributed to a unique suite of features that disrupt or provide sinks for overland flow, bind the loose in situ soil and trap mobilised sediment. These include mats of fine roots, litter dam-microterrace complexes and faunal activity by small mammals and ants. In combination, these characteristics reduce post-fire hillslope-channel sediment transfer, at least under light to moderate intensity rainfall typical of post-fire periods following recent wildfires. Evidence is discussed suggesting that the long-term geomorphological role of wildfires in south-east Australia may be of relatively minor importance and confined largely to enhanced weathering of exposed outcrops and redistribution of soil across existing erosional and depositional landforms. The soil fertility and downstream water quality implications of widespread transfer of topsoil to watercourses resulting from frequent, often severe wildfires are nevertheless significant.

Here, we suggest a new approach based on bargaining theory to tackle the question. We present a mechanistic model for negotiation of benefits between a nitrogen-fixing nodule and a legume plant. To that end, we first derive growth rates for the nodule and plant from metabolic models of each as a function of material fluxes between them. We use these growth rates as pay-off functions in the negotiation process, which is analogous to collective bargaining between a firm and a workers' union. Our model predicts that negotiations lead to the Nash bargaining solution, maximizing the product of players' pay-offs. This work introduces elements of cooperative game theory into the field of mutualistic interactions. In the discussion of the paper, we argue for the benefits of such an approach in studying the question of biological cooperation.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Akcay, E (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",erol@stanford.edu,"Akcay, Erol/G-3167-2011","Akcay, Erol/0000-0001-8149-7124",,,,22,30,30,1,20,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P R SOC B,Proc.

The three aliens were grown at 4.5%,12.5%,36%, 50% and 100% irradiances for 64 days before harvesting. The plastic response of specific leaf area (SLA) contributed to improved light interception at low irradiance, carbon gain and water balance at high irradiance. It was a good predictor for intraspecific irradiance responses of leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf area:root mass ratio, maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max) and net assimilation rate (NAR). Biomass allocation-related traits were species specific and their plasticity to irradiance was low. The high root mass fraction, leaf mass fraction and LAR distinguished the two invaders from Gynura. However, other resource capture-related traits, such as SLA, NAR and P-max, were not always higher for the invaders than for Gynura. Furthermore, plasticity to irradiance was not different between the invasive and noninvasive aliens. With increasing irradiance, Gynura decreased biomass investment to roots and leaves but increased the investment to support structures adversely affecting both low and high irradiance acclimation. Ageratina might invade new habitat successfully through tolerating shading at low irradiance and outshading competitors by forming dense stands when irradiance is increased. The results suggested that both resource capture-related traits and irradiance acclimation conferred competitive advantage to the two invaders and some traits were common for invasive and noninvasive aliens but others were specific for invaders.

Use of legumes to improve soil fertility is an option in the central highlands of Kenya and this study evaluated soil characteristics on farms and screened effectiveness of five rhizobia strains on four legumes. Soils sampled from 31 farms showed that the soils were generally acidic with more than 50% of the farms having pH in the range of extremely acidic and strongly acidic (pH < 5.0). Organic carbon was low (< 2%) on most farms and total nitrogen was deficient with more than 80% having < 0.2% N while P ranged from 1.3 to 15.8 ppm with more than 70% of the farms being critically deficient in R Nodulation on Mucuna pruriens and Crotalaria ochroleuca was observed to be variable within farms with individual farms having fewer nodules per plant than on-farm researcher managed trial. Consequently trials to evaluate effectiveness of rhizobia strains were conducted under glass house conditions. Results showed that KWN35 and TAL 1145 were highly effective on C. calothyrsus and L. trichandra and not on C. ochroleuca. Crotalaria ochroleuca nodulated effectively only with CP354 and NGR457. The NGR 457 was highly effective on all the legume plants while NGR 185 was only effective on L. trichandra. These studies showed that performance of legumes among the smallholder farms was likely to vary due to varying soil characteristics and that there could be potential for improving legume performance within the smallholder farms through inoculation.,"[Mugwe, Jayne] Res Scientist Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Natl Agroforestry Res Project, POB 27, Embu, Kenya; [Mugendi, Daniel] Kenyatta Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Odee, David; Otieno, John] Microbiol Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya","Mugwe, J (reprint author), Res Scientist Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Natl Agroforestry Res Project, POB 27, Embu, Kenya.",Jaynemugwe@yahoo.com; dmugendi@yahoo.com; dodee@africaonline.co.ke,"Mugwe, Jayne/X-5700-2019","Mugwe, Jayne/0000-0003-1405-7166",Bentley Fellowship; Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the National Agroforestry Research Project,"The authors wish to express their gratitude to TSBF/AfNet, The Bentley Fellowship and Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) through the National Agroforestry Research Project for providing funds to carry out this work.

The Eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina) is a facultative mycovore that may play an important role in fungal spore dispersal although, to date, no information exists on fungi occurring in fecal samples of box turtles or on the ecological significance of box turtles as spore dispersal vectors. Consequently, a study of the potential for Eastern box turtles to act as vectors for spore dispersal was initiated by capturing wild turtles and collecting fecal samples. Serial dilutions from fecal samples were made to enumerate spores, quantify the number of spores per gram of fecal material and to isolate and identify fungi. Fungal spores were found to be extremely abundant throughout all samples. Fecal samples from 36 turtles yielded a total of 23 different fungal taxa in the Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Two yeasts that were isolated, Cryptococcus albidus and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, are reported to naturally occur on Trifolium seeds found in fecal samples. A mold previously unreported from fecal material, Aspergillus wentii, was also found in fecal samples. Data collected suggests Eastern box turtles influence fungal spore dispersal by browsing on plant materials and defecating large numbers of fungal spores within their home ranges.","Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Charleston, IL 61920 USA; Indiana State Univ, Dept Ecol & Organismal Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Biodivers, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Jones, SC (reprint author), Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Charleston, IL 61920 USA.",,,,,,,32,6,8,0,21,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

We established a laboratory experiment to study whether the effects of Cognettia sphagnetorum (Enchytraeidae) and ectomycorrhizal fungi on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedling growth are influenced by wood ash application. Acidic coniferous forest soil was treated with wood ash at 5000 kg ha(-1) or left as ash-free control and inoculated with soil saprotrophic microbes and nematodes. The microcosms were destructively sampled 26 and 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment. We measured enchytraeid and pine seedling biomass, abundance of nematodes and leaching of NH4+-N and NO3--N at both samplings, and root length and N concentration of pine needles at the end of the experiment. On average enchytraeids and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced pine biomass production in the ash-free control soils, however, their impact was most pronounced when these organisms were alone in the systems. In fact, mycorrhizas tended to have a negative impact on the seedlings in the presence of enchytracids. Wood ash had a clear negative impact on enchytraeid populations. Wood ash decreased pine growth when enchytraeids and EM-fungi were alone in the systems, but when together they apparently compensated for the negative effects of wood ash on the seedlings. It is concluded that interactions between soil fauna, mycorrhizal fungi and plants are context dependent, thereby rendering predictions of the outcome of species interactions in soil food webs a demanding task.

In 4 of these soils ( Mateur, Enfidha, Rhayet, and Soliman) this variation appeared to be related to the nodule number on the roots of the plants. With the exception of one isolate the rhizobia isolated from these nodules had 16S rRNAPCR- RFLP fingerprint patterns that were characteristic of Sinorhizobium medicae. Plant growth in the fifth soil ( Jelma) was the poorest; plants had few nodules that yielded exclusively rhizobia with 16S rRNA fingerprint patterns characteristic of S. meliloti. In subsequent plant tests, S. medicae isolates formed effective nitrogen fixation symbioses with M. ciliaris, while S. meliloti formed small, white, ineffective nodules. Therefore, plant growth in Jelma soil was poor because only S. meliloti are present and this species is ineffective with M. ciliaris. In a co- inoculation experiment with M. ciliaris, S. medicae was more competitive for nodulation than S. meliloti, perhaps explaining why the majority of the isolates from Enfidha and Rhayet were S. medicae, since S. meliloti is present in these soils. However, it is not clear how the host influences rhizobia for nodulation by S. medicae in preference to S. meliloti when present.","Ctr Biotechnol, Lab Interact Legumineuses Microorgan, Tunis, Tunisia; USDA, ARS, BARC, SGIL, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Zribi, K (reprint author), Ctr Biotechnol, Lab Interact Legumineuses Microorgan, Technopole Borj Cedria,BP901, Tunis, Tunisia.",kais.zribi@cbbc.rnrt.tn,,"Aouani, Mohamed Elarbi/0000-0001-9502-7203",,,,36,12,13,0,3,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",Apr-73,,,AUST J SOIL RES,Aust.

Communities of these three model species were planted in 301 microcosms either in the presence of pre-established mycelium network of three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species (individually and in a mixture) or without AMF Different AMF species had significantly different effects on individual plant species' growth, which resulted in changes in plant community structure. While in the no-AMF treatment the non-mycotrophic plant species A. sagittata contributed nearly 70% to the total plant biomass, in the presence of the 3 AMF mixture the contribution of this species was only about 10%. Different effects of AMF on titter formation by C. epigejos suggest that some AMF could have greater potential to promote the replacement of annuals by perennial grasses than others.

For this, we analyzed C-13 signatures in microbial biomarker phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) from an in-situ (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labeling experiment in the Giessen Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment grasslands (GiFACE, Germany) exposed to ambient and elevated (i.e. 50% above ambient) CO2 concentrations. Short-term C-13 PLFA measurements at 3 h and 10 h after the pulse-labeling revealed very little to no C-13 enrichment after 3 h in biomarker PLFAs and a much greater incorporation of new plant-C into fungal compared to bacterial PLFAs after 10 h. After a period of 11 months following the pulse-labeling experiment, the C-13 enrichment of fungal PLFAs was still largely present but had decreased, while bacterial PLFAs were much more enriched in C-13 compared to a few hours after the pulse-labeling. These results imply that new rhizodeposit-C is rapidly processed by fungal communities and only much later by the bacterial communities, which we attributed to either a fungal-mediated translocation of rhizosphere-C from the fungal to bacterial biomass or a preferential bacterial use of dead root or fungal necromass materials as C source over the direct utilization of fresh root-exudate C in these N-limited grassland ecosystems. Elevated CO2 caused an increase in the proportional C-13 enrichment (relative to the universal biomarker 16:0) of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomarker PLFA 16:1 omega 5 and one gram-positive bacterial biomarker PLFA i16:0, but a decrease in the proportional C-13 enrichment of 18:1 omega 9c, a commonly used though questionable fungal biomarker PLFA. This suggests enhanced fungal rhizodeposit-C assimilation only by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species under elevated CO2.","Univ Ghent, Lab Appl Phys Chem, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; Univ Giessen, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; Univ Coll Dublin Belfield, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland","Denef, K (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Lab Appl Phys Chem, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",karolien.denef@ugent.be,"Muller, Christoph/F-9521-2010; Boeckx, Pascal/J-3668-2013","Boeckx, Pascal/0000-0003-3998-0010",,,,77,98,99,4,81,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2007,4,5,,,,,769,779,,10.5194/bg-4-769-2007,,,11,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,225YJ,WOS:000250553900006,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19B,"Bardgett, R","Bardgett, RD",,,"Bardgett, Richard","Bardgett, RD",,The Biology of Soil A Community and Ecosystem Approach Preface and acknowledgements,BIOLOGY OF SOIL: A COMMUNITY AND ECOSYSTEM APPROACH,Biology of Habitats,,English,Editorial Material; Book Chapter,,,,,,,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION; BOTANICALLY DIVERSE HAYMEADOWS; ENCHYTRAEID WORMS OLIGOCHAETA; USE INTENSIFICATION GRADIENT; PLANT-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS; BOREAL FOREST PRODUCTIVITY; EXOTIC EARTHWORM INVASION,,"Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England","Bardgett, R (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",,,,,,,743,2,3,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"198 MADISON AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",,,978-0-19-172818-1; 978-0-19-852502-8,BIO HABIT,,,2007,,,,,,,V,+,,,,,45,Ecology; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,BC5ML,WOS:000353390900001,,,,,10/31/19S,"Shaw, LJ; Burns, RG",,"Heipieper, HJ",,"Shaw, Liz J.; Burns, Richard G.",,,"Influence of the rhizosphere on the biodegradation of organic xenobiotics - A case study with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid",BIOREMEDIATION OF SOILS CONTAMINATED WITH AROMATIC COMPOUNDS,NATO Science Series IV-Earth and Environmental Sciences,,English,Proceedings Paper,NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Bioremediation of Soils Contaminated with Aromatic Compounds,"JUL 01-03, 2004","Tartu, ESTONIA",NATO,,"biodegradation; 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; rhizosphere; rhizoremediation; rhizodeposition",ALCALIGENES-EUTROPHUS JMP134; LEGUMINOSARUM BIOVAR VICIAE; MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR; ENHANCED MINERALIZATION; DEGRADATION PLASMIDS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DEGRADING BACTERIA; TRIFOLIUM-PRATENSE; AROMATIC-COMPOUNDS,"The rhizosphere is the unique environment at the plant-soil interface and a zone of intense soil-plant-microbe interaction.

Mechanisms suggested to explain rhizosphere enhanced biodegradation range from the direct role of rhizodeposits acting as xenobiotic structural analogs to more indirect possibilities such as increased bioavailability in the rhizosphere. Our aim was to learn more about the mechanisms of enhanced biodegradation in the rhizosphere using the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as a model xenobiotic. We report that 2,4-D mineralization is enhanced by root exudates and root debris of legume species. This rhizosphere enhancement may be due to the action of a rhizodeposit component in inducing the 2,4-D pathway. We discuss the possibility that the stimulatory component belongs to the chemical class flavonoids.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Agr Sci, Wye Campus, Ashford TN25 5AH, Kent, England","Shaw, LJ (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Agr Sci, Wye Campus, Ashford TN25 5AH, Kent, England.",,,,EUEuropean Union (EU) [FP 5]; HERBICBIOREM [QLRT-1999-00041]; Natural Environmental Research Council (U.K.)NERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/B/S/2002/00518],This research was funded by the EU FP 5 grant HERBICBIOREM (Proposal number QLRT-1999-00041) and Natural Environmental Research Council (U.K.) small grant NER/B/S/2002/00518.,,84,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1568-1238,,978-1-4020-5691-8,NATO SCI S SS IV EAR,NATO Sci.

The purpose of this study was to determine if burn season influences postfire vegetation recovery. Replicated early-season burn, late-season burn, and unburned control units were established in a mixed conifer forest, and understory vegetation was evaluated before and after treatment. Vegetation generally recovered rapidly after prescribed burning. However, late-season burns resulted in a temporary but significant drop in cover and a decline in species richness at the 1 m(2) scale in the following year. For two of the several taxa that were negatively affected by burning, the reduction in frequency was greater after late-season than early-season burns. Early-season burns may have moderated the effect of fire by consuming less fuel and lessening the amount of soil heating. Our results suggest that, when burned under high fuel loading conditions, many plant species respond more strongly to differences in fire intensity and severity than to timing of the burn relative to stage of plant growth.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific SW Res Stn, Redding, CA 96002 USA; US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Sequoia & Kings Canyon Field Stn, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA","Knapp, EE (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific SW Res Stn, 3644 Avtech Pkwy, Redding, CA 96002 USA.",eknapp@fs.fed.us,"Kane, Jeffrey/C-3072-2019; Kane, Jeffrey/AAB-6272-2019; Kane, Jeffrey M/G-7426-2011","Kane, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1453-9608; Kane, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1453-9608; ",,,,60,41,46,1,27,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the suitability of 12 non-N-2-fixing plants (i.e., nonlegumes) as reference plants for estimating the BNF of three pasture legumes (white clover, Trifolium repens L.; lucerne, Medicago sativa; and red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) in standard ryegrass-white clover (RWC) and multispecies pastures (MSP) under dry-land and irrigation systems, over four seasons in Canterbury, New Zealand. The N-15-isotope dilution method involving field N-15-microplots was used to estimate BNF. Non-N-2-fixing plants were used either singly or in combination as reference plants to estimate the BNF of the three legumes. Results obtained showed that, on the whole, N-15-enrichment values of legumes and nonlegumes varied significantly according to plant species, season, and irrigation. Grasses and herb species showed higher N-15-enrichment than those of legumes. Highest N-15-enrichment values of all plants occurred during late summer under dry-land and irrigation conditions. Based on single or combined non-N-2-fixing plants as reference plants, the proportion of N derived from the atmosphere (% Ndfa) values were high (50 to 90%) and differed between most reference plants in the MSP pastures, especially chicory (Cichorium intybus), probably because it is different in phenology, rooting depth, and N-uptake patterns compared to those of legumes. The percent Ndfa values of all plants studied also varied according to plant species, season, and irrigation in the MSP pastures. Estimated daily amounts of BNF varied according to pasture type, time of plant harvest, and irrigation, similar to those shown by percent Ndfa results as expected. Irrigation increased daily BNF more than 10-fold, probably due to increased dry-matter yield of pasture under irrigation compared to dry-land conditions. Seasonal and irrigation effects were more important in affecting estimates of legume BNF than those due to the appropriate matching of N-2-fixing and non-N-2-fixing reference plants.","Lincoln Univ, Soil & Phys Sci Grp, Agr & Life Sci Div, Canterbury, New Zealand","Goh, KM (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Soil & Phys Sci Grp, Agr & Life Sci Div, POB 84, Canterbury, New Zealand.",goh@lincoln.ac.nz,,,,,,57,3,4,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Nitrogen-15 recovery in the forest floor, fine roots (< 2 mm), and the mineral soil (0-20cm) was calculated at 6, 21, and 42 weeks after the last application. Most of the N-15 was retained in the forest floor and the mineral soil, with only small amounts (<= 2%) found in roots from both soil layers. Recovery of NH4-N-15 was greater in Inceptisols, which had a wider carbon (C)-to-N ratio than Ultisols.

Tensile strength has been found to increase with decreasing root diameter, however, it is not known how this phenomenon occurs. We carried out tensile tests on roots 0.2-12.0 mm in diameter of three conifer and two broadleaf species, in order to determine the relationship between tensile strength and diameter. Two species, Pinus pinaster Ait. and Castanea sativa Mill., were then chosen for a quantitative analysis of root cellulose content. Cellulose is responsible for tensile strength in wood due to its microfibrillar structure. Results showed that in all species, a significant power relationship existed between tensile strength and root diameter, with a sharp increase of tensile strength in roots with a diameter < 0.9 nun. In roots > 1.0 mm, Fagus sylvatica L. was the most resistant to failure, followed by Picea abies L. and C. sativa., P pinaster and Pinus nigra Arnold roots were the least resistant in tension for the same diameter class. Extremely high values of strength (132-201 MPa) were found in P abies, C. saliva and P pinaster, for the smallest roots (0.4 mm in diameter). The power relationship between tensile strength and root diameter cannot only be explained by a scaling effect typical of that found in fracture mechanics. Therefore, this relationship could be due to changes in cellulose content as the percentage of cellulose was also observed to increase with decreasing root diameter and increasing tensile strength in both P pinaster and C. saliva.","[Genet, Marie; Stokes, Alexia; Mickovski, Slobodan B.; Fourcaud, Thierry] Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, INRA, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux,Mixed Unit, 69 Rte Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Salin, Franck] Equipe Genetique Amelioration Arbres Forestiers, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Mickovski, Slobodan B.] Univ Dundee, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Dundee DD1 4HR, Scotland; [Fourcaud, Thierry] AMAP, CIRAD AMIS, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Dumail, Jean-Francois] XYLOMECA, F-24700 Moulin Neuf, France; [van Beek, Rens] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodiversi & Ecosys Dynam Phys Geog, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Beek, Rens] Univ Utrecht Heidelberglaan, Dept Phys Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Genet, M (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, INRA, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux,Mixed Unit, 69 Rte Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France.",genet@lrbb3.pierroton.inra.fr; stokes@liama.ia.ac.cn,"Van Beek, Rens/B-4904-2014; Mickovski, Slobodan B./D-4418-2011","Van Beek, Rens/0000-0002-4758-108X; Mickovski, Slobodan B./0000-0002-1792-1258",EU project Eco-slopes [QLK5200100289],"The authors thank C.

The southern cultivar is sterile; it flowers but sets no seeds. It is a densely tufted, perennial grass that is considered sterile outside its natural habitat. It grows 0.5-1.5 m high, stiff stems in large clumps from a much branched root stock. The roots of vetiver grass are fibrous and reported to reach depths up to 3 m thus being able to stabilise the soil and its use for this purpose is promoted by the World Bank. Uprooting tests were carried out on vetiver grass in Spain in order to ascertain the resistance the root system can provide when torrential runoffs and sediments are trying to uproot the plant. Uprooting resistance of each plant was correlated to the shoot and root morphological characteristics. In order to investigate any differences between root morphology of vetiver grass in its native habitat reported in the literature, and the one planted in a sub-humid environment in Spain, excavation techniques were used to show root distribution in the soil. Results show that vetiver grass possesses the root strength to withstand torrential runoff. Planted in rows along the contours, it may act as a barrier to the movement of both water and soil. However, the establishment of the vetiver lags behind the reported rates in its native tropical environment due to adverse climatic conditions in the Mediterranean. This arrested development is the main limitation to the use of vetiver in these environments although its root strength is more than sufficient.","[Mickovski, S.

Yet, precious little attempts have been made to apply these models to the hillslope scale pertinent to landsliding at which variations in soil and vegetation become important. On natural slopes positive pore pressures occur often at the weathering depth of the soil profile. At this critical depth root reinforcement is crucial to avert slope instability. This is particularly relevant for the abandoned slopes in the European part of the Mediterranean basin where root development has to balance the increasing infiltration capacity during re-vegetation. Detailed investigations related to root reinforcement were made at two abandoned slopes susceptible to landsliding located in the Alcoy basin (SE Spain). On these slopes semi-natural vegetation, consisting of a patchy herbaceous cover and dispersed Aleppo pine trees, has established itself. Soil and vegetation conditions were mapped in detail and large-scale, in-situ direct shear tests on the topsoil and pull-out tests performed in order to quantify root reinforcement under different vegetation conditions. These tests showed that root reinforcement was present but limited. Under herbaceous cover, the typical reinforcement was in the order of 0.6 kPa while values up to 18 kPa were observed under dense pine cover. The tests indicate that fine root content and vegetation conditions are important factors that explain the root reinforcement of the topsoil. These findings were confirmed by the simulation of the direct shear tests by means of an advanced root reinforcement model developed in FLAC 2D. Inclusion of the root distribution for the observed vegetation cover mimics root failure realistically but returns over-optimistic estimates of the root reinforcement. When the root reinforcement is applied with this information at the hillslope scale under fully saturated and critical hydrological conditions, root pull-out becomes the dominant root failure mechanism and the slip plane is located at the weathering depth of the soil profile where root reinforcement is negligible. The safety factors increase only slightly when roots are present but the changes in the surface velocity at failure are more substantial. Root reinforcement on these natural slopes therefore appears to be limited to a small range of critical hydrological conditions and its mitigating effect occurs mainly after failure.","[van Beek, L.

We developed a simple computer program to construct three-dimensional virtual root architectural patterns. This tool was used to build four schematic patterns: heart-, tap-, herringbone- and plate-like root systems. Each of these rooting types was characterised by specific branching characteristics. However, the total volume (proportional to the wood biomass) and material properties were kept constant. The finite element method was used to calculate the mechanical response of root/soil systems when the stem was subjected to bending forces. The overturning resistance of the four schematic root patterns was determined in four different idealistic soil types. These soils were based on Mohr-Coulomb plasticity models. Results showed that soil internal friction modified the position of the rotation axis during tilting of the root/soil plate. Rooting depth was a determinant parameter in sandy-like soils. Overturning resistance was greatest in heart- and tap-root systems whatever the soil type. However, the heart root system was more resistant on clay-like soil whereas the tap root system was more resistant on sandy-like soil. Herringbone and plate root systems were twice as less resistant on clay soils and 1.5 times less resistant on sandy soils when compared to heart and tap-like structures.","[Dupuy, Lionel; Fourcaud, Thierry; Stokes, Alexia] Univ Bordeaux 1, INRA, CNRS, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Dupuy, Lionel] Inst pour Dev Forestie, F-75007 Paris, France; [Fourcaud, Thierry] AMAP CIRAD Dept, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Dupuy, Lionel] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3E4, England","Dupuy, L (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux 1, INRA, CNRS, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France.",lxd20@cam.ac.uk,"Dupuy, Lionel/C-4433-2008","Dupuy, Lionel/0000-0001-5221-9037",EU project Ecoslopes [QLK5-2001-00289]; French Governmental CIFRE bursary; DERF-GIPECOFOR,This study was funded by the EU project Ecoslopes (QLK5-2001-00289) and the DERF-GIPECOFOR project Peuplier.

Main questions concern (1) the proposed absence of a shoot apical meristem (SAM) in apical ""meristemless"" shoot tips of Podostemoideae and, as the consequence, the endogenous inception of leaf-borne leaves and branches and (2) the predicted stem bifurcation below a ""terminal"" dithecous (double-sheathed) leaf positioned instead of a shoot apex, as it is reported for subfamily Podostemoideae. Does the ""meristemless"" shoot apex represent a true evolutionary novelty? Does the view of stem bifurcation represent a new ramification pattern with the consequence that the ""classical root shoot model"" of angiosperms is not valid for Podostemaceae? Both interpretations do not conform to previous studies that are complemented here by new data on the SAM of Zeylanidium olivaceum and Thelethylax minutiflora (Podostemoldeae). Although a SAM is difficult to observe in the vegetative shoots of many Podostemoideae, it becomes well visible when the shoot passes into the flowering stage approaching the conspicuous shoot apex of floriferous shoots. The arguments of the absence of a SAM in vegetative shoots are not convincing and the endogenous origin of ""leaf-borne leaves"" appears questionable. Consequently, the ""meristemless"" shoot apex cannot be considered as a structure having evolved de novo. In the less advanced subfamilies Tristichoideae and Weddellinoideae, the leaf primordia develop only from a few apical cells of the outer shoot layer. This allows the conclusion that the surface layer of the apex in these subfamilies corresponds to the horizontally spread single-layered apical meristem of subfamily Podostemoideae. Similarly, the view of shoot bifurcation does not conform to the diachsial-sympodial branching pattern occurring in the cymose inflorescences of many Podostemoideae. This fact contradicts the presence of a terminal leaf. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, we adopted a new approach to constrain rooting depth in terrestrial ecosystem models over the Amazon using satellite data [moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI)] and Biome-BGC terrestrial ecosystem model. We simulated seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP) using different rooting depths (1, 3, 5, and 10 m) at point and spatial scales to investigate how rooting depth affects modeled seasonal GPP variations and to determine which rooting depth simulates GPP consistent with satellite-based observations. First, we confirmed that rooting depth strongly controls modeled GPP seasonal variations and that only deep rooting systems can successfully track flux-based GPP seasonality at the Tapajos km67 flux site. Second, spatial analysis showed that the model can reproduce the seasonal variations in satellite-based EVI seasonality, however, with required rooting depths strongly dependent on precipitation and the dry season length. For example, a shallow rooting depth (1-3 m) is sufficient in regions with a short dry season (e.g. 0-2 months), and deeper roots are required in regions with a longer dry season (e.g. 3-5 and 5-10 m for the regions with 3-4 and 5-6 months dry season, respectively). Our analysis suggests that setting of proper rooting depths is important to simulating GPP seasonality in tropical forests, and the use of satellite data can help to constrain the spatial variability of rooting depth.","San Jose State Univ, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, NASA, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Ichii, K (reprint author), San Jose State Univ, Ames Res Ctr, Ecosyst Sci & Technol Branch, NASA, Mail Stop 242-2, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",kichiijp@yahoo.co.jp,"Ichii, Kazuhito/D-2392-2010; Mitchard, Edward T A/C-6346-2009; Myneni, Ranga B/F-5129-2012; Huete, Alfredo R/C-1294-2008","Ichii, Kazuhito/0000-0002-8696-8084; Mitchard, Edward T A/0000-0002-5690-4055; Myneni, Ranga B/0000-0002-0234-6393; Huete, Alfredo R/0000-0003-2809-2376; White, Michael/0000-0002-0238-8913",,,,49,53,55,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We hypothesized that nitrogen (N) fertilization would decrease these carbon stocks, because plants should reduce investment of carbon in mycorrhizal fungi when N availability is high. We measured the abundance of two major groups of mycorrhizal fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, in the top 10 cm of soil in control and N-fertilized plots within three Alaskan boreal ecosystems that represented different recovery stages following severe fire. Pools of mycorrhizal carbon included root-associated AM and ECM structures; soil-associated AM hyphae; and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AM fungi. Total mycorrhizal carbon pools decreased by approximately 50 g C m(-2) in the youngest site under N fertilization, and this reduction was driven mostly by glomalin. Total mycorrhizal carbon did not change significantly in the other sites. Root-associated AM structures were more abundant under N fertilization across all sites, and root-associated ECM structures increased marginally significantly. We found no significant N effects on AM hyphae. Carbon sequestered within living mycorrhizal structures (0.051-0.21 g m(-2)) was modest compared with that of glomalin (33-203 g m(-2)). We conclude that our hypothesis was only supported in relation to glomalin stocks within one of the three study sites. As N effects on glomalin were inconsistent among sites, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying this variation would improve our ability to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global change.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Bot, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Treseder, KK (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",treseder@uci.edu,"Treseder, Kathleen/E-5148-2011","Treseder, Kathleen/0000-0003-2847-6935",,,,77,54,58,1,81,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Although both abiotic and biotic constraints on recruitment are often assumed to operate at multiple scales, these relationships are rarely quantified in ways that enable prediction of recruitment dynamics across environmental gradients. 2 In plants such as orchids, an important bottleneck on recruitment may arise from an obligate dependence on mycorrhizal fungi in order to reach photosynthetic stage. Very little is known, however, about the factors controlling the distribution of the fungi or how fungal distributions may constrain orchid recruitment and distributions. 3 In this study, seed introduction experiments were used to test for relationships between symbiotic germination success of an orchid, Goodyera pubescens, and both proximity to adult orchids and soil abiotic conditions. Experiments were linked to ongoing demographic monitoring across a large environmental gradient to place patterns of germination better in the context of longer-term demographic patterns. 4 A hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework was used to evaluate explicitly how recruitment varies across scales and how this variation is explained by key abiotic variables. This framework was further utilized to link hypothesis testing to model building, and thereby improve our ability to make predictions across a range of environmental conditions. 5 At a microsite scale (< 4 m(2)) strong evidence was found for decreasing germination success further from adult plants. At distances greater than 1 m from adults, increased germination success was associated with higher soil moisture, higher organic content and lower pH, although the strength of these relationships varied regionally. Patterns of symbiotic germination success were also highly correlated with observed recruitment patterns at the population level. 6 Explicitly linking plant recruitment to underlying abiotic gradients and key biotic interactions using a hierarchical, predictive modelling framework is essential for understanding basic plant population processes and building capacity to make predictions of how species and communities may respond to environmental changes.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Diez, JM (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jeffdiez@gmail.com,,,,,,60,87,94,1,53,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

These orchids are characterized by two mechanisms of carbon assimilation, being autotrophic carbon fixation through photosynthesis supplemented by heterotrophic carbon fixation from mycorrhizal fungi. We investigated whether photosynthesis may sustain autotrophy of several species of orchids co-occurring in the same habitat (the understory of a chestnut forest in the Apennines range) along a vegetative season, and how photosynthesis responds to environmental parameters in the different species. Combined analysis of gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical properties, chlorophylls concentration, and Ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity were carried out to characterize the photosynthetic apparatus of the orchid species. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements indicated that in all orchids, in natural conditions and over the entire vegetative season (May to July), a detectable amount of carbon, typical of autotrophic shade leaves, is fixed. It is therefore suggested that these orchids are predominantly autotrophic. As an exception, however, Limodorum abortivum, a co-occurring orchid in the examined habitat, is unable to photosynthesize at rates compatible with autotrophy. At the low light intensity experienced in the understory habitat all orchids exhibited a similar quantum yield, but photosynthesis of Dactylorhiza saccifera and Cephalanthera longifolia was stimulated by light intensities higher than ambient, indicating that these species may better use sunflecks reaching the understory vegetation. Photosynthesis of all orchids, including Limodorum, positively responded to increasing CO2 concentration and temperature. Whether this will lead to a larger photosynthetic carbon fixation because of present and future climate change needs to be assessed with long-term experiments also including the impacts of climate on mychorrizal activity and host plants.","[Serafini, Domenico; Brilli, Federico; Loreto, Francesco] CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-00016 Rome, Italy; [Pinelli, Paola; Delfine, Sebastiano] Univ Molise, Dipartimento SAVA, Campobasso, Italy","Loreto, F (reprint author), CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00016 Rome, Italy.",francesco.loreto@ibaf.cnr.it,"Brilli, Federico/O-6475-2015; Loreto, Francesco/B-7477-2015","Brilli, Federico/0000-0002-2563-6086; Loreto, Francesco/0000-0002-9171-2681","Italian Ministry for Scientific Research (MIUR) 'Orchidee micoeterotrofiche dell'area Mediterranea'Ministero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR)","This work was supported by the project of the Italian Ministry for Scientific Research (MIUR) 'Orchidee micoeterotrofiche dell'area Mediterranea'.

Understanding groundwater surface water interactions that have significant ecological implications in floodplains is crucial to their management. Groundwater pumping leads to stream depletion and in areas of relatively shallow groundwater tables can also capture evapotranspiration (ET) discharge as a result of lowering the groundwater table. The latter may be viewed to be advantageous from a stream depletion point of view but can actually harm riparian vegetation that is directly dependent on groundwater ET. Most stream depletion models do not account for ET capture during pumping, water that would have otherwise been consumed by plants. Hence such models would overestimate actual stream depletion. On the other hand, the direct effects of groundwater pumping on ET reduction (that can potentially lead to plant health deterioration), have not been thoroughly modelled. In this paper, we investigate this problem using explicit analytical solutions implemented in a GIS platform using The Invisible Modelling Environment (TIME). Firstly, we use the well-known Theis solution to describe the two-dimensional change in groundwater heads as a result of groundwater pumping. A nonlinear model is used to estimate the decline in ET, which varies with soil, land cover type, and initial depth to groundwater. We establish criteria to constrain the spatial and temporal scales of the problem. We estimate ET capture for two different land-covers and on a sandy loam soil. This is a first of suite of models for studying groundwater surface water interactions being developed within project D3 of the eWater Cooperative Research Centre. It is shown that the capture of ET during groundwater pumping can be very significant. Dimensionless plots for ET capture are presented; they encompass the combined effects of distance from a pump to a river, pumping rate and aquifer transmissivity on the spatial extent of the influence zone for ET capture. For the case of unbounded aquifers considered in this paper, the cone of depression spans well behind and on either side of the pump. The effective influence zone for ET-capture relates to the distance between the pump and the river 'a'; it was found to span about 8a behind the pump and 5a on either side of the pump. The time required for the realisation of a certain pumping impact varies directly with aquifer diffusivity and inversely with the square of the distance between the river and the pump. ET-capture increases as the ratio of pumping rate to aquifer transmissivity increases and as the distance from the pump to the river increases. The latter delays the time scales for ET capture. Soil texture has two opposing effects on ET capture. For a certain pumping rate at steady state, coarse textured soils have a smaller depression cone compared to finer soils due to their larger hydraulic conductivity. However, coarse textured soils have a steeper ET-function, which means that for the same drawdown, ET-decline is higher than the case of fine textured soils. Specific yield affects the timing of the drawdown as well as the transient shape of the depression cone. Vegetation type dictates the rooting depth representing the length along which ET occurs; a higher drawdown is required to capture ET in areas with deep-rooted vegetation compared to shallow-rooted vegetation. The initial depth to groundwater table plays a very critical role. ET capture is maximised when the initial groundwater level is just at the transition depth, depth at which ET commences to decline. If the initial groundwater is shallow enough such that the steady state water table after pumping remains above the transition depth, then ET capture is nonexistent (ET=potential ET). If the initial groundwater depth is below the extinction depth (where ET congruent to 0), there would be no ET captured. The magnitude of ET capture can be a significant amount that can offset stream depletion. The impacts of groundwater pumping, especially in floodplains with shallow groundwater tables, may have a significant adverse impact on riparian vegetation.","[Rassam, D. W.; Knight, J.

Both spacings within and between rows significantly affected shoot height, root collar diameter, root dry weight and shoot dry weight, but not root/shoot ratio. Wider spacings produced larger seedlings, but only the wider spacing within rows significantly increased fine and coarse root mass. Provenances showed significant differences in diameter, root/shoot ratio, and fine and coarse roots, and they also showed interactions with row spacings in height and diameter measurements.

Seedlings were subjected to 12-h short-day treatments of 0 (T0), 3 (T3), 7 (T7), 10 (T10), or 15 (T15) days, followed by 0, 7, 17, 40, or 46 days of reduced N supply, respectively. Relevant physiological and morphological factors were examined concurrently. Foliar N concentrations exceeded optimal levels and differed little among treatments, suggesting a minor confounding role for N reduction. Both frost and drought tolerance increased incrementally from T0 through T15. Electrolyte leakage index decreased steadily from T0 (25% for roots, 17% for needles) to T15 (1% for roots, 2% for needles) after 2-h exposure of fine roots to -2 degrees C and of needles to -8 degrees C. With holding soil watering for 19 days caused 80% mortality among seedlings in T0, 50% in T3, and < 10% in T7-T15. The transpiration decline curve suggested that enhanced drought tolerance was largely attributable to quicker stomatal closure during water stress and lower cuticular transpiration rate. The treatments increased root growth capacity on a per-seedling, but not per-root-mass, basis. Needle primordia were developed in all T7-T15 seedlings but not in T0 and T3 treatments, suggesting that nurseries may need no more than 7 days of blackout application for conditioning spruce seedlings for summer planting. Shoot dry weight fraction increased gradually from T0 through T15 and was linearly correlated with needle specific weight and frost tolerance, and may thus be useful in monitoring progress of conditioning treatments.","Grande Prairie Reg Coll, Dept Sci, Grande Prairie, AB T8V 4C2, Canada","Tan, WX (reprint author), Grande Prairie Reg Coll, Dept Sci, 10726-106 Ave, Grande Prairie, AB T8V 4C2, Canada.",,,,,,,45,8,10,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,JAN,2007,33,1,,,,,93,107,,10.1007/s11056-006-9016-5,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,112GE,WOS:000242512900008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hogberg, MN; Hogberg, P; Myrold, DD",,,,"Hogberg, Mona N.; Hogberg, Peter; Myrold, David D.",,,"Is microbial community composition in boreal forest soils determined by pH, C-to-N ratio, the trees, or all three?",OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,fungi-to-bacteria ratio; mycorrhizal fungi; nitrogen fertilization; tree belowground carbon allocation; tree girdling,FATTY-ACID ANALYSIS; CARBON ALLOCATION; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; BACTERIAL; GRADIENT; RESPIRATION; DEPOSITION,"In Fennoscandian boreal forests, soil pH and N supply generally increase downhill as a result of water transport of base cations and N, respectively. Simultaneously, forest productivity increases, the understory changes from ericaceous dwarf shrubs to tall herbs; in the soil, fungi decrease whereas bacteria increase. The composition of the soil microbial community is mainly thought to be controlled by the pH and C-to-N ratio of the substrate. However, the latter also determines the N supply to plants, the plant community composition, and should also affect plant allocation of C below ground to roots and a major functional group of microbes, mycorrhizal fungi. We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) to analyze the potential importance of mycorrhizal fungi by comparing the microbial community composition in a tree-girdling experiment, where tree belowground C allocation was terminated, and in a long-term (34 years) N loading experiment, with the shifts across a natural pH and N supply gradient. Both tree girdling and N loading caused a decline of ca. 45% of the fungal biomarker PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9, suggesting a common mechanism, i.e., that N loading caused a decrease in the C supply to ectomycorrhizal fungi just as tree girdling did. The total abundance of bacterial PLFAs did not respond to tree girdling or to N loading, in which cases the pH (of the mor layer) did not change appreciably, but bacterial PLFAs increased considerably when pH increased across the natural gradient. Fungal biomass was high only in acid soil (pH < 4.1) with a high C-to-N ratio (> 38). According to a principal component analysis, the soil C-to-N ratio was as good as predictor of microbial community structure as pH. Our study thus indicated the soil C-to-N ratio, and the response of trees to this ratio, as important factors that together with soil pH influence soil microbial community composition.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, SLU, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Hogberg, MN (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, SLU, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",mona.n.hogberg@sek.slu.se,"Hogberg, Mona N/L-9635-2014; Myrold, David/Q-6694-2019; Myrold, David/E-1813-2011; Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012","Hogberg, Mona N/0000-0003-1258-7630; Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X; Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X; Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719",,,,48,364,422,14,350,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2007,150,4,,,,,590,601,,10.1007/s00442-006-0562-5,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,119HH,WOS:000243002900006,17033802,,,,10/31/19J,"Losure, DA; Wilsey, BJ; Moloney, KA",,,,"Losure, David A.; Wilsey, Brian J.; Moloney, Kirk A.",,,Evenness-invasibility relationships differ between two extinction scenarios in tallgrass prairie,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SPECIES-RICHNESS; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; INVASION-RESISTANCE; PLANT DIVERSITY; GRASSLAND BIODIVERSITY; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; DETERMINANTS; CONSERVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES,"Experiments that have manipulated species richness with random draws of species from a larger species pool have usually found that invasibility declines as richness increases. These results have usually been attributed to niche complementarity, and interpreted to mean that communities will become less resistant to invaders as species go locally extinct. However, it is not clear how relevant these studies are to real-world situations where species extinctions are non-random, and where species diversity declines due to increased rarity (i.e. reduced evenness) without having local extinctions. We experimentally varied species richness from 1 to 4, and evenness from 0.44 to 0.97 with two different extinction scenarios in two-year old plantings using seedling transplants in western Iowa. In both scenarios, evenness was varied by changing the level of dominance of the tall grass Andropogon gerardii. In one scenario, which simulated a loss of short species from Andropogon communities, we directly tested for complementarity in light capture due to having species in mixtures with dissimilar heights. We contrasted this scenario with a second set of mixtures that contained all tall species. In both cases, we controlled for factors such as rooting depth and planting density. Mean invader biomass was higher in monocultures (5.4 g m(-2) week(-1)) than in 4-species mixtures (3.2 g m(-2) week(-1)). Reduced evenness did not affect invader biomass in mixtures with dissimilar heights. However, the amount of invader biomass decreased by 60% as evenness increased across mixtures with all tall species. This difference was most pronounced early in the growing season when high evenness plots had greater light capture than low evenness plots. These results suggest that the effect of reduced species diversity on invasibility are 1) not related to complementarity through height dissimilarity, and 2) variable depending on the phenological traits of the species that are becoming rare or going locally extinct.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Losure, DA (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 253 Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",bwilsey@iastate.edu,"Moloney, Kirk/H-6483-2011","Moloney, Kirk/0000-0003-1406-9757; Wilsey, Brian J./0000-0002-0628-5006",,,,46,29,32,1,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2007,116,1,,,,,87,98,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15341.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,125AJ,WOS:000243413600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Purin, S; Rillig, MC",,,,"Purin, Sonia; Rillig, Matthias C.",,,"The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal protein glomalin: Limitations, progress, and a new hypothesis for its function",PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomalin-related soil protein; arbuscular mycorrhiza; heat shock protein; soil aggregation; soil protein,HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; CELL-WALL; CANDIDA-ALBICANS; PARACOCCIDIOIDES-BRASILIENSIS; HISTOPLASMA-CAPSULATUM; AGGREGATE STABILITY; SOIL-STRUCTURE; HSP70 FAMILY; STRESS; HYPHAE,"Most research on glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) has focused on the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soil aggregation and environmental engineering.

Based on recent findings, we develop a new model. for the role of glomalin; we postulate a primary role in fungal physiology and secondarily arising effects in the soil environment that lead to observed correlations of GRSP with soil aggregate stability. Concurrent with advances in molecutar biology, several recent studies have highlighted problems with quantifying GRSP from soil. We summarize and discuss limitations of the methods currently used for GRSP extraction and quantification in soils.

Using paired plots and reciprocal litter transplants in forests with and without R. maximum cover, we examined the influence of R. maximum on litter mass and quality, N cycling and soil extracellular enzymes. Standing stocks of soil organic matter, soil N, leaf titter mass and fine root biomass were greater in forests with R. maximum than those without. Tannin extracts from R. maximum foliage, and leaf litter and fine roots collected under R. maximum had a relatively high capacity to precipitate protein compared to extracts from trees. Across the growing season, soil inorganic N availabitity was generally lower under R. maximum, mostly due to reduced NO3- availability. Our data suggest that R. maximum litter alters N cycling through the formation of recalcitrant polyphenol-organic N complexes. Soil extracellular enzymes indicate the potential. processing rates of organic substrates. Between forest types, polyphenol oxidase activity was greatest in R. maximum 0 horizons, regardless of Litter type, suggesting that the Local. microbial community can better degrade and access protein-tannin-complexed N. Protease activity did not differ between forest types, but was greater on R. maximum leaf litter than hardwood leaf litter. The alteration of the N cycle via the formation of polyphenol-organic N complexes may contribute to hardwood seedling suppression, while the enzymatic release of these complexes by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi may increase N acquisition for R. maximum and contribute to its expansion in southern Appalachian forests.

To assess whether root exudates also stimulated litter decomposition, in a rhizosphere model system we continuously injected solutions of glucose, malate or glutamate through porous Rhizon((R)) supercript stop soil solution samplers into the soil at rhizosphere concentrations. The effect of these substances on the decomposition of C-14-labelled Lolium perenne shoot residues present in the soil was evaluated by monitoring (CO2)-C-14 evolution at either 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C. The incorporation of the C-14 into the microbial biomass and appearance in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool was estimated after 32 d incubation. The presence of malate and glutamate increased the mineralization of L. perenne residues by approximately 20% relative to the soil without their addition at 15 degrees C, however, no significant effects on residue decomposition were observed at 25 degrees C. The incorporation of the C-14-label into the microbial biomass and DOM pool was not affected by the addition of either glucose, malate or glutamate. Although nearly the same amount of L. perenne residues were mineralized at either temperature after 32 d, less C-14 was recovered in the microbial biomass and DOM pools at 25 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C. Alongside other results, this suggests that the rate of microbial turnover is greater at 25 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C. We conclude that the addition of labile root exudate components to the rhizosphere induced a small but significant increase on litter decomposition but that the magnitude of this effect was regulated by temperature.","Univ Bayreuth, Dept Agrosyst Res, D-95444 Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; Univ Wales, Sch Agr & Forest Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales","Kuzyakov, Y (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Agrosyst Res, Univ Str 30, D-95444 Bayreuth, Germany.",kuzyakov@uni-bayreuth.de,"Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Jones, Davey L/C-7411-2011; Hill, Paul/C-2944-2013","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Jones, Davey L/0000-0002-1482-4209; ",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/A/S/2003/00403],,,47,122,132,4,164,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2007,290,2-Jan,,,,,293,305,,10.1007/s11104-006-9162-8,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,127ZG,WOS:000243624400024,,,,,10/31/19S,"Ansley, RJ; Boutton, TW; Jacoby, PW",,"Sosebee, RE; Wester, DB; Britton, CM; McArthur, ED; Kitchen, SG",,"Ansley, R.

Root systems of mature trees were containerized with barriers inserted into the soil. Soil moisture within containers was manipulated with irrigation (Irrigated) or rain sheltering (Rainout). Other treatments included containerized precipitation-only (Control) and non-containerized precipitation-only (Natural) with three trees per treatment. After four years of treatment, soil cores to 2.7 m depth were obtained beneath each tree canopy. Mesquite and grass roots were extracted, separated into size classes, and weighed. Root length density (m m(-3)) was quantified for mesquite roots. Averaged over the entire sample depth, Irrigated trees doubled root length density of small (< 2 mm diam.) roots compared to Control trees (232 vs 105 m m(-3)). Below 90 cm depth, root length density of large (2 to 10 mm diameter) roots was five times greater in Rainout (36 m m(-3)) than Control trees (7 m m(-3)). Over all depths, root biomass was greatest in Rainout trees and root:shoot (biomass) ratio was three times greater in Rainout than Control or Irrigated trees. Mesquite leaf carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13) was lower (more negative) in Irrigated trees than other treatments, suggesting these trees had lower water use efficiency. Leaf delta C-13 was not different between Rainout and Control trees. Mesquite adapted to chronic wet or drought cycles through increased root growth but patterns of distribution differed as Irrigated trees emphasized growth of small roots throughout the profile and Rainout trees grew large roots into deeper soil layers.","[Ansley, R.

This has resulted in a strong performative role of the region not only in mainstream debates across these domains, but also in a wide range of political and policy processes and practices. Recent critiques have challenged certain key features of the dominant perception of the region, notably its portrayal of the region as something bounded and fixed. But what triggered the emphasis on the region in the first place? To what extent can the significance of the region be attributed to broader political, economic, and social shifts? To what extent does it present a more accidental outcome of processes and actions that, in combination, happened to put the region centre stage? To address/explore these questions, the paper will adopt the Strategic Relation Approach ( SRA) launched by Jessop and further developed by Hay and Sum. This approach advances a historical perspective on the production of hegemonic concepts and also seeks to integrate 'softer' discursive approaches within a broader, structuralist perspective. The result is a more precise identification of how certain more structural changes and shifts induced moments for the creation of new discursive articulations and actions oriented towards the region.","[Lagendijk, Arnoud] NSM, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands","Lagendijk, A (reprint author), NSM, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",A.Lagendijk@ru.nl,,,,,,64,59,60,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,,,REG STUD,Reg.

Highly significant positive correlation was observed between total number of nodules/seedling with root length and seedling dry matter indicating the influence of root length on nodulation and in turn the effect of nodulation on seedling biomass production.

We compared three different methods of measuring root biomass in six northern hardwood stands at the Bartlett Experimental Forest. We found that root coring, the most common method of root sampling, yields estimates of fine root biomass about 27% greater than the estimates based on roots sampled in soil pits. Soil compaction contributes about 10% to this difference; the other contributing factor is that cores cannot be taken through obstructions such as rocks and coarse roots. Pits are the only method allowing characterization of root distribution by depth in rocky soil. If the depth and diameter distribution of roots are not required, allometric equations, if available, provide the easiest method of estimating total root biomass. Equations developed at the nearby Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest predicted root mass measured in soil pits with a mean absolute error of 32%. Allometric equations systematically underpredicted observed soil pit root mass in the young stands, presumably because of mature root systems remaining from the previous cohort, and systematically overpredicted observed root mass in the oldest stands. Soil pits can accurately characterize roots up to about 2 cm; coarser roots are encountered too rarely to be estimated by this method. Soil cores sample only fine roots (up to 1-2-mm diameter) but are much less work than excavating soil pits. Root mass estimates made using cores are more accurate if larger diameter corers are used (5 cm rather than 2.5 cm); subsampling before picking roots can help to control labor costs in the face of larger sample sizes.","SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Yanai, RD (reprint author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",rdyanai@mailbox.syr.edu,"Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/J-6918-2019","Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708; Park, Byung Bae/0000-0002-0620-7374",,,,21,38,40,0,15,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

The colorless TTC is reduced to the red-colored triphenyl formazan (TF) as a result of the dehydrogenase activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, measurements with woody fine roots of adult Norway spruce and European beech trees showed that dead control roots had a high potential to react with TTC. High reactivity was found in boiled fine roots and the bark of coarse roots, but not in the boiled wood of coarse roots. By sequential extraction of dried and ground adult Norway spruce fine roots, reactivity with TTC was reduced by about 75% (water extraction), 93% (water/methanol extraction) and 94% (water/acetone extraction). The water extract reacted with TTC in the same way as polyphenols such as lignin, catechin and epicatechin. Boiling did not affect the extent to which fine roots of adult trees reduced TTC, whereas it greatly reduced TTC reduction by seedling roots. Application of the TTC test to roots of spruce seedlings subjected to increasing drought showed a progressive decrease in TTC reduction. The decrease in TTC reduction was paralleled by a reduction in 02 consumption, thus supporting the conclusion that for roots with a low polyphenol content the TTC test provides a valid assessment of tissue vitality. Our results suggest, however, that the TTC test should not be applied to the fine roots of adult trees because of their high content of polyphenolic compounds whose reaction with TTC masks changes in TTC reduction due to changes in the respiratory capacity of the tissue.","Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Inst Plant Sci, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland","Richter, AK (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",anika.richter@wsl.ch,"Brunner, Ivano/J-8661-2014","Brunner, Ivano/0000-0003-3436-995X",,,,33,29,33,3,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2007,27,1,,,,,155,160,,10.1093/treephys/27.1.155,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,123QV,WOS:000243311400017,17169917,,,,10/31/19B,"Sumorok, B; Kiedrzynska, E",,"Okruszko, T; Maltby, E; Szatylowicz, J; Swiatek, D; Kotowski, W",,"Sumorok, B.; Kiedrzynska, E.",,,Mycorrhizal status of native willow species in the Pilica River floodplain along the moisture gradient,"WETLANDS: MONITORING, MODELLING AND MANAGEMENT","Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering, Water and Earth Sciences",,English,Proceedings Paper,"International Conference Wetlands - Monitoring, Modelling and Management","SEP 22-25, 2005","Wierzba, POLAND",,,,ARBUSCULAR-MYCORRHIZAS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COLONIZATION; ECOSYSTEMS; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; PLANTS; ROOTS,"Studies on mycorrhizal symbionts occurring in plant communities in the Pilica floodplain near the town of Sulejow were carried out in the years 2003-2005.

Particular attention was given to the effect of the diameter and location of the root cutting in regard to the sprouting and rooting efficiency (the percentage of sprouted or rooted cuttings). The length of sprouting and rooting time was also measured. Cloning affected strongly all factors related to regeneration efficiency. The root system structure defined the amount of root cuttings and affected their ability to sprout and root. Practically, root cuttings taken from all parts of the root system of hybrid aspen were capable of producing new shoots and roots. However, the sprouting was better if the cutting was located further from the root collar. The diameter of the cutting did not affect the sprouting efficiency, but it had a strong impact on rooting: the rooting efficiency lowered with increasing root diameter. The clones differed significantly in sprouting time. The diameter and location of the root cutting correlated significantly with sprouting time: thicker root cuttings originating near the root collar produced shoots faster than thinner cuttings from the distal parts of the root system. Cloning, diameter class or location of cuttings had no significant effect on rooting time. For commercial scale hybrid aspen propagation it is essential to use stock plants that are at the most 2-year-old and to select only the vigorously regenerating clones which have a large root system, but relatively thin, long roots.

Other changes were implemented to water cycling routines, specifically to precipitation and evaporation, simulation of industrial nitrogen deposition and fine roots mortality. The major aim of the paper was to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the adapted model. We specifically analysed the effects of site and eco-physiological parameters on the modeled state variables (carbon pools in biomass, litter and soil and net primary production (NPP)). The analysis revealed a high sensitivity of all tested variables to the following site parameters: total precipitation, rooting depth, sand fraction (for sandy soils only), ambient CO, and parameters of nitrogen input. Similarly, the tested variables were shown to be highly sensitive to the following eco-physiological parameters: leaf and fine root C:N ratio, new stem C to new leaf C ratio, new fine root C to new leaf C ratio, specific leaf area, maximum stomatal conductance, fire mortality and fraction of N in Rubisco (specifically for deciduous species). Additionally, the whole plant mortality had a high effect on carbon pools, but a small effect on NPP. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Removal of whorl branches caused a significant reduction in both root length and shoot dry weight compared to untreated control seedlings.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark; Danish Ctr Forest Landscape & Planning, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","Andersen, L (reprint author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, Kirstinebjergvej 10, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark.",lillie.andersen@agrsci.dk,"Rasmussen, Hanne N/P-5485-2014","Rasmussen, Hanne N/0000-0002-0181-9304",,,,28,0,0,0,4,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Q. robur is more tolerant to hypoxia than Q. petraea. We designed an experiment aiming at identifying morphological and physiological responses to root hypoxia that might differ between the two species. Potted seedlings were submitted during seven weeks to a water-logging treatment with 02 concentrations below 3 mg L-1 in the vicinity of roots. The treatment induced growth cessation in both species. Q. petraea displayed a lower tolerance to hypoxia as demonstrated by the higher number of seedlings suffering shoot dieback and leaf chlorosis as compared to Q. robur. This difference should be related to the high number of adventitious roots and hypertrophied lenticels that were formed in Q. robur, compared to Q. petraea. In the fine roots of the two species, the activity of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), the key enzyme of the fermentative pathway, was stimulated after 24 It of water-logging. Transcripts of PDC increased after 48 It of water-logging in Q. robur and not in Q. petraea. Interestingly, transcripts of haemoglobin (Hb) (possibly involved in the putative nitric oxide cycle) followed the same pattern of response than those of PDC. Enzymes of the sucrose degradation pathway displayed decreased activities after 3 weeks of water-logging, probably due to decreased carbohydrate availability. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), sucrose synthase (Susy), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were higher in Q. robur after 3 weeks of water-logging. This study provided a set of markers characterizing the differences of tolerance to hypoxia between the two species for further studies on intra and inter-specific diversity.","Univ Paris 11, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; Fac Sci, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR 1202, F-33612 Cestas, France; UHP, INRA, UMR 1137, Ctr INRA Nancy,IFR 111 Genom Ecophysiol & Ecol Fo, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Dreyer, E (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Bat 362, F-91405 Orsay, France.",dreyer@nancy.inra.fr,"Brendel, Oliver/B-9266-2013","Brendel, Oliver/0000-0003-3252-0273; Parelle, Julien/0000-0002-9209-3755",,,,62,35,37,3,25,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

The mean percent colonization and spore density of AMF reached maximal values in rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Vesicular and hyphal colonizations were positively correlated with soil organic carbon content. AMF spore density was positively correlated with soil pH and negatively correlated with Olsen P content. A high Shannon-Weiner diversity index of AMF was observed in Thar Desert. A total of fifteen AMF species were associated with M. parvifolia. Percent spore density and species richness suggest that the genus Glomus was the predominant AMF under Thar Desert environment.

POM, glomalin, HA, and FA in POM, and glomalin, HA, and FA in POM-free soil were extracted in the following sequence: (1) POM fraction separation from the soil, (2) glomalin extraction from the POM fraction and POM-free soil, and (3) coextraction of HA and FA from the POM fraction and POM-free soil. Only trace amounts of HA and FA were present in the POM fraction, while POM-associated glomalin (POM-glomalin) and POM alone contributed 2 and 12%, respectively, of the total C in the soil. Mean combined weights for chemically extracted pools from POM and from POM-free soil were 9.92 g glomalin, 1.12 g HA, and 0.88 g FA kg(-1) soil. Total protein and C, N, and H concentrations showed that glomalin and HA were, for the most part, separate pools, although protein was detected in HA extracts. Even though percentage carbon was higher in HA than in glomalin, glomalin was a larger (almost nine times) operationally defined pool of soil organic C. Glomalin was also the largest pool of soil N of all the pools isolated, but all pools combined only contained 31% of the total N in the soil.","USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, Mandan, ND 58554 USA; USDA ARS, Sustainable Agr Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Nichols, KA (reprint author), USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, POB 459,1701 10th Ave SW, Mandan, ND 58554 USA.",nicholsk@mandan.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,23,31,43,2,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The total biomass of the cottonwood increased with increasing CO2 concentration (2.28, 5.28, and 3.78 kg/tree for 400, 800, and 1200 ppm, respectively). The strongest responses were observed for the trunk and coarse roots (three and two times higher as compared to the ambient CO2 concentration). The triple concentration of CO2 had a greater effect on the roots of the trees, but the growth of leaves and branches was insignificant or absent. The shoot-to-root ratio changed as follows: 2.86, 2.80, and 1.57 at 400, 800, and 1200 ppm, respectively. The rate of C-CO2 release from the soil samples incubated for 70 days increased in the following order: 400, 800, and 1200 ppm CO2; the average values of the CO2 emission were 2.02, 2.33, and 2.76 mg/100 g per day, respectively. The greatest content of C-mb (75.1 mg/100 g) was observed in the treatment with the triple CO2 concentration, and the lowest content (53.7 mg/100 g) was found for the ambient CO2 concentration. This study suggests that the responses of the cottonwood biomass and soil microbial activity vary depending on the CO2 concentration. The microbial biomass gradually increased with increasing CO2 concentration; the total plant biomass showed the highest response at the double CO2 concentration, and the triple CO2 concentration was likely to suppress the growth of the above-ground plant biomass.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Oblast, Russia; Russian Acad Sci, Inst Basic Biol Problems, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Oblast, Russia; Ctr Invest Alimentac & Desarrollo, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico; Biosphere Syst Inc, Tucson, AZ 85755 USA","Kudeyarov, VN (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Oblast, Russia.",,"Semenov, Vyacheslav M./J-5646-2018; Blagodatsky, Sergey/F-2734-2010","Semenov, Vyacheslav M./0000-0002-2539-6107; Blagodatsky, Sergey/0000-0003-1428-6014",,,,44,3,5,0,8,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",1064-2293,,,EURASIAN SOIL SCI+,Eurasian Soil Sci.,DEC,2006,39,,,1,,,S6,S14,,10.1134/S1064229306130035,,,9,Soil Science,Agriculture,150MS,WOS:000245221500002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kaestner, A; Schneebeli, M; Graf, F",,,,"Kaestner, Anders; Schneebeli, Martin; Graf, Frank",,,Visualizing three-dimensional root networks using computed tomography,GEODERMA,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil; roots; computed tomography; image analysis; 3D,RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; PLANT-ROOT; SOIL; QUANTIFICATION; DIFFUSION; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; SIZE,"We describe a method to reconstruct the root network from a three-dimensional image generated with computed tomography.

The method consists of three steps: contrast enhancement using a non-linear diffusion filter, thresholding based on Rosin's method and extraction of the main features using a morphological connectivity algorithm. With this approach, we are also capable of reconstructing fine roots with high fidelity, which is shown with a performance experiment using artificial images with increasing noise. The method is applied to an X-ray microtomography data set of two alder roots, grown for 4months in a natural moraine soil. To simplify the soil material, the bare roots were transferred into a Plexiglas receptacle filled with quartz sand. The reconstructed image is compared with a photograph of the real roots.

Surprisingly, ergosterol, but not PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9, appears non-responsive to both large-scale tree girdling, which interrupts tree belowground C allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi, and to long-term N-loading, which may have negative effects on both mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. These results, therefore, question the use of ergosterol to monitor effects of soil perturbations on fungi in the field, but do not put into question the use of the biomarker in natural forest ecosystems.

Gypsy moth (Lymantria disparL.) populations were experimentally increased to obtain defoliation in the summers of 1996, 1997 and 1998; fertilization subplots were supplemented with NH4NO3 (100 kg N ha(-1)) in the spring of each year. Despite the severity of defoliation, the effects were small, and significant on only two sampling dates: in May 1997, when fine root %CT was 23% lower in the defoliated trees, and in November 1997, when trees in the defoliated unfertilized plots had 35% higher root %CT than trees in all other plots. Defoliation effects on root %CT did not follow the same seasonal pattern as defoliation effects on root starch content, N uptake capacity or leaf %CT. Regulation of root condensed tannin concentration appeared to be partially uncoupled from these traits. The small transient effects on root defense reflect the resilience of this early successional tree to severe early season defoliation.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Kosola, KR (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kkosola@facstaff.wisc.edu,"Kosola, Kevin/R-3724-2019",,,,,35,9,9,1,22,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2006,26,12,,,,,1607,1611,,10.1093/treephys/26.12.1607,,,5,Forestry,Forestry,112VU,WOS:000242556700011,17169900,,,,10/31/19J,"Kalyn, AL; Van Rees, KCJ",,,,"Kalyn, A.

The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of fine roots to ecosystem biomass and NPP in a mature black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) (OBS), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) (OA), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) (OJP) stand, and an I I-year-old harvested jack pine (HJP) stand in Saskatchewan. Estimates of fine root biomass and NPP were obtained from nine minirhizotron (MR) tubes at each of the four Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS). Fine root data were collected once a month for May-September in 2003 and 2004. Additional C biomass and NPP data for various components of the forest stands were obtained from Gower et al. (1997) and Howard et al. (2004). Annual fine root biomass averaged 3.10 +/- 0.89, 1.71 +/- 0.49, 1.62 +/- 0.32, and 2.96 +/- 0.67 Mg C ha(-1) (means S.D.) at OBS, OA, OJP, and HIP, respectively, comprising between 1 and 6% of total stand biomass. Annual fine root NPP averaged 2.66 +/- 0.97, 2.03 +/- 0.43, 1.44 +/- 0.43, and 2.16 +/- 0.81 Me C ha-1 year (means S.D.) at OBS, OA, OJP and HIP, respectively, constituting between 41 and 71% of total stand NPP. Results of this study indicate that fine roots produce a large amount of C in boreal forests. It is speculated that fine root NPP may control a large amount of labile C-cycling in boreal forests and that fine root responses to environmental and anthropogenic stress may be an early indicator of impaired ecosystem functioning.

Results showed significant effects of vegetation cover on slope stability in two extreme slopes, type A and type E, which represented stable and failed slopes, respectively. The highest root length density (RLD) was observed in type A slope due to the high density of vegetation cover, which eventually resulted in a lower soil water content (SWC). In contrast, the low biomass density of type E slope possessed a low RLD but high SWC, characteristics of a failed slope. Some correlations were also observed: RLD is positively related to shear strength and SWC is negatively related to both soil shear strength and soil penetrability. Thus, the study suggests that SWC and RLD could be used as indicators of slope stability and has the potential to predict slope failure in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Protection of forest seedlings against this disease must be focused on integrated management for in which biological control is one of the most important tools. Mycorrhizal fungi may provide protection against pathogen invasion of seedlings. In this study, the interactions between the mycorrhizal fungi Boletus edulis, Rhizopogon roseolus, Laccaria laccata and Lactarius deliciosus and damping off pathogens (Fusarium oxysporum and F. moniliforme) were investigated in vitro and mechanisms involved in the protection of damping off in P. nigra seedlings are also discussed. The effect of filtrates from mycorrhizal species on spore germination of F. oxysporum varied throughout the tests. At the end of the assay, the inhibitory effect only could be observed in the L.deliciosus treatment. None of the filtrates reduced spore germination in F. moniliforme. Finally, three of the four mycorrhizal species grown for 2 months in the substrate, L. laccata, L. deliciosus and B. edulis, increased the survival of Fusarium inoculated P. nigra seedlings.","Univ Valladolid, Forest Entomol & Pathol Lab, Dept Prod Vegetal & Recursos Forestales, Palencia 34071, Spain","Martin-Pinto, P (reprint author), Univ Valladolid, Forest Entomol & Pathol Lab, Dept Prod Vegetal & Recursos Forestales, Avda Madrid 44, Palencia 34071, Spain.",pmpinto@pvsuva.es,"Pajares, Juan/D-5215-2014; Martin-Pinto, Pablo/D-5219-2014","Pajares, Juan/0000-0002-4682-8984; Martin-Pinto, Pablo/0000-0002-2853-056X",,,,64,17,18,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,NOV,2006,32,3,,,,,323,334,,10.1007/s11056-006-9006-7,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,104HJ,WOS:000241949200007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zou, JW; Rogers, WE; DeWalt, SJ; Siemann, E",,,,"Zou, Jianwen; Rogers, William E.; DeWalt, Saara J.; Siemann, Evan",,,The effect of Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum) ecotype on soil-plant system carbon and nitrogen processes,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,CO2; ecosystem process; EICA; invasion; N2O; soil-plant interaction,INCREASED COMPETITIVE ABILITY; ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; INVASIVE TREE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; OXIDE EMISSIONS; N2O EMISSIONS; GAS-EXCHANGE; HAWAII; COMMUNITIES; GRASSLAND,"The EICA hypothesis predicts that shifts in allocation of invasive plants give rise to higher growth rates and lower herbivore defense levels in their introduced range than conspecifics in their native range. These changes in traits of invasive plants may also affect ecosystem processes. We conducted an outdoor pot experiment with Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum, Euphorbiaceae) seedlings from its native (Jiangsu, China, native ecotype) and introduced ranges (Texas, USA, invasive ecotype) to compare their relative performances in its native range and to examine ecotype effects on soil processes with and without fertilization. Consistent with predictions, plant (shoot and root) mass was significantly greater and leaf defoliation tended to be higher, while the root:shoot ratio was lower for the invasive ecotype relative to the native ecotype. Seasonal amounts of soil-plant system CO2 and N2O emissions were higher for the invasive ecotype than for the native ecotype. Soil respiration rates and N2O emission increases from fertilization were also greater for the invasive ecotype than for the native ecotype, while shoot-specific respiration rates (g CO2-C g(-1) C day(-1)) did not differ between ecotypes. Further, soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) was higher, but soil total N was lower for soils with the invasive ecotype than soils with the native ecotype. Compared with native ecotypes, therefore, invasive ecotypes may have developed a competition advantage in accelerating soil processes and promoting more nitrogen uptake through soil-plant direct interaction. The results of this study suggest that soil and ecosystem processes accelerated by variation in traits of invasive plants may have implications for their invasiveness.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Zou, JW (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jwzou@rice.edu,"ZOU, JIANWEN/B-3059-2012",,,,,47,34,43,3,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2006,150,2,,,,,272,281,,10.1007/s00442-006-0512-2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,096TX,WOS:000241400800009,16917777,,,,10/31/19J,"Wilsey, BJ; Polley, HW",,,,"Wilsey, Brian J.; Polley, H.

Each of these in turn can be separated into native and introduced (i.e., exotic) species. Although numerous studies have compared plant traits between the traditional groups of grasses and forbs, fewer have compared native versus introduced species. Introduced grass species, which were often introduced to prevent erosion or to improve grazing opportunities, have become common or even dominant species in grasslands. By virtue of their abundances, introduced species may alter ecosystems if they differ from natives in growth and allocation patterns. Introduced grasses were probably selected nonrandomly from the source population for forage (aboveground) productivity. Based on this expectation, aboveground production is predicted to be greater and root mass fraction to be smaller in introduced than native species. We compared root and shoot distribution and tissue quality between introduced and native C-4 grass species in the Blackland Prairie region of Central Texas, USA, and then compared differences to the more well-studied divergence between C-4 grasses and forbs. Comparisons were made in experimental monocultures planted with equal-sized transplants on a common soil type and at the same density. Aboveground productivity and C:N ratios were higher, on average, in native grasses than in native forbs, as expected. Native and introduced grasses had comparable amounts of shallow root biomass and tissue C:N ratios. However, aboveground productivity and total N were lower and deep root biomass and root mass fraction were greater in native than introduced grasses. These differences in average biomass distribution and N could be important to ecosystems in cases where native and introduced grasses have been exchanged. Our results indicate that native-introduced status may be important when interpreting species effects on grassland processes like productivity and plant N accumulation.","Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA","Wilsey, BJ (reprint author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 253 Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",bwilsey@iastate.edu,,"Polley, Herbert/0000-0002-1197-8800; Wilsey, Brian J./0000-0002-0628-5006",,,,64,79,86,0,69,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2006,150,2,,,,,300,309,,10.1007/s00442-006-0515-z,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,096TX,WOS:000241400800012,16927104,,,,10/31/19J,"Bottomley, PJ; Yarwood, RR; Kageyama, SA; Waterstripe, KE; Williams, MA; Cromack, K; Myrold, DD",,,,"Bottomley, P.

An experiment was conducted in which soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between immediately adjacent forests and meadows at two high elevation (-1,600 m) sites (Carpenter and Lookout) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Half of the cores were placed in PVC pipe (closed) to prevent new root colonization, whereas the other cores were placed in mesh bags (open) to allow recolonization by fine roots. A duplicate set of open and closed soil cores was not transferred between sites and was incubated in place. After 2 year, soil cores were removed and changes in fungal and bacterial biomasses determined using light microscopy, and changes in microbial community composition determined by PLFA analysis, and by length heterogeneity PCR of the internal transcribed spacer region of fungal ribosomal DNA. At both sites soil microbial community structures had responded to treatments after 2 year of incubation. At Carpenter, both fungal and bacterial community structures of forest soil changed significantly in response to transfer from forest to meadow, with the shift in fungal community structure being accompanied by a significant decrease in the PLFA biomarker of fungal biomass, 18:2 omega 6,9. At Lookout, both fungal and bacterial community structures of forest soil changed significantly in response to open versus closed core treatments, with the shift in the fungal community being accompanied by a significant decrease in the 18:2 omega 6,9 content of closed cores, and the shift in the bacterial community structure being accompanied by a significant increase in bacterial biomass of closed cores. At both sites, fungal community structures of meadow soils changed differently between open and closed cores in response to transfer to forest, and were accompanied by increases in the 18:2 omega 6,9 content of open cores. Although there were no significant treatment effects on the bacterial community structure of meadow soil at either site, bacterial biomass was significantly higher in closed versus open cores regardless of transfer.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Bottomley, PJ (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Nash Hall,Rm 220, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",Peter.Bottomley@orst.edu,"Myrold, David/Q-6694-2019; Myrold, David/E-1813-2011","Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X; Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X; Williams, Mark A./0000-0002-4766-9399",,,,40,24,26,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2006,289,2-Jan,,,,,35,45,,10.1007/s11104-006-9095-2,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,107DD,WOS:000242150000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Del Galdo, I; Oechel, WC; Cotrufo, MF",,,,"Del Galdo, Ilaria; Oechel, Walter C.; Cotrufo, M.

Although many studies have addressed this question, a clear understanding is still missing, particularly with respect to long-term responses. In this study, we quantified soil C stores and dynamics in relationship to soil aggregation and pool composition in a Californian chaparral ecosystem exposed for 6 years to a gradient of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, ranging from pre-industrial levels 250 to 750 mu l l(-1) CO2. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 depleted in C-13 was used for the fumigation, thus providing a tracer of C input from the vegetation to the soil. Long-term CO2 exposure invariably affected soil aggregation, with a significant decrease in the macroaggregate fraction at highest CO2 levels relative to the other two size fractions (i.e. microaggregates and silt and clay). This soil structural change most likely reduced the stability and protection of SOM, and C content generally decreased in most fractions over the CO2 treatments, and induced faster turnover of recently fixed C at high CO2 levels. The strongest response was found in the C content of the microaggregates, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with rising levels of CO2. We conclude that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will decrease soil C in chaparral ecosystems, and that the microaggregate fraction is the most responsive to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2.

When fractionated according to particle density, C and N concentration (per g fraction) and C/N of these soil organo-mineral particles decrease with increasing particle density across soils of widely divergent texture, mineralogy, location, and management. The variation in particle density is explained potentially by two factors: (1) a decrease in the mass ratio of organic to mineral phase of these particles, and (2) variations in density of the mineral phase. The first explanation implies that the thickness of the organic accumulations decreases with increasing particle density. The decrease in C/N can be explained at least partially by especially stable sorption of nitrogenous N-containing compounds (amine, amide, and pyrrole) directly to mineral surfaces, a phenomenon well documented both empirically and theoretically. These peptidic compounds, along with ligand-exchanged carboxylic compounds, could then form a stable inner organic layer onto which other organics could sorb more readily than onto the unconditioned mineral surfaces (""onion"" layering model). To explore mechanisms underlying this trend in C concentration and C/N with particle density, we sequentially density fractionated an Oregon andic soil at 1.65, 1.85, 2.00, 2.28, and 2.55 g cm(-3) and analyzed the six fractions for measures of organic matter and mineral phase properties. All measures of OM composition showed either: (1) a monotonic change with density, or (2) a monotonic change across the lightest fractions, then little change over the heaviest fractions. Total C, N, and lignin phenol concentration all decreased monotonically with increasing density, and (14)C mean residence time (MRT) increased with particle density from ca. 150 years to > 980 years in the four organo-mineral fractions. In contrast, C/N. (13)C and (15)N concentration all showed the second pattern. All these data are consistent with a general pattern of an increase in extent of microbial processing with increasing organo-mineral particle density, and also with an ""onion"" layering model. X-ray diffraction before and after separation of magnetic materials showed that the sequential density fractionation (SDF) isolated pools of differing mineralogy, with layer-silicate clays dominating in two of the intermediate fractions and primary minerals in the heaviest two fractions. There was no indication that these differences in mineralogy controlled the differences in density of the organo-mineral particles in this soil. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in particle density reflects variation in thickness of the organic accumulations and with an ""onion"" layering model for organic matter accumulation on mineral surfaces. However. the mineralogy differences among fractions made it difficult to test either the layer-thickness or ""onion"" layering models with this soil. Although SDF isolated pools of distinct mineralogy and organic-matter composition, more work will be needed to understand mechanisms relating the two factors.

The population dynamics was presented as a series of cycles (each one involves ""soil rhizosphere -> nodules -> soil"" succession) described using recurrent equations. For representing the selection and mutation pressures, we used a universal approach based on calculating the shifts in the genetic ratios of competing bacterial genotypes within the particular habitats and across several habitats. Analysis of the model demonstrated that a balanced polymorphism may be established in rhizobia population: mutants with an improved fitness do not supplant completely the parental strain while mutants with a decreased fitness may be maintained stably. This polymorphism is caused by a rescue of low-fitted genotypes via negative frequency-dependent selection (FDS) that is implemented during inoculation of nodules and balances the Darwinian selection that occurs during multiplication or extinction of bacteria at different habitats. The most diverse populations are formed if the rhizobia are equally successful in soil and nodules, while a marked preference for any of these habitats results in the decrease of diversity. Our simulation suggests that FDS can maintain the mutualistic rhizobia-legume interactions under the stress conditions deleterious for surviving the bacterial strains capable for intensive N-2 fixation. Genetic consequences of releasing the modified rhizobia strains may be addressed using the presented model. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Because leaves and roots of the same species are thought to be similar in structure and life history, we hypothesized that Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little (Utah juniper) fine roots would reflect the persistent aboveground foliage characteristic of this species. We monitored fine roots, less than I mm in diameter, by minirhizotron imaging to a depth of 150 cm over two growing seasons from April 2002 to December 2003. We measured fine root numbers, lengths and diameters, and noted the time of birth and death of root segments. We correlated our root data with soil water potential measured by thermocouple psychrometry and ecosystem evapotranspiration measured by ecosystem eddy flux. Median fine root lifespan, determined by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, was about one year, much less than foliage lifespan estimates of more than five years. Yet, roots of juniper live much longer than those of other Great Basin species. The median survivorship of shallow and deep roots was 144 and 448 days, respectively. Production of new roots was observed during periods of favorable soil water potential and there was a seasonal progression of increased new roots and root length during the warm season toward lower soil depths with root loss in the upper soil layers. This was also reflected in water extraction which progressed to greater soil depths later in the warm season. Aboveground, rates of ecosystem evapotranspiration decreased with decreasing soil water potentials in a similar manner in both 2002 and 2003, reflecting the relocation of roots to available water at depth. Juniper exhibited a flexible root depth distribution throughout the 20 months of this study, indicating the potential to respond to shifting soil water resources despite long fine root lifespans.","Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Forest Range & Wildlife, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Biometeorol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Peek, MS (reprint author), William Paterson Univ, Dept Biol, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA.",peekm@wpunj.edu,"Ryel, Ronald/A-3422-2008","Hipps, Lawrence/0000-0002-7658-8571",,,,48,21,22,2,27,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2006,26,11,,,,,1469,1476,,10.1093/treephys/26.11.1469,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,105DI,WOS:000242009100009,16877331,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Nicoll, BC; Berthier, S; Achim, A; Gouskou, K; Danjon, F; van Beek, LPH",,,,"Nicoll, B.

Carr.) trees, from a 40-year-old plantation in west Scotland, were extracted, digitised in three dimensions, and root topology was recorded. Roots were from trees grown on a steep (ca. 30 degrees) north-facing slope, and from an adjacent horizontal area with similar gleyed mineral soil. The prevailing wind was across-slope from the west. Analysis of below-ground parts of the trees in comparison with those above-ground revealed a positive linear relationship between coarse root volume and stem volume. Most non-directional characteristics of the root systems were similar between trees on the slope and on flat terrain. Allocation of root mass around trees was examined in relation to the slope and the prevailing wind direction. Trees on the horizontal area had more root mass in leeward sectors than other sectors, but trees on the slopes had more root mass in the windward sectors than other sectors. Centres of mass of the root systems from the horizontal part of the site were not significantly clustered in any direction, but root systems of trees on the slope had centres of mass significantly clustered across the slope in the windward direction. For trees on the slope, the mean direction of the largest sector without structural roots was 4 degrees from north, i.e. downslope. The results are discussed in relation to soil characteristics and the biomechanical behaviour of trees on slopes.","Forestry Commiss Roslin, No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland; INRA, EPhysE, F-33611 Gazinet, France; Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht Ctr Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands","Nicoll, BC (reprint author), Forestry Commiss Roslin, No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland.",bruce.nicoll@forestry.gsi.gov.uk,"Danjon, Frederic/F-1557-2011; Van Beek, Rens/B-4904-2014","Danjon, Frederic/0000-0002-9104-9808; Van Beek, Rens/0000-0002-4758-108X; Nicoll, Bruce/0000-0002-5891-0555",,,,62,31,34,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Arg.) were investigated. In one experiment, the 9.1 m inter row space of a 15 year old rubber plantation was intercropped with cinnamon. The effect of four cinnamon densities (17,500 bushes ha(-1), 8,260 bushes ha(-1), 7,980 bushes ha(-1) and 3,980 bushes ha(-1)) and four levels of fertilizer (60 g bush(-1), 120 g bush(-1), 180 g bush(-1) and 240 g bush(-1)) on cinnamon bark yield and yield components were tested in a split plot experiment. Interception of light by the rubber canopy, R:FR ratio of transmitted light under the rubber canopy and the fine root length density in the inter row was uniform in all treatments throughout the whole experimental period. R:FR ratio of light under cinnamon was significantly lower under the highest cinnamon plant density of 17,500 bushes ha(-1). Bushes in the highest plant density treatment (D1) produced longer shoots than those in the lowest density treatment (D4), where the weight of bark cm(-1) was greater. As a result there were no significant effects of plant density on cinnamon bark yield at the individual bush level. This also resulted in significantly greater weight of bark per ha in the highest density treatment (D1) indicating the possibility of increasing cinnamon plant density for obtaining greater bark yield from intercropping systems under considerable shade and root competition. Increasing the level of added fertilizer even up to four times the standard did not have any advantage on bark yield or its components.","Rubber Res Inst Sri Lanka, Agalawatta 22400, Western Prov, Sri Lanka","Pathiratna, LSS (reprint author), Rubber Res Inst Sri Lanka, Agalawatta 22400, Western Prov, Sri Lanka.",dirrri@tradenetsl.lk,,,,,,27,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

We hypothesized that both edaphic factors and seedling age would affect ectomycorrhizal (ECM) community structure. We assessed the relative abundance of mycorrhizal morphotypes and distinguished ECM fungi present on root tips using RFLP ( restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the ITS ( internal transcribed spacer) of fungal rDNA. Most of the RFLP types were identified by comparing RFLP patterns with reference data obtained from regional sporocarps and isolates of ectendomycorrhizal species. Samples of unidentified RFLP types and representatives of suilloid RFLP patterns were sequenced and compared with available sequences. Overall, we identified 13 fungal species, with species richness varying from two to eight species among nurseries. The dominant species in each examined nursery were Wilcoxina mikolae and Thelephora terrestris. Suilloid fungi were also abundant in most of the nurseries. S. variegatus was the most frequent suilloid species among the nurseries. Seedling age affected the relative abundance of ECM species to some extent. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a lack of apparent correlations between the relative abundances of species and edaphic factors. Factors that may contribute to the maintenance of ECM community structure are discussed.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland","Rudawska, M (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",mariarud@man.poznan.pl,,"Leski, Tomasz/0000-0003-4167-5015; Rudawska, Maria/0000-0002-8103-5269",,,,53,30,31,0,12,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Metals also can exert a selective pressure on the organisms, resulting in microbial populations with higher tolerance to metals. Given the importance of legumes in animal and human consumption and their use in maintaining soil fertility, some attention has been given to the effects that heavy metals exert on Rhizobium isolates. In this context, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae was isolated from areas with different heavy metal contents and their tolerances were compared. Alterations in the protein pool of Rhizobium populations were also evaluated. Physicochemical parameters were determined and heavy metal concentrations in soils were analysed by ICP-AES. Isolates were screened for their tolerance in YEM media supplemented with different heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Co, Cd, Ni, Cr). Proteins were extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE. EI1 and EI2 (engineering industries) soils presented the highest metal concentration, and were therefore the most polluted soils. Isolates showed different growth responses to heavy metals. C (control soil) and M (mines) isolates were less tolerant than Ell, EI2 and CI (chemical industries) isolates. Metals influenced their protein profiles, most of the alterations corresponding to decreases in polypeptide expression. However, in tolerant isolates these alterations corresponding basically to increases, as occurred in CI isolates. This work suggests that there is a relationship between Rhizobium's tolerance, heavy metal soil contamination and alterations in protein pool. As a result, the analysis of protein alterations seems to be a good indicator to estimate the level of stress imposed on Rhizobium populations submitted to heavy-metal contamination.

One year after planting, both mycorrhizal inoculation treatments and the addition of amendment had increased plant growth and dehydrogenase, urease and benzoyl argininamide hydrolysing activities. The inoculation with G. mosseae increased plant growth to a greater extent than the addition of the amendment (about 35% greater than plants grown in the amended soil and about 79% greater than control plants) and both treatments produced similar increases in soil aggregate stability (about 31% higher than control soil). The organic amendment produced a very significant decrease in the levels of microbial biomass C and a strong increase in soil dehydrogenase and urease activities, which were proportional to the amendment rate. Only the combined treatment involving the addition of a medium dose of amendment (100 mg C kg(-1) stop soil) and the mycorrhizal inoculation with G. intraradices or G. deserticola produced an additive effect on the plant growth with respect to the treatments applied individually (about 77% greater than plants grown in the amended soil and about 63% greater than inoculated plants).","CSIC, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Murcia 30100, Spain","Carrasco, L (reprint author), CSIC, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, POB 164,Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",fcb@cebas.csic.es,"Tortosa, German/M-9544-2019; Caravaca, Fuensanta/K-6358-2017; Munoz, German Tortosa/B-5531-2009; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013","Tortosa, German/0000-0003-3982-1167; Caravaca, Fuensanta/0000-0001-8247-6296; Roldan, Antonio/0000-0002-2610-7784",,,,42,7,7,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Federal forest plans for the northwestern USA include guidelines that require the retention of a minimum of 15% basal area in harvest units, with the goal of facilitating the development of late-seral stand structure, which is an important habitat element for old-growth forest-dependent species. However, effective levels and patterns of green-tree retention are unknown. We present results of a treatment consisting of 15% basal area, evenly dispersed retention (15%D). We quantified changes in the ectomycorrhiza (EM) community after the 15%D treatment, both near and away from retention trees. Pretreatment samples were obtained between 1 and 24 months before tree harvest. Post-treatment samples were collected within 14-25 months of harvest. In areas 8-25 m from retention trees, there was a 50% decline in the number of EM types per soil core from before to after treatment. Soil cores taken > 5 m from retention trees exhibited a shift in EM community structure. EM-type richness was positively correlated with fine-root-tip density.

There was no effect of water content on the chemical shift distribution of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal in C-13 cross-polarization (CP) NMR spectra. The sensitivity of the C-13 CP NMR spectra decreased slightly with increasing water content. Much of this decrease could be attributed to decreases in T-1 rho H relaxation rates, caused by enhanced molecular mobility of the organic matter in the presence of absorbed water. Rates of T-1H relaxation were very sensitive to water content, and average T-1H relaxation rates decreased four- to five-fold from the smallest to the largest water content. Rates of T-1H relaxation were non-uniform, and were better modelled by two-T-1H component fits than one-T-1H component fits. The ratio of rapidly to slowly relaxing components increased with increasing water content. Proton spin relaxation editing (PSRE) subspectra revealed substantial changes in the nature of these two components with increasing water content. These results indicate the presence of an organic matter component that is very sensitive to water content, transforming from slowly relaxing at a small water content to rapidly relaxing at a greater water content. This component was shown to be rich in O-alkyl and carbonyl C, and may be hemicellulosic root exudates and microbial mucilages. The slowly relaxing PSRE component was a mixture of ligno-cellulose and alkyl biopolymers, whereas the rapidly relaxing component was primarily charcoal for one of the soils, and was reminiscent of dissolved organic carbon for the other soil. These findings show that care must be taken in controlling water contents when using PSRE to study organic matter.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia","Smernik, RJ (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Waite Campus, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia.",ronald.smernik@adelaide.edu.au,"Smernik, Ron/H-9905-2013","Smernik, Ronald/0000-0001-6033-5855",,,,37,10,10,1,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1351-0754,,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

Various possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the existence of these bacteria in nodules, but there is no sufficient experimental evidence to support the estimations. In this work, we proved that the Agrobacterium strain CCBAU 81181, which was originally isolated from the root nodules of Onobrychis viciaefolia, and a symbiotic strain of Sinorhizobium meliloti CCBAU 10062 could coinhabit the root nodules of Melilotus dentatus. Analyses were performed by using a fluorescence marker, reisolation of bacteria from nodules, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole cellular proteins, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of symbiotic genes. The inoculation of A. tumefaciens CCBAU 81181 did not affect the growth and nodulation of plants. CCBAU 81181 and 24 other Agrobacterium strains isolated from nodules were incapable of nodulating on their original or alternative host and 22 strains of these strains were endophytes in the roots and stems of their hosts. Also, the tumor-inducing A. tumefaciens strains IAM 13129(T) and C58 were found capable of entering the roots of Glycyrrhiza pallidiflora, but did not cause pathogenic symptoms. With these results, we conclude that A. tumefaciens strains could be endophytic bacteria in the roots, stems, and root nodules.

Extraradical hyphal lengths exhibited a significant, on average 24%. reduction in C maculosa-versus native grass-dominated sites. As both AMF community composition and abundance were altered by C maculosa invasion, these data are strongly suggestive of potential impacts on AMF-mediated ecosystem processes.

Previous studies demonstrating the potential of atmospheric N deposition to influence forest soil carbon have focused on decomposition processes with much less known about potential impacts on mycorrhiza-derived carbon. Glomalin is a unique glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that has been implicated in the formation of soil aggregates and potentially a significant store of soil carbon. To determine the possible impact of experimental N deposition of such stores we examined the operationally defined glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels over two growing seasons in three forest types receiving background N deposition (control) or treated with 80 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) as NaNO3. Three sites of each of three forest types, sugar maple-basswood (SMBW), sugar maple-red oak (SMRO), and black oak-white oak (BOWO), in northern Lower Michigan were studied during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. GRSP were extracted from air-dried soils with citric acid and measured by the Bradford method. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences related to forest type and sample date in easily extractable Bradford reactive (EE-BRSP) and Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), but failed to detect significant effects of experimental N amendment. EE-BRSP and BRSP varied in a pattern that was consistent with an AM fungal origin; a pattern that reflected the mycorrhizal types of the dominant over and understory plants of each forest ecosystem. SMBW forests dominated by AM plants had the highest levels of protein. BOWO forests with low AM plant cover had the lowest protein levels and SMRO forests were intermediate. Both Bradford-reactive fractions and their ratio varied seasonally, generally being highest in fall samples. Significant correlations observed between BRSP fractions, phosphorous, and soil organic matter were likely related to covariation of soil properties across forest types. While not statistically significant, response patterns of BRSP to N deposition were ecosystem-specific and reflected mycorrhizal types of dominant species. Abundance of these proteins reflected previously observed changes in SOC in the two forest types examined with abundant AM hosts. Specifically, nitrate addition led to BRSP decreases in SMBW and increases in SMRO forests. Changes in BRSP accounted for a small fraction of the changes in SOC; appearing to increase as a fraction of residual SOC consistent with the idea that GRSP are recalcitrant. BRSP remained unchanged at BOWO sites despite a significant increase in SOC at these sites. Our results point to the potential of proteins as contributors to differential, mycorrhizal type-specific responses to changes in soil carbon following N amendment.","Bluffton Univ, Dept Sci, Bluffton, OH 45817 USA; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Antibus, RK (reprint author), Bluffton Univ, Dept Sci, Bluffton, OH 45817 USA.",antibusr@bluffton.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,78,6,6,0,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2006,288,2-Jan,,,,,173,187,,10.1007/s11104-006-9106-3,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,119GS,WOS:000243001400014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chapman, KA; Colombo, SJ",,,,"Chapman, Kimberly A.; Colombo, Stephen J.",,,Early root morphology of jack pine seedlings grown in different types of container,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Copperblock (R); Jiffy (R) pellet; Multipot (R); root system form; shoot : root mass; Starpot (R); Ventblock (R),LODGEPOLE PINE; STEM STRAIGHTNESS; TREE STABILITY; MORPHOGENESIS; DEFORMATION; PLANTATIONS; SPRUCE; STOCK,"This study compared the effects of container type on early root system morphology of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) seedlings to determine impacts of container type on root characteristics that may be important for tree stability. Seedlings were grown for one season in Multipots (R), Ventblocks (R), Copperblocks (R), Starpots (R) and Jiffy (R) pellets, and for a second season in sand culture in pots. After the first growing season, roots that had grown between Jiffy plugs were cut using a knife, either ""early'', in September, or ""late'', in November. Seedlings produced in non-pruning containers, Multipots and Ventblocks, had more vertical structural roots, less even root distribution and high shoot: root mass after a second season. Seedlings grown in pruning containers, Copperblocks, Starpots and Jiffy pellets, had more horizontal structural roots and more evenly distributed roots. Jiffy seedlings had high shoot: root mass after pruning, but ratios decreased to low levels similar to Starpots and Copperblocks after a second season in pots. Early pruning of Jiffy seedlings removed less root mass than late pruning, but total live root mass of early and late pruned seedlings was similar after the potting trial. Pruning containers thus produced structural root forms with more desirable characteristics for tree stability.

Karst.) trees was investigated by means of sap flow measurements made with the heat field deformation method. Irrigation was applied to a limited portion of the root system to steepen gradients of water potential in the soil and thus enhance rates of HR. On completion of the sap flow measurements, and to aid in their interpretation, the structure of the root system of seven of the investigated trees was exposed to a depth of 30 cm with a supersonic air-stream (air-spade). Before irrigation, vertical redistribution of water was observed in large coarse roots and some adjacent small lateral roots. Immediately after localized irrigation, horizontal redistribution of water from watered roots to dry roots via the stem base was demonstrated. The amount of horizontal distribution depended on the position of the receiving roots relative to the watered roots and the absorbing area of the watered root. No redistribution from watered roots via dry soil to roots of neighboring trees was detected. Responses of sap flow to localized irrigation were more pronounced in small lateral roots than in large branching roots where release and uptake of water are integrated. Sap flow measurements with multi-point sensors along radii in large lateral roots demonstrated water extraction from different soil horizons. We conclude that synchronous measurements of sap flow in both small and large lateral roots are needed to study water absorption and transport in tree root systems.","Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Nadezhdina, N (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",nadezdan@mendelu.cz,"Nadezhdina, Nadezhda/E-6075-2014",,,,,51,50,54,0,29,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,OCT,2006,26,10,,,,,1277,1288,,10.1093/treephys/26.10.1277,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,094TN,WOS:000241262000004,16815830,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Hogberg, P; Read, DJ",,,,"Hogberg, Peter; Read, David J.",,,Towards a more plant physiological perspective on soil ecology,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; FINE-ROOT CARBON; FOREST SOIL; PINE FOREST; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS; TEMPERATE FOREST; UNITED-STATES; RESPIRATION,"Soil respiration almost balances carbon fixation by terrestrial photosynthesis and exceeds all anthropogenic carbon emissions by an order of magnitude, yet we lack precise knowledge of the sources of, and controls upon, the release of carbon dioxide from soils.

The new studies challenge the widespread view that soil activity is dominated by decomposer organisms using older detrital material and that root litter inputs equal those of aboveground litter. The new observations emphasize the physiological continuity and dynamic interdependence of the plant-microbe-soil system and highlight the need for closer cooperation between plant and soil scientists.","SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, Sect Soil Sci, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Hogberg, P (reprint author), SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, Sect Soil Sci, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Peter.Hogberg@sek.slu.se,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Read, David/C-2454-2013","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; ",,,,68,288,313,3,161,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Regarding the lower fungi, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota, a variety of proposals have been advanced. Microsporidia may or may not be fungi; the Glomales (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) may or may not constitute a fifth fungal phylum, and the loss of the flagellum may have occurred either once or multiple times during fungal evolution. All of these issues are capable of being resolved by a molecular phylogenetic analysis which achieves strong statistical support for major branches. To date, no fungal phylogeny based upon molecular characters has satisfied this criterion. Results: Using the translated amino acid sequences of the RPBI and RPB2 genes, we have inferred a fungal phylogeny that consists largely of well-supported monophyletic phyla. Our major results, each with significant statistical support, are: (1) Microsporidia are sister to kingdom Fungi and are not members of Zygomycota; that is, Microsporidia and fungi originated from a common ancestor. (2) Chytridiomycota, the only fungal phylum having a developmental stage with a flagellum, is paraphyletic and is the basal lineage. (3) Zygomycota is monophyletic based upon sampling of Trichomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Glomales. (4) Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota form a monophyletic group separate from Chytridiomycota. (5) Basidiomycota and Ascomycota are monophyletic sister groups. Conclusion: In general, this paper highlights the evolutionary position and significance of the lower fungi (Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota). Our results suggest that loss of the flagellum happened only once during early stages of fungal evolution; consequently, the majority of fungi, unlike plants and animals, are nonflagellated. The phylogeny we infer from gene sequences is the first one that is congruent with the widely accepted morphology-based classification of Fungi. We find that, contrary to what has been published elsewhere, the four morphologically defined phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota) do not overlap with one another. Microsporidia are not included within kingdom Fungi; rather they are a sister- group to the Fungi. Our study demonstrates the applicability of protein sequences from large, slowly-evolving genes to the derivation of well-resolved and highly supported phylogenies across long evolutionary distances.","Univ Washington, Dept Biol & Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Liu, YJJ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol & Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",yajuan@u.washington.edu; machrisod@gmail.com; benhall@u.washington.edu,,,,,,74,82,89,0,25,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2148,,,BMC EVOL BIOL,BMC Evol.

The programme was conceived to address a number of questions relating to the role of biodiversity in the ecological functioning of soils. It had six scientific aims, which in outline were: (i) to quantify the taxonomic diversity of key groups of the soil biota in a single ecosystem; (ii) to extend taxonomic understanding of the soil biota, especially to poorly characterised groups; (iii) to characterise the roles played by all major groups of the soil biota in the ecologically important process of the carbon cycle; (iv) to determine the extent to which depauperation of the soil biota may reduce its ability to perform essential ecosystem services; (v) to conduct parallel manipulations of major taxonomic groups of soil biota under controlled conditions; (vi) to determine the extent to which soil biodiversity is an indicator of soil ecosystem resilience. The research was focussed on a single, upland grassland site and combined both field studies and experiments in controlled laboratory conditions. We present the rationale for the study, provide information on the field site and the experimental design, and then give results of the background monitoring of both the soil chemistry and the botanical composition during the progress of the research. These changes reflect the results of the major treatments (N and Ca applied singly and in combination) in the experimental design. We briefly review the main achievements of the programme (such as understanding the outstanding diversity of the small soil organisms bacteria, protozoa, mycorrhizal fungi and nematodes - and the speed with which processes in the soil occur) and argue that the research has made substantial advances towards our understanding of both the extent and function of the biological diversity of soil ecosystems.

Established techniques for analysis of DNA and RNA were used to interrogate labelled biomass providing a unique in depth study of active microbial fractions. A key finding was the extensive role of mycorrhizal fungi in facilitating the flow of carbon into the soil microbial community.

An experiment was established in an upland grassland system to investigate the impact of addition of nitrogen and lime (NL) fertiliser on plant communities and the soil biota. The NL treatment increased above ground plant biomass and accelerated root returns to the soil, providing increased plant-derived energy for the soil food web. No changes were seen in fungal biomass, as indicated by PLFA, but bacterial biomass was reduced. However, the numbers of bacterial feeding and predatory nematodes increased in the NL treatment and may be masking the effects at the lower trophic levels, indicating top-down control mechanisms. Although the NL treatment changed nematode community structure, there was an overall depression in the abundance of nematodes. This decrease was likely to be related to soil moisture content, which was reduced significantly in the NL treatment by increased evapotranspiration due to the larger above ground biomass production. This study highlights the strong bottom-up control over the soil dwelling nematodes both in terms of driving changes in diversity and in modifying the soil physical environment.

Dramatic alterations made to these layers during earthworm invasion significantly change microbial community structure and therefore microbial activities such as C transformations. Understanding the impacts of earthworm invasion on the microbes themselves will give insight into earthworm effects on microbial activities. Bacterial and actinomycete communities in earthworm guts and casts have not been studied in environments recently invaded by earthworms. Earthworm invasion tended to decrease fungal species density and fungal species diversity and richness. The presence of earthworms decreased zygomycete species abundance probably due to disruption of fungal hyphae. Physical disruption of hyphae may also explain decreased mycorrhizal colonization rates, decreased mycorrhizal abundance and altered mycorrhizal morphology in the presence of earthworms. Mixing of organic layers into mineral soil during earthworm invasion tended to decrease microbial biomass in forest floor materials while increasing it in mineral soil. In newly invaded forest soils, microbial respiration and the metabolic quotient tended to decline. In forests where either the microbial community has had time to adapt to earthworm activities, or where the destruction of the forest floor is complete, as in invasions by the Asian Amynthas hawayanus, the presence of earthworms tends to increase the metabolic quotient indicating a shift to a smaller, more active microbial community.","Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; Univ Gottingen, Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","McLean, MA (reprint author), Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",lsmclean@isugw.indstate.edu,,,,,,86,54,61,1,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

We conducted a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of defoliation and soil fungi on competition between the invasive weed Centaurea solstitialis and C. solstitialis and Avena barbata, a naturalized Eurasian annual grass, and Nassella pulchra, a native California bunchgrass. Surprisingly, considering the explosive invasion of grasslands by C. solstitialis, Avena and Nassella were strong competitors and reduced the invader's biomass by 80.2% and 80.1% over all defoliation and soil fungicide treatments, respectively. However, our experiments were conducted in artificial environments where competition was probably accentuated. When fungicide was applied to the soil, the biomass of C. solstitialis was reduced in all treatment combinations, but reduction in the biomass of the invader had no corollary impact on the grasses. There was no overall effect of defoliation on the final biomass of C. solstitialis as the invader compensated fully for severe clipping. In fact, the directional trend of the clipping effect was +6.4% over all treatments after eight weeks. A significant neighbor x soil fungicide x clipping effect suggested that the compensatory response was the strongest without soil fungicide and when C. solstitialis was alone (+ 19%). Our key finding was that the compensatory response of C. solstitialis in all treatments was associated with an increase in the weed's negative effects on Nassella and Avena - there was a significant decrease in the total biomass of both grasses and the reproductive biomass of Avena in pots with clipped C. solstitialis. Our results were obtained in controlled conditions that may have been conducive to compensatory growth, but they suggest the existence of mechanisms that may allow C. solstitialis, like other Centaurea species, to resist herbivory.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Evolut Ecol & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",callaway@selway.umt.edu,,,,,,56,24,28,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Positive correlations between mycorrhizal colonization and shoot P concentration, and between total P uptake and total biomass were found under elevated CO2. The results suggested that the interspecific difference in CO2 response at low P availability was caused by the difference in CO2 response in mycorrhizae and P uptake.

Understanding these changes is challenging because there are complex interactions between 'direct' effects of N on plant physiology and soil biogeochemistry, and 'indirect' effects caused by changes in plant species composition. By planting high N and low N plant community compositions into high and low N deposition model terrestrial ecosystems we experimentally decoupled direct and indirect effects and quantified their contribution to changes in carbon, N and water cycling. Our results show that direct effects on plant growth dominate ecosystem response to N deposition, although long-term carbon storage is reduced under high N plant-species composition. These findings suggest that direct effects of N deposition on ecosystem function could be relatively strong in comparison with the indirect effects of plant community change.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Natl Environm Res Council, Ctr Populat Biol, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Osnabruck, Dept Biol & Chem, Div Ecol, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Lancaster, Soil & Ecosyst Ecol Lab, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Fachbereich Biol 10, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Manning, P (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Natl Environm Res Council, Ctr Populat Biol, Dept Biol Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",p.manning@imperial.ac.uk,"Ellis, Richard/A-9176-2008; Turan, Veysel/G-7722-2011; Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012; Manning, Peter/I-6523-2012; Bonkowski, Michael/C-3700-2013","Ellis, Richard/0000-0002-2690-9090; Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Manning, Peter/0000-0002-7940-2023; Bonkowski, Michael/0000-0003-2656-1183",,,,33,68,69,3,87,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Here, we examine the effects of AMF on plant community composition in experimental wetland plant communities, where the dominant plant species are non-mycorrhizal and subordinate plant species are colonized by AMF. We also assess how an important abiotic soil variable, depth to water table (soil saturation), might mediate the community-level effects of AMF. 2 In the low water table (un-saturated) treatment, above-ground plant biomass increased in the presence of AMF relative to the controls, while in the high water table treatment, biomass decreased with the presence of AMF. Contrary to predictions, plant diversity was unaffected by the presence of AMF in the low water table treatment, but significantly decreased in the presence of AMF in the high water table treatment. Changes in biomass and composition were driven by the interactions between the dominant non-mycorrhizal species Carex hystercina, and the remaining mycorrhizal plant species. 3 Our results indicate that AMF have the potential to influence plant community composition in calcareous fens and that these effects can be mediated by soil saturation. 4 This study has implications for understanding how established principles of above-ground/below-ground interactions from upland communities translate to wetland plant communities and for understanding how AMF function can be mediated by abiotic soil properties. Contrary to previous thought, AMF may be important drivers of plant community composition in wetland plant communities.","Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Wolfe, BE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bwolfe@oeb.harvard.edu,,,,,,34,35,36,1,42,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Because oak seeds are heavy, most germinate under parent trees where they compete for light and water. Animals disperse acorns to more distant sites, often in shrublands, contributing to the expansion of oak woodlands. While dispersed seeds escape from competition, they may lack access to mycorrhizal inoculum or to the common mycorrhizal network of oak woodlands. The purpose of this study was to determine whether small mammals eat hypogeous sporocarps and defecate fungal spores thus dispersing mycorrhizal inoculum in oak woodlands. Mycorrhizal fungi, particularly truffles, are not ""everywhere"" because they are obligately mycorrhizal on trees. In addition, hypogeous fungi remain below ground and do not release spores into the air, further inhibiting dispersal of inoculum. We collected 21 species of hypogeous fungi near Oregon white oaks and confirmed the mycorrhizal status of six species. We set live traps and captured three species of rodents, Microtus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus,and Reithrodontomys megalotis. Spores of twelve species of hypogeous fungi were in their fecal pellets. The diets of these small mammals differed in fungal composition indicating unique foraging strategies. We found that mycorrhizal communities on Oregon white oak saplings located in buck brush shrublands at distances away from mature trees included hypogeous species suggesting that small mammals disperse spores for mycorrhizal inoculum. Dispersal of mycorrhizal inoculum is an important consideration in restoration of oak habitats, in natural regeneration of oak communities, and in their possibilities for range expansion with global warming.","So Oregon State Coll, Dept Biol, Ashland, OR 97520 USA","Southworth, D (reprint author), So Oregon State Coll, Dept Biol, Ashland, OR 97520 USA.",southworth@sou.edu,,,,,,65,28,29,1,25,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,PULLMAN,"PO BOX 645020, PULLMAN, WA 99164-5910 USA",0029-344X,,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,FAL,2006,80,4,,,,,264,273,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,135LB,WOS:000244154000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Newingham, BA; Callaway, RM",,,,"Newingham, Beth A.; Callaway, Ragan M.",,,"Shoot herbivory on the invasive plant, Centaurea maculosa, does not reduce its competitive effects on conspecifics and natives",OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SPOTTED KNAPWEED; ROOT HERBIVORY; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; INSECT HERBIVORY; CARBON TRANSFER; GROWTH; RESPONSES; GRASS; OVERCOMPENSATION,"Herbivory can have negative, positive, or no effect on plants. However, insect biological control assumes that herbivory will negatively affect the weed and release natives from competition. Centaurea maculosa, an invader in North America, is tolerant to herbivory, and under some conditions, herbivory may increase its competitive effects on natives. Therefore, we investigated two hypotheses: 1) herbivory stimulates compensatory growth by C. maculosa, which increases its competitive effects, and 2) herbivory stimulates the allelopathic effect of C. maculosa. In the greenhouse, Trichoplusia ni shoot herbivory reduced C. maculosa biomass when shoot damage exceeded 40% of the total original leaf area. Conspecific neighbors had no effect on C. maculosa biomass, and the presence of the natives Festuca idahoensis and F. scabrella had a positive effect on C. maculosa. Neighbors did not alter the effects of shoot herbivory. More importantly, even intense shoot herbivory on C. maculosa did not benefit neighboring plants. In a field experiment, clipping 50% of C. maculosa aboveground biomass in the early summer and again in the late summer reduced final biomass by 40% at the end of the season; however, this clipping did not affect total biomass production or reproductive output. Festuca idahoensis neighbors did not increase the effects of clipping, and aboveground damage to C. maculosa did not release F. idahoensis from competition. In the greenhouse we used activated carbon to adsorb allelochemicals, which reduced the competitive effects of C. maculosa on F. idahoensis but not on F. scabrella or other C. maculosa. However, we found no increase in the allelopathic effects of C. maculosa after shoot herbivory. In summary, our results correspond with others indicating that exceptionally high intensities of herbivory are required to suppress C. maculosa growth and reproduction; however, even intense herbivory on C. maculosa does not insure that native bunchgrasses will benefit.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Newingham, BA (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",newingha@unlv.nevada.edu,,,,,,72,20,23,3,27,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2006,114,3,,,,,397,406,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,076WH,WOS:000239988300002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Willems, A",,,,"Willems, Anne",,,The taxonomy of rhizobia: an overview,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,1st International Meeting on Microbial Phosphate Solubilization,"JUL 16-19, 2002","Salamanca, SPAIN","Univ Salamanca, Consejo Super Investigac Cientif",,Agrobacterium; review; rhizobia; taxonomy,ROOT-NODULE BACTERIA; NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA; DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION; ADHAERENS CASIDA 1982; CICER-ARIETINUM L; SP-NOV; SP.

For this reason, we have analysed the ability to solubilize phosphate of a wide number of strains isolated from Cicer arietinum growing in several soils in Spain. The aim of this work was to analyse microbial populations nodulating chickpea, that are able to solubilize phosphates, using molecular techniques. In the present work we analyzed 19 strains isolated from effective nodules of C. arietinum growing in three soils from the North of Spain. Nineteen strains showed ability to solubilize phosphate in YED-P medium. These strains were separated into 4 groups according to the results obtained by 879F-RAPD fingerprinting. The 16S rDNA sequencing of a representative strain from each group allowed the identification of strains as belonging to the genus Mesorhizobium. Strains from groups I and II showed a 99.4% and 99.2% similarity with M. mediterraneum UPM-CA142(T), respectively. The strains from group III were related to M. tianshanense USDA 3592(T) at a 99.4% similarity level. Finally, the strain from group IV was related to M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) with a 99.3% similarity. The LMW RNA profiles confirmed these results. Strains from groups I and II showed an identical LMW RNA pro. le to that of M. mediterraneum UPM-CA142(T); the profile of strains from group III was identical to that of M. tianshanense USDA 3592(T) and the pro. le of strains from group IV was identical to that of M. ciceri USDA 3383(T). Different 879F-RAPD patterns were obtained for strains of the group I, group II and the M. mediterraneum type strain (UPM-CA142(T)). The 879-RAPD patterns obtained for group III also differed from the pattern shown by M. tianshanense USDA 3592(T) . Finally, the patterns between group IV and M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) were also different. These results suggest that groups I and II may be subspecies of M. mediterraneum, group III a subspecies of M. tianshanense and group IV a subspecies of M. ciceri. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to establish the taxonomic status of strains isolated in this study.","Univ Salamanca, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Lab 209, Salamanca 37007, Spain; CSIC, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol, Salamanca, Spain; Univ Salamanca, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Inst Hispano Luso Invest Agrarias, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Mateos, PF (reprint author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Lab 209, Edificio Dept Biol,Pl Doctores Reina S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",pfmg@usal.es,"Velazquez, Encarna/B-3669-2017; Peix, Alvaro/A-7196-2010; Rivas, Raul/B-1869-2017; Trujillo, Martha E./L-1763-2014; Mateos, Pedro/L-6001-2014","Velazquez, Encarna/0000-0002-5946-7241; Peix, Alvaro/0000-0001-5084-1586; Rivas, Raul/0000-0003-2202-1470; Trujillo, Martha E./0000-0002-9193-1673; Mateos, Pedro/0000-0003-1628-598X; Martinez-Molina, Eustoquio/0000-0002-0983-9780",,,,46,59,72,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2006,287,2-Jan,,,,,23,33,,10.1007/s11104-006-9062-y,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,103NC,WOS:000241892500004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Saiz, G; Green, C; Butterbach-Bahl, K; Kiese, R; Avitabile, V; Farrell, EP",,,,"Saiz, Gustavo; Green, Carly; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus; Kiese, Ralf; Avitabile, Valerio; Farrell, Edward P.",,,Seasonal and spatial variability of soil respiration in four Sitka spruce stands,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,1st International Meeting on Microbial Phosphate Solubilization,"JUL 16-19, 2002","Salamanca, SPAIN","Univ Salamanca, Consejo Super Investigac Cientif",,gley soil; organic layer thickness; seasonal variation; soil respiration; spatial variation; Sitka spruce chronosequence,CARBON-DIOXIDE EFFLUX; MIXED-HARDWOOD FOREST; CO2 EFFLUX; WATER CONTENT; PINE PLANTATION; ABIOTIC FACTORS; DOUGLAS-FIR; TEMPERATURE; ROOT; FLUX,"We investigated the causes for the seasonal and spatial variation of soil respiration in a first rotation Sitka spruce chronosequence composed of four age classes ( 10, 15, 31, and 47 year old) in Central Ireland. The study aimed at identifying easily determinable environmental parameters that explained the variation in soil respiration rates. The variation in temperature and soil water content influenced the seasonal trend observed in the spatial variability of soil respiration. The highest coefficients of variation in soil respiration were observed during autumn drought, while lower coefficients were generally observed during periods with highest soil respiration rates. On average, the sampling strategy of 30 sampling points per stand was adequate to obtain an average rate of soil respiration within 20% of its actual value at the 95% confidence level. Significantly higher soil respiration rates were observed at locations with high accumulation of organic matter and in collars established in close vicinity to tree stems. The organic layer thickness was the only variable that yielded significant regressions for explaining spatial variation in soil respiration in all the stands. Correlation analyses between the studied variables and soil respiration suggested the relative importance of heterotrophic and autotrophic components differed in their annual contribution to total soil respiration at each forest stand. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relative importance of primary temporal and spatial controls over soil respiration. Soil temperature and organic layer thickness explained most of the variance of soil respiration for the different sampling periods, while soil water content had a weaker effect as well as a different influence on soil respiration depending on the time of the year. The strong linear correlation between forest floor carbon and soil carbon stock further confirmed organic layer thickness as an integrative factor encompassing the effect of soil carbon pools on soil respiration. Moreover, its inclusion in the multiple regression analyses overrode the influence of both distance and fine root biomass. Overall, a multiple linear regression model driven by easily determinable environmental variables such as soil temperature, organic thickness, soil water content, soil bulk density, and soil organic carbon concentration allowed us to explain 54% of total variance of soil respiration over the different stand ages for the entire year P < 0.05). Our results show that the adoption of an adequate sampling strategy, and the determination of some key environmental variables may help to explain a large proportion of total variation of soil respiration over the entire rotation length of afforested ecosystems.","Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res Grp, Dublin 2, Ireland; Atmospher & Environm Res Inst Meteorol & Climate, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany","Saiz, G (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res Grp, Dublin 2, Ireland.",gustavo.saiz@ucd.ie,"Kiese, Ralf/A-7310-2013; Saiz, Gustavo/F-3994-2011; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Saiz, Gustavo/N-3849-2019","Saiz, Gustavo/0000-0001-7794-4403; Saiz, Gustavo/0000-0001-7794-4403",,,,43,97,113,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2006,287,2-Jan,,,,,161,176,,10.1007/s11104-006-9052-0,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,103NC,WOS:000241892500016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Oliveira, RS; Castro, PML; Dodd, JC; Vosatka, M",,,,"Oliveira, Rui S.; Castro, Paula M.

They also have different efficiencies in gathering phosphate from the soil. These differences in phosphate uptake and ERM length or architecture may contribute to differential growth responses of plants and this may be an important contributor to plant species coexistence. The effects of the development of the ERM of AMF on the coexistence of two co-occurring plant species were investigated in root-free hyphal chambers in a rhizobox experimental unit. The dominant shrub (Salix atrocinerea Brot.) and herbaceous (Conyza bilbaoana J. Remy) plant species found in a highly alkaline anthropogenic sediment were studied in symbiosis with four native AMF species ( Glomus intraradices BEG163, Glomus mosseae BEG198, Glomus geosporum BEG199 and Glomus claroideum BEG210) that were the most abundant members of the AMF community found in the sediment. Different AMF species did not influence total plant productivity (sum of the biomass of C. bilbaoana and S. atrocinerea), but had a great impact on the individual biomass of each plant species. The AMF species with greater extracted ERM lengths (G. mosseae BEG198, G. claroideum BEG210 and the four mixed AMF) preferentially benefited the plant species with a high mycorrhizal dependency (C. bilbaoana), while the AMF species with the smallest ERM length (G. geosporum BEG199) benefited the plant species with a low mycorrhizal dependency (S. atrocinerea). Seed production of C. bilbaoana was only observed in plants inoculated with G. mosseae BEG198, G. claroideum BEG210 or the mixture of the four AMF. Our results show that AMF play an important role in the reproduction of C. bilbaoana coexisting with S. atrocinerea in the alkaline sediment and have the potential to stimulate or completely inhibit seed production. The community composition of native AMF and the length of the mycelium they produce spreading from roots into the surrounding soil can be determinant of the coexistence of naturally co-occurring plant species.","Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal; Plant Works Ltd, Sittingbourne ME9 8HL, Kent, England; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Castro, PML (reprint author), Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, Rua Dr Antonio Bernardino Almeida, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal.",plcastro@esb.ucp.pt,"Castro, Paula ML/M-8241-2013","Castro, Paula ML/0000-0001-8841-6606; Vosatka, Miroslav/0000-0002-1378-3185; Oliveira, Rui S./0000-0001-5252-5595",,,,61,28,28,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2006,287,2-Jan,,,,,209,221,,10.1007/s11104-006-9067-6,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,103NC,WOS:000241892500020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Roldan, A; Carrasco, L; Caravaca, F",,,,"Roldan, A.; Carrasco, L.; Caravaca, F.",,,Stability of desiccated rhizosphere soil aggregates of mycorrhizal Juniperus oxycedrus grown in a desertified soil amended with a composted organic residue,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,aggregate stability; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; enzyme activity; Mediterranean shrubs; microbial biomass; organic amendment; soil drying and rewetting cycles,RECEIVING URBAN REFUSE; FUNGI; ROOTS; INOCULATION; INFECTION; GLOMALIN; BIOMASS; STRAIN,"Adequate soil structural stability favours the establishment and viability of a stable plant cover, protecting the soil against water erosion in desertified Mediterranean environments. We studied the effect of soil drying-rewetting, inoculation with a mixture of three exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, Glomus deserticola (Trappe, Bloss. & Menge) and Glomus mosseae (Nicol & Gerd.) Gerd. & Trappe) and addition of a composted organic residue on aggregate stabilisation of the rhizosphere soil of Juniperus oxycedrus. The AM fungi and composted residue produced similar increases in plant growth, independently of the water conditions. Under well-watered conditions, the highest percentages of stable aggregates were recorded in the amended soil, followed by the soil inoculated with AM fungi. Excepting microbial biomass C, the soil drying increased labile C fractions (water soluble C, water soluble and total carbohydrates), whereas the rewetting decreased significantly such C fractions. Desiccation caused a significant increase in aggregate stability of the rhizosphere soil of all plants, particularly in the amended and inoculated plants. In all treatments, the aggregates formed after soil drying were unstable, since, in the rewetting, they disappear, reaching the initial levels before soil drying. Our results suggest that the aggregation mechanisms developed by rhizosphere microbial community of the amended and inoculated plants under water stress can be particularly relevant in decertified soils exposed to long desiccation periods. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It was hypothesized that the lack of increase in fungal biomass was due to constraints on development of fungi with persistent hyphae such as lignocellulolytic basidiomycetes and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. With respect to the former group, the slow increase of the pool of lignocellulose-rich organic matter was expected to be the major constraint for their development. To study this, we enriched soil samples of one arable land, of two recently abandoned arable lands, of one older abandoned arable land and of heathland with carbon substrates that differed in composition (glucose, cellulose and sawdust). In addition, we combined the effect of carbon addition on fungal biomass development in arable and recently abandoned lands with inoculation of 1% of soil from the older abandoned site and the heathland. All treatments induced a fast increase and a subsequent rapid decline in fungal biomass in the arable and ex-arable fields. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns and enzyme activities did show differences between the carbon treatments but not between the recent and older abandoned field sites, indicating a similarly responding fungal community even after three decades of land abandonment and irrespective of soil inoculation. Identification of fungi by sequencing and culturing confirmed that decomposition processes were mostly dominated by opportunistic fungi in arable and ex-arable fields. In the heathland, only a very slow increase of microbial activity was observed after addition of carbon and sequencing of DGGE bands showed that ericoid mycorrhiza (ERM) fungi were responsible for carbon decomposition. We conclude that an increase of enduringly present fungal hyphae in ex-arable land may only be possible when a separate litter layer develops and/or when suitable host plants for ERM fungi become established.

We explore here the possibility of direct contributions of AMF to ecosystem C losses, namely via leaching of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP). We tested the hypothesis that GRSP, an operationally defined SOM pool to which AMF contribute (especially as evidenced with monoclonal antibody MAb32B11-based detection), is mobile in soils and can be lost in leachate. For two New Zealand soils, we showed that only insignificant amounts of GRSP were lost: a maximum of 0.03% of MAb32B11-immunoreactive GRSP present in soils was lost during the week-long experiment, representing a minute fraction of total leachate dissolved organic carbon (0.06%). Our data showed that this pathway of C loss may be relatively unimportant in many soils. However, other indirect contributions of AMF to soil C losses remain yet to be explored.

Rates of gross N mineralization in rhizosphere soil (9.2 mg N kg(-1)d(-1)) were about ten times higher than in bulk soil (1.0 mg N kg(-1)d(-1)). Total bacterial numbers in soil adjacent to roots were slightly higher than in bulk soil; protozoa biomass was not measurably different. Changes in bacterial numbers or standing stocks of bacterial N could not account for rates of N mineralization. Nitrification potential values were similar in bulk and rhizosphere soil, yet gross rates of nitrification were highly dependent on location along the root. Gross nitrification rates in soil near the root tip were the same as those in bulk soil, while rapid uptake of NH4 by older sections of root (8-16 cm from the tip), appeared to limit nitrification rates. Only small differences in microbial community structure between bulk and rhizosphere soil were detected by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. While the small increases in bacterial numbers and changes in community composition may in-part explain the increased rates of N mineralization, other microbial-root interactions are likely involved in accelerating the flux of N from organic sources to the plant-available NH4 pool. The high rates of N mineralization observed in soil immediately adjacent to roots should facilitate plant access to N. Most of the stocks and fluxes determined in these studies exhibited distinct spatial patterns along the plant root that may have significantly impacted N-availability to the plant.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Herman, DJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",skyhawk@nature.berkeley.edu,,,,,,45,86,101,1,71,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

In particular, we examined relationships that exist between leaf area, above-ground biomass, fine root surface area and fine root biomass using destructive harvesting techniques. Fine roots (< 5 mm) were sampled spatially and temporally using sequential coring and scaled to estimate total fine root biomass and total fine root surface area using a weighting technique.

Stand composition has also been altered as shade tolerant tree species crowd out shade intolerant species. To restore forest structure and reduce the risk of large, intense fires, managers have increasingly used prescription burning. Most fires prior to EuroAmerican settlement occurred during the late summer and early fall and most prescribed burning has taken place during the latter part of this period. Poor air quality and lack of suitable burn windows during the fall, however, have resulted in a need to conduct more prescription burning earlier in the season. Previous reports have suggested that burning during the time when trees are actively growing may increase mortality rates due to fine root damage and/or bark beetle activity. This study examines the effects of fire on tree mortality and bark beetle attacks under prescription burning during early and late season. Replicated early season burn, late season burn and unburned control plots were established in an old-growth mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada that had not experienced a fire in over 120 years. Although prescribed burns resulted in significant mortality of particularly the smallest tree size classes, no difference between early and late season burns was detected. Direct mortality due to fire was associated with fire intensity. Secondary mortality due to bark beetles was not significantly correlated with fire intensity. The probability of bark beetle attack on pines did not differ between early and late season burns, while the probability of bark beetle attack on firs was greater following early season burns. Overall tree mortality appeared to be primarily the result of fire intensity rather than tree phenology at the time of the burns. Early season burns are generally conducted under higher fuel moisture conditions, leading to less fuel consumption and potentially less injury to trees. This reduction in fire severity may compensate for relatively modest increases in bark beetle attack probabilities on some tree species, ultimately resulting in a forest structure that differs little between early and late season prescribed burning treatments.

From 2005 onwards, national GHG inventories should also provide uncertainty estimates of the reported emissions and removals. Comprehensive uncertainty analysis and key category analysis of the carbon inventory can provide guidance for prioritizing efforts in further development of the inventory. In this study, the estimates of the forest carbon stock and carbon sink were obtained by combining forest inventory data, models of biomass and turnover, and a dynamic decomposition model for SOM and litter, Yasso. To study the decisive factors affecting uncertainties of forest carbon sink and stock estimates, we conducted a Monte Carlo analysis for the calculation of the forest carbon budget of Finnish forests for the period 1989-2004. Uncertainty of the vegetation carbon sink was affected mostly by input data on growth variation and drain. Uncertainty of the soil carbon sink was dominated by the soil model initialization, but the effect decreased with time. After few years, the effect of initialization leveled with the effect of temperature and drain, both of which were given as input data to the system and which varied inter-annually. The contribution of these variables was less important to uncertainty of stocks in vegetation and soil than the contribution of model parameters. The most influential parameters for vegetation C stock were carbon density and conversion factors for tree and ground vegetation biomass, and for soil C stock, they were soil model parameters, and biomass conversion factors and turnover rates of fine roots and ground vegetation. After short initialization period for soil C, uncertainty of soil sink can be reduced by improving the precision of input data (harvests on upland soils, annual temperature). Precision of vegetation sink can be improved mainly by improving the quality of input data on growth variation and harvests. There is an unknown error source related to inter-annual variability of the forest ecosystems, which cannot be represented with the system. Vegetation sink was compiled with biomass models that are based on long-term averages and they do not support year-to-year variations which may occur in forest ecosystems. Averaged biomass models with averaged turnover models, produce highly auto-correlated series of litter input, which result in relatively precise annual soil sink estimates. Due to these reasons, the current inventory-based approach is more justified for the estimation of average sinks for longer periods than I year. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, a full 'invasional meltdown', in which interspecific facilitation leads to an accelerating increase in the number of introduced species and their impact, has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. The great majority of suggested instances of 'invasional meltdown' remain simply plausible scenarios of long-term consequences based on short-term observations of facilitatory interactions between individuals of two species. There is a particular dearth of proven instances in which two invasive species each enhance the impact and/or probability of establishment and spread of the other. By contrast, in many authenticated cases, at least one partner is aided. The metaphor of meltdown focused attention on facilitation in invasion and has probably helped inspire recent studies. As have other metaphors from invasion biology and other sciences, 'meltdown' has struck a responsive chord with writers for the lay public; some have stretched it well beyond its meaning as understood by invasion biologists. There is no evidence that this hyperbole has impeded scientific understanding or caused loss of scientific credibility.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Simberloff, D (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dsimberloff@utk.edu,,,,,,59,285,301,10,227,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Senescent ectomycorrhizal roots represent a large input of carbon into soils, but their fate remains unknown. Here, we present the surprising result that, despite much higher nitrogen concentrations, roots colonized by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi lost only one-third as much carbon as non-mycorrhizal roots after 2 years of decomposition in a pinon pine (Pinus edulis) woodland. Experimentally excluding live mycorrhizal hyphae from litter, we found that live mycorrhizal hyphae may alter nitrogen dynamics, but the afterlife (litter-mediated) effects of EM fungi outweigh the influences of live fungi on root decomposition. Our findings indicate that a shift in plant allocation to mycorrhizal fungi could promote carbon accumulation in soil by this pathway. Furthermore, EM litters could directly contribute to the process of stable soil organic matter formation, a mechanism that has eluded soil scientists.","Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Res, Dept Biol Sci Merriam Powell, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Langley, JA (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",langleya@si.edu,"Hungate, Bruce/F-8991-2011","Hungate, Bruce/0000-0002-7337-1887",,,,28,96,106,3,85,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Throughout arid regions of the world, groundwater is extracted for human population centres. In the Great Basin and Range region of the USA, we lack basic information regarding some plant communities detailing the extent to which vegetation is threatened by groundwater extraction. This is particularly true for alkali meadow vegetation, which is restricted to zones of shallow groundwater yet is not a riparian plant community with obligate wetland properties. 2. To increase our understanding of the relative importance of groundwater and precipitation in maintaining alkali meadow vegetation cover, we used a 16-year record of plant cover derived from satellite data of Owens Valley, California, USA, in conjunction with concurrent depth-to-water and precipitation measurements, to analyse vegetation response to anthropogenic and climatic changes in water availability. 3. Groundwater decline varied from 0.5 to 5.0 m throughout the study area, with the largest changes occurring at sites closest to pumping wells. The entire region experienced a 6-year drought (1987-92), during which annual precipitation remained below the 50-year median. 4. Meadow plant cover over the 16-year study period was correlated with groundwater depth, but plant cover was generally unresponsive to annual precipitation variability. Sensitivity to groundwater decline was greatest for plots with a higher cover of herbaceous perennials. 5. The results showed that this plant community is groundwater dependent, and that this characteristic buffers the system from the effects of drought. However, at sites with extensive groundwater decline, the remaining plant cover became weakly correlated with precipitation only after groundwater declined below a threshold depth located at 2.5 m, representing the average plant rooting depth. 6. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable water development that seeks to pump groundwater without adversely affecting vegetation cover and plant assemblages must recognize the maximum rooting depth of groundwater-dependent plant species. When groundwater is within the root zone, management decisions can be made to either increase or decrease vegetation cover through modification of groundwater depth. When groundwater is below the root zone, vegetation cover is low and susceptible to changes in precipitation. Quantitative satellite measurements of vegetation cover might aid the monitoring and sustainable management of water resources.","Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Inyo Cty Hlth Dept, Bishop, CA 93514 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Elmore, AJ (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, 6182 Steele Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",Andrew@elmore.cc,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009; Elmore, Andrew/D-4341-2012","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Elmore, Andrew/0000-0002-9697-9457",,,,47,71,77,2,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

A greenhouse experiment was done to determine whether there are feedbacks between N-altered soil inoculum and growth of a dominant native shrub and an invasive grass species in southern California. The region is experiencing large-scale loss of Artemisia californica shrublands and replacement by invasive annual grasses under N deposition. Artemisia californica and Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens were grown with soil inoculum from experimental plots in a low N deposition site that had (1) N-fertilized and (2) unfertilized soil used for inoculum, as well as (3) high-N soil inoculum from a site exposed to atmospheric N deposition for four decades. All treatments plus a nonmycorrhizal control were given two levels of N fertilizer solution. A. californica biomass was reduced by each of the three inocula compared to uninoculated controls under at least one of the two N fertilizer solutions. The inoculum from the N-deposition site caused the greatest growth depressions. By contrast, B. madritensis biomass increased with each of the three inocula under at least one, or both, of the N solutions. The different growth responses of the two plant species may be related to the types of AM fungal colonization. B. madritensis was mainly colonized by a fine mycorrhizal endophyte, while A. californica had primarily coarse endophytes. Furthermore, A. californica had a high level of septate, nonmycorrhizal root endophytes, while B. madritensis overall had low levels of these endophytes. The negative biomass response of A. californica seedlings to high N-deposition inoculum may in part explain its decline; a microbially-mediated negative feedback may occur in this system that causes poor seedling growth and establishment of A. californica in sites subject to N deposition and B. madritensis invasion.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Allen, EB (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",edith.allen@ucr.edu,,,,,,65,31,33,1,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2006,286,2-Jan,,,,,153,165,,10.1007/s11104-006-9034-2,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,084SX,WOS:000240555800013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Halvorson, JJ; Gonzalez, JM",,,,"Halvorson, Jonathan J.; Gonzalez, Javier M.",,,"Bradford reactive soil protein in Appalachian soils: distribution and response to incubation, extraction reagent and tannins",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomalin; Bradford reactive soil protein; BSRP; extractants; tannins; soil carbon; soil nitrogen,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; HUMIC-LIKE SUBSTANCES; AGGREGATE STABILITY; GLOMALIN PRODUCTION; FLOODPLAIN SOILS; FOREST SOILS; CARBON; NITROGEN; TILLAGE; HYPHAE,"Bradford reactive soil protein (BRSP) is thought to correlate to glomalin, an important soil glycoprotein that promotes soil aggregate formation and may represent a significant pool of stable soil organic matter (SOM). However, more information is needed about its importance in Appalachian soils and its relationships with other soil properties. We measured BRSP in 0-20 cm soil from pastures, hayfields, cultivated fields or forest areas in southern West Virginia. Highest amounts of BRSP were found near the soil surface and decreased significantly with depth for all land uses except cultivated sites. Forest and pasture sites contained more BRSP than hayfields or cultivated fields but these differences occurred only in the 0-5 cm depth. Overall averages of C and N in BRSP represented about 4.0 and 6.5% of the total soil C and N respectively. During a 395 day soil incubation, we found CO2-C evolution rates comparable to other studies but only small changes in BRSP (< 10%) including some evidence for increases during incubation. Sodium citrate, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium oxalate recovered significantly more BRSP from soil than the other extractants we tested with highest extraction efficiencies observed for sodium citrate and pyrophosphate. Recovery of BRSP appears related to negative charge and buffering capacity of both the soil and extractant. Extractants with low negative charge had little buffering capacity and yielded little BRSP. Tannic acid appeared to increase extraction of BRSP but less soluble-N was recovered from tannin-treated samples than from untreated controls and E4/E6, the ratio of absorbance at 465 and 665 nm, decreased, evidence for the formation of larger or heavier molecules. Formation of dark-colored substances during extraction suggests the colorimetric Bradford assay may overestimate soil protein when tannins are present. Recovery of less soluble-N from soil extracts and lower E4/E6 ratios suggests tannins may bind with soil constituents themselves or form non-extractable N-containing complexes.","USDA ARS, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, Beaver, WV 25813 USA","Halvorson, JJ (reprint author), USDA ARS, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, 1224 Airport Rd, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",Jonathan.Halvorson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,58,27,32,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2006,286,2-Jan,,,,,339,356,,10.1007/s11104-006-9047-x,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,084SX,WOS:000240555800026,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rosier, CL; Hoye, AT; Rillig, MC",,,,"Rosier, Carl L.; Hoye, Andrew T.; Rillig, Matthias C.",,,Glomalin-related soil protein: Assessment of current detection and quantification tools,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomalin; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; ELISA; Bradford method; monoclonal antibody,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; BOVINE SERUM-ALBUMIN; ANTIBODY-BASED ELISA; TRICHODERMA-HARZIANUM; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; AGGREGATE STABILITY; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; ALPHA-LACTALBUMIN,"Despite the widely acknowledged importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soil ecology, quantifying their biomass and presence in field soils is hindered by tedious techniques. Hence biochemical markers may be useful, among which glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) could show a particular promise. Presently GRSP is operationally defined, its identification resting solely on the methods used to extract it from soil (citric acid buffer and autoclaving) and the assays (Bradford/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody) utilized to detect it. The current assumption is that most non-heat stable soil proteins except glomalin are destroyed during the harsh extraction procedure. However, this critical assumption has not been tested. The purpose of this research was to challenge the GRSP extraction process to determine the accuracy of the Bradford method as a measure of glomalin; and to provide some assessment of the specificity of the ELISA monoclonal antibody. In two studies we spiked soil samples either with known quantities of a glycoprotein (BSA: bovine serum albumin) or with leaf litter from specific sources. After extraction 41-84% of the added BSA was detected with the Bradford method. This suggests that the currently used extraction procedure does not eliminate all non-glomalin proteins. Also, ELISA cross-reactivity against BSA was limited, ranging from 3% to 14%. Additions of leaf litter also significantly influenced GRSP extraction and quantification suggesting that plant-derived proteins, as would occur in the field, had a similar effect as BSA. Litter additions decreased the immunoreactive protein values, suggesting interference with antibody recognition. We conclude that the use of GRSP, especially Bradford-based detection, in the assessment of AMF-derived substances within field soils is problematic, it may be inappropriate in situations of significant organic matter additions.

In a comparative field study on seasonal soil-plant water dynamics of two exotic species (Cupressus lisitanica Mill. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and the indigenous Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Mirb. in south Ethiopia, we combined a 2.5-year record for climate and soil water availability, natural-abundance oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of soil and xylem water, destructive root sampling and transpiration measurements. Soil was generally driest under C. lusitanica with its dense canopy and shallow root system, particularly following a relatively low-rainfall wet season, with the wettest soil under E. globulus. Wet season transpiration of C lusitanica was twice that of the other species. In the dry season, P.falcatus and C. lusitanica reduced transpiration by a factor of six and two, respectively, whereas E. globulus showed a fivefold increase. In all species, there was a shift in water uptake to deeper soil layers as the dry season progressed, accompanied by relocation of live fine root biomass (LFR) of C lusitanica and P. falcatus to deeper layers. Under R falcatus, variability in soil matric potential, narrow delta O-18 depth gradients and high LFR indicated fast water redistribution. Subsoil water uptake was important only for E. globulus, which had low topsoil LFR and tap roots exploiting deep water. Although P.falcatus appeared better adapted to varying soil water availability than the exotic species, both conifers decreased growth substantially during dry weather. Growth of L globulus was largely independent of topsoil water content, giving it the potential to cause substantial dry-season groundwater depletion.","Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, D-06099 Halle, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Inst Soil Sci & Soil Geog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Univ Bayreuth, Inst Plant Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Isotope Hydrogeol, D-06120 Halle, Germany","Fritzsche, F (reprint author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, D-06099 Halle, Germany.",florian.fritzsche@landw.uni-halle.de,"Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013","Guggenberger, Georg/0000-0002-6962-8264",,,,67,39,41,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2006,26,8,,,,,1043,1054,,10.1093/treephys/26.8.1043,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,067TW,WOS:000239326500008,16651254,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Falkiner, RA; Nambiar, EKS; Polglase, PJ; Theiveyanathan, S; Stewart, LG",,,,"Falkiner, R.

One central biophysical issue which determines the effectiveness of trees to control groundwater is the ability of trees to grow roots through degraded soils and take up groundwater. We investigated the effect of soil properties, especially the presence of shallow watertables and site preparation practice, on the vertical and horizontal distributions of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden and Corymbia maculata (Hook.) K.D. Hill and L.A.S. Johnson roots. In order to improve the reliability of root data, we measured root growth and distribution by three different methods - (i) number of roots intercepting the vertical plane of the soil profile, (ii) root length density in soil cores taken at different depths but in the horizontal plane of the profile, and (iii) root length density in soil cores in the vertical plane at different radial positions from trees and compared the results. Two experimental sites were established in flood-irrigated, farm forestry plantations on contrasting soils in the Murray Riverina region of south-eastern Australia. At one site (Norwood Park), we studied a 58-month-old stand of E. grandis growing in clay loam overlaying medium clay, saline, sodic and alkaline subsoil with a saline (11.5 dS m(-1)) watertable at 2.8 m depth. Here, there were few roots growing above the watertable. The Karawatha site had adjacent stands of 46-month old E. grandis and C. maculata growing in a sandy, neutral and non-saline soil with a shallow (3.1 m deep) non-saline (2.8 dS m(-1)) watertable. Here roots proliferated above the watertable in both species but to a much greater extent under C. maculata than under E. grandis. Root distributions in the surface soil were similar at all sites but differences in root growth in the capillary zones paralleled differences in groundwater uptake by trees. We conclude (i) that appropriate matching of species with site characteristics, especially soil and groundwater properties, will enhance tree growth and groundwater uptake and (ii) that extensive planting of C. maculata over non-saline watertables maximises the chances of achieving the multiple objectives of regional groundwater control, fast growth rates and reduced irrigation demand.","CSIRO, Ensis, Canberra, ACT 2604, Australia","Falkiner, RA (reprint author), CSIRO, Ensis, POB E4008, Canberra, ACT 2604, Australia.",randall.falkiner@csiro.au,,,,,,25,10,16,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Two glasshouse experiments were conducted using compartmented pots. The first investigated the effects of distance between a colonised and uncolonised host plant (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and average pore size of the growth substrate (100 mu m, 38 mu m) on the ability of two AM fungi, G. intraradices and G. mosseae, to colonise a new host plant. The second experiment determined if the pore size of the substrate (100 mu m, 38 mu m) affected the growth of AM fungi in the absence of a new host. In Experiment 1, both G. mosseae and G. intraradices grew successfully through the two sand substrates and colonised new host plants. Both fungi reached and colonised new hosts fastest when hosts were separated by the shortest distance (2.5 cm), with largest pore size substrate (100 mu m). G. mosseae produced more external hyphae per unit of colonised root and colonised new host plants more rapidly than G. intraradices. However, receiver plants colonised by G. mosseae exhibited a negative mycorrhizal growth response following colonisation. Experiment 2 showed that G. mosseae grew further from its host than G. intraradices. The results support the theory that some AM fungal species may produce large amounts of external hyphae primarily to increase the probability of locating and colonising a new host plant.

Seeds and root nodules were sampled from 10 sites. Twenty-seven rhizobial strains were isolated from root nodules and characterized as fast-growers and slime-producers on yeast mannitol agar. By partial sequencing of the gene coding for the 16 S ribosomal RNA, they were found to be affiliated to Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Agrobacterium but several strains had sequences with separate positions. Interestingly one of these was further assigned to Phyllobacterium. Opposite to rhizobia, the distribution of the two Medicago species varied along the salinity gradient, M. ciliaris being dominant in the low NaCl concentration zones and M. polymorpha dominant in the most saline zones. Tolerance to salinity, of both bacterial and plant partners, was studied under laboratory conditions, showing that plants are susceptible to NaCl concentrations of 50mM, 15-fold lower than that of their associated rhizobia (800mM).","LSTM, UMR113, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France","de Lajudie, P (reprint author), LSTM, UMR113, TA 10-J,Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",P-De.Lajudie@mpl.ird.fr,"Bailly, Xavier/C-6254-2011; de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008; Avarre, Jean-Christophe/E-4170-2019","Bailly, Xavier/0000-0001-6959-7974; de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352; Bena, Gilles/0000-0003-3080-8441; Avarre, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6899-7052",,,,30,3,5,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,1532-4990,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

Sampling took place at two locations of differing postfire ages and nine 100-m(2) plots were sampled per location. The dominant overstory tree species in the plots were trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) or white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss], and balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.]. Mycorrhizae were analyzed using morphological as well as molecular methods, employing fungal-specific primers to amplify ribosomal DNA for subsequent cloning and sequencing. A total of 1800 mycorrhizal. root tips collected from the 18 plots were morphologically classified into 26 morphotypes, with Cenococcum geophilum dominating (36% of root tips). A second set of root tips, selected from the same 18 samples on which the morphological analysis was based, were analyzed using molecular methods. From this analysis, 576 cloned polymerase chain reaction products were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and a total of 207 unique types were found. No one type dominated the system and 159 occurred only once. Sequence analysis of the types that occurred more than once revealed that Piloderma sp., Russula sp., Cortinarius sp., and Lactarius sp. were the most common mycorrhizae. The ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure revealed by the rDNA analysis differed from that observed using morphological methods. Canonical correspondence analyses of the sequenced restriction types and % overstory composition indicate that the distributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi are influenced by the relative proportions of host tree species. The distinct fungal assemblages found in the different plots supported by the different combinations of host tree species provides further support for the need to conserve stand diversity in the southern boreal forest.","Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, GREFi, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Widden, P (reprint author), Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, GREFi, 7100 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",widdenp@vax2.concordia.ca,,,,,,72,46,47,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Several large, bare roadcuts exist in the North Coast Ranges along the west coast of California, USA. Substrate was collected from a large roadcut that has remained barren for more than a decade despite conventional surface amendment with NPK fertilizer and seeding with a mix including nonserpentine grasses and herbs. Although serpentine plant communities have been studied globally in great detail, very little information exists on how to effectively restore these communities after drastic disturbance (removal of topsoil and loss of biological activity). This rhizotron study examined how surface layering and mixing yard waste compost into serpentine substrate affected biomass production, rooting distribution, and tolerance of native, as well as invasive grass species that grow on serpentine. Roots of less serpentine-tolerant species became necrotic upon contact with the serpentine substrate in the layered compost application treatment. The roots of highly serpentine-tolerant species, however, displayed a superior tolerance to the serpentine substrate and were able to grow through its entire depth. Mixing the compost into the serpentine substrate significantly improved the Ca content of the growing medium, allowing the less serpentine-tolerant species to root through the entire depth. Although the compost surface layer treatment promoted growth of the highly serpentine-tolerant species in the serpentine substrate, mixing the compost amendment into the substrate would also permit additional desirable revegetation species to become established.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","O'Dell, RE (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",reodell@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,42,6,6,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2006,285,2-Jan,,,,,19,29,,10.1007/s11104-005-8361-z,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,084KQ,WOS:000240532200003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ouahmane, L; Duponnois, R; Hafidi, M; Kisa, M; Boumezouch, A; Thioulouse, J; Plenchette, C",,,,"Ouahmane, L.; Duponnois, R.; Hafidi, M.; Kisa, M.; Boumezouch, A.; Thioulouse, J.; Plenchette, C.",,,Some Mediterranean plant species (Lavandula spp. and Thymus satureioides) act as potential 'plant nurses' for the early growth of Cupressus atlantica,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Cupressus atlantica; degraded forest ecosystems; microbial catabolic diversity; nurse plant; restoration ecology; revegetation strategies,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; SHRUB-STEPPE; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; RHIZOSPHERE; VEGETATION; ISLANDS; DESERT,"The mycorrhizal status of several representative shrub species (Lavandula spp. and Thymus satureioides) in Moroccan semiarid ecosystems, was evaluated as well as their contribution to the mycorrhizal potential of the soil. Furthermore, the rhizosphere soils collected under these target species were tested for their influence on the growth of Cupressus atlantica, a tree species whose natural stands has declined in this area. Soil samples were collected from the rhizosphere of L. stoechas, L. dentata and of C. atlantica existing in the experimental area. Control samples were randomly collected from bare soil sites, away from plant influence. All the target species formed AM symbiosis and the extent of AM fungal colonization was not significantly different between plant species. No significant difference was detected between the total number of AM fungal spores of the bare soil and those recorded in the root zones of target species and C. atlantica. Three genera of AM fungi (Scutellospora, Glomus and Acaulospora) were present in the rhizospheres of the plant species and in the bare soil. The number of mycorrhizal propagules in soil originating from around the four target plant species was significantly higher than the one in the bare soil (Figure 1). The most probable number (MPN) of mycorrhizal propagules per 100 g of dry soil ranged from 7.82 (bare soil) to 179.7 (L. dentata and C. atlantica) and 244.5 (L. stoechas and T. satureioides). As the total number of spores was not different for the soil of different origins, the increase of the mycorrhizal soil infectivity (MSI) mainly resulted from larger AM mycelial networks that constituted the main source of AM fungal inoculum. In addition, this MSI enhancement was linked with changes in the functioning of soil microbial communities. In a glasshouse experiment, the growth of C. atlantica seedlings was significantly higher in the C. atlantica and in the shrub species soils than in the bare soil. Although the AM inoculum potential is not sufficient to ensure the development of forest trees in Mediterranean ecosystems, the use of plant nurses such as T. satureioides or Lavandula spp. could be of great interest to restore a self-sustaining vegetation cover to act against desertification.","INRA, UMR BGA, F-21034 Dijon, France; Univ Cadi Ayyad, Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco; Direct Reg Eaux & Forets Haut Atlas, Marrakech, Morocco; IRD, UMR113, CIRAD, INRA,IRD,AGRO M,UM2,LSTM, Montpellier, France; Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69365 Lyon, France; INRA, UMR BGA, F-21034 Dijon, France","Plenchette, C (reprint author), INRA, UMR BGA, F-21034 Dijon, France.",christian.plenchette@dijon.inra.fr,"HAFIDI, Mohamed/AAA-9508-2019; Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016","HAFIDI, Mohamed/0000-0001-6049-8398; lahcen, ouahmane/0000-0002-7378-549X; Thioulouse, Jean/0000-0001-7664-0598",,,,70,22,27,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUL,2006,185,1,,,,,123,134,,10.1007/s11258-005-9089-9,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,056DQ,WOS:000238501900011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bradley, K; Drijber, RA; Knops, J",,,,"Bradley, Kate; Drijber, Rhae A.; Knops, Jean",,,Increased N availability in grassland soils modifies their microbial communities and decreases the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; fame; microbial community composition; nitrogen fertilization; grasslands,FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; METHYL-ESTER PROFILES; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; SEMIARID GRASSLANDS; PLANT; BIOMASS; FIELD; ALLOCATION; BACTERIA; ALTERS,"Two complementary studies were performed to examine (1) the effect of 18 years of nitrogen (N) fertilization, and (2) the effects of N fertilization during one growing season on soil microbial community composition and soil resource availability in a grassland ecosystem. N was added at three different rates: 0, 5.44, and 27.2g N m(-2) y(-1). In both studies, Schizachyrium scoparium was the dominant plant species before N treatments were applied. Soil microbial communities from each experiment were characterized using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Discriminant analysis of the FAMEs separated the three N fertilizer treatments in both experiments, indicating shifts in the composition of the microbial communities. In general, plots that received N fertilizer at low or high application rates for 18 years showed increased proportions of bacterial FAMEs and decreased fungal FAMEs. In particular, control plots contained a significantly higher proportion of fungal FAMEs C18:1(cis9) and C18:2(cis9,12) and of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) FAME, C16:1 (cis11), than both of the N addition treatment plots. A significant negative effect of N fertilization on the AMF FAME, C16:1 (cis11), was measured in the short-term experiment. Our results indicate that high rates of anthropogenic N deposition can lead to significant changes in the composition of soil microbial communities over short periods and can even disrupt the relationship between AMF and plants.

A multi-year study was conducted in outdoor sun-lit controlled-environment chambers containing a reconstructed ponderosa pine/soil-litter system. The study used a 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of CO2 and two levels of O-3 and three replicates of each treatment. The objectives of our study were to assess the effects of long-term exposure to elevated CO2 and O-3, singly and in combination, on soil respiration, fine root growth and soil organisms. Fine root growth and soil organisms were included in the study as indicators of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration. The study evaluated three hypotheses: (1) elevated CO2 will increase C assimilation and allocation belowground increasing soil respiration; (2) elevated O-3 will decrease C assimilation and allocation belowground decreasing soil respiration and (3) as elevated CO2 and O-3 have opposing effects on C assimilation and allocation, elevated CO2 will eliminate or reduce the negative effects of elevated O-3 on soil respiration. A mixed-model covariance analysis was used to remove the influences of soil temperature, soil moisture and days from planting when testing for the effects of CO2 and O-3 on soil respiration. The covariance analysis showed that elevated CO2 significantly reduced the soil respiration while elevated O-3 had no significant effect. Despite the lack of a direct CO2 stimulation of soil respiration, there were significant interactions between CO2 and soil temperature, soil moisture and days from planting indicating that elevated CO2 altered soil respiration indirectly. In elevated CO2, soil respiration was more sensitive to soil temperature changes and less sensitive to soil moisture changes than in ambient CO2. Soil respiration increased more with days from planting in elevated than in ambient CO2. Elevated CO2 had no effect on fine root biomass but increased abundance of culturable bacteria and fungi suggesting that these increases were associated with increased C allocation belowground. Elevated CO2 had no significant effect on microarthropod and nematode abundance. Elevated O-3 had no significant effects on any parameter except it reduced the sensitivity of soil respiration to changes in temperature.

AMF activity was measured by the mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP), mycorrhizal fungal hyphal length (HL), easily extractable and total Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP). AMF diversity was represented by richness, Shannon diversity index and number of spores. Orchards reduced the MIP of the soil and increased the HL when compared to the grassland site. The amount of easily extractable BRSP was not different among orchards and between seasons evaluated, with overall mean value of 1.23 mg g(-1). However, the amount of total-BRSP was smaller in the conventional orchard (4.55 mg g(-1)) than in the organic orchard (4.91 mg g(-1)) and in the native grassland (5.12 mg g(-1)). T-BRSP and total organic carbon were strongly correlated in the grassland during the winter, suggesting the contribution of this protein for carbon stocks in the native soil of this region. The organic orchard presented the highest AMF richness, but sporulation and Shannon diversity index were larger in the conventional orchard. Our data suggest that the conventional orchard promoted higher impacts on the natural condition of AMF activity, being considered an unadvisable practice to soil conservation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study the effect of Pinus sylvestris seedlings and the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme on a number of biogeochemical variables, mainly related to labile carbon pools was investigated. The impact of K limitation as a potential regulatory factor was also examined. Columns filled with E horizon +/- plants and +/- mycorrhizal fungi were incubated for 18.5 months. The results demonstrate that plants, as well as mycorrhizal fungi, significantly increased the concentrations of some simple organic acids, including oxalate, in soil solution. Observations for dissolved organic carbon were slightly contradictory but the cumulative amount found in drainage water was similar to 20% higher in planted versus non-planted columns. Soil from planted treatments also showed more rapid mineralisation kinetics for oxalate. However carbon utilization (mineralisation vs. biomass) of oxalate and glucose by the soil microbial biomass was less influenced by plants. At harvest a component integration study of soil autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was performed which revealed that both plant and mycorrhiza had a positive effect on the heterotrophic respiration. Potassium omission had little effect on the variables studied with the exception of the maximum mineralisation rate for oxalate, which increased when K was withdrawn. The results are discussed in the context of the dynamics of labile soil carbon pools and ecosystem C fluxes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated grazing by larvae of Tipula paludosa on colonization of Agrostis capillaris by two species of fungi, Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices. Host plants were subjected to 7 days of grazing only, continuous grazing for 42 days, or no herbivory. Those plants with no herbivory had significantly lower levels of colonization by arbuscules and hyphae compared to plants which were grazed for 7 or 42 days. The effect only occurred in the upper parts of the root system, where larvae were active. We suggest that this effect was most likely mediated by a change in quantity and composition of root exudates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To compute specific rhizosphere respiration, temperature corrections were made with either species-specific coefficients (Q(10)) based on the observed change in respiration rate between 15 and 21 degrees C or an arbitrarily assigned Q(10) of 2. Estimated, species-specific Q(10) values were 3.0 and 3.4 for A. saccharum and B. alleghaniensis, respectively, and did not vary with light regime. Using either method of temperature correction, specific rhizosphere respiration did not differ either between A. saccharum and B. alleghaniensis, or among light regimes except in A. saccharum at 6% of full daylight. At this irradiance, seedlings were smaller than in the other light treatments, with a larger fine root fraction of total root dry mass, resulting, in higher respiration rates. Specific rhizosphere respiration was significantly higher during the afternoon than at other times of day when temperature-corrected on the basis of an arbitrary Q(10) of 2, suggesting the possibility of diurnal variation in a temperature-independent component of rhizosphere respiration.","Univ Quebec, GREFi, Montreal, PQ H3P 3P8, Canada; INRA, UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, UMR 1137, Equipe Bioclimatol Ecophysiol Phytoecol, F-54280 Champenoux, France; INRA, UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, UMR 1137, Equipe Ecophysiol Cellulaire & Mol, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Delagrange, S (reprint author), Univ Quebec, GREFi, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3P 3P8, Canada.",delagrange.sylvain@courrier.uqam.ca,,"DREYER, Erwin/0000-0003-4999-5072",,,,47,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,2006,26,7,,,,,925,934,,10.1093/treephys/26.7.925,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,057XM,WOS:000238628500009,16585038,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Mitchell, CE; Agrawal, AA; Bever, JD; Gilbert, GS; Hufbauer, RA; Klironomos, JN; Maron, JL; Morris, WF; Parker, IM; Power, AG; Seabloom, EW; Torchin, ME; Vazquez, DP",,,,"Mitchell, Charles E.; Agrawal, Anurag A.; Bever, James D.; Gilbert, Gregory S.; Hufbauer, Ruth A.; Klironomos, John N.; Maron, John L.; Morris, William F.; Parker, Ingrid M.; Power, Alison G.; Seabloom, Eric W.; Torchin, Mark E.; Vazquez, Diego P.",,,Biotic interactions and plant invasions,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,INCREASED COMPETITIVE ABILITY; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENEMY RELEASE HYPOTHESIS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; AMMOPHILA-ARENARIA; INTRODUCED POPULATIONS; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; HERBIVOROUS INSECTS; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; CENTAUREA-MACULOSA,"Introduced plant populations lose interactions with enemies, mutualists and competitors from their native ranges, and gain interactions with new species, under new abiotic conditions. From a biogeographical perspective, differences in the assemblage of interacting species, as well as in abiotic conditions, may explain the demographic success of the introduced plant populations relative to conspecifics in their native range. Within invaded communities, the new interactions and conditions experienced by the invader may influence both its demographic success and its effects on native biodiversity. Here, we examine indirect effects involving enemies, mutualists and competitors of introduced plants, and effects of abiotic conditions on biotic interactions. We then synthesize ideas building on Darwin's idea that the kinds of new interactions gained by an introduced population will depend on its relatedness to native populations. This yields a heuristic framework to explain how biotic interactions and abiotic conditions influence invader success. We conclude that species introductions generally alter plants' interactions with enemies, mutualists and competitors, and that there is increasing evidence that these altered interactions jointly influence the success of introduced populations.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; Ctr Reg Invest Cient & Tecnol, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina","Mitchell, CE (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",mitchell@bio.unc.edu,"Mitchell, Charles E/I-3709-2014; Agrawal, Anurag A/Y-2497-2019","Mitchell, Charles E/0000-0002-1633-1993; Agrawal, Anurag A/0000-0003-0095-1220; Vazquez, Diego P./0000-0002-3449-5748; Hufbauer, Ruth/0000-0002-8270-0638; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259",,,,116,454,468,10,318,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Because carbon in the BGB is difficult to measure, it is often estimated using BGB to AGB ratios. However, this ratio can change markedly along resource gradients, such as water availability, which can lead to substantial errors in BGB estimates. In this study, BGB and AGB sampling was carried out in Eucalyptus populnea-dominated woodland communities of northeast Australia to examine patterns of BGB to AGB ratio and vertical root distribution at three sites along a rainfall gradient (367, 602, and 1,101 mm). At each site, a vegetation inventory was undertaken on five transects (100 x 4 m), and trees representing the E. populnea vegetation structure were harvested and excavated to measure aboveground and coarse-root (diameter of at least 15 mm) biomass. Biomass of fine and small roots (diameter less than 15 mm) at each site was estimated from 40 cores sampled to 1 m depth. The BGB to AGB ratio of E. populnea-dominated woodland plant communities declined from 0.58 at the xeric end to 0.36 at the mesic end of the rainfall gradient. This was due to a marked decline in AGB with increased aridity whereas the BGB was relatively stable. The vertical distribution of fine roots in the top 1 m of soil varied along the rainfall gradient. The mesic sites had more fine-root biomass (FRB) in the upper soil profile and less at depth than the xeric site. Accordingly, at the xeric site, a much larger proportion of FRB was found at depth compared to the mesic sites. The vertical distribution patterns of small roots of the E. populnea woodland plant communities were consistently )-shaped, with the highest biomass occurring at 15-30-cm depth. The potential significance of such a rooting pattern for grass-tree and shrub-tree co-existence in these ecosystems is discussed. Overall, our results revealed marked changes in BGB to AGB ratio of E. populnea woodland communities along a rainfall gradient. Because E. populnea woodlands cover a large area (96 M ha), their contribution to continental-scale carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission can be substantial. Use of the rainfall-zone-specific ratios found in this study, in lieu of a single generic ratio for the entire region, will significantly improve estimates of BGB carbon stocks in these woodlands. In the absence of more specific data, our results will also be relevant in other regions with similar vegetation and rainfall gradients (that is, arid and semiarid woodland ecosystems).","New S Wales Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia; Cooperat Res Ctr Greenhouse Accounting, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Queensland Dept Primary Ind & Fisheries, Rockhampton, Qld 4072, Australia","Zerihun, A (reprint author), New S Wales Dept Primary Ind, POB 100, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia.",ayalsewz@sf.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,36,35,39,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JUN,2006,9,4,,,,,501,515,,10.1007/s10021-005-0155-x,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,053GD,WOS:000238292700001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Subke, JA; Inglima, I; Cotrufo, MF",,,,"Subke, Jens-Arne; Inglima, Ilaria; Cotrufo, M.

We present results of an exhaustive literature search of partitioning studies and analyse global trends in flux partitioning between biomes and ecosystem types by means of a metaanalysis. Across all data, an overall decline in the R-H/R-S ratio for increasing annual R-S fluxes emerged. For forest ecosystems, boreal coniferous sites showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) R-H/R-S ratios than temperate sites, while both temperate or tropical deciduous forests did not differ in ratios from any of the other forest types. While chronosequence studies report consistent declines in the R-H/R-S ratio with age, no difference could be detected for different age groups in the global data set. Different methodologies showed generally good agreement if the range of R-S under which they had been measured was considered, with the exception of studies estimating R-H by means of root mass regressions against R-S, which resulted in consistently lower R-H/R-S estimates out of all methods included. Additionally, the time step over which fluxes were partitioned did not affect R-H/R-S ratios consistently. To put results into context, we review the most common techniques and point out the likely sources of errors associated with them.

This study aimed to assess how root respiration, a major flux component, is affected by land management and changes in land use. Respiration of roots, separated to classes of different diameter, was measured in 11 temperate mountain grasslands, including meadows, pastures and abandoned sites at three geographic locations. Specific root respiration was affected by nitrogen (N) concentration, root class and land use. The relationship between root N concentration and respiration differed between locations. With increasing root diameter there was a decrease in root respiration, N concentration, respiration per unit N and Q(10). In grasslands abandoned for several years specific root respiration was lower than in meadows, pastures and a recently abandoned site. This was due to lower root N concentrations and/or lower respiration rates per unit N within each root class. Since root biomass was higher on abandoned grasslands, total ecosystem root respiration did not differ consistently between sites. Ecosystem root respiration showed distinct seasonal changes due to changes in root biomass, which were less pronounced on abandoned grasslands. Fine roots generally made up the largest portion of ecosystem root respiration, their contribution varying between 35% and 96%. On meadows, clipping increased soil and root respiration by increasing soil temperature. When corrected for temperature effects soil respiration was reduced by 20-50%, whilst root respiration was little affected, suggesting that carbohydrate reserves sustained root metabolism for several days and that microbial respiration strongly responded to short-term changes in assimilate supply.","Univ Innsbruck, Inst Okol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Bahn, M (reprint author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Okol, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",michael.bahn@uibk.ac.at,"Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013","Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776",,,,71,118,129,5,79,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For each stand age, three forest stands with similar characteristics of soil type and site preparation were used. There were no significant differences in total soil respiration among sites of the same age, except for the case of a 15-year-old stand that had lower soil respiration rates due to its higher productivity. Soil respiration initially decreased with stand age, but levelled out in the older stands. The youngest stands had significantly higher respiration rates than more mature sites. Annual soil respiration rates were modelled by means of temperature-derived functions. The average (Q) under bar (10) value obtained treating all the stands together was 3.8. Annual soil respiration rates were 991, 686, 556, and 564 g C m(-2) for the 10-, 15-, 31-, and 47-year-old stands, respectively. We used the trenching approach to separate soil respiration components. Heterotrophic respiration paralleled soil organic carbon dynamics over the chronosequence, decreasing with stand age to slightly increase in the oldest stand as a result of accumulated aboveground litter and root inputs. Root respiration showed a decreasing trend with stand age, which was explained by a decrease in fine root biomass over the chronosequence, but not by nitrogen concentration of fine roots. The decrease in the relative contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil CO2 efflux from 59.3% in the youngest stand to 49.7% in the oldest stand was explained by the higher activity of the root system in younger stands. Our results show that stand age should be considered if simple temperature-based models to predict annual soil respiration in afforestation sites are to be used.","Univ Coll Dublin, Fac Agr, Forest Ecosyst Res Grp, Dept Environm Resource Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Hydrol Micrometeorol & Climate Change, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cork, Ireland; Atmospher & Environm Res Inst Meteorol & Climate, Karlsruhe, Germany; Forest Res & Management Inst, Bucharest, Romania","Saiz, G (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Fac Agr, Forest Ecosyst Res Grp, Dept Environm Resource Management, Dublin 2, Ireland.",gustavo.saiz@ucd.ie,"Byrne, Kenneth/F-9638-2013; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Saiz, Gustavo/F-3994-2011; Saiz, Gustavo/N-3849-2019; Kiese, Ralf/A-7310-2013","Byrne, Kenneth/0000-0001-8622-7297; Saiz, Gustavo/0000-0001-7794-4403; Saiz, Gustavo/0000-0001-7794-4403; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598; Blujdea, Viorel N.B./0000-0002-7932-8484",,,,49,92,116,2,58,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Soil CO2 effluxes showed a pronounced seasonal trend, which was well related to the pattern of precipitation and soil water content and were always significantly lower in the clear-cut plots than in the intact plots. On an annual basis, soil respiration represented 1.57 and 0.91 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) in intact and clear-cut plots, respectively. During the first year following harvest, residues have lost 0.79 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1). Our estimate of heterotrophic respiration was calculated assuming that it was similar to soil respiration in the clear-cut area except that the decomposition of residues did not occur, and it was further corrected for differences in soil water content between intact and clear-cut plots and for the cessation of leaf and fine root turnover in clear cut. Heterotrophic respiration in clear-cut plots was estimated at 1.18 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) whereas it was only 0.65 kg(C) m(-2) yr(-1) in intact plots (41% of soil respiration).

Location: western Zimbabwe. Methods: Trees of common species were tagged, mapped, and measured annually between 2001 and 2003 in a Kalahari sand woodland savanna. Diameter increments were analysed with mixed model regressions for the largest ramet in each genet. Stem diameter and damage, soil texture, and indices of competition at multiple spatial scales were used as covariates. Results: Stem diameter increased initially and then declined as a function of size in undamaged trees, which grew faster than damaged trees. Growth in damaged trees declined with size. No site differences were detected, and there was evidence for between-tree competition on growth only in the fastest-growing species, Brachystegia spiciformis. In several species the growth rate of the largest ramet increased as a function of the basal area of secondary ramets, contrary to expectations. For many species, the growth models showed poor explanatory power. Conclusions: Growth in Kalahari sand savanna trees varies as a function of size and changes in tree architecture caused by disturbance agents such as fire, frost, and elephant browsing. Disturbance may thus play an important role on vegetation dynamics through its effects on growth in the post-disturbance phase. Growth is highly stochastic for some species in this system, and more deterministic in others. It is hypothesized that this dichotomy may be driven by differences in rooting depth among species.","Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Holdo, RM (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, POB 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rholdo@zoo.ufl.edu,,,,,,44,19,19,0,13,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-770 13 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Insights about factors controlling soil CO(2) efflux are constrained by the challenge of apportioning sources of CO(2) between autotrophic tree roots (and mycorrhizal fungi) and heterotrophic microorganisms. In some temperate conifer forests, the reduction in soil CO(2) efflux after girdling (phloem removal) has been used to separate these sources. Girdling stops the flow of carbohydrates to the belowground portion of the ecosystem, which should slow respiration by roots and mycorrhizae while heterotrophic respiration should remain constant or be enhanced by the decomposition of newly dead roots. Therefore, the reduction in CO(2) efflux after girdling should be a conservative estimate of the belowground flux of C from trees. We tested this approach in two tropical Eucalyptus plantations. Tree canopies remained intact for more than 3 months after girdling, showing no reduction in light interception. The reduction in soil CO(2) efflux averaged 16-24% for the 3-month period after girdling. The reduction in CO(2) efflux was similar for plots with one half of the trees girdled and those with all of the trees girdled. Girdling did not reduce live fine root biomass for at least 5 months after treatment, indicating that large reserves of carbohydrates in the root systems of Eucalyptus trees maintained the roots and root respiration. Our results suggest that the girdling approach is unlikely to provide useful insights into the contribution of tree roots and heterotrophs to soil CO(2) efflux in this type of forest ecosystem.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Grad Degree Program Ecol & Nat Resources, Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Forest Sci, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; Votorantim Celulose & Papel, BR-12300000 Jacarei, SP, Brazil; US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Affiliate Face, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Binkley, D (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Grad Degree Program Ecol & Nat Resources, Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dan@cnr.colostate.edu,"Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008","Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738",,,,19,62,68,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2006,148,3,,,,,447,454,,10.1007/s00442-006-0383-6,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,046FH,WOS:000237796300009,16496179,,,,10/31/19J,"Smemo, KA; Zak, DR; Pregitzer, KS",,,,"Smemo, KA; Zak, DR; Pregitzer, KS",,,Chronic experimental NO3- deposition reduces the retention of leaf litter DOC in a northern hardwood forest soil,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,dissolved organic carbon; DOC; microbial respiration; plant litter decomposition; soluble potyphenolics; adsorption; nitrate NO3- deposition,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; ATMOSPHERIC NITRATE DEPOSITION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; MICROBIAL RESPIRATION; TEMPERATE FOREST; DECIDUOUS FOREST; FINE-ROOT; CARBON; MINERALIZATION,"In forests of the Great Lakes region, experimental NO3 deposition has suppressed soil respiration and enhanced DOC export. Reasons for these responses are unknown, but they could arise via two alternatives: (i) direct suppression of microbial activity by NO3 or (ii) indirect suppression of the microbial community via changes in litter biochemistry in response to greater N availability. To test the second alternative, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment to examine how chronic experimental NO3 deposition affects the contributions of fresh leaf litter to microbial respiration and DOC export. The study reported here used manipulations of mineral soil and fresh leaf litter from a previously studied northern hardwood forest stand in northern Lower Michigan that has received 9 years of ambient and experimental (three times ambient) atmospheric NO3 deposition. We found that cumulative microbial respiration over the 6-week incubation was substantially greater in fresh litter plus mineral soil (20.2-13.4 mg C) versus mineral soil alone (4.4-4.1 mg C); however, experimental NO3- deposition had no effect on microbial respiration across the litter-mineral soil manipulations. DOC production (similar to 75%) was primarily associated with leaching from fresh litter. In contrast, mineral soil was a significant sink for litter-derived DOC. Significantly, the mineral soil sink was less pronounced in soil receiving experimental NO3- deposition in which similar to 30% more DOC was leached compared to the ambient NO3- deposition treatment. Furthermore, mineral soil was also both a source and sink for soluble phenolics; however, NO3- deposition suppressed a mineral-soil sink for phenolics derived from fresh leaf litter. These results suggest that increases in DOC export and declines in soil respiration in response to NO3- deposition in the field are not related to obvious changes in litter biochemistry or to the microbial metabolism of this material. Alternatively, these patterns may be linked to decreased abiotic sinks for litter-derived DOC in mineral soil, an unexpected ecosystem consequence of increased anthropogenic (NO3-) deposition.

Thus, root morphological, topological and functional parameters, including hydraulic conductance per leaf unit surface area ( K-RL), were investigated in one-year seedlings cultivated in three PVC tubes differing in length ( 20, 60 and 100 cm). Longer tubes showed greater projected root area, root volume, total and fine root lengths, specific root length ( S-RL) and K-RL values than did shorter tubes. On the other hand, the length of coarse roots ( diameter > 4.5 mm) and the average root diameter were greater in shorter tubes. The strong positive correlation found between K-RL and S-RL ( r = + 0.69; P < 0.001) indicated that root thickness was inversely related to water flow through the root system. We concluded that root systems developed in longer tubes are more efficient for plant water uptake and, therefore, changes in root pattern produced in standard forest containers ( i.e. about 20 cm length) may in fact prevent a proper establishment of the holm oak in the field, particularly in xeric environments.","CITA Aragon, Unit Forest Resources, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; Univ Lleida, Dept Prod Vegetal & Ciencia Forestal, Lleida 25198, Spain","Gil-Pelegrin, E (reprint author), CITA Aragon, Unit Forest Resources, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",egilp@aragon.es,"Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/M-5129-2014; Voltas, Jordi/N-9587-2019; Voltas, Jordi/D-3280-2013","Gil-Pelegrin, Eustaquio/0000-0002-4053-6681; Voltas, Jordi/0000-0003-4051-1158; Peman, Jesus/0000-0003-4561-5925",,,,34,33,37,2,22,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

When restoring species to grasslands, it is important to consider the role mycorrhizal fungi and soil environmental conditions can play in affecting restoration success. For edaphic endemics soil properties will also likely be an important factor dictating the growth of the target species. We investigated how the rare forb, Erodium macrophyllum, grows in three different soils with associated mycorrhizal inocula in full factorial design. Soil and inocula came from a grassland dominated with the native grass, Nassella pulchra, a grassland dominated with exotic grasses, and from a clay soil in which E. macrophyllum is currently found. We found that E. macrophyllum responded differentially to soil textural classes and inocula, but there were no interactions; growth was greatest in loamy soil from the invaded grassland and inoculum from the invaded grassland increased growth the most regardless of soil characteristics. When restoring E. macrophyllum to different areas, soil characteristics will likely have the greatest affect on growth, but inocula will likely increase growth also. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A study was carried out to determine the effects of these changes on soil microbial communities. Soils were sampled under exotic grasses and the native shrub Artemisia californica along an urban-to-rural N deposition gradient, and in N-fertilized plots in a rural site with low deposition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of A. californica was highest in low-N soils, but annual grasses (mainly Bromus madritensis) were colonized primarily by a fine endophyte that showed no pattern of response to soil N level. In addition, annual grasses generally had higher colonization by nonmycorrhizal, primarily septate, fungi in high N soils, while nonmycorrhizal colonization of A. californica was low in all soils. Spore density declined in the rhizosphere of A. californica with elevated N, but not of B. madritensis. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were extracted from soil and their profiles were used to describe the soil microbial communities. Principal components analysis of FAME profiles showed a significant but weak relationship with levels of soil N. At the low N-deposition site that received N fertilizer, host plant was more important than soil N in determining FAME profiles. The most abundant fatty acids were the biomarkers for AM fungi. The different microbial communities of the two species, especially the predominance of fine endophyte and nonmycorrhizal fungi in roots of B. madritensis, warrant further research on functional responses to understand how these microorganisms may be involved in the invasion of native shrubland by exotic grasses.

Although existing weed management techniques can successfully reduce negative impacts of knapweeds, these plants continue to spread in an unpredictable manner. The successful spread of knapweeds into native plant communities may be driven, in part, by interactions between these plants and native soil communities. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative benefit of native soil communities to two native plants and two knapweeds and to investigate the growth of these plants in soil from knapweed infestations and from adjacent native rangelands. Individual plants of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love), yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), spotted and diffuse knapweed were grown in a greenhouse in field collected soil. The relative benefit of the native soil community was determined by comparing emergence and production of native plants and exotic knapweeds in autoclaved versus unautoclaved native rangeland soil. Emergence and production were also determined in the greenhouse for native plants and exotic knapweeds grown in soil collected from the core and perimeter of knapweed infestations and in soil from the adjacent, uninvaded native rangeland. The native soil community had a negative effect on the growth of bluebunch wheatgrass (P spicata (Pursh) A. Love) and diffuse knapweed, but a positive effect on spotted knapweed emergence. The interactions between yarrow (A. millefolium L.) and the native soil community were variable. The native soil community appears to be more beneficial to spotted knapweed than to the other plants studied, including diffuse knapweed. Therefore, it appears that two closely related knapweeds have very different interactions with soil biota and perhaps different strategies for invasion. Soil from diffuse and spotted knapweed infestations did not prevent growth of two native plants. Diffuse knapweed growth was not promoted by soil from within a diffuse knapweed infestation, but soil from the core of a spotted knapweed infestation did increase emergence of spotted knapweed.

Replicated plots were treated using combinations of carbohydrate addition to reduce soil N availability, reseeding with desirable mid- and late-seral plant species, and reintroducing a native late-sera] soil microbial community using whole soil inoculum. The responses of extraradical filamentous fungi, mycorrhizae (infection intensity, arbuscules and vesicles) and systemic endophytic fungal (SEF) of native perennial grasses were evaluated in relation to plant community relative biomass, litter mass and soil C:N ratio in treated versus replicated untreated control plots. Soil filamentous fungal and plant community changes occurred with combined treatments (sucrose, seeding, soil inoculum) and were most evident in the diffuse knapweed-invaded sites during 2003. Based on overall correlations for the 2000-2003 experimental period, total and active filamentous fungi were inversely related to the relative biomass of invasive plants, particularly of spotted knapweed. The native perennial grasses had lower mycorrhizal infection intensity at the spotted knapweed site, in comparison with the diffuse knapweed infested site, where soil inoculation also appeared to be related to higher SEF and mycorrhizal infection occurrence. These results suggest that a mycocentric approach, involving soil management to maintain filamentous fungal hyphal lengths, while decreasing active fungal development, may create a soil evironment more conducive to maintenance of desired indigenous plant species.

Our research examined the effects of herbivory and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) on the growth of C maculosa, and two native grasses, Festuca idahoensis and Pseudoroegneria spicata. Plants were grown for I I weeks, with or without AM, prior to simulated herbivory. We removed 75% of aboveground biomass from half of the plants, and harvested all plants 4 weeks later. All species increased their growth rate after clipping, but clipped plants were smaller than unclipped plants. The difference in biomass between clipped and unclipped plants was smaller for C maculosa (clipped: unclipped = 0.62) than for the native grasses (0.42 and 0.52). Plants with AM were smaller than non-AM plants across all species, with the greatest reduction in F idahoensis (77% versus 18% in C maculosa and P. spicata). Levels of AM colonization were minimal in F idahoensis (< 1% of root length colonized), intermediate in P. spicata (13% colonization) and highest in C maculosa (20%). Extra radical hyphae (ERH) lengths were highest for C. maculosa, and equal between the two grasses. Because of the lower biomass, plant tissue N concentrations were higher in AM plants, but P concentrations increased in AM plants for only C. maculosa and P. spicata. The superior competitive ability of C. maculosa may be the result of greater compensatory growth after herbivory and higher amounts of ERH, both of which result in greater resource capture.

(Asteraceae, spotted knapweed) was introduced to the United States from Eurasia in the late 1800s and now covers over 3 million ha in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Several recent studies have suggested that the success of C. maculosa may be partly due to its ability to outcompete native species for phosphorus (P), through high root mass and/ or association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used a combination of field and greenhouse studies to explore the P efficiency of C maculosa and its effects on soil P levels. C maculosa was P efficient in both the field study and greenhouse experiment. In the field, P concentration in C maculosa was more than twice that of three native species (Pseudorogneria spicata, Festuca idahoensis, and Lupinus sericeous). In the greenhouse experiment, even at extremely low levels of soil P availability, uptake of P by C maculosa was six times greater than that by the native, Lupinus argenteus. However, soil P levels were elevated in sites invaded by C. maculosa, which is the opposite of what would be expected if root or mycorrhizal uptake were responsible for the higher P efficiency. These results indicate that the success of C maculosa may be due to its greater ability to acquire P than native species, but do not indicate that C maculosa is actually outcompeting natives for the P that it acquires. In contrast, C. maculosa appears to have the ability to increase the availability of P in some soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Sampling included three paired sites containing areas where herbicides and mechanical means had been employed and which were still dominated by leafy spurge, and areas where herbicides had not been applied and where very little (< 0.03%) or no leafy spurge or Canada thistle existed. Plant species diversity, frequency, and percent cover were estimated. Decomposition rates were assessed by use of litterbags placed on the sites and retrieved after I year. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum potential was used as an index for mutualistic associations. Soil microarthropod densities were used as an index for the detrital food web. Significantly greater (P <= 0.05) richness of plant species and significantly higher percent relative cover of herbs, sedges, lichen, moss, and fallen litter was found on non-invasive plots compared to plots with invasive species. Plots where herbicides had been applied, and which still possessed leafy spurge, showed a significantly higher percentage of bare ground. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential did not differ between plots. Overall soil arthropod densities and densities of specific suborders of Acari were significantly lower (P <= 0.05) in invasive species plots. There was no significant difference in decomposition rates between non-invasive and invasive plots, but there were site differences in losses of lignin, phosphorus, and trace elements from litter placed on invasive and non-invasive plots. When differences were observed, loss rates were always less in invasive plots. Our results indicate that the establishment of leafy spurge and Canada thistle and the subsequent management practices to control them has altered the plant community structure by facilitating the establishment of other exotic species, which has resulted in a change in the composition and functioning of the belowground community.

The study was focused on the ability of soils to serve as an effective rooting space. The gas diffusion coefficient and the fine root distributions of comparable sensitive silty loams were used to describe the disturbances of soil functions still detectable after decades. Tracking with heavy loaded machines severely reduced the soil aeration and in consequence the ability of the soil to act as a rooting space. Reduction of gas diffusivity and rooting was found on the whole skidding trail area and even expanded to the close vicinity of the margin zone. Up to 14 years after machine impact, gas diffusion coefficients and root densities beyond 4 cm depth under wheel tracks showed no signs of restoration. Soil aeration and root densities comparable to the control plot were found in the top soil layer 18 years after tracking at the site Ettenheim. At that location 24 years after machine impact, significantly reduced root densities occurred only in soil depths beyond 54 cm. In the long run, only concentration of machine traffic on permanent skid trail systems guarantees an adequate soil preservation. This applies especially under Middle European site conditions and management practices.

Five genera were identified in the rhizosphere of these selected plant species. A high diversity of AMF was observed which varied between different host plant species. Among the five genera, Glomus occurred most frequently, with ten species, Acaulospora and Scutellospora were found with three species, respectively, while Gigasporel and Paraglomus were detected with one species each. Glomus constrctum, Glomus fasciculatum, Glomus geosporum, Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae and Glomus rubiforme were the most dominant species. The AMF spore density was not clearly affected by the host plant suggesting that biotic factors may be relatively less important than abiotic/edaphic factors for establishing population pattern. The spore density of AMF had a strong positive correlation with soil pH and organic carbon content and a negative correlation with Olsen's P content of the soil. The association with AMF of these plant species native to the harsh environmental conditions of the Indian Thar Desert may play a significant role in the reestablishment and conservation of these multipurpose endangered medicinal plants.

Using a simple conceptual model, we visualize the effect that clumping has on below ground resource uptake (RU). Two general conclusions can be drawn from the model: (1) clumping results in a loss of RU, and does so to a larger extent when species differ more in rooting depth and when plant density increases; (2) the current view on complementarity may be flawed, as we find that neighborhood species richness only promotes spatial complementarity directly at the transition from monocultures to higher species richness levels, but not at transitions between higher richness levels. The number of species in a community does, however, affect the probability of the occurrence of clumping. In randomly assembled communities, clumps are statistically larger when the number of species is lower, leading to reduced overall below ground complementarity. Complementarity, and thus also RU, will therefore increase indirectly with increasing species richness. As a result of our findings, we propose that clumping could have a number of 'hidden' consequences, for example on invasibility of a community and on competition between species. Clumping could also prove to be a new and important explanatory factor in diversity studies, as it extends the definition of complementarity effects to include the effect of spatial heterogeneity of plant positions within the community.","Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","De Boeck, HJ (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Campus Eiken 3,Univ Pl 1, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",hans.deboeck@ua.ac.be,"De Boeck, Hans/N-6153-2016; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","De Boeck, Hans/0000-0003-2180-8837; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358",,,,37,26,27,1,14,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2006,113,2,,,,,269,278,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14257.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,044EO,WOS:000237655400008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Otieno, DO; Kurz-Besson, C; Liu, J; Schmidt, MWT; Do, RVL; David, TS; Siegwolf, R; Pereira, JS; Tenhunen, JD",,,,"Otieno, D.

Continuous measurements were conducted between May 2003 and August 2004, while discontinuous measurements were conducted on a monthly basis between May and September 2003 and repeated between March and September 2004. Intensive measurements were conducted on five trees with mean height and DBH of 5.3 m and 11.6 cm, respectively, growing at close proximity to each other. Weather conditions and soil water potential (Psi s) at the rhizosphere of each of the trees measured at 0.3 and 1 m soil depth were continuously monitored. Predawn (Psi pd) and midday (Psi md) leaf water potentials were determined every month. Soil and plant samples were also collected in June and September from different locations within the study site for delta O-18 isotope composition analysis. Pressure-volume (p-v) curves were constructed from plant shoots at different times during the vegetative period to determine osmotic potential at full saturation (Pi(100)), water potential at turgor loss point (Psi(tlp)), relative water content at turgor loss point (R*(tlp)) and bulk modulus of elasticity (epsilon). Significant P < 0.05 decline in Psi s occurred between May and September, the lowest value recorded being -2.0 MPa. Decline in soil moisture affected tree water status, but decline in leaf water potential varied significantly (P < 0.05) among the trees. At the end of summer drought, lowest Psi pd measured was -1.7 MPa while the highest measured during this time was -0.8 MPa. Differences among trees were attributed to differences in rooting depth, as shown by regression analysis of O-18 isotopes. Radial stem growth ceased when Psi s within the upper 0.3 m depth approached -1.5 MPa. The upper soil layers contributed approximately 33% of the total tree water requirement, between spring and mid summer when drought was experienced by trees. Deep soil layers however, supplied most of the water required during drought and no growth was recorded during this time. Stressed trees increased solute concentration of their tissues by a Magnitude of 0.7 MPa while bulk tissue elastic modulus increased by about 17 MPa. The study emphasizes the significance of roots as determinants of tree productivity and survival in the Mediterranean ecosystems.","Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Inst Super Agron, P-1394017 Lisbon, Portugal; INIAP, Estacao Florestal Nacl, P-2780159 Oeiras, Portugal; Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Otieno, DO (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, POB 95440, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",denotieno@yahoo.com,"Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/D-4570-2013; Kurz-Besson, Cathy/A-5762-2013; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009; David, Teresa Soares/B-2993-2014","Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/0000-0003-4566-5420; Kurz-Besson, Cathy/0000-0003-3685-0923; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651; David, Teresa Soares/0000-0003-1473-899X; Pereira, Joao/0000-0002-3658-5587",,,,53,42,45,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2006,283,2-Jan,,,,,119,135,,10.1007/s11104-004-7539-0,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,063TI,WOS:000239042200011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Leuschner, C; Wiens, M; Harteveld, M; Hertel, D; Tjitrosemito, S",,,,"Leuschner, Christoph; Wiens, Maria; Harteveld, Marieke; Hertel, Dietrich; Tjitrosemito, S.",,,"Patterns of fine root mass and distribution along a disturbance gradient in a tropical montane forest, Central Sulawesi (Indonesia)",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,agroforestry; canopy gaps; disturbance intensity; fine root biomass; selective logging; vertical root distribution,WET FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; CANOPY GAPS; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS; BEECH; ECOSYSTEMS; STAND,"Large parts of the remaining tropical moist forests of South-east Asia are encroached at their margins by selective logging, rattan harvesting and the establishment of small agroforest plantations under the rainforest canopy. These slight to heavy disturbances affect aboveground forest structure by reducing wood biomass and canopy cover; however, they may also have a profound impact on the belowground compartment. In a lower montane moist forest of Central Sulawesi, we studied the profile totals of fine root biomass (FRBtot, roots < 2 mm until 50 cm of soil depth) and of fine root necromass (FRNtot), the vertical distribution of fine root mass, and the fine root live/dead ratio by root coring in 12 forest stands that represented a gradient in forest use (or disturbance) intensity (forest use type A: undisturbed natural forest, B and C: slightly or moderately disturbed forests with selective timber extraction, D: heavily disturbed cacao agroforest systems under a remaining rainforest cover; each forest types being replicated three times). FRBtot decreased significantly from forest A to the disturbed B, C and D forests, and reached less than 60% of the FRBtot value of A in the agroforest systems D. A similar decrease with increasing disturbance intensity was found for FRNtot. Forest disturbance intensity had no significant influence on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the profiles. According to correlation and principal components analyses, fractional canopy cover was the most important factor influencing FRBtot and FRNtot, whereas diameter at breast height, stand basal area, stem density, soil pH and base saturation had only a minor or no influence on root mass. A reduction in canopy cover from 90% (forest type A) to 75% (types C and D) was associated with a reduction in FRBtot by about 45% which indicates that timber extraction leads not only to canopy gaps but to corresponding 'root gaps' in the soil as well. We conclude that forest encroachment that is widespread in large parts of South-east Asia's remaining rainforests significantly reduces tree fine root biomass and associated carbon sequestration, even if it is conducted at moderate intensities only.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Inst Pertanian Bogor, Fac Sci & Math, Bogor, Indonesia","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,32,19,22,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2006,283,2-Jan,,,,,163,174,,10.1007/s11104-006-6638-5,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,063TI,WOS:000239042200015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Morgan, CP; Stolt, MH",,,,"Morgan, CP; Stolt, MH",,,Soil morphology-water table cumulative duration relationships in southern New England,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COLOR PATTERNS; MOISTURE REGIMES; SATURATION; HYDROSEQUENCE; TOPOSEQUENCE; FLUCTUATIONS; INDICATORS; FEATURES; DRAINAGE; INDIANA,"Although redoximorphic features (RMFs) are commonly used in place of direct observation to estimate the depth of the seasonal high water table (SHWT), little is known about the relationships between RMFs and the duration or the water table. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of how the expression of RMFs relates to the depth and duration of the water table in moderately well-drained soils of southern New England. The 20 soils studied included Dystrudepts, Quartzipsamments, and Psammaquents; of these, 17 met the criteria for Oxyaquic (8) or Aquic (9) subgroup classification. Water table levels were monitored for 18 mo from February to July of the following year to compare the depth and cumulative duration of the water table (cumulative saturation) to RMFs within soil horizons. Average seasonal high water table level (AS14WT) was correlated (p < 0.05) to the depth of the first loamy horizon with > 2% RNWs (r(2) = 0.654-0.72). Water table levels occurred within horizons with no RMFs for as much as 13% of the 18 mo study period. Mean cumulative saturation for soils with textures finer than loamy sand ranged from 3% for horizons with no RMFs to 36% for horizons with a depleted matrix. For horizons with textures of loamy sand and coarser, the mean cumulative saturation ranged from 8% for horizons with no RMFs to 45% for horizons with 2% depletions. (Percentage of cumulative saturation would have likely been less if we monitored for a full > 2 yr, as the late summer and fall of the second year were not monitored.) Our results suggest that the abundance of RMFs increases as the percentage of time the water table is present within a horizon increases. Additionally, coarse-textured horizons are less expressive in regards to RMF abundance than are loamy-textured horizons with similar cumulative saturation. For land-use decisions, soil morphology should be used to provide both an estimate of the depths of a defined SHWT and cumulative saturation.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Stolt, MH (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",mstolt@uri.edu,,,,,,45,17,18,1,6,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Enhancement requires several hours for complete activation and is postulated to involve Al-responsive genes or components. We examined the mechanism of Al-induced citrate release by studying the relationship between citrate release and expression of the mitochondrial citrate synthase (mCS) gene in three leguminous trees. Root elongation in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was arrested within 24 h by 30 mu M Al, whereas root elongation in Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Neilson and Acacia mangium Willd. was inhibited < 50% by a 48-h treatment with 100 mu M AI in calcium chloride solution. Roots of P. falcataria and A. mangium maintained enhanced release and accumulation of citrate for at least 28 days in response to Al treatment. Aluminum increased the accumulation of mCS transcripts in P. falcataria roots, but not in L. leucocephala roots, and thus up-regulation decreased following removal of Al. Lanthanum did not alter the expression level of mCS. Aluminum increased mCS activity concomitantly with enhanced mCS gene expression in P. falcataria, whereas it did not affect mCS activity in L. leucocephala. Aluminum content in root apices of P. falcataria was increased by cycloheximide, supporting the idea that de novo synthesis of proteins is a prerequisite for Al resistance. Our findings suggest that Al-inducible expression of mCS coupled with enhanced citrate release mediates Al resistance in P. falcataria.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Asian Nat Environm Sci Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Osawa, H (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",osawa@fr.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,48,14,14,0,8,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2006,26,5,,,,,565,574,,10.1093/treephys/26.5.565,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,040HK,WOS:000237369400003,16452070,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Ren, J; Yao, YN; Yang, YQ; Korpelainen, H; Junttila, O; Li, CY",,,,"Ren, J; Yao, YN; Yang, YQ; Korpelainen, H; Junttila, O; Li, CY",,,Growth and physiological responses to supplemental UV-B radiation of two contrasting poplar species,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,antioxidant enzymes; electrolyte leakage; free proline; UV-B absorbing compounds,ULTRAVIOLET-B; POPULUS-TRICHOCARPA; LEAF EXPANSION; WATER-STRESS; FIELD; SEEDLINGS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PROLINE; SENSITIVITY; PHENOLICS,"We compared the growth and physiological responses of cuttings of Populus kangdingensis C.

Estimates of the soil C sink strength that this increased stock of trees may have induced on a regional scale are scarce, uncertain and difficult to compare. This illustrates the need for a widely applicable calculation method. Here, we calculate a C budget of productive forest in southeast Norway based on forest inventory information, biomass expansion factors (BEF), biomass turnover rates and the dynamic soil model Yasso. We estimate a 29% increase (112-145 Tg) of C in biomass between 1971 and 2000, and estimate the associated increase of C in soils (including dead wood) to be 4.5% (181-189 Tg). The C sink strengths in biomass and soils (including dead wood) in 1990 are 0.38 and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Estimated soil C density is 58 Mg C ha(-1) or ca 40% of measured soil C density in Norwegian forest soils. A sensitivity analysis - using uncertainty estimates of model inputs and parameters based on empirical data - shows that the underestimation of the soil C stock can be due to overestimation of decomposition rates of recalcitrant organic matter in the soil model and to including only trees as a source of litter. However, uncertainty in these two factors is shown to have a minimal effect on soil sink estimates. The key uncertainty in the soil sink is the initial value of the soil C stock, i.e. the assumed steady state soil C stock at the start of the time series in 1970. However, this source of uncertainty is reduced in importance for when approaching the end of the data series. This indicates that a longer time series of forest inventory data will decrease the uncertainty in the soil sink estimate due to initialisation of the soil C stock. Other, less significant, sources of uncertainty in estimates of soil stock and sink are BEF for fine roots and turnover rates of fine roots and foliage. The used method for calculation of a forest C budget can be readily applied to other regions for which similar forest resource data are available. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Tree-cutting did not cause a significant increase of nitrate (NO3-) concentration in stream water during the growing season after the cutting. Subsequent Sasa-cutting caused significant increase of stream NO3- concentration to ca. 15 mu mol L-1. There was no significant change of stream pH following both cuttings. NO3- concentration in soil solution increased after both cutting, but the change of concentration was higher (> 100 mu mol L-1) after the Sasa-cutting than after the tree-cutting. In a riparian conserved area, on the other hand, NO3- in soil solution remained low after tree-cutting, suggesting the riparian area acted as a NO3- sink after the tree-cutting. There was no significant change in total biomass of fine roots after the tree-cutting because of an increase in Sasa root biomass despite a decrease in tree roots. The subsequent Sasa-cutting caused a 50% decrease of fine root biomass compared to that in the un-cut Sasa site. These results suggested that nitrogen uptake by Sasa was very important in preventing nitrogen leaching after tree-cutting. and decline of this nitrogen uptake after Sasa-cutting lead to marked NO3- leaching to the stream.

Since the root-derived CO, is not part of soil C loss, it is worth estimating this fraction and determining its driving forces. In order to determine the dependency of the root respiration on recent photosynthates in a European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) stand in Southern Switzerland, we girdled 104 tree stems on an area of 625 m(2) at the end of August. The response of forest girdling on the below-ground C cycle was assessed by measuring soil respiration, soil microbial carbon biomass and root composition during the 37 days of experiment. Recent photosynthates contributed significantly to the soil respiration, which declined by 22 and up to 36% on average after girdling. The difference in soil respiration between girdled and control plots was significant only during a short time period (9-20 days after girdling). A significant decline in soil respiration was observed up to a distance of 4 in from the stems. Fine roots from girdled trees were strongly depleted in starch (-90%), although they were functional as shown by the dehydrogenase test. We assume that a large fraction of the starch loss was most likely respired and contributed to the soil respiration or there was a decline in new starch supply due to reduced carbon allocation to the roots.

Thus, a better understanding of the C cycle may contribute to the development of process-based models that better represent the processes in C cycle models. A new soil C model was developed to predict the effect of an increase in the temperature regime on soil C dynamics and pools in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] and black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] forest types in Eastern Canada. Background information to calibrate the model originated from the experimental sites of the ECOLEAP project as well as from a companion study on laboratory soil incubation. Different types of litter were considered in the model: foliage, twigs, understory species, other fine detritus and fine roots. A cohort approach was used to model litter mineralization over time. The soil organic C in the organic (F and H) and mineral layers (0-20 cm) was partitioned into active, slow and passive pools and the rates of C transfer among the different pools and the amount of CO2 respired were modelled. For each forest type, there was a synchrony of response of the C pools to soil temperature variation. The results of the simulations indicated that steady state conditions were obtained under current temperature conditions. When mean annual soil temperatures were gradually increased, the litter and active and slow C pools decreased substantially, but the passive pools were minimally affected. The increase in soil respiration resulting from a gradual increase in temperature was not pronounced in comparison to changes in mineralization rates. An increase in litter production during the same period could contribute to reducing net C losses.","Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Larocque, GR (reprint author), Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",guy.larocque@nrcan.gc.ca,,"Pare, David/0000-0003-0177-6428",,,,48,5,5,0,12,AGRICULTURAL INST CANADA,OTTAWA,"280 ALBERT ST, SUITE 900, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1P 5G8, CANADA",Aug-71,,,CAN J SOIL SCI,Can.

We examine the situation where a single plant selectively utilizes member(s) of a group of ectomycorrhizal potential trading partners. Under biologically realistic circumstances, the plant may simultaneously utilize multiple partners, its degree of utilization determining the community structure of the fungi. If utilization of multiple partners is optimal, the marginal cost of acquiring additional nitrogen from every trading partner must be equal while the marginal cost of acquiring it from any unutilized partner must be larger. Because the plant's nitrogen demand is light dependent, the composition of the fungal species among its trading partners changes along light-availability gradients. We discuss the design of an experiment to test the key prediction of our model, the equalization of marginal cost.","Colorado Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Kummel, M (reprint author), Colorado Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA.",mkummel@coloradocollege.edu,"Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,34,40,42,0,35,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2006,87,4,,,,,892,902,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[892:TEOMOU]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,033QF,WOS:000236863200012,16676533,,,,10/31/19J,"McCormick, MK; Whigham, DF; Sloan, D; O'Malley, K; Hodkinson, B",,,,"McCormick, MK; Whigham, DF; Sloan, D; O'Malley, K; Hodkinson, B",,,Orchid-fungus fidelity: a marriage meant to last?,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,environmental change; Goodyera; mycorrhiza; orchid; Orchidaceae; Tulasnella,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MYCO-HETEROTROPHIC PLANTS; TERRESTRIAL ORCHIDS; SPECIFICITY; INDIVIDUALS; CHRONOSEQUENCE; ASSOCIATION; COMMUNITIES; NITROGEN; ECOLOGY,"The characteristics of plant-rnycorrhizae associations are known to vary in both time and space, but the ecological consequences of variation in the dynamics of plant-fungus interactions are poorly understood. For example, do plants associate with single fungi or multiple fungi simultaneously, and do the associations persist through a plant's lifetime or do plants support a succession of different fungi? We investigated these and other questions related to plant-fungus interactions in Goodyera pubescens, an evergreen terrestrial orchid of the eastern United States, that interdicts with closely related fungi in the genus Tulasnella. Unlike the mycorrhizal associations of other plants, orchid-mycorrhizal associations only benefit the orchid, based on current evidence. Many terrestrial orchids have been found to associate with specific groups of fungi. This characteristic could potentially limit orchids to relatively narrow ranges of environmental conditions and may be a contributing factor in the decline of many orchids in the face of changing environmental conditions. We found that G. pubescens protocorms (developing embryos prior to leaf production) and adults associated with only one fungal individual at a time. The orchid-fungus association persists for years, but during I drought period that was associated with the death of many plants, surviving plants were able to switch to new fungal individuals. These results. suggest that G. pubescens interacts with the same fungal partner during periods of modest environmental variation but is able to switch to a different fungal partner. We hypothesize that the ability to switch fungi allows G. pubescens to survive more extreme environmental perturbations. However, laboratory experiments suggest that switching fungi has potential costs, as it increases the risk of mortality, especially for smaller individuals. Our findings indicate that it is unlikely that switching fungi is a common way to improve tolerance of less severe environmental fluctuations and disturbances. These findings may have important implications for plant responses to severe climatic events or to more gradual environmental changes such its global warming.","Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","McCormick, MK (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",,"Sloan, Daniel/D-4152-2011","Whigham, Dennis/0000-0003-1488-820X; Sloan, Daniel/0000-0002-3618-0897",,,,37,85,94,0,40,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2006,87,4,,,,,903,911,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[903:OFAMMT]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,033QF,WOS:000236863200013,16676534,,,,10/31/19J,"Newman, GS; Arthur, MA; Muller, RN",,,,"Newman, GS; Arthur, MA; Muller, RN",,,Above- and belowground net primary production in a temperate mixed deciduous forest,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon allocation; interannual variability; mesic; mixed mesophytic forest; nitrogen mineralization; Quercus; soil moisture; total belowground carbon allocation; xeric,BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION; FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; LEAF-AREA INDEX; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; EASTERN KENTUCKY; HARDWOOD FOREST; MESOPHYTIC FOREST; DOUGLAS-FIR; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS,"Our current ability to detect and predict changes in forest ecosystem productivity is constrained by several limitations. These include a poor understanding of belowground productivity, the short duration of most analyses, and a need for greater examination of species- or community-specific variability in productivity studies. We quantified aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) over 3 years (1999-2001), and both belowground NPP (BNPP) and total NPP over 2 years (2000-2001) in both mesic and xeric site community types of the mixed mesophytic forest of southeastern Kentucky to examine landscape variability in productivity and its relation with soil resource [water and nitrogen (N)] availability. Across sites, ANPP was significantly correlated with N availability (R-2 = 0.58, P = 0.028) while BNPP was best predicted by soil moisture content (R-2 = 0.72, P = 0.008). Because of these offsetting patterns, total NPP was unrelated to either soil resource. Interannual variability in growing season precipitation during the study resulted in a 50% decline in mesic site litter production, possibly due to a lag effect following a moderate drought year in 1999. As a result, ANPP in mesic sites declined 27% in 2000 compared to 1999, while xeric sites had no aboveground production differences related to precipitation variability. If global climate change produces more frequent occurrences of drought, then the response of mesic sites to prolonged moisture deficiency and the consequences of shifting carbon (C) allocation on C storage will become important questions.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Forestry, Lexington, KY 40546 USA","Newman, GS (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",gsn3@nau.edu,"Newman, Greg/B-9456-2015","Newman, Greg/0000-0001-8932-0809",,,,55,49,51,6,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2006,9,3,,,,,317,329,,10.1007/s10021-006-0015-3,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,037BL,WOS:000237121600001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kiely, PD; Haynes, JM; Higgins, CH; Franks, A; Mark, GL; Morrissey, JP; O'Gara, F",,,,"Kiely, P.

In plant-bacterial interactions, signal molecules exuded by the plant affect both primary initiation and subsequent behavior of the bacteria in complex beneficial associations such as biocontrol. However, despite this general acceptance that plant-root exudates have an effect on the resident bacterial populations, very little is still known about the influence of these signals on bacterial gene expression and the roles of genes found to have altered expression in plant-microbial interactions. Analysis of the rhizospheric communities incorporating both established techniques, and recently developed ""omic technologies"" can now facilitate investigations into the molecular basis underpinning the establishment of beneficial plant-microbial interactomes in the rhizosphere. The understanding of these signaling processes, and the functions they regulate, is fundamental to understanding the basis of beneficial microbial-plant interactions, to overcoming existing limitations, and to designing improved strategies for the development of novel Pseudomonas biocontrol strains.","Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Microbiol, Biomerit Res Ctr, UCC, Cork, Ireland","O'Gara, F (reprint author), Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Microbiol, Biomerit Res Ctr, UCC, Cork, Ireland.",f.ogara@ucc.ie,,"O'Gara, Fergal/0000-0002-2659-0673; Franks, Ashley/0000-0003-1664-6060; Morrissey, John/0000-0001-7960-2001",,,,69,38,42,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

We compared two populations of B. holboellii from contrasting water environments in a reciprocal transplant experiment, as well as in a laboratory dry-down experiment. We continuously measured the water content of soils using time domain reflectometery (TDR). We compared populations for their water use efficiency (WUE), root/shoot ratios (R:S) and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) in the field and in the laboratory, and identified candidate genes that (i) responded plastically to water stress and (ii) were differentially expressed between the two populations. Genotypes from the drier site had higher WUE, which was attributable to a large reduction in transpirational water loss. The xeric-adapted population also had increased investment in root biomass and greater leaf mass per unit area. Reciprocal transplants in the field had significantly greater survival in their native habitat. In total, 450 cDNA-AFLP fragments showed significant changes between drought and control treatments. Furthermore, some genes showed genotype (population)-specific patterns of up- or down-regulation in response to drought. Three hundred cDNA-AFLP bands were sequenced leading to the identification of cDNAs coding for proteins involved in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, redox regulation, oxidative stress and pathways involved in stress adaptation. Some of these proteins could contribute a physiological advantage under drought, making them potential targets for natural selection.","Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Keygene NV, NL-6700 AE Wageningen, Netherlands","Mitchell-Olds, T (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, POB 91000, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",tmo1@duke.edu,"Mitchell-Olds, Thomas/K-8121-2012; Kroymann, Juergen/B-4317-2013","Mitchell-Olds, Thomas/0000-0003-3439-9921; Kroymann, Juergen/0000-0002-4573-6498",,,,64,69,74,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Organic production regulations prohibit the use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, therefore farmers are dependent upon N-sources accepted by organic certification agencies. In the state of Chiapas, little is known about effectiveness of rhizobia and nodule development, location and structure of the common coffee shade tree genus Inga. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness of selected rhizobia isolates as inoculants for Inga oerstediana under greenhouse and field conditions, (2) describe the morphological and histochemical characteristics of I. oerstediana root nodules, and (3) apply the N-15 natural abundance technique to investigate nitrogen fixation in two stands of I. oerstediana of different ages intercropped with C. arabica. To meet objectives one and two, we assessed shoot biomass, nodule number, nodule mass and total shoot N of inoculated I. oerstediana seedlings at 90 and 150 days after planting (DAP) in the greenhouse and field. Light microscopy, and in situ hybridization of nodule sections for leghemoglobin and Nif H cDNA determination were used to describe nodule morphology and histology. Results indicated that tested isolates appear not to be fixing NZ 150 DAP and inoculation with isolated bacteria, and that inoculated treatment nodules lacked leghemoglobin and Nif H mRNA transcript, however contained infected bacteroids. An unidentified brown-pigmented granular substance was present in all nodules examined. I. oerstediana appears slow to nodulate, with negligible nodulation at 90 DAP, and limited nodulation at 150 DAP. Using the natural abundance method to meet objective three, recycling of fixed N in older 5-7 year plots is thought to have caused great N-15 value variation in both reference and leguminous trees and data could not be used to estimate % N derived from Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF). I. oerstediana found in younger 1-3 year old plots was found to derive 20% of its N from BNF. As fixation appears to be low in young Inga, recommendations for organic C. arabica shade tree management include supplementation of N during early growth of Inga-C. arabica intercrop, and longer-term nodulation studies combined with additional N-2-fixation assessment using N-15 natural abundance methods.

The presence of P-type II gene subfamilies that are specific for certain kingdoms has been reported but was sometimes contradicted by discovery of previously unknown homologous sequences in newly sequenced genomes. Members of this gene family have been sampled in all of the fungal phyla except the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; phylum Glomeromycota), which are known to play a key-role in terrestrial ecosystems and to be genetically highly variable within populations. Here we used highly degenerate primers on AMF genomic DNA to increase the sampling of fungal P-Type II ATPases and to test previous predictions about their evolution. In parallel, homologous sequences of the P-type II ATPases have been used to determine the nature and amount of polymorphism that is present at these loci among isolates of Glomus intraradices harvested from the same field. Results: In this study, four P-type II ATPase sub-families have been isolated from three AMF species. We show that, contrary to previous predictions, P-type IIC ATPases are present in all basal fungal taxa. Additionally, P-Type IIE ATPases should no longer be considered as exclusive to the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota, since we also demonstrate their presence in the Zygomycota. Finally, a comparison of homologous sequences encoding P-type IID ATPases showed unexpectedly that indel mutations among coding regions, as well as specific gene duplications occur among AMF individuals within the same field. Conclusion: On the basis of these results we suggest that the diversification of P-Type IIC and E ATPases followed the diversification of the extant fungal phyla with independent events of gene gains and losses. Consistent with recent findings on the human genome, but at a much smaller geographic scale, we provided evidence that structural genomic changes, such as exonic indel mutations and gene duplications are less rare than previously thought and that these also occur within fungal populations.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biol Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Nicolas.Corradi@unil.ch; Ian.Sanders@unil.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Corradi, Nicolas/0000-0002-7932-7932",,,,43,31,35,0,7,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"MIDDLESEX HOUSE, 34-42 CLEVELAND ST, LONDON W1T 4LB, ENGLAND",1471-2148,,,BMC EVOL BIOL,BMC Evol.

Caatinga soils from both, natural (control) and mining impacted areas, were used to maintain seedlings inoculated with Glomus etunicatum. The soil from the impacted area was diluted 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% with soil from the control area. In general, the increase in the proportion of contaminated soil had a negative effect on plant growth. Inoculated plants presented greater height, leaf number and dry matter of roots and shoots than the non-inoculated plants, when cultivated in soil with up to 50% of contaminated soil. Higher spore number was produced in substrate with 25% soil contamination. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher than 40% in those treated with <50% disturbed soil. Proportions of copper contaminated soil higher than 50%, inhibited plant growth, development of the AMF in the roots and consequently, the benefit of mycorrhization. The pattern of Cu and P absorption in Leucaena, associated or not with G. etunicatum, is maintained when the soil is up to 50% contaminated. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the potential role that rhizosphere soil microbial communities play in facilitating or resisting the spread of invasive species into native plant communities. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial communities of invasive and native plant rhizospheres in serpentine soils. We compared rhizosphere microbial communities, of two invasive species, Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) and Aegilops triuncialis (barb goatgrass), with those of five native species that may be competitively affected by these invasive species in the field (Lotus wrangelianus, Hemizonia congesta, Holocarpha virgata, Plantago erecta, and Lasthenia californica). Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) was used to compare the rhizosphere microbial communities of invasive and native plants. Correspondence analyses (CA) of PLFA data indicated that despite yearly variation, both starthistle and goatgrass appear to change microbial communities in areas they invade, and that invaded and native microbial communities significantly differ. Additionally, rhizosphere microbial communities in newly invaded areas are more similar to the original native soil communities than are microbial communities in areas that have been invaded for several years. Compared to native plant rhizospheres, starthistle and goatgrass rhizospheres have higher levels of PLFA biomarkers for sulfate reducing bacteria, and goatgrass rhizospheres have higher fatty acid diversity and higher levels of biomarkers for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species composition was analysed based on 96 sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, 72 originated from mycorrhizal roots, and 24 originated from AMF spores. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a total of 19 AMF species representing all genera of the Glomeromycota except Scutellospora and Pacispora. Despite a different farming intensity, resulting in remarkable differences concerning their plant species diversity (27 against 43 plant species), the diversity of AMF was found to be similar with 11 species on the intensively farmed meadow and ten species on the extensively farmed one. Nevertheless, species composition between both sites was clearly different. It thus seems likely that the AMF species composition, but not necessarily the species number, is related to above ground plant biodiversity in the system under study.","Univ Leipzig, Inst Bot, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Renker, C (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Bot, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",crenker@uni-leipzig.de,"Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016; Kahmen, Ansgar/AAC-4899-2019","Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; ",,,,59,60,73,2,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The soils of the Great Nicobar mangroves were silt-clays and were poor in phosphate content. Five species of AMF belonging to the genus Glomus were isolated. The %AMF colonization in the mangrove plants was between 0 and 17%, and the presence of AMF in the aerenchymatous cortex suggests that the mangrove plants may be aiding in AMF survival by providing oxygen. Two strains of phosphate solubilising Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in the mangrove soils of Great Nicobar. Phosphate solubilisation by the two isolated strains was almost 70% under in vitro conditions. PSB may play a role in the mangrove ecosystems of Great Nicobar by mobilising insoluble phosphate.

In the UF, F was often low in May because of cold soils, but subsequently attained rates equivalent to those of the OM0C0 and OM1C0, despite lower soil temperatures. Three to five growing seasons after treatment, soil temperature and moisture, together with F-10, explained 71%-87% of the plot-level variation in F.","Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; Canadian Forest Serv, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada","Fleming, RL (reprint author), Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 W Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",roflemin@nrcan.gc.ca,,,,,,71,17,19,1,19,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

In this paper two wild Brassica species, B. nigra and B. oleracea were experimentally infested with 10 larvae of the cabbage root fly, Delia radicum. Plant dry masses and glucosinolate levels in shoots, main roots, and fine roots were determined at 3, 7, 12 and 14 days after infestation and compared to those of control plants. The systemic response in the leaves differed between plant species. In B. nigra shoot glucosinolate levels in D. radicum infested plants steadily increased with time until they were almost twice those of controls 14 days after infestation. B. oleracea plants infested with D. radicum did not show significant changes in shoot glucosinolate levels within 14 days, which may be due to the unexpected poorer performance of D. radicum on this species. Both plant species showed a local increase in indole glucosinolates in the main roots, which are the preferred feeding site of D. radicum larvae. B. oleracea plants however showed a stronger (1.9 - 4.7 times) increase in indole glucosinolate levels than B. nigra (1.5 - 2.6 times). The increase in indole glucosinolates in B. nigra main roots, was counterbalanced by a significant decrease in aromatic glucosinolate levels. These differences in local responses to D. radicum feeding between the two species may have contributed to the slower growth rates of the larvae on B. oleracea. D. radicum feeding did not result in altered glucosinolate levels in the fine roots in either plant species. The differences in glucosinolate induction patterns between the summer annual B. nigra and the perennial B. oleracea are discussed in the light of their different life histories.","Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","van Dam, NM (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",n.vandam@nioo.knaw.nl,"van Dam, Nicole/B-3281-2008","van Dam, Nicole/0000-0003-2622-5446",,,,47,65,67,3,51,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"VIADUKSTRASSE 40-44, PO BOX 133, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0937-7409,,,CHEMOECOLOGY,Chemoecology,MAR,2006,16,1,,,,,17,24,,10.1007/s00049-005-0323-7,,,8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,018HF,WOS:000235754300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Finkes, LK; Cady, AB; Mulroy, JC; Clay, K; Rudgers, JA",,,,"Finkes, LK; Cady, AB; Mulroy, JC; Clay, K; Rudgers, JA",,,Plant-fungus mutualism affects spider composition in successional fields,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,endophyte; Lolium arundinaceum; Neotyphodium; predation; species richness; symbiosis; tri-trophic,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODE; GENERALIST PREDATORS; ENDOPHYTE INFECTION; DIVERSITY; RYEGRASS; GRASSES; CURCULIONIDAE; DECOMPOSITION; FACILITATION,"Mutualistic symbionts are widespread in plants and may have strong, bottom-up influences on community structure. Here we show that a grass-endophyte mutualism shifts the composition of a generalist predator assemblage. In replicated, successional fields we manipulated endophyte infection by Neotyphodium coenophialum in a dominant, non-native plant (Lolium arundinaceum). We compared the magnitude of the endophyte effect with manipulations of thatch biomass, a habitat feature of known importance to spiders. The richness of both spider families and morphospecies was greater in the absence of the endophyte, although total spider abundance was not affected. Thatch removal reduced both spider abundance and richness, and endophyte and thatch effects were largely additive. Spider families differed in responses, with declines in Linyphiidae and Thomisidae due to the endophyte and declines in Lycosidae due to thatch removal. Results demonstrate that the community impacts of non-native plants can depend on plants' mutualistic associates, such as fungal endophytes.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Slippery Rock Univ, Dept Pk & Recreat, Slippery Rock, PA 16057 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Rudgers, JA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jrudgers@rice.edu,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",,,,,47,22,22,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Experimental NO3- deposition (3 g NO3- N m(-2) y(-1)) has significantly reduced soil respiration and increased the export of DOC/DON and NO3- across the region. Here, we evaluate the possibility that diminished microbial activity in mineral soil was responsible for these ecosystem-level responses to NO3- deposition. To test this alternative, we measured microbial biomass, respiration, and N transformations in the mineral soil of four northern hardwood stands that have received 9 years of experimental NO3- deposition. Microbial biomass, microbial respiration, and daily rates of gross and net N transformations were not changed by NO3- deposition. We also observed no effect of NO3- deposition on annual rates of net N mineralization. However, NO3- deposition significantly increased (27%) annual net nitrification, a response that resulted from rapid microbial NO3- assimilation, the subsequent turnover of NH4+, and increased substrate availability for this process. Nonetheless, greater rates of net nitrification were insufficient to produce the 10-fold observed increase in NO3- export, suggesting that much of the exported NO3- resulted directly from the NO3- deposition treatment. Results suggest that declines in soil respiration and increases in DOC/DON export cannot be attributed to NO3- -induced physiological changes in mineral soil microbial activity. Given the lack of response we have observed in mineral soil, our results point to the potential importance of microbial communities in forest floor, including both saprotrophs and mycorrhizae, in mediating ecosystem-level responses to chronic NO3- deposition in Lake States northern hardwood forests.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49937 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",drzak@umich.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997",,,,41,29,35,1,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,MAR,2006,9,2,,,,,242,253,,10.1007/s10021-005-0085-7,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,027OE,WOS:000236424100007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gardner, TA",,,,"Gardner, TA",,,Tree-grass coexistence in the Brazilian cerrado: demographic consequences of environmental instability,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brazil; cerrado; coexistence; fire; non-equilibrium dynamics; simulation model; storage effect; tree reproduction,AFRICAN HUMID SAVANNA; NEOTROPICAL SAVANNA; COMMUNITY DYNAMICS; SEMIARID SAVANNAS; WOODY-PLANTS; ARID SAVANNA; VEGETATION; FIRE; PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEMS,"Aim: Tropical savanna ecosystems are uniquely characterized by the co-dominance of both trees and grasses. An operational understanding of the ecological processes involved in maintaining this condition is essential for understanding both the functioning of savanna systems as well as their potential response to environmental change. A simple model is presented to explore the potential for a demographic mechanism of long-term tree persistence and temporal physiognomic stability in the Brazilian cerrado. Location: The model is developed based on data from the humid cerrado of Brazil. Methods: In contrast to many existing models of tree-grass dynamics a model is presented which is based on data from the humid cerrado of Brazil, which is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from many of the more arid savannas of the palaeotropics. The model focuses on the dynamics of a synthetic tree population, with particular attention given to reproduction, seedling establishment and fire effects; with separate sub-models for grass production, fire and rainfall. Results: The model successfully predicts coexistence across the full range of observed vegetation physiognomies, but only under limited conditions. Under coexistence conditions, the dynamics of the tree population are characterized by long periods of gradual decline, punctuated by occasional bursts of growth. However, in agreement with earlier studies, the model consistently over-predicts domination by the tree component. Fire is identified as an overriding factor in determining model behaviour, and the response of reproduction and sapling recruitment to variance in the frequency of fire ignition is identified to be of potential importance in the functioning of the Brazilian cerrado. The key dynamics of the model which promote tree-grass coexistence are consistent with a number of established determinants of ecological resilience in savanna systems. Main conclusions: The model identifies the importance of the effective exploitation of rare opportunities for favourable recruitment (e.g. exclusion from fire) by the tree population, in promoting coexistence within a predominantly adverse environment. Support is provided for an alternative demographic mechanism of tree-grass coexistence in the cerrado (the storage effect), which is not based on the limiting assumption of niche partitioning through differences in rooting depth. The results are consistent with those presented by recent modelling work based on the more arid savannas of southern Africa. The model presented here differs in the emphasis given to particular environmental and life-history attributes which are critical in determining the tree-grass balance, but provides further general support for the potential role of demographic mechanisms (such as the storage effect) in determining the structure of tropical savannas. Despite having clear limitations, models can serve as valuable heuristic tools to aid the integration and exploration of existing data sets as well as our present understanding of key ecological processes.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","Gardner, TA (reprint author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",t.gardner@uea.ac.uk,"Gardner, Toby/B-7516-2008",,,,,95,42,45,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We examined the relationship between dwarf mistletoe infection, host vigour and the ectomycorrhizal colonization and fungal community composition of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) using a combination of field observations and glasshouse studies. High levels of dwarf mistletoe infection were not associated with increased mortality or needle loss of infected pinyons, but infected trees had lower shoot growth. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was positively associated with dwarf mistletoe infection severity at two sites in two years. In addition, the ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure of trees with low, intermediate and high levels of dwarf mistletoe were significantly different, primarily due to a shift in the dominance of ascomycete fungi. These higher levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization were associated with increased fungal inoculum under the crowns of pinyons heavily infected with dwarf mistletoe. In addition, 33% more pinyon seedlings were found in the understories of mistletoe-infected trees than uninfected trees. These findings point to complex multi-trophic interactions between the above-ground and below-ground communities of pinyon pine, and suggest that a detailed understanding of host-parasite relationships may require study of other symbionts associated with the host.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Mueller, RC (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",rem5@dana.ucc.nau.edu,,,,,,62,29,30,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In coastal foredunes, feeding-specialist cyst nematodes (Heterodera spp.) are dominant in the soil nematode community and greenhouse studies pointed at bottom-up control by their host plant. Here we examine the population dynamics of H. arenaria in the field in relation to resource quantity in the root zone of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass). Ammophila arenaria is a pioneer grass in mobile coastal foredunes of northwestern and Mediterranean Europe. Every year, the plant expands clonally into freshly deposited layers of wind-blown sand, followed by dispersal and build-up of the nematode population into the new root zone. In a newly developing root zone the first H. arenaria cysts were observed one month after the first new roots were detected, indicating that nematode dispersal is not limiting the initial establishment of new populations. Throughout the growth season, the numbers of cysts, as well as the numbers of eggs and juveniles within cysts, were related to the quantity of roots. However, cyst density varied between years. Therefore, we conclude that in new root layers of A. arenaria cyst nematodes are bottom-up controlled by resource quantity, but that other factors, for example resource quality, influence the relation between nematode abundance and resource quantity. In deeper root zones the nematode abundance declines over time. Here, numbers of cysts were not related to root biomass, while numbers of eggs and juveniles inside the cysts were weakly related. This points at other factors than resource quantity, for example the quality of the roots or unsuitable abiotic environmental conditions that have a stronger influence on cyst numbers than resource quantity. We discuss how bottom-up control of cyst nematodes may indirectly protect the plant against harmful root knot nematodes.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Plant Microorganism, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Van der Stoel, CD (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Plant Microorganism, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",w.vanderputten@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",,,,49,21,21,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2006,112,3,,,,,651,659,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13547.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CS,WOS:000234800800018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hawkes, CV; Belnap, J; D'Antonio, C; Firestone, MK",,,,"Hawkes, CV; Belnap, J; D'Antonio, C; Firestone, MK",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal assemblages in native plant roots change in the presence of invasive exotic grasses,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; exotic annual grasses; grasslands; native perennial grasses; plant invasion,GAS-EXCHANGE CHARACTERISTICS; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; SOIL BIOTA; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; FUNGI; GRASSLAND; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION,"Plant invasions have the potential to significantly alter soil microbial communities, given their often considerable aboveground effects. We examined how plant invasions altered the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi of native plant roots in a grassland site in California and one in Utah. In the California site, we used experimentally created plant communities composed of exotic (Avena barbata, Bromus hordeaceus) and native (Nassella pulchra, Lupinus bicolor) monocultures and mixtures. In the Utah semi-arid grassland, we took advantage of invasion by Bromus tectorum into long-term plots dominated by either of two native grasses, Hilaria jamesii or Stipa hymenoides. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots were characterized with PCR amplification of the ITS region, cloning, and sequencing. We saw a significant effect of the presence of exotic grasses on the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing native plant roots. In the three native grasses, richness of mycorrhizal fungi decreased; in the native forb at the California site, the number of fungal RFLP patterns increased in the presence of exotics. The exotic grasses also caused the composition of the mycorrhizal community in native roots to shift dramatically both in California, with turnover of Glomus spp., and Utah, with replacement of Glomus spp. by apparently non-mycorrhizal fungi. Invading plants may be able to influence the network of mycorrhizal fungi in soil that is available to natives through either earlier root activity or differential carbon provision compared to natives. Alteration of the soil microbial community by plant invasion can provide a mechanism for both successful invasion and the resulting effects of invaders on the ecosystem.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Moab, UT 84532 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, EEMB, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Studies Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hawkes, CV (reprint author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, 1 Univ Stn,C0930, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",chawkes@nature.berkeley.edu,,"Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469",,,,52,135,150,5,108,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2006,281,2-Jan,,,,,369,380,,10.1007/s11104-005-4826-3,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,041GH,WOS:000237441800029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sullivan, TS; Stromberger, ME; Paschke, MW",,,,"Sullivan, TS; Stromberger, ME; Paschke, MW",,,Parallel shifts in plant and soil microbial communities in response to biosolids in a semi-arid grassland,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biosolids; grassland soil; soil microbial community; arbuscular mycorrhizae; FAME,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; COLONIZATION; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; SHRUBLAND; BIOMASS; PRODUCTIVITY; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT,"Approximately 70,150 dry Mg of biosolids from over 450 wastewater treatment facilities are applied to the semi-arid rangelands of Colorado every year. Research on semi-arid grassland responses to biosolids has become vital to better understand ecosystem dynamics and develop effective biosolids management strategies. The objectives of this study were to determine the long-term (similar to 12 years) effects of a single biosolids application, and the short-term ( similar to 2 years) effects of a repeated application, on plant and microbial community structure in a semi-arid grassland soil. Specific attention was paid to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and linkages between shifts in plant and soil microbial community structures. Biosolids were surface applied to experimental plots once in 1991 (long-term plots) and again to short-term plots in 2002 at rates of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 21, or 30 Mg ha(-1). Vegetation (species richness and above-ground biomass), soil chemistry (pH, EC, total C, total N, and extractable P, NO3-N, and NH4-N), and soil microbial community structure [ester-linked fatty acid methyl esters (EL-FAMEs)], were characterized to assess impacts of biosolids on the ecosystem. Soil chemistry was significantly affected and shifts in both soil microbial and plant community structure were observed with treatment. In both years, the EL-FAME biomarker for AMF decreased with increasing application rate of biosolids; principal components analysis of EL-FAME data yielded shifts in the structure of the microbial communities with treatment primarily related to the relative abundance of the AMF specific biomarker. Significant (p <= 0.05) correlations existed among biomarkers for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, AMF and specific soil chemical parameters and individual plant species' biomass. The AMF biomarker was positively correlated with biomass of the dominant native grass species blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [Willd. ex Kunth] Lagasca. ex Griffiths) and was negatively correlated with western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.) biomass. This study demonstrated that applications of biosolids at relatively low rates can have significant long-term effects on soil chemistry, soil microbial community structure, and plant community species richness and structure in the semi-arid grasslands of northern Colorado. Reduced AMF and parallel shifts in the soil microbial community structure and the plant community structure require further investigation to determine precisely the sequence of influence and resulting ecosystem dynamics.

In this study, allometric equations were developed relating component biomass to diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) to DBH for 10 co-occurring tree species in the Chinese temperate mixed forest. The 10 species were Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.), Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.), white birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.), Amur cork-tree (Phellodendron amurense Rupr.), Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.), Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr.), aspen (Populous davidiana Dode), maple (Acer mono Maxim.), and Amur linden (Tilia amurensis Rupr.). The biomass components included stem, current-year branch, older branch, current-year foliage, older foliage, stump, and coarse root (diameter >= 5 mm). Harvested tree DBH ranged from 2.4 to 57.1 cm. Generalized biomass allometric equations that ignored tree species, based on DBH and fitted on a log-log scale, explained more than 90% of variability in woody component biomass, but the species effect was significant (alpha = 0.05). Including tree height as the second independent variable in the allometric equations improved the accuracy of biomass estimates, especially for foliage biomass. The relative differences in biomass estimated from the generalized, DBH-only, and DBH-H combined equations varied from -50.6% to 43.9% depending upon model form, species, and biomass component. Foliage biomass was more variable than other component biomass both across and within tree species. Some potential sources of error in biomass estimation were also discussed.

Evaluations of carbon fixation and storage in this forest are facilitated by its general homogeneity with respect to soil, climate and tree genetics. However, initial assessments were based on basic values for expansion factors and carbon concentration in the biomass, and more accurate results could be obtained. The aim of the present study was to estimate the carbon concentration in the 13 main compartments of mature P. pinaster shoots and roots, describing sources of variation within these compartments and quantifying precisely the corresponding carbon contents. The biomass distribution per compartment in the shoots and roots of 12 trees with a range of social status is given. It was obtained by joint architecture and dry weight measurements. The root systems were uprooted with a mechanical shovel and measured by 3D digitizing. Biomass allometric prediction equations per compartment according to girth at breast height were developed. The carbon concentration was analysed in 300 samples from four trees, taking into account their architecture. The carbon concentration varied largely between compartments and showed a quadratic relationship with relative height in the four stem compartments and in branches and buds. It showed a negative exponential relation with root diameter. The carbon concentration of needles was not related to their age or their relative height in the crown. Carbon concentration variations were in accordance with the tissue chemical composition found in literature. The biochemical concentration of softwoods organs is extensively reviewed in the paper. The weighted mean carbon concentration reached 53.6% in the shoots and 51.7% in the roots. This resulted to 53.2% at tree level. The carbon content in the pine stand was 74 t C per hectare. Between and within compartment variations in carbon concentration should be considered in carbon content evaluations and in structural-functional models. The underestimation of carbon storage in mature P. pinaster stands and sawnwood products reaches 6% when the usual 50% conversion factor is used. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Rupr. and Larix cajanderi Mayer) that grow on the continuous permafrost regions in Siberia. Sample tree data (total n = 27) gathered from four mature stands (> 100 years old) were employed for analysis. First, to determine good size predictor of biomass, site-specific allometric relationships (log-linear equation form) were derived between dry mass of four components (stem, branch, needle and coarse root; >= 5 mm in diameter) and seven size variables; stem diameters (breast height, 30 cm height and crown base), sapwood areas (breast height and 30 cm height), and two combined-variables (tree height x dia-diameter). For all components, site-specific allometric equations based on breast-height diameter (D) always gave high correlations as those using other size variables. However, between-stand comparisons of the D-base site-specific allometry indicated that size dependency (i.e., regression slope) differed for stem mass. Besides, needle and coarse root mass for a given size (i.e., regression intercept) differed significantly among the four stands. These facts implied that D-base regression model was reliable for biomass estimation by site-specific allometry, but was not suitable for developing general (i.e., site-common) allometry. Second, to examine carbon allocation pattern, we estimated each stand biomass by applying corresponding site-specific D-base allometry. Stand total biomass ranged from 8.6 to 33.1 Mg ha(-1), and aboveground-total/coarse root biomass ratio (i.e., T/R) ranged from 1.5 to 2.6. The variation was mainly due to trade-offs between stem and root biomass. Average T/R was about 2.3 that was calculated for some reported L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi stands (n = 16), including our four stands. This average T/R was extremely small in comparison to that (5.1) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on the non- or discontinuous permafrost regions in Siberia. This finding strongly suggested that the two Larix species invested annual carbon gains largely into root growth. We discussed its ecological implications in relation to stand structure and permafrost soil-N conditions in the larch taiga ecosystem. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

At Harvard Forest, chronic N fertilization has decreased organic soil microbial biomass C (MBC) by an average of 54% and substrate induced respiration (SIR) was decreased by an average of 45% in hardwood stands. In the pine stand, organic soil MBC was decreased by 40% and SIR decreased by an average of 35%. The fungal: bacterial activity ratio was also decreased in the hardwood stands from an average of 1.5 in the control plot to 1.0 in the High-N plot, and in the pine stands from 1.9 in control plot to 1.0 in the High-N stand. At Mt. Ascutney, MBC was reduced by an average of 59% and SIR by 52% in the High N plots relative to the unfertilized plots, and the fungal: bacteria] activity ratio was only slightly decreased. The Bear Brook watershed is in an earlier stage of N saturation (Stage 0-1) and did not exhibit significant fertilization effects on microbial biomass. Across all three sites, MBC and SIR had negative relationships with total N inputs in both mineral soils and organic soils, though the effect was much stronger in organic soils. Both MBC and SIR were positively correlated with dissolved organic C, total soil C, and bulk soil C:N ratios. These results are consistent with the N saturation hypothesis, but do not indicate a strong role for microbial N immobilization in preventing N loss. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We used quantitative soil pits to describe rooting patterns with soil depth and distance to trees in northern hardwood stands. We sited three 0.5 m(2) quantitative soil pits in each of three young (19-27 years) and three older (56-69 years) stands developed after clear-cutting. Live roots were divided into diameter classes delimited at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 100 mm; dead roots were not distinguished by size. Mean total live-root biomass was 2900 +/- 500 g.m(-2) in older stands and 1500 +/- 400 g.m(2) in young stands. The root mass in the 2-20 mm class was 2.7 times greater in the older stands (p = 0.03); fine-root (< 2 mm) biomass was 1.5 times greater (p = 0.12), suggesting that fine-root biomass continues to increase past the age of canopy closure in this forest type. Root biomass density declined with soil depth, with the finest roots (< 0.5 mm) declining most steeply; roots were found at low densities well into the C horizon. We analyzed root biomass density as a function of the influence of nearby trees (represented as the sum of basal area divided by the distance from the pit) and found that fine as well as coarse roots reflected this influence. In systems where this is the case. root measurements should be made with attention to patterns of tree distribution.","SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Park, BB (reprint author), SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 205 Marshall Hall,1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",bbpark@syr.edu,"Yanai, Ruth D./O-3250-2019","Yanai, Ruth D./0000-0001-6987-2489; Park, Byung Bae/0000-0002-0620-7374",,,,23,62,67,2,25,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Effects of within-AMF species or within-population variation on plant growth have received less attention. High genetic variation exists within AMF populations. However, it is unknown whether genetic variation contributes to differences in plant growth. In our study, a population of AMF was cultivated under identical conditions for several generations prior to the experiments thus avoiding environmental maternal effects. We show that genetically different Glomus intraradices isolates from one AMF population significantly alter plant growth in an axenic system and in greenhouse experiments. Isolates increased or reduced plant growth meaning that plants potentially receive benefits or are subject to costs by forming associations with different individuals in the AMF population. This shows that genetic variability in AMF populations could affect host-plant fitness and should be considered in future research to understand these important soil organisms.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland.",ian.sanders@unil.ch,"Croll, Daniel/B-4933-2008; Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; Croll, Daniel/C-1661-2018","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Croll, Daniel/0000-0002-2072-380X",,,,27,137,144,2,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

While photosynthesis is a single process with a well-established theoretical underpinning, respiration integrates the variety of plant and microbial processes by which CO2 returns from ecosystems to the atmosphere. Limits to current capacity for predicting ecosystem respiration fluxes across biomes or years result from the mismatch between what is usually measured - bulk CO2 fluxes - and what process-based models can predict - fluxes of CO2 from plant (autotrophic) or microbial (heterotrophic) respiration. Papers in this Thematic Issue and in the recent literature, document advances in methods for separating respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components using three approaches: (1) continuous measurements of CO2 fluxes and assimilation of these data into process-based models; (2) application of isotope measurements, particularly radiocarbon; and (3) manipulation experiments. They highlight the role of allocation of C fixed by plants to respiration, storage, growth or transfer to other organisms as a control of seasonal and interannual variability in soil respiration and the oxidation state of C in the terrestrial biosphere. A second theme is the potential for comparing C isotope signatures in organic matter, CO2 evolved in incubations and microbial biomarkers to elucidate the pathways (respiration, recycling, or transformation) of C during decomposition. Together, these factors determine the continuum of timescales over which C is returned to the atmosphere by respiration and enable testing of theories of plant and microbial respiration that go beyond empirical models and allow predictions of future respiration responses to future change in climate, pollution and land use.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Trumbore, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",setrumbo@uci.edu,"Trumbore, Susan/B-1948-2013",,,,,82,334,404,10,207,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In order to minimize disturbance to the soil and maximize preservation of the natural relationships among roots, rhizospheric microorganisms, and decomposers, we conducted a girdling experiment in a subalpine forest dominated by lodgepole pine trees. In two separate years, we girdled trees in small forest plots (5-7 m in diameter) and trenched around the plots to sever invading roots in order to experimentally stop the transport of photosynthate from needles to roots, and eliminate rhizospheric respiration. Soil respiration rates in plots with trees girdled over 1 year prior to measurement were higher than those in plots with trees girdled 2-3 months prior to measurement. These results suggest that any stimulation of respiration because of the experimental artifact of fine root death and addition of labile carbon to the pool of decomposer substrates is slow, and occurs beyond the first growing season after girdling. Compared with control plots with nongirdled trees, soil respiration rates in plots with girdled trees were reduced by 31-44% at the mid-summer respiratory maximum. An extreme drought during one of the 2 years used for observations caused greater reductions in the heterotrophic component of soil respiration compared with the rhizospheric component. In control plots, we observed a pulse in K(2)SO(4)-extractable carbon during the spring snowmelt period, which was absent in plots with girdled trees. In control plots, soil microbial biomass increased from spring to summer, coincident with a seasonal increase in the rhizospheric component of soil respiration. In plots with girdled trees, the seasonal increase in microbial biomass was lower than in control plots. These results suggest that the observed seasonal increase in rhizospheric respiration rate in control plots was because of an increase in rhizospheric microbial biomass following 'soil priming' by a spring-time pulse in dissolved organic carbon. Winter-time, beneath-snow microbial biomass was relatively high in control plots. Soil sucrose concentrations were approximately eight times higher during winter than during spring or summer, possibly being derived from the mechanical damage of shallow roots that use sucrose as protection against low-temperature extremes. The winter-time sucrose pulse was not observed in plots with girdled trees. The results of this study demonstrate that (1) the rhizospheric component of soil respiration rate at this site is significant in magnitude, (2) the heterotrophic component of soil respiration rate is more susceptible to seasonal drought than the rhizospheric component, and (3) the trees in this ecosystem exert a major control over soil carbon dynamics by 'priming' the soil with sugar exudates during the late-spring snowmelt period and releasing high concentrations of sucrose to the soil during winter.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Monson, RK (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Russell.Monson@colorado.edu,,,,,,49,202,223,3,130,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Radiocarbon signatures of live and dead fine (< 2 mm diameter) roots in two mature Amazon tropical forests are consistent with average ages of 4-11 years (ranging from < 1 to > 40 years). Measurements of C-14 in the structural tissues of roots known to have grown during 2002 demonstrate that new roots are constructed from recent (< 2-year-old) photosynthetic products. High Delta C-14 values in live roots most likely indicate the mean lifetime of the root rather than the isotopic signature of inherited C or C taken up from the soil. Estimates of the mean residence time of C in forest fine roots (inventory divided by loss rate) are substantially shorter (1-3 years) than the age of standing fine root C stocks obtained from radiocarbon (4-11 years). By assuming positively skewed distributions for root ages, we can effectively decouple the mean age of C in live fine roots (measured using C-14) from the rate of C flow through the live root pool, and resolve these apparently disparate estimates of root C dynamics. Explaining the C-14 values in soil pore space CO2, in addition, requires that a portion of the decomposing roots be cycled through soil organic matter pools with decadal turnover time.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Lab Ecol Isotop, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; IPAM, Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, BR-66035170 Belem, Para, Brazil; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA","Trumbore, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",setrumbo@uci.edu,"Silver, Whendee L./H-1118-2012; Trumbore, Susan/B-1948-2013; Camargo, Plinio/D-6635-2012; Martinelli, Luiz/F-7870-2011","Silver, Whendee L./0000-0003-0372-8745; Martinelli, Luiz/0000-0002-7103-7551",,,,28,95,105,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Three chronosequences were established on calcareous and three on acidic bedrocks. Stand elevation and mean annual precipitation of the chronosequences were different. Maximum stand age was 93 years on acid and 112 years on calcareous bedrocks. Stem biomass increased with stand age and reached values of 250-400 t C ha(-1) in the oldest successional stands. On acidic bedrocks, the organic layers accumulated linearly during forest succession at a rate of 0.34 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). On calcareous bedrocks, a maximum carbon stock in the humus layers was reached at an age of 60 years. Total carbon stocks in stem biomass, organic layers and the mineral soil increased during forest development from 75 t C ha(-1) in the meadows to 350 t C ha(-1) in the oldest successional forest stands (2.75 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Carbon sequestration occurred in stem biomass and in the organic layers (0.34 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)on acid bedrock), while mineral soil carbon stocks declined. Mineral soil carbon stocks were larger in areas with higher precipitation. During forest succession, mineral soil carbon stocks of the upper 50 cm decreased until they reached approximately 80% of the meadow level and increased slightly thereafter. Carbon dynamics in soil layers were examined by a process model. Results showed that sustained input of meadow fine roots is the factor, which most likely reduces carbon losses in the upper 10 cm. Carbon losses in 10-20 cm depth were lower on acidic than on calcareous bedrocks. In this depth, continuous dissolved organic carbon inputs and low soil respiration rates could promote carbon sequestration following initial carbon loss. At least 80 years are necessary to regain former stock levels in the mineral soil. Despite the comparatively larger amount of carbon stored in the regrowing vegetation, afforestation projects under the Kyoto protocol should also aim at the preservation or increase of carbon in the mineral soil regarding its greater stability of compared with stocks in biomass and humus layers.

These selective constraints can be explored through the study of nucleotide polymorphism at loci controlling specificity. The membrane-anchored receptor NORK (nodulation receptor kinase) of the legume Medicago truncatula controls early steps of root infection by two symbiotic microorganisms: nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) and endomycorrhizal fungi (Glomales). We analyzed the diversity of the gene NORK by sequencing 4 kilobases in 28 inbred lines sampled from natural populations. We detected 33 polymorphic sites with only one nonsynonymous change. Analysis based on Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H summary statistics revealed no departure from the neutral model. We analyzed divergence using sequences from the closely related species M. coerulea. The McDonald-Kreitman test indicated a significant excess of nonsynonymous changes contributing to this divergence. Furthermore, maximum-likelihood analysis of a molecular phylogeny of a few legume species indicated that a number of amino acid sites, likely located in the receptor domain of the protein, evolved under the regime of positive selection. Further research should focus on the rate and direction of molecular coevolution between microorganisms' signaling molecules and legumes' receptors.","Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 1097, Diversite & Genome Plantes Cultivees, Montpellier, France; Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 5171, Genome Populat Interact Adaptat, Montpellier, France; Aarhus Univ, Dept Genet & Ecol, Bioinformat Res Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark","De Mita, S (reprint author), INRA, Stn Genet & Ameliorat Plantes, Domaine Melgueil, F-34130 Mauguio, France.",demita@ensam.inra.fr,,"Bataillon, Thomas/0000-0002-4730-2538",,,,42,22,22,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0022-2844,,,J MOL EVOL,J.

Strains with various abilities to form mycorrhizae were analysed by comparative genomic hybridizations using a cDNA microarray containing 1076 putative unique genes of P. involutus. To screen for genes diverging at an enhanced and presumably non-neutral rate, we implemented a simple rate test using information from both the variations in hybridizations signal and data on sequence divergence of the arrayed genes relative to the genome of Coprinus cinereus. C. cinereus is a free-living saprophyte and is the closest evolutionary relative to P. involutus that has been fully sequenced. Approximately 17% of the genes investigated were detected as rapidly diverging within Paxillus. Furthermore, 6% of the genes varied in copy numbers between the analysed strains. Genome rearrangements associated with this variation including duplications and deletions may also play a role in adaptive evolution. The cohort of divergent and duplicated genes showed an over-representation of either orphans, genes whose products are located at membranes, or genes encoding for components of stress/defence reactions. Some of the identified genomic changes may be associated with the variation in host specificity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The proposed procedure could be generally applicable to screen for rapidly evolving genes in closely related strains or species where at least one has been sequenced or characterized by expressed sequence tag analysis.","Lund Univ, Dept Microbial Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Complex Syst Div, Dept Theoret Phys, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Tunlid, A (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Microbial Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.tunlid@mbioekol.lu.se,"Johansson, Tord/Y-6869-2019; Rajashekar, Balaji/W-8012-2018","Johansson, Tord/0000-0002-6945-716X; Rajashekar, Balaji/0000-0002-1665-5584; Le Quere, Antoine/0000-0001-7470-5730",,,,51,29,31,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Exceptionally high productivity occurs in toe-slope positions, and has been ascribed to influx of N from surrounding areas and higher rates of soil N turnover in situ. Despite large apparent natural variations in forest productivity, rates of gross soil N mineralization and gross nitrification have never been compared in Fennoscandian boreal forests of contrasting productivity. We report contrasting patterns of soil N turnover in three model ecosystems, representing the range in soil C-to-N ratios (19-41) in Fennoscandian boreal forests and differences in forest productivity by a factor close to 3. Gross N mineralization was seven times higher when soil, microbial, and plant C-to-N ratios were the lowest compared to the highest. This process, nitrification and potential denitrification correlated with inorganic, total and microbial biomass N, but not microbial C. There was a constant ratio between soil and microbial C-to-N ratio of 3.7 +/- 0.2, across wide ratios of soil C-to-N and fungi-to-bacteria. Soil N-cycling should be controlled by the supplies of C and N to the microbes. In accordance with plant allocation theory, we discuss the possibility that the high fungal biomass at high soil C-to-N ratio reflects a particularly high supply of plant photosynthates, substrates of high-quality C, to mycorrhizal fungi. Methods to study soil N turnover and N retention should be developed to take into account the impact of mycorrhizal fungi on soil N-cycling.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Climate Impact Res Ctr, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Hogberg, MN (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",mona.n.hogberg@sek.slu.se,"Hogberg, Mona N/L-9635-2014; Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Myrold, David/E-1813-2011; Myrold, David/Q-6694-2019","Hogberg, Mona N/0000-0003-1258-7630; Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X; Myrold, David/0000-0001-6418-226X",,,,75,52,52,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2006,147,1,,,,,96,107,,10.1007/s00442-005-0253-7,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,002HB,WOS:000234601000012,16193295,,,,10/31/19J,"Derner, JD; Boutton, TW; Briske, DD",,,,"Derner, JD; Boutton, TW; Briske, DD",,,Grazing and ecosystem carbon storage in the North American Great Plains,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,delta C-13; C isotope signatures; carbon storage; grazing; Great Plains; soil organic carbon,SHORTGRASS STEPPE; SOIL CARBON; PERENNIAL GRASSES; ORGANIC-MATTER; MIXED-GRASS; PLANT; NITROGEN; C-4; HERBIVORY; PATTERNS,"Isotopic signatures of C-13 were used to quantify the relative contributions of C-3 and C-4 plants to whole-ecosystem C storage (soil+plant) in grazed and ungrazed sites at three distinct locations (short-, mid- and tallgrass communities) along an east-west environmental gradient in the North American Great Plains. Functional group composition of plant communities, the source and magnitude of carbon inputs, and total ecosystem carbon storage displayed inconsistent responses to long-term livestock grazing along this gradient. C-4 plants [primarily Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag ex Steud.] dominated the long-term grazed site in the shortgrass community, whereas the ungrazed site was co-dominated by C-3 and C-4 species; functional group composition did not differ between grazed and ungrazed sites in the mid- and tallgrass communities. Above-ground biomass was lower, but the relative proportion of fine root biomass was greater, in grazed compared to ungrazed sites at all three locations. The grazed site of the shortgrass community had 24% more whole-ecosystem carbon storage compared to the ungrazed site (4022 vs. 3236 g C m(-2)). In contrast, grazed sites at the mid- and tallgrass communities had slightly lower (8%) whole-ecosystem carbon storage compared to ungrazed sites (midgrass: 7970 vs. 8683 g C m(-2); tallgrass: 8273 vs. 8997 g C m(-2)). Differential responses between the shortgrass and the mid- and tallgrass communities with respect to grazing and whole-ecosystem carbon storage are likely a result of: (1) maintenance of larger soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in the mid- and tallgrass communities (7476-8280 g C m(-2)) than the shortgrass community (2517-3307 g C m(-2)) that could potentially buffer ecosystem carbon fluxes, (2) lower root carbon/soil carbon ratios in the mid- and tallgrass communities (0.06-0.10) compared to the shortgrass community (0.20-0.27) suggesting that variation in root organic matter inputs would have relatively smaller effects on the size of the SOC pool, and (3) the absence of grazing-induced variation in the relative proportion of C-3 and C-4 functional groups in the mid- and tallgrass communities. We hypothesize that the magnitude and proportion of fine root mass within the upper soil profile is a principal driver mediating the effect of community composition on the biogeochemistry of these grassland ecosystems.","USDA ARS, High Plains Grasslands Res Stn, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecol & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Derner, JD (reprint author), USDA ARS, High Plains Grasslands Res Stn, 8404 Hildreth Rd, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA.",Justin.Derner@ars.usda.gov,"Boutton, Thomas W./C-5821-2016","Boutton, Thomas W./0000-0002-7522-5728",,,,60,123,147,3,111,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2006,280,2-Jan,,,,,77,90,,10.1007/s11104-005-2554-3,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,015UF,WOS:000235575900009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Soethe, N; Lehmann, J; Engels, C",,,,"Soethe, N; Lehmann, J; Engels, C",,,Root morphology and anchorage of six native tree species from a tropical montane forest and an elfin forest in Ecuador,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,aspect ratio; buttress; root architecture; root asymmetry; slope; stilt root,PINUS-PINASTER AIT.; CLOUD FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS; STABILITY; GROWTH; SYLVESTRIS; STRENGTH; STANDS,"Root architecture of tree species was investigated at two different altitudes in tropical forests in Ecuador. Increasing altitude was accompanied by higher wind speeds and more shallow soils, while slope angles of both sites were comparable (20-50 degrees). Three tree species typical for the montane forest at 1900 m (Graffenrieda emarginata (Ruiz & Pav.) Triana (Melastomataceae), Clethra revoluta (Ruiz & Pav.) Spreng. (Clethraceae), Vismia tomentosa Ruiz & Pav. (Clusiaceae)) and for the elfin forest at 3000 m (Weinmannia loxensis Harling (Cunoniaceae), Clusia spec. (Clusiacaea) Styrax foveolaria Perkins (Styraceae)) were examined. At 1900 m, 92% of the trees grew upright, in comparison to 52% at 3000 m. At 3000 m, 48% of the trees were inclined, lying or even partly uprooted. At this altitude, all trees with tap roots or with shoots connected by coarse rhizomes, 83% of the trees with stilt roots, and 50% of the trees in which stems or roots were supported by other trees grew upright, suggesting that these characteristics were relevant for tree stability. Root system morphology differed markedly between altitudes. In contrast to 1900 m, where 20% of structural roots originated in the deeper mineral soil, root origin at 3000 m was restricted to the forest floor. The mean ratio of root cross sectional area to tree height decreased significantly from 6.1 x 10(-3)m(2)m(-1) at 1900 m to 3.2 x 10(-3)m(2)m(-1) at 3000 m. The extent of root asymmetry increased significantly from 0.29 at 1900 m to 0.62 at 3000 m. This was accompanied by a significantly lower number of dominant roots at 3000 m (2.3 compared to 3.8 at 1900 m). In conclusion, native tree species growing in tropical montane and elfin forests show a variety of root traits that improve tree stability. Root system asymmetry is less important for tree stability where anchorage is provided by a deep and solid root-soil plate. When deep rooting is impeded, root traits improving the horizontal extension of the root-soil plate are more pronounced or occur more frequently. Furthermore, mutual mechanical support of roots and stems of neighboring trees seems to be an appropriate mechanism to provide anchorage in soils with low bulk density and in environments with high wind speeds.","Humboldt Univ, Dept Plant Nutr & Fertilizat, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Soethe, N (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Plant Nutr & Fertilizat, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",Nathalie.Soethe@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Lehmann, Johannes/H-2682-2014","Lehmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4701-2936",,,,38,30,30,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2006,279,2-Jan,,,,,173,185,,10.1007/s11104-005-1005-5,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,012LL,WOS:000235340600017,,,,,10/31/19J,"LeCain, DR; Morgan, JA; Milchunas, DG; Mosier, AR; Nelson, JA; Smith, DP",,,,"LeCain, DR; Morgan, JA; Milchunas, DG; Mosier, AR; Nelson, JA; Smith, DP",,,"Root biomass of individual species, and root size characteristics after five years of CO2 enrichment on native shortgrass steppe",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,CO2; forage; grass species; grassland; monolith; roots,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; WATER RELATIONS; SEMIARID GRASSLAND; C-4 GRASSES; DYNAMICS; SOIL; RESPONSES; PRODUCTIVITY; SEEDLINGS; ECOSYSTEM,"Information from field studies investigating the responses of roots to increasing atmospheric CO2 is limited and somewhat inconsistent, due partly to the difficulty in studying root systems in situ. In this report, we present standing root biomass of species and root length and diameter after five years of CO2 enrichment (similar to 720 mu mol mol(-1)) in large (16 m(2) ground area) open-top chambers placed over a native shortgrass steppe in Colorado, USA. Total root biomass in 100 cm longx20 cm widex75 cm depth soil monoliths and root biomass of the three dominant grass species of the site were not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Root biomass of Stipa comata in the 0-20 cm soil depth was nearly 100% greater in elevated vs. ambient CO2 chambers, but this was not statistically significant (P=0.14). However, there was a significant 37% increase in fine root length under elevated CO2 in the 0-10 cm soil depth layer. Other reports from this study suggest that the increase in fine roots is primarily from improved seedling recruitment of S. comata under elevated CO2. Few treatment differences in root length or diameter were detected in lower 10 cm depth increments, to 80 cm. These results reflect the root status integrated over two wet, two dry and one normal precipitation years and approximately one complete cycle of root turn-over on the shortgrass steppe. We conclude that increasing atmospheric CO2 will have only small effects on standing root biomass and root length and diameter of most shortgrasss steppe species. However, the potential increased competitive ability of Stipa comata, a low forage quality species, could alter the ecosystem from the current dominant, high forage quality species, Bouteloua gracilis. B. gracilis is very well adapted to the frequent droughts of the shortgrass steppe. Increased competitive ability of less desirable plant species under increasing atmospheric CO2 will have large implications for long-term sustainability of grassland ecosystems.","USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Florida, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; N Carolina State Univ, USDA ARS, SNFR, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","LeCain, DR (reprint author), USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",dan.lecain@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,25,28,30,3,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2006,279,2-Jan,,,,,219,228,,10.1007/s11104-005-2301-9,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,012LL,WOS:000235340600021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Collet, C; Lof, M; Pages, L",,,,"Collet, C; Lof, M; Pages, L",,,Root system development of oak seedlings analysed using an architectural model.

The model is based on a root typology and the implementation of a series of developmental processes (axial and radial growth, branching, reiteration, decay and abscission). Parameters describing the different processes are estimated for each root type. Young oak seedlings were grown for 4 years in bare soil or with grass competition and were periodically excavated for root system observation and measurements (topology of the root system, length and diameter of all roots with a diameter greater than 0.3 mm). In the fourth year, 40 cm x20 cm x20 cm soil monoliths were excavated for fine root measurement (root density and root length). Root spatial development was analysed on a sub-sample of roots selected on four seedlings. The model was a guideline that provided a complete and consistent set of parameters to represent root system development. It gave a comprehensive view of the root systems and made it possible to quantify the effects of competition on the different root growth processes. The same root typology was used to describe the seedlings in bare soil and in grass. Five root types were defined, from large tap roots to fine roots. Root system size was considerably reduced by grass competition. Branching density was not affected but the branch roots were always smaller for the seedlings grown in competition. Reiteration capacity was also reduced by competition. Cross sectional areas before and after branching were linearly related with a scaling coefficient close to 1, as predicted by the pipe model theory. This relationship was not affected by grass competition.","INRA, LERFoB, F-54280 Seichamps, France; So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; INRA, Unite PSH, F-84914 Avignon, France","Collet, C (reprint author), INRA, LERFoB, F-54280 Seichamps, France.",collet@nancy.inra.fr,"Pages, Loic/F-9893-2011",,,,,53,34,35,2,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2006,279,2-Jan,,,,,367,383,,10.1007/s11104-005-2419-9,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,012LL,WOS:000235340600032,,,,,10/31/19J,"Petersson, H; Stahl, G",,,,"Petersson, H; Stahl, G",,,"Functions for below-ground biomass of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula pendula and Betula publescens in Sweden",SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,boreal; carbon; birch; Kyoto Protocol; Norway spruce; prediction; root; root system; Scots pine; stump; UNFCCC,CARBON; FORESTS,"Accurate estimates of below-ground biomass of trees are important when quantifying the amount of carbon sequestered in forests.

B.S.P.) stands based on the maximization of net production. This objective was attained via the development of an allometrically extended stand density management diagram (SDMD), which was used to describe the mass dynamics of biotic and abiotic tree components by initial density regime, site quality and fine root turnover rate. Specifically, periderm, stem, branch, foliage and abiotic crown masses were estimated employing multivariate allometric regression functions based on data derived from 125 destructively sampled trees. Below-ground mass estimates were obtained using generalized allometric relationships derived from the literature. Abiotic masses included three basic components: (1) allometrically estimated retained woody debris consisting of abiotic crown structures that remained attached to the main stem; (2) fine woody debris arising from needle loss, root turnover, and abscission of modular components; (3) coarse woody debris arising from trees which incurred mortality through self-thinning. The algorithmic version of the model (1) simultaneously calculates periodic annual net production estimates (Mg/ha/year) by 10-year intervals over 100-year rotation lengths for eight initial density conditions, (2) given (1), determines the occupancy level for which net production is maximized for each stage of development (decade interval), and (3) given (2), determines the optimal size-density trajectory within the context of a SDMD. Additionally, results derived from multiple model simulations employing a range of initial densities (1500, 1650,..., 16,350 stems/ha), site indices (9, 10,..., 15 m) and fine root turnover rates (0.2, 0.3,...,0.8 proportion/year), indicated that black spruce productivity was maximized when site occupancies were maintained slightly below the zone of imminent competition mortality.

In our study, we measured dry matter accumulation (DMA), total projected leaf area (LA), specific projected leaf area (SLA), root/shoot ratio (RS), root mass/projected leaf area ratio (R/LA), projected leaf area/stem cross-sectional area ratio (LA/SA), leaf stomatal density (SD), stomatal length (SL) and total stomatal length (TSL), nitrogen content per unit leaf mass (N-mass) and nitrogen content per unit projected leaf area (N-area), and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13). Significant differences in these properties among the populations were detected, but these morphological and physiological responses to altitudinal gradients of origins varied non-linearly with increasing altitude. We found that seed source near 2950 m altitude was likely an optimum zone for P. asperata; growth was most vigorous at this altitude, and with increasing altitudinal distance from this optimum the growth decrease. In addition, seedling early growth, including DMA and LA. negatively correlated with RS, R/LA, N-mass, N-area, and delta C-13, and positively correlated with SLA, LA/SA, SD, SL and TSL. Our results provided strong evidence that variations in these physiological and morphological properties of P. asperata populations reflected genetic adaptations to native habitats. These differences may be used as criteria for genotype selection in the mountains of southwestern China. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial distribution of biomass,necromass and morphology parameters of the fine roots (diameter classes < 1, 1-2, < 2 mm) of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were analysed in response to fertilisation with granulated wood ash (GWA) in a long-term field experiment in SW Sweden. GWA was applied as a single dose of 3200 kg ha(-1) and the fine roots were sampled 9 years later by soil coring. Soil cores were divided into 1-cm strata within the top 0-2.5 cm humus limits, the lower humus below 2.5 cm (with varying thickness) and the mineral soil to 50 cm depth (from ground surface). Total fine-root biomass in the GWA treatment, 256 +/- 20 and 258 +/- 25 g m(-2): respectively, and length 2072 +/- 182 and 1800 +/- 198 m m(-2), respectively, did not differ statistically from each other. Total fine-root necromass in the 1-2 mm fraction was significantly higher in C than in the GWA treatment, 130 +/- 12 and 80 +/- 10 g m(-2), respectively. Fine-root biomass in the < 1 mm fraction was significantly greater in the lower humus in the GWA treatment, but this did not affect the total biomass in the < 1 mm fraction in the whole soil profile. The biomass-to-necromass ratio (1-2 mm) was significantly higher in the GWA treatment in the 0-30 cm soil layer than in the corresponding layer of the control. Specific root length (SRL) was lower in the GWA treatment than in the control in the 0-5 cm soil layer. The lower necromass and SRL were more clearly related to the GWA treatment, whereas the difference in the vertical distribution of biomass may have been related to the thicker humus layer in the GWA plots.

A plantation located in Rotto (Department of Linguere Senegal) containing 80 similar 10-year-old trees was identified The distance between each tree planted was about 5 m. Soil analysis showed soil characteristics were not different within the plantation. The plantation was divided into two parts: one part where the 10-year-old frees were inoculated at the beginning of the rainy season (August 2002 and August 2003) with 1 L of a liquid inoculum prepared with dried alginate beads containing a mixture of selected rhizobial strains (CIRADF 300, CIRADF 301 and CIRADF 302). The taping was done at the same intensity on each tree and when the leaves started to fall. The gum-arabic production was measured for every tree during two years (December 2002/April 2003 and December 2003/April 2004). The rainfall the first year was low, about 250 mm. The effect of the inoculation was assessed in terms of percentage of trees producing gum and amount of gum-arabic produced Results were not significantly different (P <= 0.05). Before the second rainy season, mature trees from the inoculated plot were reinoculated and tree taping accomplished. The annual rainfall the second year was around 440 mm. Data suggested that gum-arabic yield of inoculated trees was significantly higher compared to the noninoculated tree gum-arabic yields. We can assume that the inoculation of 10-year old-trees will enhance the gum-arabic yield under natural conditions.","World Agroforestry Ctr, Forest Dept CIRAD,Lab Commun Microbiol, UCAD,IRD,ISRA,UPR Ecosyst Plantat 80, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst CIAT, Nairobi, Kenya","Lesueur, D (reprint author), World Agroforestry Ctr, Forest Dept CIRAD,Lab Commun Microbiol, UCAD,IRD,ISRA,UPR Ecosyst Plantat 80, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst CIAT, POB 30677, Nairobi, Kenya.",d.lesueur@cgiar.org,,,,,,8,7,7,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,1532-4990,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

Biolog Ecoplates were used to determine the community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) in the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples. CLPP were summarized as AWCD (average well color development, OD 48h(-1)). The rhizosphere/bulk soil ratio of AWCD was an order higher in the 4-yr-old stand than in the first year after planting or in middle-aged stands. The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and basal respiration (BAS) of bulk soil samples were measured, and the metabolic quotient q(CO2)=BAS/SIR was calculated. Short root morphological studies were carried out using WinRHIZO (TM) Pro 2003b. SIR increased from 0.23 to 2.73 mgCg(-1), while q(CO2) and mean specific root length (SRI, m g(-1)) decreased with increasing stand age (from 1 to 26 years) from 0.51 to 0.25, and from 172 to 90 in g(-1) respectively. Soil pH decreased 1 unit during the first 26 years. According to efficient adaptive strategies, the survival and productivity of black alder stands on oil shale mining areas are high, and hence black alder is a perspective tree species for the afforestation of these areas.","[Lohmus, K.; Ostonen, I.; Alama, S.; Rosenvald, K.; Mander, U.] Univ Tartu, Inst Geog, Tartu, Estonia; [Truu, J.; Truu, M.] Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, Tartu, Estonia; [Kaar, E.; Kuznetsova, T.; Vares, A.; Uri, V.] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Tartu, Estonia","Lohmus, K (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Geog, Tartu, Estonia.",,"Truu, Jaak/H-1323-2015; Ostonen, Ivika/G-9874-2015; Rosenvald, Katrin/F-7501-2017; Mander, Ulo/H-3228-2015","Truu, Jaak/0000-0003-1818-6678; Ostonen, Ivika/0000-0001-9043-6083; Rosenvald, Katrin/0000-0001-7392-3867; Mander, Ulo/0000-0003-2340-6989; Uri, Veiko/0000-0002-1774-4079","Ministry of Education and Science of EstoniaMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [0182534s03]; Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [6011]",This study was supported by Target Funding Project No. 0182534s03 of the Ministry of Education and Science of Estonia and Grant No. 6011 from the Estonian Science Foundation.

Most of the belowground biomass in older loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests is in coarse roots, and coarse roots persist longer after harvest than aboveground biomass and fine roots. The main objective was to assess the carbon accumulation in coarse roots of a loblolly pine plantation that was subjected to different levels of management intensity. Total belowground biomass ranged from 56.4 to 62.4 Mt.ha(-1) and was not affected by treatment. Vegetation control and disking increased pine taproot biomass,and decreased hardwood taproot biomass. Pines between tree coarse roots were unaffected by treatment, but hardwoods between tree coarse roots were significantly reduced by vegetation control. Necromass was substantially lower than between-tree biomass, indicating that decomposition of coarse-root biomass from the previous stand was rapid for between-tree coarse roots. Total aboveground biomass was increased by vegetation control, with the lowest production on the least intensively managed plots (180.2 Mt.ha(-1)) and the highest production on the most intensively managed plots (247.3 Mt.ha(-1)). Coarse-root biomass ranged from 19% to 24% of total biomass. Silvicultural practices increasing aboveground pine productivity did not increase total coarse-root biomass carbon because of the difference in root/shoot allocation between pine and hardwood species.","James W Sewall Co, Charlotte, NC 28210 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Forest Nutr Cooperat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; USDA, Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Miller, AT (reprint author), James W Sewall Co, 200-10035 Pk Cedar Dr, Charlotte, NC 28210 USA.",Ashley.Miller@jws.com,,,,,,67,32,33,0,10,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

So far, the majority of studies have focused on AG induced responses. Possible interactions between AG and BG induced responses have only recently received scientific attention. On the one hand, induction in one plant part may result in systemically induced responses in other parts. On the other hand, simultaneously occurring AG and BG induced responses may interfere, for example, when the activities of root feeders alter the effectiveness of induced responses against lcaf feeders. In both cases, AG-BG interactions between induced responses may affect the amount of damage to a plant and therefore constitute an important selection pressure in the evolution of optimal plant-defence strategies. Here we present a new concept for the integration of AG and BG induced responses in current optimal-defence theory. First, we will consider differences in physiology and morphology between roots and shoots, which relate to their different roles in resource acquisition and which are important in interactions with their environment. Then, we will evaluate how general principles emerging from current theories and mathematical models of optimal AG induced plant defences can be applied to BG induced responses, as well as to their interactions with AG responses. Finally, we argue that plants integrate the information that is communicated by roots and shoots to optimize plant fitness in a multitrophic context.","[Van Dam, Nicole M.; Bezemer, T.

Here, we present a six-year record of N dynamics of a sweetgunt (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to elevated [CO2] in the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We also evaluate the concept of PNL for this ecosystem from the perspective of N uptake, content, distribution, and turnover, and N-use efficiency. Leaf N content was 11% lower on a leaf mass basis (N-M) and 7% lower on a leaf area basis (N-A) in CO2-enriched trees. However, there was no effect of [CO2] on total canopy N content. Resorption of N during senescence was not altered by [CO2], so N-M of litter, but not total N content, was reduced. The N, of fine roots was not affected, but the total amount of N required for fine-root production increased significantly, reflecting the large stimulation of fine-root production in this stand. Hence, total N requirement of the trees was higher in elevated [CO2], and the increased requirement was met through an increase in N uptake rather than increased retranslocation of stored reserves. Increased N uptake was correlated with increased net primary productivity (NPP). N-use efficiency, however, did not change with CO2 enrichment because increased N productivity was offset by lower mean residence time of N in the trees. None of the measured responses of plant N dynamics in this ecosystem indicated the occurrence of PNL, and the stimulation of NPP by elevated [CO2] was sustained for the first six years of the experiment. Although there are some indications of developing changes in the N economy, the N supply in the soil at this site may be sufficient to meet an increasing demand for available N, especially as the roots of CO2-enriched trees explore deeper in the soil profile.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Norby, RJ (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",rjn@ornl.gov,"Iversen, Colleen M/B-8983-2012; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012","Iversen, Colleen M/0000-0001-8293-3450; Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828",,,,36,88,90,2,68,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2006,87,1,,,,,5,14,,10.1890/04-1950,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,021XU,WOS:000236020000003,16634292,,,,10/31/19J,"Finzi, AC; Moore, DJP; DeLucia, EH; Lichter, J; Hofmockel, KS; Jackson, RB; Kim, HS; Matamala, R; McCarthy, HR; Oren, R; Pippen, JS; Schlesinger, WH",,,,"Finzi, AC; Moore, DJP; DeLucia, EH; Lichter, J; Hofmockel, KS; Jackson, RB; Kim, HS; Matamala, R; McCarthy, HR; Oren, R; Pippen, JS; Schlesinger, WH",,,Progressive nitrogen limitation of ecosystem processes under elevated CO2 in a warm-temperate forest,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated CO2; net primary production; nitrogen cycling; temperate forest,MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN; LOBLOLLY-PINE PLANTATION; FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SOIL-NITROGEN; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; EXTRACTION METHOD; ENRICHMENT; MINERALIZATION; FUMIGATION,"A hypothesis for progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) proposes that net primary production (NPP) will decline through time in ecosystems subjected to a step-function increase in atmospheric CO2. The primary mechanism driving this response is a rapid rate of N immobilization by plants and microbes under elevated CO2 that depletes soils of N, causing slower rates of N mineralization. Under this hypothesis, there is little long-term stimulation of NPP by elevated CO2 in the absence of exogenous inputs of N. We tested this hypothesis using data on the pools and fluxes of C and N in tree biomass, microbes, and soils from 1997 through 2002 collected at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. Elevated CO2 stimulated NPP by 18-24% during the first six years of this experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis for PNL, significantly more N was immobilized in tree biomass and in the O horizon under elevated CO, In contrast to the PNL hypothesis, microbial-N immobilization did not increase under elevated CO2, and although the rate of net N mineralization declined through time, the decline was not significantly more rapid under elevated CO2. Ecosystem C-to-N ratios widened more rapidly under elevated CO2 than ambient CO2 indicating a more rapid rate of C fixation per unit of N, a processes that could delay PNL in this ecosystem. Mass balance calculations demonstrated a large accrual of ecosystem N capital. Is PNL occurring in this ecosystem and will NPP decline to levels under ambient CO2? The answer depends on the relative strength of tree biomass and O-horizon N immobilization vs. widening C-to-N ratios and ecosystem-N accrual as processes that drive and delay PNL, respectively. Only direct observations through time will definitively answer this question.","Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04287 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Res, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Finzi, AC (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",afinzi@bu.edu,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019; Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016; Moore, David JP/A-6268-2013; McCarthy, Heather/Q-9347-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533; Moore, David JP/0000-0002-6462-3288; McCarthy, Heather R/0000-0002-2219-5182; Hofmockel, Kirsten/0000-0003-1586-2167",,,,49,166,174,4,119,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2006,87,1,,,,,15,25,,10.1890/04-1748,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,021XU,WOS:000236020000004,16634293,,,,10/31/19J,"Luo, YQ; Hui, DF; Zhang, DQ",,,,"Luo, YQ; Hui, DF; Zhang, DQ",,,Elevated CO2 stimulates net accumulations of carbon and nitrogen in land ecosystems: A meta-analysis,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon sequestration; ecosystem development; global change; meta-analysis; nitrogen; stoichiometry,ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FACE EXPERIMENTS; ORGANIC-MATTER; GLACIER BAY; SOIL CARBON; FOREST; SEQUESTRATION; ENRICHMENT; RESPONSES; DIOXIDE,"The capability of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon (C) plays a critical role in regulating future climatic change yet depends on nitrogen (N) availability. To predict long-term ecosystem C storage, it is essential to examine whether soil N becomes progressively limiting as C and N are sequestered in long-lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. A critical parameter to indicate the long-term progressive N limitation (PNL) is net change in ecosystem N content in association with C accumulation in plant and soil pools under elevated CO, We compiled data from 104 published papers that study C and N dynamics at ambient and elevated CO2, The compiled database contains C contents, N contents, and C:N ratio in various plant and soil pools, and root:shoot ratio. Averaged C and N pool sizes in plant and soil all significantly increase at elevated CO2 in comparison to those at ambient CO2, ranging from a 5% increase in shoot N content to a 32% increase in root C content. The C and N contents in litter pools are consistently higher in elevated than ambient CO2 among all the surveyed studies whereas C and N contents in the other pools increase in some studies and decrease in other studies. The high variability in CO, induced changes in C and N pool sizes results from diverse responses of various C and N processes to elevated CO2. Averaged C:N ratios are higher by 3% in litter and soil pools and 11% in root and shoot pools at elevated relative to ambient CO2 Elevated CO2 slightly increases root:shoot ratio. The net N accumulation in plant and soil pools at least helps prevent complete down-regulation of, and likely supports, long-term CO2 stimulation of C sequestration. The concomitant C and N accumulations in response to rising atmospheric CO2 may reflect intrinsic nature of ecosystem development as revealed before by studies of succession over hundreds to millions of years.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, So China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yluo@ou.edu,"Hui, Dafeng/A-2476-2008; Hui, Dafeng/B-1946-2008","Hui, Dafeng/0000-0002-5284-2897",,,,51,400,436,25,323,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2006,87,1,,,,,53,63,,10.1890/04-1724,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,021XU,WOS:000236020000007,16634296,,,,10/31/19J,"Niva, M; Svensson, BM; Karlsson, PS",,,,"Niva, Mikael; Svensson, Brita M.; Karlsson, P.

The most efficient responses are shortened spacers and increased branching frequency. Here we experimentally investigate the ability of the stoloniferous plant Linnaea borealis to respond to patches of increased light intensity and reduced water availability in natural systems. The significance of contrasts between patches was also investigated. A three-level factorial design was used, with light, water availability, and site as the factors. Increased light intensity was achieved through mowing of the surrounding vegetation, and reduced water availability was achieved by placing wooden ledges under the stolons. The treatments were applied at three subarctic sites that differ in light conditions. Branching frequency, number of new meristems, average internode length, leaf area, and dry weight production were studied 14 months after the manipulations. Increased light intensity increased branching frequencies; the strongest effects were obtained at the site with a closed canopy. Average intemode length decreased 19% in response to increased light intensity. Root:shoot ratios decreased under increased light intensity and reduced water availability. A reduction in water availability alone did not affect any other investigated traits. We conclude that ramets of L. borealis are able to respond efficiently to small-scale variations in light intensity in natural systems, an ability of great importance for the performance of a prostrate species on shady forest floors.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Plant Ecol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Svensson, BM (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Plant Ecol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Villavagen 14, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",brita.svensson@ebc.uu.se,"Karlsson, Staffan/J-3082-2012","Karlsson, Staffan/0000-0002-5739-5213",,,,41,6,7,0,14,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2006,13,3,,,,,318,323,,10.2980/i1195-6860-13-3-318.1,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,090OL,WOS:000240960500004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Loomis, PF; Ruess, RW; Sveinbjornsson, B; Kielland, K",,,,"Loomis, Patricia F.; Ruess, Roger W.; Sveinbjornsson, Bjartmar; Kielland, Knut",,,Nitrogen cycling at treeline: Latitudinal and elevational patterns across a boreal landscape,ECOSCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,amino acids; mineralization; nitrogen cycling; seasonal patterns; treeline; winter,FINE-ROOT DYNAMICS; AMINO-ACID; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ALPINE TUNDRA; ARCTIC TUNDRA; SOIL-NITROGEN; TAIGA FORESTS; CARBON; TEMPERATURE; ALASKA,"We studied spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen pools and fluxes in soils at treeline and forested sites within three mountain ranges across a 785-km transect in Alaska during 2001-2002. We measured pools of soil mineral (ammonium and nitrate) and organic (amino acid and microbial biomass) nitrogen, in situ rates of net mineralization, net nitrification, net amino acid production, and decomposition, as well as soil carbon turnover in a laboratory incubation experiment. Soils at treeline were mostly colder than forested soils, particularly during fall and over winter, and had reduced rates of nitrogen cycling and litter decomposition relative to forested stands. Treeline soils also had lower rates of potential respiration per unit carbon, suggesting reduced soil organic matter quality relative to forest soils. Therefore, effects of both colder temperatures and poorer substrate quality appeared to suppress rates of nitrogen turnover at treeline. Seasonal patterns of nitrogen turnover were similar across latitudes (i.e., mountain ranges). On average, 70% of total annual net nitrogen mineralization occurred from August through May, suggesting that fall and winter are critical periods for soil nitrogen transformations in both forested and treeline ecosystems. Among mountain ranges, pool sizes and fluxes of nitrogen were similar despite significant variation in growing season length and mean annual temperatures. Soil moisture and soil organic matter quality may have stronger effects on variation in nitrogen cycling than temperature at our sites.","Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA","Loomis, PF (reprint author), ABR Inc, POB 80410, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.",tloomis@abrinc.com,,,,,,67,27,30,2,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2006,13,4,,,,,544,556,,10.2980/1195-6860(2006)13[544:NCATLA]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,124CY,WOS:000243346000015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mokany, K; Raison, RJ; Prokushkin, AS",,,,"Mokany, K; Raison, RJ; Prokushkin, AS",,,Critical analysis of root: shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass; carbon accounting; critical review; global carbon stocks; root; shoot; vegetation,CANADIAN FOREST SECTOR; CARBON BUDGET MODEL; BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; PRODUCTIVITY; ALLOCATION; DEPTHS; PLANTS; WATER,"One of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the root : shoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. Previous reviews have examined root : shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable root : shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. This study reviewed root : shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. A key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. Of the 786 root : shoot ratio observations collated, 62% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. When only the reliable data were examined, root : shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height. Although a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. When the root : shoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. The use of the vegetation-specific root : shoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.","Cooperat Res Ctr Greenhouse Accounting, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Sukachev Inst Forest, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia","Mokany, K (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",karel.mokany@anu.edu.au,"Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009; Raison, Robert/E-5431-2011; Prokushkin, Anatoly/U-1603-2017","Prokushkin, Anatoly/0000-0001-8721-2142",,,,39,597,703,17,345,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Tangential bands of intercellular canals and single canals were found in the xylem of all ten species. Staining of microtome sections indicated that the chemical composition of the secretion is similar to that of ""wound-gums"". Studying the origin of the intercellular canals along the stem axis, it became obvious that the formation of the canals can be induced by wounding of the primary meristems (in particular by insect attacks of Hypsipyla spp., wounding of root tips) and by wounding of the cambium (formation of 43-100% of the intercellular canals). In fast growing trees of Carapa spp., Entandrophragma utile, and Khaya ivorensis, planted at an experimental site near Manaus, Brazil, numerous canals were found which were not induced by wounding of the meristems. In these trees an out of phase sequence of xylem cell development and high growth stresses were observed, which are hypothesised to be a further trigger for the traumatic formation of intercellular canals.","Fed Res Ctr Forestry & Forest Prod, Inst Wood Biol & Wood Preservat, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Inst Appl Bot, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany; Leiden Univ Branch, Natl Herbarium Nederland, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Dunisch, O (reprint author), Fed Res Ctr Forestry & Forest Prod, Inst Wood Biol & Wood Preservat, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",o.duenisch@holz.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,49,3,3,1,8,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0928-1541,2294-1932,,IAWA J,IAWA J.,,2006,27,3,,,,,281,297,,10.1163/22941932-90000155,,,17,Forestry,Forestry,084OJ,WOS:000240542400005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Uhlmann, E; Gorke, C; Petersen, A; Oberwinkler, F",,,,"Uhlmann, E; Gorke, C; Petersen, A; Oberwinkler, F",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizae from arid parts of Namibia,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomeromycota; species inventory; land utilization,COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SOIL FUNGI; DIVERSITY; PLANT; GLOMALES; COLONIZATION; GRASSLAND; GRASSES; SPORES; IDENTIFICATION,"Soil and root samples from three arid sites in southern Namibia were analysed for the presence of arbuscular rnycorrhizal fungi.

Rhizobial diversity from five Portuguese soils was assessed by IAR profiles and molecular methods [16S rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, direct amplified polymorphic DNA (DAPD) fingerprinting, and SDS-PAGE analysis of protein profiles]. For each analysis, a dendrogram was generated using the software BioNumerics. All three molecular methods generated analogous clustering of the isolates, supporting previous results on 16S rDNA sequence-based phylogeny. Clusters obtained with IAR profile are similar to the species groups generated with the molecular methods used. IAR groups do not correlate significantly with the geographic origin of the isolates. These results may indicate a chromosomal location of antibiotic resistance genes, and suggest that IAR is species related. DAPD and IAR profiles proved to be the most discriminating approaches in strain differentiation and can be used as fast methods to screen diversity in new isolates.","Univ Evora, Dept Biol, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; Univ Evora, Inst Ciencias Agr Mediterran, Lab Microbiol Solo, Evora, Portugal","Oliveira, S (reprint author), Univ Evora, Dept Biol, Apartado 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",ismo@uevora.pt,"Laranjo, Marta/I-6040-2012","Laranjo, Marta/0000-0002-3900-5592; Oliveira, Solange/0000-0003-4984-4805; Alexandre, Ana/0000-0001-7033-4186",,,,42,17,19,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Winds that damage forests tend to result from extra-tropical depressions or from topographically enhanced westerly air flows. Severe wind damage can occur when wind speeds exceed c. 110 km/hr, although investigating the relationship between damage and wind speeds is difficult, as gusts, for which speed is usually unrecorded, are important. Damage is often quantified by estimates of area affected, with some authors detailing the size and species of damaged trees within a given area. Key abiotic factors that influence damage patterns are topographical position, edaphic conditions, and disturbance history. Important biotic factors are tree height, tree health, position of the tree within the stand, and species. Damage type (uprooting or breakage) is primarily controlled by canopy position and rooting depth. Forest responses to wind damage include sprouting, recruitment, release, and suppression, with the dominant mode of forest recovery being strongly influenced by the severity of damage, and the species composition of the stand. As noted in international literature on wind damage, a lack of consistent methods, combined with poor species and spatial coverage, makes identifying general trends difficult. Investigating the role of wind damage in New Zealand forests has focused to date on Nothofagus forests and plantations of exotic trees and few studies have investigated long term dynamics following wind disturbance events.","Univ Auckland, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Martin, TJ (reprint author), Wildland Consultants Ltd, POB 303-376, Auckland 0751, New Zealand.",tin@wildlands.co.nz,,,,,,75,41,42,0,19,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,1177-7788,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

We present a novel root chamber (size: 90 x 70 x 30 mm) that allows growth monitoring of individual tree fine roots in the soil while altering root competition situations experimentally. Fine roots of mature trees that were carefully uncovered from the soil were allowed to grow for several months in the chamber which contained soil material from the root's close proximity. Fine root increment was quantified by optical root length determination at the beginning and the end of the experiment. By placing individual fine roots of a tree species together with a second conspecific or allospecific root, the chamber allows one to simulate conditions of intra- and interspecific competition, and to test hypotheses on intensity and direction of root competition in the soil of mixed forests. We investigated the applicability of the root chamber in a mature beech-oak mixed forest in which beech is known to be a superior competitor above-ground. One-hundred and six chambers with different combinations of beech and oak fine roots were exposed in the soil for 180 or 438d. In two-species chambers, which contained one beech and one oak root allowing for interspecific competition, beech fine roots grew significantly faster than oak roots. Furthermore, beech roots tended to show a higher growth rate in two-species chambers than in single-species chambers (two beech roots: intraspecific competition). In contrast, oak roots tended to grow slower when placed together with beech than when growing together with oak. By expressing the competitive strength of beech and oak roots with the relative competition intensity (RCI) index, evidence of asymmetric interspecific root competition in favour of beech was obtained. The potentials of this technique are related to the fact that replicated experiments with fine roots of adult trees can be conducted in the field; a certain artificiality, which is inherent to all rhizosphere experiments, represents the main limitation. From this study we conclude that while there are some Limitations, in situ root chambers represent an important step towards the experimental analysis of root competition in forests.

The communities consisted of 0, 10, or 20 spores of Glomus etunicatum and 0, 10, or 20 spores of Glomus intraradices in all possible combinations. Spores were produced by fungal cultures originating on A. gerardii in a serpentine plant community; seeds of A. gerardii were collected at the same site. The experiment was performed in the greenhouse using a mixture of sterilized serpentine soil and sand to which naturally occurring non-mycorrhizal microbes were added. There was no difference in root AMF colonization rates between single species communities of either G. etunicatum or G. intraradices, but G. intraradices enhanced plant growth and G. etunicatum did not. However, plants grew larger with some combinations of G. intraradices plus G. etunicatum than with the same quantity of G. intraradices alone. These results suggest the potential for niche complementarity in the mycorrhizal fungi. That G. etunicatum only increased plant growth in the presence of G. intraradices could be illustrative of why AMF that appear to be parasitic or benign when examined in isolation are maintained within multi-species mycorrhizal communities in nature.","Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Citadel, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29409 USA","Gustafson, DJ (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",danny.gustafson@citadel.edu,,,,,,47,46,48,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,,2006,183,2,,,,,257,263,,10.1007/s11258-005-9037-8,,,7,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,069EU,WOS:000239430000007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Quezada, IM; Gianoli, E",,,,"Quezada, Ivan M.; Gianoli, Ernesto",,,Simulated herbivory limits phenotypic responses to drought in Convolvulus demissus Choisy (Convolvulaceae),POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,6th International Conference on Dormice,"SEP, 2005","Siedlce, POLAND",,,perennials; phenotypic plasticity; resource availability; water deficit,ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; PLASTICITY; TOLERANCE; DAMAGE; STRESS; GROWTH,"Drought and herbivory are important stress factors for plants. When plants are subjected to any form of stress, phenotypic responses are elicited to reduce damage. Responses to drought include a decrease in leaf area and aerial biomass, and an increase in root/shoot ratio of biomass allocation. If plants are subjected to drought and herbivory at the same time, constrained responses are expected due to resource limitation. In a greenhouse experiment we analyzed the effect of simulated herbivory on the ability to respond to drought stress in seedlings of the Chilean perennial herb Convolvulus demissus (Convolvulaceae), which in natural populations may experience water deficit during dry summers as well as grazing by mammals. Plants subjected to drought showed the phenotypic responses theoretically expected. In contrast, plants subjected to a combined drought + herbivory treatment did not show those responses, being pheno-typically similar to control plants. It is suggested that herbivory may limit responses to drought in C. demissus, hence magnifying the negative consequences on plant fitness of such abiotic factor.","Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile","Gianoli, E (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",egianoli@udec.cl,"Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015; Quezada, Ivan/P-4503-2014","Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640; Quezada, Ivan/0000-0003-3027-2237",,,,22,9,9,0,3,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

Cornicabra) to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization by Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae, and Glomus claroideum, in terms of changes in the number and length of shoots and trunk diameter. In colonized plants, the number of shoots increased by 29% 3 months after transplanting, reaching as high as 121% at 12 months after transplanting. G. mosseae was the most influential species in this respect. Six months after transplanting, the colonized plants showed a greater number of shoots than did the control plants at 12 months after transplanting. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization may therefore provide a mechanism by which the juvenile growth period of these olive trees can be reduced. G. claroideum-colonized plants showed 118% more shoots than did control plants at 6 months after transplanting; at 12 months, they showed 100% more shoots. This fungus was the most effective at increasing trunk diameter and plant biomass at 12 and 24 months after transplant. Three months after transplanting, the trunk diameter in G. claroideum-colonized plants was similar to that observed 12 months after transplanting in noncontrol plants-a 10-month growth advantage. To maximize root and shoot growth and to reduce juvenile growth, Cornicabra olive plantlets apparently need to enter into a symbiotic relationship with Glomus species. The present results show the effectiveness of Glomus colonization in reducing the juvenile period of these trees; inoculation with Glomus species is therefore recommended as an olivicultural practice.","Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Univ Ingn Tecn Agr, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Granada, Spain; Agroambientales Delagac Agr, Toledo 45071, Spain","Piedra, AP (reprint author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Univ Ingn Tecn Agr, C-Ronda Calatrava 7, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",Andres.Porras@uclm.com,"Azcon, Rosario/H-5240-2015; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015","Azcon, Rosario/0000-0003-4568-4090; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718",,,,27,12,13,0,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0038-075X,1538-9243,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,JAN,2006,171,1,,,,,52,58,,10.1097/01.ss.0000187348.31987.b6,,,7,Soil Science,Agriculture,009DK,WOS:000235091300006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Aspelmeier, S; Leuschner, C",,,,"Aspelmeier, S; Leuschner, C",,,Genotypic variation in drought response of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth): leaf and root morphology and carbon partitioning,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,drought stress; genotypic variation; leaf morphology; root morphology; root : shoot ratio,FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; WATER RELATIONS; GAS-EXCHANGE; EUCALYPTUS-GLOBULUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH; STRESS; SEEDLINGS; CLONES; PROVENANCES,"This study investigates the drought response of four genotypes of Betula pendula with a focus on leaf and root morphological traits, leaf phenology and carbon partitioning between shoot and root. Potted one-year-old clonal plants of four genotypes from regions with low to high annual rainfall (550-1270 mm year(-1)) were subjected to drought periods of 12-14 weeks in two subsequent years. Well-watered control plants of the four genotypes differed significantly with respect to total leaf area per plant (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA), whereas differences in total fine root surface area (RA), root specific area (SRA), and the fine root:leaf mass ratio (FR:LM) were not significant. Highest LA and SLA were found in the clone originating from the driest environment. In complementary physiological investigations this clone was found to have the highest water use as well which was interpreted as competitive superiority in terms of water consumption. Drought resulted in an increase in SLA in all genotypes, and a decrease in LA. Leaf area reduction was more pronounced in the genotypes from high than in those from low rainfall origin. The ratio of total root to leaf surfaces remained more or less constant after drought application despite an increase in FR:LM. This is explained by a decrease in SRA resulting from a reduced abundance of very small fine rootlets (diameter < 0.2 mm) in the drought-treated plants. The loss in total root surface area due to a reduction in finest root mass was compensated for by a relative increase in total root dry mass per plant. Comparison of results from the first and second drought period indicated a marked influence of timing of drought, root system size, and putative root limitation on plant drought response. We conclude that leaf and root morphology, the total leaf and root surfaces, and the morphological response to drought in birch are to a large extent under genetic control.","Univ Gottingen, Plant Ecol Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Aspelmeier, S (reprint author), Uferweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",stella@aspelmeier.de,,,,,,56,46,55,0,37,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legume-rhizobia symbiosis is believed to be the main pathway for secondary fallow regrowth to recuperate these losses, thus constituting an important mechanism for maintaining the sustainability of this agro-ecosystem. By contrast, BNF in mature rainforest is believed to be low. However, these assumptions have never been unambiguously verified, since serious methodological constraints make all quantitative BNF estimates in tropical forests questionable. The present study, therefore, pursues indirect evidence on the role of BNF in 2-25 years of secondary forest regrowth and in mature rainforest of central Amazonia, at 100 km to the north and 70 km to the east of the city of Manaus, Brazil. We show BNF to be high throughout secondary regrowth, as opposed to low BNF in mature rainforest. Our main evidence is based on the high vegetation share of legume species capable of BNF in secondary regrowth as opposed to lower shares in mature rainforest. Furthermore, clusters of potentially N-2-fixing legumes in secondary regrowth but not in mature rainforest were associated with low delta(15)N-signals of leaf litter and with an above-average vegetation biomass. Positive correlations between the individual plant sizes and foliar delta(15)N-signals of potentially N-2-fixing legumes suggest that physiological limitations in the dominating legume tree giants may be one factor responsible for the low BNF in mature rainforest. The role of legume BNF appears quite constant throughout the first 25 years of secondary forest regrowth covered by this study, contrary to previous notions on a BNF maximum in early or mid-succession. Thus, BNF-rates do not provide an adequate criteria for defining minimum or optimum fallow periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it's percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists. In the face of rapid change and multiple pressures on native forest ecosystems, the impacts of earthworm invasion on forest soil structure and function must be considered.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55812 USA","Hale, CM (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 1530 Cleveland Ave N,115 Green Hall, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",chale@nrri.umn.edu,"Pastor, John/F-6241-2011","Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Frelich, Lee/0000-0002-9052-7070",,,,84,138,142,1,113,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,DEC,2005,8,8,,,,,911,927,,10.1007/s10021-005-0066-x,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,992HC,WOS:000233874000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dobbertin, M",,,,"Dobbertin, M",,,Tree growth as indicator of tree vitality and of tree reaction to environmental stress: a review,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Review,,,,,,tree growth; vitality; crown transparency; stress factors; drought,WESTERN SPRUCE BUDWORM; LONG-TERM OBSERVATIONS; FOREST CROWN CONDITION; PINE PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; FINE-ROOT VITALITY; NORWAY SPRUCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PICEA-ABIES; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; MORTALITY MODELS,"The intensive monitoring plots (Level II) of ICP Forests serve to examine the effects of air pollution and other stress factors on forest condition, including tree vitality. However, tree vitality cannot be measured directly. Indicators, such as tree growth or crown transparency, may instead be used. Tree growth processes can be ranked by order of importance in foliage growth, root growth, bud growth, storage tissue growth, stem growth, growth of defence compounds and reproductive growth. Under stress photosynthesis is reduced and carbon allocation is altered. Stem growth may be reduced early on as it is not directly vital to the tree. Actual growth must be compared against a reference growth, such as the growth of trees without the presumed stress, the growth of presumed healthy trees, the growth in a presumed stress-free period or the expected growth derived from models. Several examples from intensive monitoring plots in Switzerland illustrate how tree-growth reactions to environmental stresses may serve as vitality indicator. Crown transparency and growth can complement each other. For example, defoliation by insects becomes first visible in crown transparency while stem growth reaction occurs with delay. On the other hand, extreme summer drought as observed in large parts of Europe in 2003 affects stem growth almost immediately, while foliage reduction becomes only visible months later. Residuals of tree growth models may also serve as indicators of changed environmental conditions. Certain stresses, such as drought or insect defoliation cause immediate reactions and are not detectable in five-year growth intervals. Therefore, annual or inter-annual stem growth should be assessed in long-term monitoring plots.","Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Dobbertin, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 213 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94530 USA.",dobbertin@wsl.ch,,,,,,144,300,318,9,144,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

We also studied the resulting changes in root-tip ultrastructure and peroxidase isozyme biochemistry. P. americana leaf extract inhibited seed germination, seedling growth, and biomass when compared to control and treated soil. Root and shoot growth in treated soil was stimulated relative to control soil, but root growth was inhibited by 50% in the leaf extract treatment. Biomass of C. mimosoides seedlings grown on leaf extract was reduced sevenfold when compared to the control seedlings. The amounts of total phenolic compounds in the leaf extract, treated soil, and control soil were 0.77, 0.14, and 0.03 mg 1(-1), respectively. The root tips of C. mimsoides treated with leaf extracts of P. americana showed amyloplasts and large central vacuoles with electron-dense deposits inside them when compared to control root tips. The activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GuPOX) in whole plant, roots, and shoots of C. mimosoides increased as leaf extract increased; maximum activity was observed in extract concentrations of 75% and higher. Root GuPOX activity was three times higher than in shoots. Therefore, we conclude that inhibition of C. mimosoides growth is related to the phenolic compounds in the P. americana leaf extract and the ultrastructure changes in root-tip cells and increased GuPOX activity is a response to these allelochemicals.","Washington State Univ, Nat Resource Sci Dept, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA; Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea","Lee, EJ (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Nat Resource Sci Dept, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA.",ejlee@plaza.snu.ac.kr,,,,,,41,9,10,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

In many tropical forests, trees compete not only with other trees, but also with lianas, which compete aggressively for below-ground resources and thus may limit tree growth and regeneration. 2 Using a replicated experiment, we tested the relative strengths of above- and below-ground competition from lianas on tree saplings in a disturbed forest in Cote d'Ivoire with a heterogeneous canopy and relatively high light penetration. We planted seedlings of three tree species and subjected them to below-ground competition with lianas (BGC), above- and below-ground competition with lianas (ABGC), or a liana-free control treatment. After 2 years, we harvested the saplings and compared the amount of above-ground biomass and its relative allocation among the three experimental treatments and different tree species. 3 Lianas competed intensely with saplings in this tropical forest, substantially limiting sapling growth. Saplings grown in the ABGC and BGC treatments had only 18.5% and 16.8% of the above-ground dry biomass of those grown in the liana-free control treatment. 4 Sapling biomass did not differ significantly among the ABGC and BGC treatments, suggesting that below-ground competition was the driving force behind liana vs. tree competition in this forest. Above-ground competition with lianas, however, did affect the allocation of biomass in saplings, resulting in shorter, thicker stems and a poorly developed crown. 5 Collectively, our findings suggest that below-ground competition with lianas plays a substantial role in limiting the growth of saplings in disturbed and secondary tropical forests, and above-ground effects may be due to a combination of above-ground competition and mechanical stress. 6 Disentangling above- and below-ground competition between lianas and trees is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of naturally regenerating tropical forests, as well as formulating successful management plans for sustainable timber harvest.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Ctr Ecosyst Studies, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Schnitzer, SA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",schnitze@uwm.edu,,"Schnitzer, Stefan/0000-0002-2715-9455",,,,77,142,162,5,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We investigated whether (+/-)-catechin, a phytotoxin exuded from the roots of the exotic invader Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), is also one of the factors that regulates C. maculosa recruitment. 2 Adding activated carbon, which adsorbs organic compounds, to soil around C. maculosa adults in the field increased seedling density by 78% 25 days after sowing, and by 34% 32 days after sowing, suggesting that soil-borne compounds inhibited or delayed recruitment. 3 Analysis of field soils near mature C. maculosa revealed that they can contain exceptionally high (+/-)-catechin concentrations (mean = 1.55 mg g(-1) dry soil, with 60% of samples containing >= 1.0 mg (+/-)-catechin g(-1)). 4 In laboratory experiments, treatment with >= 1.0 mg (+/-)-catechin mL(-1) reduced seedling root elongation by > 50%, indicating that field concentrations are sufficient to inhibit C. maculosa recruitment.

The potential for a single plant root exudate to influence both inter- and intraspecific interactions emphasizes the complex effects that plant secondary metabolites may have on plant population and community structure.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Ctr Rhizosphere Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Vivanco, JM (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",j.vivanco@colostate.edu,"Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013","Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905; Perry, Laura/0000-0003-2796-868X",,,,47,97,101,0,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Analytical models of N-15 distribution would be helpful in interpreting delta(15)N patterns in fungi and plants. To compare different analytical models, we measured nitrogen isotope patterns in soils, saprotrophic fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, and plants with different mycorrhizal habits on a glacier foreland exposed during the last 100 years of glacial retreat and on adjacent nonglaciated terrain. Since plants during early primary succession may have only limited access to propagules of mycorrhizal fungi, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal plants would initially be similar to nonmycorrhizal plants in delta(15)N and then decrease, if mycorrhizal colonization were an important factor influencing plant delta(15)N. As hypothesized, plants with different mycorrhizal habits initially showed similar delta(15)N values (-4 to -6%. relative to the standard of atmospheric N-2 at 0 parts per thousand), corresponding to low mycorrhizal colonization in all plant species and an absence of ectomycorrhizal sporocarps. In later successional stages where ectomycorrhizal sporocarps were present, most ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants declined by 5-6 parts per thousand in delta(15)N, suggesting transfer of N-15-depleted N from fungi to plants. The values recorded (-8 to -11 parts per thousand) are among the lowest yet observed in vascular plants. In contrast, the delta(15)N of nonmycorrhizal plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal plants declined only slightly or not at all. On the forefront, most ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi were similar in delta(15)N (-1 to -3 parts per thousand), but the host-specific ectomycorrhizal fungus Cortinarius tenebricus had values of up to 7 parts per thousand. Plants, fungi and soil were at least 4 parts per thousand higher in N-15 from the mature site than in recently exposed sites. On both the forefront and the mature site, host-specific ectomycorrhizal fungi had higher delta(15)N values than ectomycorrhizal fungi with a broad host range. From these isotopic patterns, we conclude:(1) large enrichments in N-15 of many ectomycorrhizal fungi relative to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal plants are best explained by treating the plant-fungal-soil system as a closed system with a discrimination against N-15 of 8-10 parts per thousand during transfer from fungi to plants, (2) based on models of N-15 mass balance, ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi retain up to two-thirds of the N in the plant-mycorrhizal system under the N-limited conditions at forefront sites, (3) sporocarps are probably enriched in N-15 by an additional 3 parts per thousand relative to available nitrogen, and (4) host-specific ectomycorrhizal fungi may transfer more N to plant hosts than non-host-specific ectomycorrhizal fungi. Our study confirms that nitrogen isotopes are a powerful tool for probing nitrogen dynamics between mycorrhizal fungi and associated plants.","Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03833 USA; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Hobbie, EA (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03833 USA.",erik.hobbie@unh.edu,,,,,,45,92,98,1,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2005,146,2,,,,,258,268,,10.1007/s00442-005-0208-z,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,992HV,WOS:000233875900011,16096847,,,,10/31/19J,"Genet, M; Stokes, A; Salin, F; Mickovski, S; Fourcaud, T; Dumail, JF; van Beek, R",,,,"Genet, M; Stokes, A; Salin, F; Mickovski, S; Fourcaud, T; Dumail, JF; van Beek, R",,,The influence of cellulose content on tensile strength in tree roots,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomechanics; Castanea sativa Mill; Pinus pinaster Ait; root reinforcement; slope stability; soil fixation,ANCHORAGE; PINE; SYSTEMS; WOOD; REINFORCEMENT; ARCHITECTURE; MORPHOLOGY; STABILITY; MECHANICS; SIZE,"Root tensile strength is an important factor to consider when choosing suitable species for reinforcing soil on unstable slopes. Tensile strength has been found to increase with decreasing root diameter, however, it is not known how this phenomenon occurs. We carried out tensile tests on roots 0.2-12.0 mm in diameter of three conifer and two broadleaf species, in order to determine the relationship between tensile strength and diameter. Two species, Pinus pinaster Ait. and Castanea sativa Mill., were then chosen for a quantitative analysis of root cellulose content. Cellulose is responsible for tensile strength in wood due to its microfibrillar structure. Results showed that in all species, a significant power relationship existed between tensile strength and root diameter, with a sharp increase of tensile strength in roots with a diameter < 0.9 mm. In roots > 1.0 mm, Fagus sylvatica L. was the most resistant to failure, followed by Picea abies L. and C. sativa., P. pinaster and Pinus nigra Arnold roots were the least resistant in tension for the same diameter class. Extremely high values of strength (132-201 MPa) were found in P. abies, C. sativa and P. pinaster, for the smallest roots (0.4 mm in diameter). The power relationship between tensile strength and root diameter cannot only be explained by a scaling effect typical of that found in fracture mechanics. Therefore, this relationship could be due to changes in cellulose content as the percentage of cellulose was also observed to increase with decreasing root diameter and increasing tensile strength in both P. pinaster and C. sativa.","Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux, Mixed Unit,INRA, F-33162 Cestas, France; INRA, Equipe Genet & Ameliorat Arbres Forestiers, UMR BIOGECO, F-33162 Cestas, France; AMIS, CIRAD, AMAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; Univ Dundee, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Civil Engn Div, Dundee DD1 4HR, Scotland; XYLOMECA, F-24700 Moulin Neuf, France; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam Phys Geog, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Chem, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Genet, M (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, Lab Rheol Bois Bordeaux, Mixed Unit,INRA, 69 Rte Arcachon, F-33162 Cestas, France.",genet@lrbb3.pierroton.inra.fr; stokes@lrbb3.pierroton.inra.fr,"; Mickovski, Slobodan/D-4418-2011","stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911; Mickovski, Slobodan/0000-0002-1792-1258",,,,50,158,219,6,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2005,278,2-Jan,,,,,1,9,,10.1007/s11104-005-8768-6,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988ZP,WOS:000233643000001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mickovski, SB; van Beek, LPH; Salin, F",,,,"Mickovski, SB; van Beek, LPH; Salin, F",,,Uprooting of vetiver uprooting resistance of vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides),PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,pullout resistance; root system morphology; roots; uprooting; vetiver; Vetiveria zizanioides,HEDGES; SOIL,"Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides), also known as Chrysopogon zizanioides, is a graminaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical India. The southern cultivar is sterile; it flowers but sets no seeds. It is a densely tufted, perennial grass that is considered sterile outside its natural habitat. It grows 0.5-1.5 m high, stiff stems in large clumps from a much branched root stock. The roots of vetiver grass are fibrous and reported to reach depths up to 3 m thus being able to stabilize the soil and its use for this purpose is promoted by the World Bank. Uprooting tests were carried out on vetiver grass in Spain in order to ascertain the resistance the root system can provide when torrential runoffs and sediments are trying to uproot the plant. Uprooting resistance of each plant was correlated to the shoot and root morphological characteristics. In order to investigate any differences between root morphology of vetiver grass in its native habitat reported in the literature, and the one planted in a sub-humid environment in Spain, excavation techniques were used to show root distribution in the soil. Results show that vetiver grass possesses the root strength to withstand torrential runoff. Planted in rows along the contours, it may act as a barrier to the movement of both water and soil. However, the establishment of the vetiver lags behind the reported rates in its native tropical environment due to adverse climatic conditions in the Mediterranean. This arrested development is the main limitation to the use of vetiver in these environments although its root strength is more than sufficient.","Univ Amsterdam, IBED, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; LRBB, F-33162 Cestas, France","Mickovski, SB (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Dept Civil Engn, Dundee DD1 4HR, Scotland.",s.b.mickovski@dundee.ac.uk,"Van Beek, Rens/B-4904-2014; Mickovski, Slobodan B./D-4418-2011","Van Beek, Rens/0000-0002-4758-108X; Mickovski, Slobodan B./0000-0002-1792-1258",,,,17,30,32,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2005,278,2-Jan,,,,,33,41,,10.1007/s11104-005-2379-0,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988ZP,WOS:000233643000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"van Beek, LPH; Wint, J; Cammeraat, LH; Edwards, JP",,,,"van Beek, LPH; Wint, J; Cammeraat, LH; Edwards, JP",,,Observation and simulation of root reinforcement on abandoned Mediterranean slopes,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,FLAC 2D; in-situ direct shear tests; root pull-outs; root reinforcement; slope stability modelling; vegetation,STRENGTH; LANDSLIDES; REDUCTION; SOIL,"The mechanics of root reinforcement have been described satisfactorily for a single root or several roots passing a potential slip plane and verified by field experiments. Yet, precious little attempts have been made to apply these models to the hillslope scale pertinent to landsliding at which variations in soil and vegetation become important. On natural slopes positive pore pressures occur often at the weathering depth of the soil profile. At this critical depth root reinforcement is crucial to avert slope instability. This is particularly relevant for the abandoned slopes in the European part of the Mediterranean basin where root development has to balance the increasing infiltration capacity during re-vegetation. Detailed investigations related to root reinforcement were made at two abandoned slopes susceptible to landsliding located in the Alcoy basin (SE Spain). On these slopes semi-natural vegetation, consisting of a patchy herbaceous cover and dispersed Aleppo pine trees, has established itself. Soil and vegetation conditions were mapped in detail and large-scale, in-situ direct shear tests on the topsoil and pull-out tests performed in order to quantify root reinforcement under different vegetation conditions. These tests showed that root reinforcement was present but limited. Under herbaceous cover, the typical reinforcement was in the order of 0.6 kPa while values up to 18 kPa were observed under dense pine cover. The tests indicate that fine root content and vegetation conditions are important factors that explain the root reinforcement of the topsoil. These findings were confirmed by the simulation of the direct shear tests by means of an advanced root reinforcement model developed in FLAC 2D. Inclusion of the root distribution for the observed vegetation cover mimics root failure realistically but returns over-optimistic estimates of the root reinforcement. When the root reinforcement is applied with this information at the hillslope scale under fully saturated and critical hydrological conditions, root pull-out becomes the dominant root failure mechanism and the slip plane is located at the weathering depth of the soil profile where root reinforcement is negligible. The safety factors increase only slightly when roots are present but the changes in the surface velocity at failure are more substantial. Root reinforcement on these natural slopes therefore appears to be limited to a small range of critical hydrological conditions and its mitigating effect occurs mainly after failure.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht Ctr Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Nottingham, England; Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Scott Wilson Pavement Engn Ltd, Nottingham, England","van Beek, LPH (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht Ctr Geosci, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.vanbeek@geog.uu.nl,"Cammeraat, Erik/G-2863-2010; Van Beek, Rens/B-4904-2014","Cammeraat, Erik/0000-0003-4398-206X; Van Beek, Rens/0000-0002-4758-108X",,,,36,63,66,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2005,278,2-Jan,,,,,55,74,,10.1007/s11104-005-7247-4,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988ZP,WOS:000233643000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dupuy, L; Fourcaud, T; Stokes, A",,,,"Dupuy, L; Fourcaud, T; Stokes, A",,,A numerical investigation into the influence of soil type and root architecture on tree anchorage,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomechanics; finite element method; modelling; morphology; SIMUL3R; uprooting,PINUS-PINASTER AIT.; NORWAY SPRUCE; SITKA SPRUCE; SCOTS PINE; SYSTEMS; MODEL; GROWTH; STABILITY; STANDS; STRENGTH,"The influence of root morphology and soil type on the mechanical behaviour of tree anchorage was investigated through numerical modelling. We developed a simple computer program to construct three-dimensional virtual root architectural patterns. This tool was used to build four schematic patterns: heart-, tap-, herringbone- and plate-like root systems. Each of these rooting types was characterized by specific branching characteristics. However, the total volume (proportional to the wood biomass) and material properties were kept constant. The finite element method was used to calculate the mechanical response of root/soil systems when the stem was subjected to bending forces. The overturning resistance of the four schematic root patterns was determined in four different idealistic soil types. These soils were based on Mohr-Coulomb plasticity models. Results showed that soil internal friction modified the position of the rotation axis during tilting of the root/soil plate. Rooting depth was a determinant parameter in sandy-like soils.

However, the heart root system was more resistant on clay-like soil whereas the tap root system was more resistant on sandy-like soil.

Predictions of future ecosystem C sequestration hinge on respiration budgets, but the mycorrhizal influence on total soil respiration remains unknown. In this study, sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) were subjected to various mycorrhizal treatments, and their root and soil systems were enclosed in chambers that continuously monitored belowground (root + mycorrhizal + heterotrophic) CO2 production during plant growth, death, and decomposition. Rhizocosms with high mycorrhizal colonization exhibited higher soil respiration rates as plants matured, an increase that was in proportion to the mycorrhizal stimulation of plant growth. Living mycorrhizal plants behaved like nonmycorrhizal ones in that total rhizocosm respiration had the same relationship to plant mass and the same temperature sensitivity as nonmycorrhizal plants. Upon removal of the shoots though, mycorrhizal plants exhibited the largest relative reduction in respiration resulting in a unique relationship of soil respiration with plant mass. The mycorrhizal influence on heterotrophic respiration merits as much attention from experimenters and modelers as the mycorrhizal contribution to autotrophic respiration.","Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; No Arizona Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Langley, JA (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",langleya@si.edu,,,,,,35,24,33,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2005,277,2-Jan,,,,,335,344,,10.1007/s11104-005-7932-3,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,987OR,WOS:000233527700029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Batten, KM; Six, J; Scow, KM; Rillig, MC",,,,"Batten, KM; Six, J; Scow, KM; Rillig, MC",,,Plant invasion of native grassland on serpentine soils has no major effects upon selected physical and biological properties,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil aggregate stability; glomalin-related soil protein; grasslands; invasion ecology; Aegilops triuncialis; Centaurea solstitialis,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ORGANIC-MATTER; AGGREGATE STABILITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GLOMALIN; HYPHAE; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; CARBON; BIOTA,"Plant invasions alter soil microbial community composition; this study examined whether invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community were reflected in soil aggregation, an ecosystem property strongly influenced by microorganisms. Soil aggregation is regulated by many biological factors including roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae, and microbially-derived carbon compounds. We measured root biomass, fungal-derived glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), and aggregate mean weight diameter in serpentine soils dominated by an invasive plant (Aegilops triuncialis (goatgrass) or Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle)), or by native plants (Lasthenia californica and Plantago erecta, or Hemizonia congesta). Root biomass tended to increase in invaded soils. GRSP concentrations were lower in goatgrass-dominated soils than native soils. In contrast, starthistle dominated soil contained a higher amount of one fraction of GRSP, easily extractable immunoreactive soil protein (EE-IRSP) and a lower amount of another GRSP fraction, easily extractible Bradford reactive soil protein (EE-BRSP). Soil aggregation increased with goatgrass invasion, but did not increase with starthistle invasion. In highly aggregated serpentine soils, small increases in soil aggregation accompanying plant invasion were not related to changes in GRSP and likely have limited ecological significance.

Optimizing the purity of each fraction is necessary to correlate fraction quantity and molecular characteristics with soil quality. Manipulation of extraction sequence and controlled precipitation of HA were used to evaluate co-extraction of HA and glomalin. Eight bulk soil samples (0 to 10 cm depth) were collected from four U.S. states (Colorado, Nebraska, Maryland, and Georgia). In Experiment 1, glomalin extraction (50 MM citrate, pH 8.0, at 121 degrees C) was followed by HA extraction (0.1 N NaOH at room temperature), and Experiment 2 used the reciprocal sequence. Experiment 2 HA was precipitated stepwise at pH levels 2.5, 2.0, and 1.0. Gravimetric weight, Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP), and immunoreactive soil protein (IRSP), along with percentages of C, N, H, and Fe, were used to compare glomalin and HA. The HA fraction from Experiment 2 contained 2-fold greater amounts of BRSP than HA from Experiment I and showed that pre-extraction of glomalin improved the purity of HA. The glomalin fraction from Experiment 1 contained 1.5 times the BRSP of glornalin from Experiment 2 and was twice the gravimetric weight. BRSP and gravimetric weight were concentrated in HA that precipitated at pH 2.5 or 2.0 and percentage IRSP was significantly higher in the pH 2.5 precipitate. The results indicate that glomalin should be extracted first and examined as a biomolecule separate from the humic acid mixture. Percentages C, H, N, and Fe in glomalin varied across soils and experiments. In seven soils, the changes in Fe percentage in glomalin from Experiment 1 to 2 were significantly correlated with the changes in glornalin weight and %C. Iron in glornalin from Experiment 1 was related to soil pH and clay content, whereas soil organic C was positively and significantly correlated with Experiment 1 glornalin BRSP and IRSP. In Experiment 1, a recalcitrant pool of glornalin was released by treating soil with NaOH, suggesting that a fraction of glomalin is difficult to remove from soil and glornalin extraction efficiency could be improved. Refinements to extraction and purification protocols such as pretreatment of soils with HCI and sequential extraction can facilitate studies on organic matter structure and function.","USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, Mandan, ND 58554 USA; USDA ARS, Sustainable Agr Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Nichols, KA (reprint author), USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, 1701 10th Ave SW POB 459, Mandan, ND 58554 USA.",nicholsk@mandan.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,33,52,59,1,44,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3261 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,DEC,2005,170,12,,,,,985,997,,10.1097/01.ss.0000198618.06975.3c,,,13,Soil Science,Agriculture,998ZZ,WOS:000234359700004,,Green Published,,,10/31/19J,"Saeki, Y; Kaneko, A; Hara, T; Suzuki, K; Yamakawa, T; Nguyen, MT; Nagatomo, Y; Akao, S",,,,"Saeki, Y; Kaneko, A; Hara, T; Suzuki, K; Yamakawa, T; Nguyen, MT; Nagatomo, Y; Akao, S",,,Phylogenetic analysis of soybean-nodulating rhizobia isolated from alkaline soils in Vietnam,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,alkaline soil; Bradyrhizobium; Rj-soybean; Sinorhizobium; Vietnam,SYMBIONT SINORHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; TRANSCRIBED SPACER REGION; RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; SP-NOV; GROWING RHIZOBIA; USDA STRAINS; ROOT-NODULES; SEQUENCE; FREDII,"In order to analyze the phylogeny of soybean-nodulating bacteria in alkaline soils in Vietnam, indigenous soybean-nodulating bacteria were isolated from root nodules by cultivating three kinds of Rj-soybean cultivars on two alkaline soils in Vietnam. The 120 isolates were classified into two major genera of soybean-nodulating rhizobia, namely Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium genera, based on a growth analysis on medium and PCR-RFLP analyses of 16S rDNA and of the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Most of the isolates of B. japonicum were extra-slow-growing and their ITS types were similar to that of B. japonicum USDA 135. They were not isolated from the soybean cultivar CNS used as Rj(2)Rj(3), genotype. Isolates of Sinorhizobium were divided into two groups, S. fredii and S. sp., based on a PCR-RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA. Furthermore, PCR-RFLP analysis of the 16S-23S rDNA ITS region enabled to separate them into five types, three ITS types associated with S. fredii and two with S. sp. Sinorhizobium was frequently isolated from the three soybean cultivars on two soils. From the isolate ratio, it was suggested that B. japonicum strains similar to B. japonicum USDA 135 and S. fredii predominated in the alkaline soils of Vietnam. Additionally, our findings indicated that the Rj-genotypes affected not only the compatibility, but also the preference for nodulation between the host soybean and rhizobia.","Miyazaki Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biochem & Appl Biosci, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Resources, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; Hanoi Agr Univ, Fac Land & Environm, Dept Agrochem & Microbiol, Hanoi, Vietnam","Saeki, Y (reprint author), Miyazaki Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biochem & Appl Biosci, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan.",,,,,,,28,28,29,0,2,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

How the concurrent increase in tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentration ([O-3]) will interact with rising atmospheric [CO2] to affect C cycling is unknown. A major component of carbon cycling in forests is fine root production, mortality and decomposition. To better understand the effects of elevated [CO2] and [O-3] on the dynamics of fine root C, we conducted a combined field and laboratory incubation experiment to monitor decomposition dynamics and changes in fine root litter chemistry. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology at the FACTS-II Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, elevated [CO2] (535 mu l l(-1)) and [O-3] (53 nl l(-1)) in intact stands of pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixed stands of trembling aspen plus paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen plus sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). We hypothesized that the trees would react to increased C availability (elevated [CO2]) by increasing allocation to C-based secondary compounds (CBSCs), thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because of its lower growth potential, we reasoned this effect would be greatest in the aspen-maple community relative to the aspen and aspen-birch communities. As a result of decreased C availability, we expected elevated [O-3] to counteract shifts in C allocation induced by elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of CBSCs were rarely significantly affected by the CO2 and O-3 treatments in decomposing fine roots. Rates of microbial respiration and mass loss from fine roots were unaffected by the treatments, although the production of dissolved organic C differed among communities. We conclude that elevated [CO2] and [O-3] induce only small changes in fine root chemistry that are insufficient to significantly influence fine root decomposition. If changes in soil C cycling occur in the future, they will most likely be brought about by changes in litter production.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Chapman, JA (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",jchapman@mtu.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,55,19,21,0,26,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2005,25,12,,,,,1501,1510,,10.1093/treephys/25.12.1501,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,994GT,WOS:000234019900004,16137936,,,,10/31/19J,"Johnk, N; Hietala, AM; Fossdal, CG; Collinge, DB; Newman, MA",,,,"Johnk, N; Hietala, AM; Fossdal, CG; Collinge, DB; Newman, MA",,,Defense-related genes expressed in Norway spruce roots after infection with the root rot pathogen Ceratobasidium bicorne (anamorph : Rhizoctonia sp.),TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,chitinase; differential display (DD); germin-like protein; GST; NBS-LRR; peroxidase; real-time PCR,GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; CELL-SUSPENSION CULTURES; PLANT-DISEASE RESISTANCE; CONIFER SEEDLING ROOTS; GERMIN-LIKE PROTEIN; PICEA-ABIES; UNINUCLEATE RHIZOCTONIA; OXIDATIVE BURST; DIFFERENTIAL DISPLAY; OPHIOSTOMA-POLONICUM,"To study the mechanisms of inducible disease resistance in conifers, changes in transcript accumulation in roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings exposed to the root rot pathogen Ceratobasidium bicorne Erikss. & Ryv. (anamorph: Rhizoctonia sp.) were monitored by differential display (DID). Because C. Income attacks root tips, a desiccation treatment was added to exclude genes induced by pathogen-related desiccation stress. The DD analysis was defined by the use of 11 sets of primers, covering about 5% of the transcriptome. A comparison of gene expression in control, desiccation- and pathogen-stressed roots revealed 36 pathogen-induced gene transcripts. Based on database searches, these transcripts were assigned to four groups originating from spruce mRNA (25 transcripts), rRNA (five transcripts), fungal mRNA (two transcripts) and currently unknown cDNAs (four transcripts). Real-time PCR was applied to verify and quantify pathogen-induced changes in transcript accumulation. Of the 18 transcripts tested, nine were verified to be Norway spruce gene transcripts up-regulated from 1.3- to 66-fold in the infected roots. Four germin-like protein isoforms, a peroxidase and a glutathione S-transferase, all implicated in oxidative processes, including the oxidative burst, were predicted from sequence similarity searches. Seven class IV chitinase isoforms implicated in fungal cell wall degradation and a nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) disease resistance protein homologue related to pathogen recognition were identified. Several transcript species, such as the NBS-LRR homologue and the germin-like protein homologues, have not previously been identified as pathogen-inducible genes in gymnosperms.","Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Dept Plant Biol, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark; Danish Ctr Forest Landscape & Planning KVL, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; Norwegian Forest Res Inst, N-1432 As, Norway","Newman, MA (reprint author), Royal Vet & Agr Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mari@kvl.dk,"Section, Forest Health/B-6603-2009; Collinge, David/G-2854-2014; Newman, Mari-Anne/M-1550-2013; Fossdal, Carl Gunnar/C-5536-2008","Collinge, David/0000-0003-2690-5820; Newman, Mari-Anne/0000-0001-5782-6071; Fossdal, Carl Gunnar/0000-0002-7390-7864",,,,73,22,25,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2005,25,12,,,,,1533,1543,,10.1093/treephys/25.12.1533,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,994GT,WOS:000234019900007,16137939,,,,10/31/19J,"Lopez, OR; Kursar, TA; Cochard, H; Tyree, MT",,,,"Lopez, OR; Kursar, TA; Cochard, H; Tyree, MT",,,Interspecific variation in xylem vulnerability to cavitation among tropical tree and shrub species,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,drought tolerance; hydraulic conductivity; tropical rainforest; water potential; water stress; xylem cavitation,DRY FOREST TREES; HYDRAULIC ARCHITECTURE; WATER RELATIONS; WOODY-PLANTS; NEOTROPICAL FOREST; SEVERE DROUGHT; CANOPY TREES; EMBOLISM; PANAMA; LEAF,"In tropical moist forests, seasonal drought limits plant survival, productivity and diversity. Drought-tolerance mechanisms of tropical species should reflect the maximum seasonal water deficits experienced in a particular habitat. We investigated stem xylem vulnerability to cavitation in nine tropical species with different life histories and habitat associations. Stem xylem vulnerability was scored as the xylem water potential causing 50 and 75% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50 and P75, respectively). Four shade-tolerant shrubs ranged from moderately resistant (P50 = -1.9 MPa for Ouratea lucens Kunth. Engl.) to highly resistant to cavitation (P50 = -4.1 MPa for Psychotria horizontalis Sw.), with shallow-rooted species being the most resistant. Among the tree species, those characteristic of waterlogged soils, Carapa guianensis Aubl., Prioria copaifera Griseb. and Ficus citrifolia Mill., were the most vulnerable to cavitation (P50 = -0.8 to -1.6 MPa). The wet-season, deciduous tree, Cordia alliodora (Ruiz & Pav.) Oken., had resistant xylem (P50 = -3.2 MPa), whereas the dry-season, deciduous tree, Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. was among the most vulnerable to cavitation (P50 = -0.8 MPa) of the species studied. For eight out of the nine study species, previously reported minimum seasonal leaf water potentials measured in the field during periods of drought correlated with our P50 and P75 values. Rooting depth, deciduousness, soil type and growth habit might also contribute to desiccation tolerance.

To determine the fate of the seeds, cotton thread was attached to the seeds and the trail followed. A total of 25 seed caches were located. All of the seeds were found in separate caches, which was consistent with scatter-hoarding behaviour. The average distance from the source of the seeds to the cache was 43.1 m +/- 5.8 m at Dryandra woodland and 29.1 m +/- 3.8 m at Karakamia sanctuary. The mean cache depth was 4.3 cm +/- 0.2 cm at Dryandra woodland compared with 4.6 cm +/- 0.3 cm at Karakamia sanctuary. Significantly more seedlings and saplings grew away from sandalwood trees at sites where woylies were present than at sites with no woylies. In contrast, significantly more seedlings and saplings grew under adult sandalwood trees at the site without woylies than where they were present, although there were significantly lower rates of recruitment and sandalwood regeneration at these sites. In addition, significantly more whole, undisturbed sandalwood seeds were found under the parent trees at the woylie-free site than at the site with woylies. These findings strongly suggest that little seed dispersal or regeneration of sandalwood occurs in the absence of woylies. Through scatter-hoarding, woylies have the potential to disperse and cache sandalwood seeds away from the source and significantly alter the subsequent regeneration of sandalwood. Furthermore, by caching seeds large distances away from a source, woylies could modify the distribution of sandalwood in an area.","Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; Western Australia Dept Conservat & Land Managemen, Swan Reg Serv, Bentley, WA, Australia","Murphy, MT (reprint author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",m.murphy@murdoch.edu.au,"Hardy, Giles/B-2432-2013","Hardy, Giles/0000-0001-7419-5064",,,,68,29,36,0,24,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,NOV,2005,30,7,,,,,747,755,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01515.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971OK,WOS:000232393600004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Krause, C; Morin, H",,,,"Krause, C; Morin, H",,,"Adventive-root development in mature black spruce and balsam fir in the boreal forests of Quebec,Canada",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BUDWORM OUTBREAKS; ABIES-BALSAMEA; SYSTEM; QUEBEC; CANADA; DYNAMICS; ARCHITECTURE; INCREMENT; STABILITY; CONIFERS,"Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)

To gain a better understanding of root growth, the root systems of 30 mature black spruce and 30 mature balsam fir were excavated until the root diameter had decreased to 2 cm. Tree ages ranged from 100 to more than 250 years. All trees showed only adventive roots; this was confirmed by dating the root-shoot interface. The youngest lateral roots were located close to ground level, whereas the oldest ones occurred lower in the stump, suggesting a process of renewal for the latter. Reconstruction of the development of the root system revealed a specific root-growth pattern. Adventive roots grew, on average, more than 60% of their total length in the year of initiation, whereas more than 93% of lateral-root elongation was recorded in the first 10 years after adventive roots were initiated. This growth pattern was found to be similar in the two tree species in terms of lateral-root development (p = 0.68). More variability was observed for the ramified adventive roots. However, two patterns emerged. First, around 10% of total elongation was completed in the same year as that of the corresponding lateral roots. Second, several ramified adventive roots were initiated in the same calendar year but delayed by several years relative to lateral adventive root initiation. No significant differences were observed between black spruce and balsam fir (p = 0.1).","Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada","Krause, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Fondamentales, 555 Blvd Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.",ckrause@uqac.ca,,,,,,57,32,33,1,13,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We analysed the diversity of symbiotic association specificity among the two organisms, and its evolution in the plant genus. Nitrogen fixation tests and molecular phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that the genus Medicago includes more symbiotic specificity groups than previously suggested and that plant specificity is highly unstable and has repeatedly switched along the diversification of this genus. A phylogenetic analysis including geographical data shows that bacterial geographical diversity distribution has a strong influence on the geographic distribution of plant species and their ability to colonize new areas. Multiple other modifications of specificity occurred along the diversification of the genus, presumably due to selection for specialization to a single bacterial biovar. Codivergence between plants and bacteria may also have taken place.","Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, UMR 113, F-34398 Montpellier, France; Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Biogeog & Ecol Vertebres, Montpellier, France; Lab Interact Plantes Microorganismes, Castanet Tolosan, France; Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, Montpellier, France","Bena, G (reprint author), Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, UMR 113, TA 10-J,Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",bena@mpl.ird.fr,"Olivieri, Isabelle/E-5872-2016","Bena, Gilles/0000-0003-3080-8441",,,,43,57,59,0,17,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1010-061X,,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Classical plating methods were applied to cultivate these fungi and to study their morphology. Molecular markers were used for further determination. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer of DNA extracts of the cultured fungi as well as total DNA extracts of the mites themselves, also containing fungal DNA, were amplified and sequenced. Based on phylogenetic analysis, a total of 31 fungal species from major fungal groups were found to be associated with oribatid mites, indicating that mites do not selectively disperse specific species or species groups. The detected taxa were mainly saprobiontic, cosmopolitan (e.g., Alternaria tenuissima), but also parasitic fungi (Beauveria bassiana) for whose dispersal oribatid mites might play an important role. In contrast, no mycorrhizal fungi were detected in association with oribatid mites, indicating that their propagules are dispersed in a different way. In addition, fungi that are known to be a preferred food for oribatid mites such as the Dematiacea were not detected in high numbers. Results of this study point to the potential of oribatid mites to disperse fungal taxa in soil and indicate that co-evolutionary patterns between oribatid mites and their associated fungi might be rare or even missing in most cases, since we only detected ubiquitous taxa attached to the mites.","Univ Leipzig, Inst Bot, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Renker, C (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Bot, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",crenker@uni-leipzig.de,"Buscot, Francois/A-4125-2016","Buscot, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006",,,,79,55,60,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Embryos of all species contained storage reserve cotyledons and germinate in a hypogeal manner. Species mean embryo masses ranged from 0.4-48.1 g. Partial embryo predation treatments were: 1/2 embryo treatment; embryos separated into component cotyledons, and 1/4 embryo treatment; cotyledons separated as above and subsequently cut in half. Germination was scored as production of roots and shoots, or roots or shoots only. Embryos from all species produced seedlings in all treatments, even after the removal of up to 75 percent of the cotyledonary reserve. Moreover, the proportion germinating were not different between intact embryos and i) separated cotyledons, ii) cotyledon halves that maintained or were adjacent to the embryonic axis (except for the largest seeded species), and iii) cotyledon halves that did not include the root-shoot axis (four species). Thus, production of roots and shoots, or roots or shoots only was largely independent of the presence of the embryonic root-shoot axis - implying that somatic cells in storage cotyledons are capable of differentiating into the full range of cell types typical of shoots and roots in the absence of the root-shoot axis. The generality of this response across all seven species suggests somatic embryogenesis in storage cotyledons may be a more widespread phenomenon in tropical floras than currently considered.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia","Harrington, MG (reprint author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",mark.harrington@jcu.edu.au,,"Edwards, Will/0000-0001-8981-7479",,,,20,1,1,0,1,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2005,111,2,,,,,215,220,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13645.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,979XU,WOS:000232979300002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Brinkman, EP; Troelstra, SR; van der Putten, WH",,,,"Brinkman, EP; Troelstra, SR; van der Putten, WH",,,Soil feedback effects to the foredune grass Ammophila arenaria by endoparasitic root-feeding nematodes and whole soil communities,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Heterodera arenaria; Meloidogyne maritima; Pratylenchus penetrans; root-feeding nematode; soil community; soil pathogen,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES; MARRAM GRASS; BORNE FUNGI; COASTAL FOREDUNES; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; PATHOGENIC FUNGI; L LINK; GROWTH; ORGANISMS,"In coastal foredunes, the grass Ammophila arenaria develops a soil community that contributes to die-back and replacement by later successional plant species. Root-feeding nematodes and pathogenic soil microorganisms are involved in this negative feedback. Regular burial by wind-blown beach sand results in vigorous growth of A. arenaria, probably because of enabling a temporary escape from negative soil feedback. Here, we examine the role of root-feeding nematodes as compared to the whole soil community in causing negative feedback to A. arenaria. We performed a 3-year sand burial experiment in the field and every year we determined the feedback of different soil communities to plant growth in growth chamber bioassays. In the field, we established A. arenaria in tubes with beach sand, added three endoparasitic root-feeding nematode species (Meloidogyne maritima, Heterodera arenaria and Pratylenchus penetrans) or root zone soil to the plants, and created series of ceased and continued sand burial. During three subsequent years, plant biomass was measured and numbers of nematodes were counted. Every year, bioassays were performed with the field soils and biomass of seed-grown A. arenaria plants was measured to determine the strength of feedback of the established soil communities to the plant. In the field, addition of root zone soil had a negative effect on biomass of buried plants. In the bioassays, addition of root zone soil also reduced the biomass of newly planted seedlings, however, only in the case when the field plants had not been buried with beach sand. Addition of the three endoparasitic root-feeding nematodes did not influence plant biomass in the field and in the bioassays. Our results strongly suggest that the negative feedback to A. arenaria is not due to the combination of the three endoparasitic nematodes, but to other components in the soil community, or their interactions with the nematodes.

The objectives of this study were to study the influence of SDS disease on soybean yield and to compare soil and site factors with the SDS disease incidence and severity so that the factors that influence the disease could be identified. This was a 2-year study conducted on a farm near Desoto, IL, USA. Various site and soil parameters were collected, mapped and analyzed statistically to correlate with the SDS foliar index, DX (= disease incidence x severity/9). Soybean yield declined 7% for every 10% increase in DX. Statistically, no significant relationship was found between DX and organic matter content in soils. However, DX was positively related to soil pH, bulk density and moisture content at field capacity, but inversely related to available potassium, and macro-porosity. Both rooting depth and topography of the field had mixed relationships with the SDS index. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Unravelling the involvement of induced plant responses in the interactions between aboveground and belowground communities associated with plants is likely to benefit from comprehensive metabolomic analyses.

As nodulation with specific rhizobia and/or mycorrhizal fungi, may become essential for the settlement and growth of legumes, the objective was to ascertain the specificity/promiscuity of the plant-rhizobia interaction, by detecting the occurrence of infective rhizobia in the soils to be revegetated and by cross inoculation tests. Native rhizobia for the target species, were isolated from nondisturbed native areas. The four species were inoculated with four semiarid soils located in central Spain, that we intend to revegetate. Specific rhizobia for M. strasseri and M. citrina were detected in three of the four soils. The soil that did not show infective rhizobia had received sewage-sludge from a waste-water treatment plant, and levels of heavy metals were high. None of the 4 soils had specific rhizobia for C. arborescens and D. pentaphyllum. The cross inoculation tests revealed that M. strasseri and M. citrina belonged to the same symbiotic grouping as alfalfa. On the other hand C. arborescens and D. pentaphyllum only nodulated with their own specific native rhizobia, and the rhizobia from C. arborescens and D. pentaphyllum were not infective with any of the tested species. For M. strasseri the effectiveness of the native rhizobia was significantly higher than the effectiveness of the infective rhizobia from the soils to be revegetated.

Studies of N dynamics typically focus on aboveground litter production, but in semiarid ecosystems, fine-root production greatly exceeds shoot production. We explored the contribution of root and shoot litter to N cycling in adjacent grassland and aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest at the northern edge of the Great Plains. We used a new approach to measure N inputs from root litter production: we combined root productivity data from minirhizotron images with N content data from several root diameter and color classes. We also measured the production and N content of aboveground litter. The novel contribution of our study comes from the simultaneous measurements of above- and belowground productivity and N input from litter production in adjacent forest and grassland habitats. Aboveground litter production was threefold greater in forest than in grassland (330 vs. 136 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)), but fine roots accounted for 80-90% of total litter production. As a result, total production was not significantly different between habitats, and the N contribution from total litter production was surprisingly similar between grassland (16.8 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)) and forest (17.1 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)). Thus in spite of great differences between habitats in aboveground litter production, N inputs from total litter production cannot explain the higher availability of N in forest soils. However, we found differences between habitats in root litter quality (forest, 1.14% N; grassland, 0.81% N, as well as in the seasonal and vertical distribution of root production. Grassland root production was significantly greater than,forest root production in early summer in the top 20 cm of soil. Conversely, forest produced. more. root length at the end of the growing season in deeper soil layers (> 50 cm). These differences may increase available N in forest soils, but this increase is not attributable to differences in total litter production between habitats.","Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Steinaker, DF (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",steinakd@uregina.ca,"Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011",,,,,50,50,62,0,45,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2005,86,10,,,,,2825,2833,,10.1890/04-0893,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,971DP,WOS:000232361800027,,,,,10/31/19J,"Andersen, CP; Nikolov, I; Nikolova, P; Matyssek, R; Haberle, KH",,,,"Andersen, CP; Nikolov, I; Nikolova, P; Matyssek, R; Haberle, KH",,,"Estimating ""autotrophic"" belowground respiration in spruce and beech forests: decreases following girdling",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fagus sylvatica; Picea abies; autotrophic (root plus mycorrhizal) respiration; soil respiration; soil temperature; drought; CO2 flux; girdling,SOIL RESPIRATION; ROOT RESPIRATION; CARBON ALLOCATION; SEASONAL-CHANGES; PINE FOREST; FINE-ROOT; GROWTH; OZONE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PLANTS,"Seasonal fluxes of CO2 from soil and the contribution of autotrophic (root + mycorrhizal) to total soil respiration (SR) were estimated for a mixed stand of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Central Europe. Mature trees of each species were girdled in August 2002 to eliminate carbohydrate allocation to roots. SR was measured at distances of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5/2.0 m from the bole of each tree at 1-2 weeks intervals throughout the fall of 2002 and monthly during the spring and summer of 2003. The contribution of roots and mycorrhizae to total SR was estimated by the decrease in SR compared to ungirdled control trees to account for seasonal patterns evident in controls. SR decreased with soil temperature in the fall 2002 and increased again in 2003 as soil warmed. During most of the study period, SR was strongly related to soil temperature. During the dry summer of 2003, however, SR appeared to be uncoupled from temperature and was strongly related to soil water content (SWC). Mean rates of SR in beech and spruce control plots as well as root densities did not show a clear pattern with distance from the bole. SR decreased to levels below controls in beech within a few days after girdling, whereas spruce did not show a significant decrease until October 2002, 6 weeks after girdling. In both beech and spruce, decreased SR in response to girdling was greatest closest to the bole, possibly reflecting increased mycorrhizal activity close to the bole. Autotrophic respiration was estimated in beech to be as much as 50% of the total SR in the stand. The contribution of autotrophic respiration was less certain for spruce, although close to the bole, the autotrophic fraction may contribute to total SR as much as in beech.

It is hypothesized that defoliation-induced changes in plant carbon allocation and root soluble C concentration modify rhizosphere C availability and, further, the abundance and activity of soil microbes and their grazers. To test this hypothesis, field-grown Lolium perenne swards were defoliated twice during their second growing season at two nitrogen availabilities (added N or no added N). Plant, soil and microbial attributes were measured 2 and 4 days after the last defoliation, and nematode abundance was measured 6 days after the last defoliation. 2. Defoliation decreased shoot production in plots where N was added, but had no significant effect in plots where N was not added. Root biomass and the ratio of root mass to shoot production were not affected. 3. Defoliation increased root soluble C concentration by 26% at the first harvest (2 days after defoliation) and by 18% at the second harvest (4 days after defoliation). Leaf N concentration was 27% lower in defoliated than in non-defoliated swards at the first harvest, while that of stems was 14% higher in defoliated swards at both harvests, and that of roots was not affected. Defoliation increased root C : N ratio, decreased stem C : N ratio, and did not have a statistically significant effect on leaf C : N ratio. 4. Soil attributes (soil soluble C concentration and soil C and N concentrations) were not affected by defoliation. Similarly, microbial attributes such as microbial C and N content, bacterial abundance in rhizosphere soil, and diversity of C sources utilized by the rhizosphere microbial community, did not differ between defoliated and non-defoliated swards. 5. Among nematode trophic groups, defoliation reduced the abundance of fungivorous and herbivorous nematodes by 70 and 47%, respectively, but did not affect the abundance of bacterivorous, omnivorous and predatory nematodes. 6. Although defoliation altered plant C allocation and root soluble C concentration, these changes did not influence C availability, soil microbial growth or the abundance of bacteria-feeding nematodes in the plant rhizosphere. Instead, the effects on root- and fungus-feeding nematodes suggest that the effects of defoliation on soil communities were propagated not through the effects of root-released C on bacteria and bacterial grazers, but through effects of root quality on root-feeders and possibly through effects of mycorrhizal fungi on fungus-feeders.","ENSAIA, UMR INPL INRA Agron & Environm, Rhizosphere Grp, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Bazot, S (reprint author), ENSAIA, UMR INPL INRA Agron & Environm, Rhizosphere Grp, BP 172, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",Christophe.Robin@ensaia.inpl-nancy.fr,"ROBIN, Christophe/C-7323-2013; Mikola, Juha/A-1630-2015","ROBIN, Christophe/0000-0001-8117-806X; Mikola, Juha/0000-0002-4336-2648; Nguyen, Christophe/0000-0003-0917-6398",,,,64,40,46,1,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Elevated compared with ambient CO2 concentrations resulted in greater root-length growth (+52%), root-length losses (+37%), and total pool sizes (+41%). The greater standing pool of roots under elevated compared with ambient CO2 was because of the greater number of roots (+35%), not because individuals were longer. Loss rates increased relatively less than growth rates because life spans were longer (+41%). The diameter of roots was larger under elevated compared with ambient CO2 only in the upper soil profile. Elevated CO2 affected root architecture through increased branching. Growth-to-loss ratio regressions to time of equilibrium indicate very long turnover times of 5.8, 7.0, and 5.3 years for control, ambient, and elevated CO2, respectively. Production was greater under elevated compared with ambient CO2 both below- and aboveground, and the above- to belowground ratios did not differ between treatments. However, estimates of belowground production differed among methods of calculation using minirhizotron data, as well as between minirhizotron and root-ingrowth methods. Users of minirhizotrons may need to consider equilibration in terms of both new growth and disappearance, rather than just growth. Large temporal pulses of root initiation and termination rates of entire individuals were observed (analogous to birth-death rates), and precipitation explained more of the variance in root initiation than termination. There was a dampening of the pulsing in root initiation and termination under elevated CO2 during both wet and dry periods, which may be because of conservation of soil water reducing the suddenness of wet pulses and duration and severity of dry pulses. However, a very low degree of synchrony was observed between growth and disappearance (production and decomposition).","Colorado State Univ, Forest Range & Watershed Stewardship Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; USDA ARS, Soil Plant Nutrient Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Milchunas, DG (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Forest Range & Watershed Stewardship Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Daniel.Milchunas@ColoState.edu,,,,,,67,49,56,1,51,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We sought to test for relationships between the numerical abundances of bacteria, microfungi, nematodes and arthropods along a pH gradient. Location 284 agro-ecosystems on Pleistocene sand across the Netherlands. Methods Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and stepwise regressions were applied, using soil- and leaf-litter organisms sampled from a land-cover network. Results The major variation in the numerical abundance of the organisms belonging to the investigated taxocenes could be ascribed to soil acidity. Contrary to expectations, the effects of temperature on numerical abundance were significant only for Fungi and Nematoda (P < 0.0001). Geographical co-ordinates always play a minor role. The often-suggested close correlation between the numerical abundance of eukaryotes and their local taxonomic diversity applied only to Arthropoda and Fungi (P < 0.00001). Only the number of bacterial DNA bands seemed to reflect the taxa-area relationship (F-value = 22.45, P < 0.0001). Main conclusions There were strong relationships between the numerical abundances of all the investigated taxocenes and the field-measured soil acidity (P < 0.0001). The largest effects were detected in the Fungi, which tended to be much more acid-tolerant than Bacteria. These patterns imply ecological shifts in the detrital soil food web and deserve further investigation.","Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Lab Ecol Risk Assessment, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; Environm Assessment Agcy, Bilthoven, Netherlands","Mulder, C (reprint author), Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Lab Ecol Risk Assessment, POB 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands.",christian.mulder@rivm.nl,"van Wezel, Annemarie/N-9758-2013; Mulder, Christian/N-4726-2015","van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X; Mulder, Christian/0000-0001-5735-6989",,,,87,47,50,2,43,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

It was hypothesized that microbial community structure would be similar in soils from the same grassland type, and that grassland vegetation classifications could thus be used as predictors of microbial community structure. Microbial community measurements varied widely according to both site and grassland type, and trends in the effect of grassland improvement differed between sites. These results were consistent with those from similar studies, and indicated that floristic community composition was not a stable predictor of microbial community structure across sites. This may indicate a lack of correlation between grassland plant composition and soil microbial community structure, or that differences in soil chemistry between sites had larger impacts on soil microbial populations than plant-related effects.","Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Ind Microbiol, Microbial Ecol Grp, Dublin 4, Ireland","Kennedy, N (reprint author), Univ No British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Programs, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",nablak@alum.colby.edu,"Kennedy, Nabla/H-3540-2019","Kennedy, Nabla/0000-0003-3778-4294",,,,63,26,26,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

We investigated the effects of spatial pattern and density on the relative importance of intra- and interspecific competition in a field experiment. We hypothesized that weak competitors increased biomass and seed production within neighborhoods of conspecifics, while stronger competitors would show increased biomass and seed production within neighborhoods of heterospecifics. Seeds of four annual plant species (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stachys annua, Stellaria media, Poa annua) were sown in two spatial patterns (aggregated vs. random) and at two densities (low vs. high) in three different species combinations (monocultures, three and four species mixtures). There was a hierarchy in biomass production among the four species and C. bursa-pastoris and S. media were among the weak competitors. Capsella and Stellaria showed increased biomass production and had more individuals in the aggregated compared to the random pattern, especially when both superior competitors (S. annua, P. annua) were present. For P. annua we observed considerable differences among species combinations and unexpected pattern effects. Our findings support the hypothesis that weak competitors increase their fitness when grown in the neighborhood of conspecifics, and suggested that for the weakest competitors the species identity is not important and all other species are best avoided through intraspecific aggregation. In addition, our data suggest that the importance of spatial pattern for the other competitors might not only depend on the position within the hierarchy but also on the identity of neighbor species, species characteristics, below ground interactions, and other nonspatial factors.","Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Conservat Biol, Basel, Switzerland","Monzeglio, U (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, Basel, Switzerland.",u.monzeglio@unibas.ch,"Stoll, Peter/A-8881-2010","Stoll, Peter/0000-0003-1509-1702",,,,58,57,60,1,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2005,145,4,,,,,619,628,,10.1007/s00442-005-0168-3,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,973ZA,WOS:000232559900012,16001215,,,,10/31/19J,"Majdi, H",,,,"Majdi, H",,,Fine root turnover in forest ecosystems - Preface,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Majdi, H (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, POB 7072, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",turpault@nancy.inra.fr,,,,,,5,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,2-Jan,,,,,VII,VIII,,10.1007/s11104-005-2582-z,,,2,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Andersson, P; Majdi, H",,,,"Andersson, P; Majdi, H",,,Estimating root longevity at sites with long periods of low root mortality,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,International Workshop on Fine Root Turnover,"SEP 08-10, 2003","Uppsala, SWEDEN",,,fine roots; longevity; long winter; minirhizotron; mortality; Picea abies,NORWAY SPRUCE STAND; DYNAMICS; FORESTS,"Minirhizotron technique is capable of providing median root longevity. The use of the median longevity might overestimate root longevity if the distribution of survival times is very skewed or irregular, as is the case at sites where root mortality is very low during the long winter. In this paper we illustrate the case theoretically and compare that with field observation in northern Sweden to show an alternative procedure for such sites. Hypothetical root cohorts were constructed to investigate and show some technical problems with estimating median root longevity at a Swedish northern site where root mortality is very low during long winter time (8 months), and to investigate whether these problems could be overcome by discarding winter time from the survival analysis and include only the growing season in which the roots are at risk of mortality. Authentic root data, gathered in a minirhizotron study at such a site, were analysed on a whole year basis and on season basis. By analysing longevity based only on the season when there is a risk for root death, the median longevity became a more reliable estimate of the true mean longevity. When this method was applied to root data from northern Sweden, the estimated root longevity in different treatments became between 17% lower and 8% higher compared to the longevity estimated on a whole year basis.We conclude that the reliability of the median longevity as an estimate of the true mean longevity can be increased by basing the survival analysis only on the parts of the year when fine roots are at risk of mortality at sites with long winter and low root mortality.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil Sci, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Andersson, P (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, POB 7072, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",hooshang.majdi@eom.slu.se,,,,,,13,13,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,2-Jan,,,,,9,14,,10.1007/s11104-004-0125-7,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ghanati, F; Morita, A; Yokota, H",,,,"Ghanati, F; Morita, A; Yokota, H",,,Effects of aluminum on the growth of tea plant and activation of antioxidant system,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,aluminum tolerance; antioxidant system; Camellia sinensis; lignin; phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL); reactive oxygen species (ROS),HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TOXICITY; CATALASE; CELLS; COLEOPTILES; SEEDLINGS; TOLERANT; LIGNIN; ACID,"A possible connection between the effects of aluminum (Al) on the growth of tea plants and the active oxygen species scavenging system in root tips of intact tea plants and suspension-cultured tea cells was examined.

Their Al resistance was respectively higher than and similar to that in an Al resistant buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) cultivar. In contrast, P. bungeanum was much more Al sensitive since the root elongation was inhibited by 80% under the same condition. The difference in Al resistance among Polygonum species was confirmed in a 10-d intermittent Al treatment experiment, the root biomass of the first two species were unaltered and decreased by 50% in the latter species. However, high Al accumulation was not found in the leaves, indicating these species were not Al accumulators. Oxalate efflux was detected in root exudates of both Al resistant species, efflux initiated within 30 min treatment of 50 mu M Al. No organic acid anions were detected in the root exudates of the Al sensitive species. The anion channel inhibitor phenylglyoxal (PG) inhibited the oxalate efflux greatly. Inhibition of root elongation was greater in the presence of PG, confirming that oxalate efflux was associated with the Al resistance. However, since the efflux rate was much lower than their related species buckwheat, other mechanisms must be involved in Al resistance and these need to be studied further.","Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Peoples R China","Zheng, SJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Peoples R China.",sjzheng@zju.edu.cn,"Zheng, Shao Jian/A-3552-2009","Zheng, Shao Jian/0000-0002-3336-8165",,,,31,17,22,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,2-Jan,,,,,143,151,,10.1007/s11104-005-3786-y,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Garau, G; Reeve, WG; Brau, L; Deiana, P; Yates, RJ; James, D; Tiwari, R; O'Hara, GW; Howieson, JG",,,,"Garau, G; Reeve, WG; Brau, L; Deiana, P; Yates, RJ; James, D; Tiwari, R; O'Hara, GW; Howieson, JG",,,The symbiotic requirements of different Medicago spp. suggest the evolution of Sinorhizobium meliloti and S-Medicae with hosts differentially adapted to soil pH,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,acid adaptation; Medicago spp; Sinorhizobium medicae; S. meliloti; symbiotic requirements,POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; LEGUME PASTURE; ACID TOLERANCE; IDENTIFICATION; AUSTRALIA; SEQUENCES; FIXATION; BACTERIA; STRAINS,"Nitrogen fixing rhizobia associated with the Medicago L. genus belong to two closely related species Sinorhizobium medicae and S. meliloti. To investigate the symbiotic requirements of different Medicago species for the two microsymbionts, 39 bacterial isolates from nodules of eleven Medicago species growing in their natural habitats in the Mediterranean basin plus six historical Australian commercial inocula were symbiotically characterized with Medicago hosts. The bacterial species allocation was first assigned on the basis of symbiotic proficiency with M. polymorpha. PCR primers specific for 16S rDNA were then designed to distinguish S. medicae and S. meliloti. PCR amplification results confirmed the species allocation acquired in the glasshouse. PCR fingerprints generated from ERIC, BOXA1R and nif-directed RPO1 primers revealed that the Mediterranean strains were genetically heterogenous. Moreover PCR fingerprints with ERIC and BOX primers showed that these repetitive DNA elements were specifically distributed and conserved in S. meliloti and S. medicae, clustering the strains into two divergent groups according to their species. Linking the Sinorhizobium species with the plant species of origin we have found that S. medicae was mostly associated with medics well adapted to moderately acid soils such as M. polymorpha, M. arabica and M. murex whereas S. meliloti was predominantly isolated from plants naturally growing on alkaline or neutral pH soils such as M. littoralis and M. tornata. Moreover in glasshouse experiments the S. medicae strains were able to induce well-developed nodules on M. murex whilst S. meliloti was not infective on this species. This feature provides a very distinguishing characteristic for S. medicae. Results from the symbiotic, genotypic and cultural characterization suggest that S. meliloti and S. medicae have adapted to different Medicago species according to the niches these medics usually occupy in their natural habitats.","Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali Agr & Biotecnol Agroa, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; Murdoch Univ, Ctr Rhizobium Studies, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; Dept Agr, S Perth, WA, Australia","Howieson, JG (reprint author), Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali Agr & Biotecnol Agroa, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",jhowieso@murdoch.edu.au,"Garau, Giovanni/J-5362-2014; Brau, Lambert/J-3214-2018","Garau, Giovanni/0000-0001-8292-8336; Brau, Lambert/0000-0001-7105-8339; DEIANA, Pietrino/0000-0001-5162-3441; Tiwari, Ravi/0000-0003-3354-770X",,,,32,50,51,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,2-Jan,,,,,263,277,,10.1007/s11104-005-0374-0,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900023,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kuwada, K; Kuramoto, M; Utamura, M; Matsushita, I; Shibata, Y; Ishii, T",,,,"Kuwada, K; Kuramoto, M; Utamura, M; Matsushita, I; Shibata, Y; Ishii, T",,,"Effect of mannitol from Laminaria japonica, other sugar alcohols, and marine alga polysaccharides on in vitro hyphal growth of Gigaspora margarita and root colonization of trifoliate orange",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus; growth stimulant; mannitol; marine algae; polysaccharide; sugar alcohol,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON METABOLISM; INFECTION; SPORE,"A compound that stimulated the growth of an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus was isolated from 75% methyl alcohol (MeOH) extracts of a brown alga, Laminaria japonica Areschoug, using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This compound (Compound 1) was identified as mannitol by HPLC and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Compound 1 and purchased polysaccharides (alginic acid, fucoidan, carrageenan and mannan from marine algae) were tested for in vitro hyphal growth of an AM fungus, Gigaspora margarita Becker and Hall. Compound 1 (50-500 mg L-1) and carrageenan (1000 mg L-1) significantly stimulated the hyphal growth of germinating spores of Gi. margarita. The application of 100 mg L-1 of Compound 1 to trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata Raf.) inoculated with Gi. margarita promoted root colonization and increased plant growth. These results suggest low concentrations of mannitol are among the reasons for enhanced hyphal growth and root colonization by the application of algal extracts. Other sugar alcohols (100-300 mg L-1 of xylitol, sorbitol and meso-erythritol) also increased the hyphal growth of Gi. margarita.","Yamaki Co Ltd, Res Lab, Iyo, Ehime 7993194, Japan; Ehime Univ, Dept Mol Sci, Integrated Ctr Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; Okayama Gakuin Univ, Fac Human Life, Kurashiki, Okayama 7108511, Japan; Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068522, Japan","Kuwada, K (reprint author), Yamaki Co Ltd, Res Lab, Iyo, Ehime 7993194, Japan.",kkuwada@yamaki.co.jp,,,,,,30,6,7,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2005,276,2-Jan,,,,,279,286,,10.1007/s11104-005-4985-2,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,988VS,WOS:000233629900024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pasonen, HL; Degefu, Y; Brumos, J; Lohtander, K; Pappinen, A; Timonen, S; Seppanen, SK",,,,"Pasonen, HL; Degefu, Y; Brumos, J; Lohtander, K; Pappinen, A; Timonen, S; Seppanen, SK",,,Transgenic Betula pendula expressing sugar beet chitinase IV forms normal ectomycorrhizae with Paxillus involutus in vitro,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mycorrhizal colonization; risk assessment; silver birch; transgenic tree,PATHOGEN RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; FUNGUS GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; PLANT CHITINASES; NICOTIANA-SYLVESTRIS; ENHANCED RESISTANCE; TOBACCO CHITINASES; GENE-EXPRESSION; MYCORRHIZAL; GROWTH; COLONIZATION,"Mycorrhizal fungi contain chitin in their cell walls and may be influenced by transgenic chitinases.

Artificial herbivory significantly decreased the amount of ergosterol, a fungus-specific sterol, in the birch roots and microbial respiration in the soil. Reduction in plant's photosynthetic ability thus reduced availability of carbon for both mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere microorganisms. Adding glucose, a carbon source easily assimilable by soil microorganisms, significantly enhanced microbial respiration, and counteracted the negative effects of clipping on microbial respitation. At the same time, the amount of ergosterol in the birch roots was decreased, indicating that enhanced activity of rhizosphere microorganisms had a negative impact on the mycorrhizal fungi. The outcome of glucose addition on mycorrhizal fungi did not interact with the clipping treatment. A fungal and bacteria] toxin treatment did not affect microbial respiration, but significantly increased the birch root growth and amount of ergosterol in the treatment without the glucose addition. Our results show that rhizosphere microorganisms may have antagonistic effects on mycorrhizal fungi associated with the birch. We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between rhizosphere microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi may have an important role in the functions of mycorrhizal systems and its significance in natural systems should be further investigated.

Forst. or Anacardium occidentale L. under subtropical conditions. An adjacent soil under natural vegetation was used as a standard of local, high quality soil. Six years after planting, revegetation with C. equisetifolia or A. occidentale had resulted in higher soil total organic C, water soluble C and carbohydrates, total N content and aggregate stability compared with the bare soil. Soil bulk density decreased sharply after planting of both the tree species, approaching that of soil under native vegetation. Protease-BAA and P-glucosidase activities were higher in the soil revegetated with C. equisetifolia than in that revegetated with A. occidentale, while the remaining activities reached similar values in both the revegetated soils, these being higher than those of the bare soil. It may be concluded that revegetation with C. equisetifolia or A. occidentale rapidly improved soil physical and microbiological properties of a mining area under subtropical conditions. Soil enzyme activities and labile carbon fractions were very sensitive indicators of the improvement in soil quality resulting from the revegetation. Over the duration of this experiment, revegetated soils were still far from reaching the quality levels of the soil under natural vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Theory suggests that intralocus sexual conflict can be mitigated through reduction of the intersexual genetic correlation (r(MF)), predicting negative covariation between rMF and sexual dimorphism. In addition, recent work showed that selection should favor reduced expression of alleles inherited from the opposite-sex parent (intersexual inheritance) in traits subject to intralocus sexual conflict. For traits under sexual selection in males, this should be manifested either in reduced maternal heritability or, when conflict is severe, in reduced heritability through the opposite-sex parent in offspring of both sexes. However, because we do not know how far these hypothesized evolutionary responses can actually proceed, the importance of intralocus sexual conflict as a long-term constraint on adaptive evolution remain, unclear. In this study, we investigated the genetic architecture of sexual and nonsexual morphological traits in Prochyliza xanthostorna. The lowest r(MF) and greatest dimorphism were exhibited by two sexual traits (head length and antenna length) and, among all traits, the degree of sexual dimorphism was correlated negatively with r(MF). Moreover, sexual traits exhibited reduced maternal heritabilities, and the most strongly dimorphic sexual trait (antenna length) was heritable only through the same-sex parent in offspring of both sexes. Our results support theory and suggest that intralocus sexual conflict can be resolved substantially by genoinic adaptation. Further work is required to identify the proximate mechanisms underlying these patterns.","Univ Turin, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Bonduriansky, R (reprint author), Univ Turin, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",r.bonduriansky@unsw.edu.au,,"Bonduriansky, Russell/0000-0002-5786-6951",,,,79,74,74,0,24,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,SEP,2005,59,9,,,,,1965,1975,,,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,969UB,WOS:000232259300011,16261734,,,,10/31/19J,"Kozovits, AR; Matyssek, R; Blaschke, H; Gottlein, A; Grams, TEE",,,,"Kozovits, AR; Matyssek, R; Blaschke, H; Gottlein, A; Grams, TEE",,,Competition increasingly dominates the responsiveness of juvenile beech and spruce to elevated CO2 and/or O-3 concentrations throughout two subsequent growing seasons,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,allometry; European beech (Fagus sylvatica); interspecific competition; Norway spruce (Picea abies); partitioning; whole-plant nitrogen status,LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; CENTRAL EUROPEAN HEDGEROW; LOW OZONE CONCENTRATIONS; BIRCH BETULA-PENDULA; FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MODEL-ECOSYSTEMS; NORWAY SPRUCE; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; CROWN ARCHITECTURE,"Saplings of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies were grown in mono- and mixed cultures in a 2-year phytotron study under all four combinations of ambient and elevated ozone (O-3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The hypotheses tested were (1) that the competitiveness of beech rather than spruce is negatively affected by the exposure to enhanced O-3 concentrations, (2) spruce benefits from the increase of resource availability (elevated CO2) in the mixed culture and (3) that the responsiveness of plants to CO2 and O-3 depends on the type of competition (i.e. intra vs. interspecific). Beech displayed a competitive disadvantage when growing in mixture with spruce: after two growing seasons under interspecific competition, beech showed significant reductions in leaf gas exchange, biomass development and crown volume as compared with beech plants growing in monoculture. In competition with spruce, beech appeared to be nitrogen (N)-limited, whereas spruce tended to benefit in terms of its plant N status. The responsiveness of the juvenile trees to the atmospheric treatments differed between species and was dominated by the type of competition: spruce growth benefited from elevated CO2 concentrations, while beech growth suffered from the enhanced O-3 regime. In general, interspecific competition enhanced these atmospheric treatment effects, supporting our hypotheses. Significant differences in root : shoot biomass ratio between the type of competition under both elevated O-3 and CO2 were not caused by readjustments of biomass partitioning, but were dependent on tree size. Our study stresses that competition is an important factor driving plant development, and suggests that the knowledge about responses of plants to elevated CO2 and/or O-3, acquired from plants growing in monoculture, may not be transferred to plants grown under interspecific competition as typically found in the field.","Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Grams, TEE (reprint author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Ecol, Caixa Postal 04457, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",grams@wzw.tum.de,"Gottlein, Axel/E-9923-2017; Kozovits, Alessandra R/H-7623-2012; Grams, Thorsten E.

Seedlings of native woody pioneer and early secondary species that generally exhibited fine roots with a dense cover of long root hairs showed higher mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal colonization than late-secondary and climax species with coarse roots with a sparse cover of short root hairs. Root-hair length and incidence decreased with the progression among the successional groups while fine-root diameter increased, both in the greenhouse and in the field. The mycorrhizal response was highly correlated to root mycorrhizal colonization in the greenhouse and in the field. These parameters were inversely correlated with the seed mass and fine-root diameter, but directly correlated with root-hair incidence, both in the greenhouse and in the field. Mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal colonization were also directly correlated with the root-hair length and root/shoot ratio of uninoculated plants. The seedling mycorrhizal status of the early successional woody species suggests that the root traits of these fast-growing species can be more receptive to attraction, infection and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizas than root traits of late-successional species.","Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, Parana, Brazil","Zangaro, W (reprint author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, Parana, Brazil.",wzangaro@uel.br,"Zangaro, Waldemar/A-2890-2008; Romagnoli, Graziela Gorete/O-3806-2016",,,,,40,36,44,0,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

While height and root-collar diameter are the most common traits evaluated during seedling quality assessment, above-ground morphology is not always an accurate predictor of performance after outplanting. Root system morphology and physiological status may provide a more accurate indication of seedling potential. However, relatively few studies have attempted to quantitatively assess root system quality in relation to outplanting success. Large root volume, high root fibrosity, and an increased number of first-order lateral roots have shown some correlation to improved field performance. Physiological seedling quality assessment is commonly practiced through evaluation of root growth potential. Other tests, such as root electrolyte leakage, have also shown some potential as measures of seedling physiological quality. This review identifies current methods of assessing seedling root system quality and discusses potential shortcomings of these methods. An increased understanding of the suitability of current tests, coupled with the development of new tests and multiple parameter relationships, may foster the development of species and site-specific targets for seedling root system quality assessment. The production of seedlings with root systems that meet high morphological and physiological standards better enables seedlings to rapidly establish and thrive upon outplanting.","Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Jacobs, DF (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, 715 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",djacobs@purdue.edu,,"Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516",,,,112,100,127,2,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,SEP,2005,30,3-Feb,,,,,295,311,,10.1007/s11056-005-7480-y,,,17,Forestry,Forestry,966CU,WOS:000231998000012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mikola, J; Nieminen, M; Ilmarinen, K; Vestberg, M",,,,"Mikola, J; Nieminen, M; Ilmarinen, K; Vestberg, M",,,Belowground responses by AM fungi and animal trophic groups to repeated defoliation in an experimental grassland community,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,AM fungi; defoliation; enchytraeid; grassland; nematode; soil food web,SOIL FOOD-WEB; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; LOLIUM-PERENNE; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; PLANT; RHIZOSPHERE; HERBIVORY; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY,"We tested a hypothesis that the effects of defoliation on plants and soil organisms vary with the number of successive defoliations. We established a 23-week greenhouse experiment using replicated grassland microcosms that were composed of three plant species, Trifolium repens, Plantago lanceolata and Phleum pratense, growing together in grassland soil with a diverse soil community. The experiment consisted of two treatment factors-defoliation and harvest time-in a fully factorial design. The defoliation treatment had two levels, i.e. no trimming and trimming of plants every 2 weeks, and the harvest time live levels, i.e. harvests after 1-3, 5 and 7 trimmings. Shoot production (trimmed plus harvested shoot mass), harvested shoot and root mass and root N and C concentrations increased with time but were reduced by defoliation. Colonization rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi decreased with time in T. repens roots but were enhanced by defoliation, whereas AM colonization rates in P. pratense roots were not affected by harvest time or defoliation. The abundance of bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes decreased and that of herbivorous and predatory nematodes increased with time, while the abundance of omnivorous nematodes and detritivorous enchytraeids varied in time without a linear trend. Defoliation had no effect on fungivores and predators but increased the abundance of bacterivores. Defoliation also increased the abundance of herbivores, omnivores and detritivores after 2 trimmings and that of omnivores and detritivores after 5 trimmings, but had a negative effect on omnivores after 3 trimmings and on herbivores after 7 trimmings. Among nematode genera, some deviation from the trophic group responses existed: for instance, defoliation reduced the abundance of bacterivorous Acrobeloides spp. and did not affect the abundance of herbivorous Filenchus spp. and Paratylenchus spp. Our results show that the effects of defoliation on plants, AM fungi and some soil animal trophic groups may remain constant all the way through several defoliations, whereas other animal trophic groups may have different and even opposite responses to defoliation depending on the length of the defoliation period before monitoring. This shows how separate studies with defoliation periods of different length can produce contradictory results of the effects of defoliation on the abundance of soil animals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphotypes generally correlated well with specific TRFs and sequence analysis confirmed that TRFs could be used to discriminate among fungal types. Sequence analysis indicated that important ECM fungi including Russulaceae, Thelephorales, and Tricholomataceae could be fingerprinted with TRFLP. In addition, a fixed proportion of the DNA extracted from each morphotype from the same core was used in a pooling experiment used to assess whether previously identified fungal species types could be distinguished from one another within reconstructed communities. Since some morphotypes share TRFs, dual analysis of ITS1 and ITS2 was necessary for accurate fingerprinting of fungal types. Approximately, 5.0 +/- 0.3 phylotypes were detected per core with TRFLP-coffected morphotyping as compared to 4.0 +/- 0.4 phylotypes using TRFLP on pooled community samples. TRFLP made on experimental sporocarp communities suggested that reduced ECM richness with TRFLP may be partly caused by differences in the amount of DNA available for PCR and primer bias. Nonetheless, TRFLP on pooled morphotypes accounted for more than 93 % of colonized root tips. The method can be used to facilitate analysis of mycorrhizal communities using root tips collected from soil cores. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the greenhouse, two-week-old seedlings were randomly assigned to one of seven water-depth treatments (-6, -4, -2, 0, +2, +4, and +6 cm relative to the soil surface) and allowed to grow for six months. Species included five perennial sedges, four perennial and one annual grasses, and two perennial and two annual forbs. Twelve of the species had their lowest biomass and lowest survivorship at water depths greater than 0 cm. The root:shoot ratio, however, did not change across water-depth treatments. Biomass accumulation differed by plant form (sedges > forbs > grasses). Annuals had the greatest biomass values across the widest range of water depths compared to perennials. Of the fourteen plants tested, Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), one of the two invasive, non-native species tested, had the greatest biomass at water depths from -6 to +2, whereas Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass), the other invasive, had comparatively small mean biomass values. Ranking of biomass between species was highly concordant between non-flooded treatments but not significantly concordant between flooded treatments indicating that plant species have distinct responses to flooding. This research suggests that newly established plant seedlings in wetland restorations should not be submerged, or if submergence is unavoidable, annuals and sedges may be more tolerant of prolonged flooding.","Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Fraser, LH (reprint author), Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada.",lfraser@tru.ca,,,,,,55,31,47,1,39,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,SEP,2005,25,3,,,,,520,530,,10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0520:ACAOSS]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,967ZM,WOS:000232130300002,,,,,10/31/19J,"O'Grady, AP; Worledge, D; Battaglia, M",,,,"O'Grady, AP; Worledge, D; Battaglia, M",,,Temporal and spatial changes in fine root distributions in a young Eucalyptus globulus stand in southern Tasmania,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine roots; eucalyptus; root length density; biomass density; root size class distributions,SCOTS PINE STANDS; ABOVEGROUND GROWTH; NITENS; DYNAMICS; WATER; SOIL; BIOMASS; PRODUCTIVITY; PLANTATION; AUSTRALIA,"Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) is an important plantation tree species within Australia and in Mediterranean climates throughout the world. Despite this, very little is known about below ground processes in this species. This information is vital for modelling growth and productivity of E. globulus stands and for predicting the impact of these stands on site carbon and water balance. This paper presents data on the temporal and spatial development of fine root length density (L-v), fine root biomass density (M-r), and information on the diameter size class distributions of fine roots, in a young E globulus stand during the first 14 months of growth at a site in southern Tasmania. Spatial and temporal changes in the root distribution were quantified through sequential soil coring. There was rapid expansion of the fine root network. Six months after planting, fine roots were recorded at distances of a meter from the tree (L-v 0.3 cm cm(-3)) and by 14 months had occupied the inter-rows (L-v approximately 1.3 cm cm(-3)). Fine root length density (L-v) and biomass M-r declined with distance from the tree and with increasing depth. However, after 14 months, distance from tree became less important as roots occupied the inter-rows. Fine root density was highest in upper soil horizons and roots less than I mm diameter were the largest contributors to L-v, Root length density and biomass density was still increasing after 14 months growth even though most of the soil profile had been explored.

The air temperature between June and August was anomalous, deviating from the 30 year average (1961-1990) by +2 degrees C to +5 degrees C. In northeastern Central Europe (51 degrees N-55-N, 10 degrees E-17 degrees E: north-eastern Germany and western Poland) a deficit in precipitation of 180 mm resulted from the 2003 drought. In this year the precipitation rate amounted to 440 turn p. a. only. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the main tree species in the ongoing conversions of coniferous plantations to deciduous forests, since beech dominates the potential natural vegetation (PNV) in large parts of Central Europe. However, the reputed drought sensitiveness of beech has led to discussions about the growth and regeneration of beech on dryer sites in southern Germany in the context of climate change predictions. In eight pure and mixed European beech forests in northeastern Central Europe the growth response of natural beech regeneration during the 2003 summer drought and the additional effects of shading was investigated. The selected stands, comprising four to six year old natural beech regeneration situated on sites with similar sandy soils, spanned a 600 kin geographic gradient from Northeast Germany to Northeast Poland (Masuria). During the extended drought period from end of July to mid August 2003, the plant water status of beech regeneration was assessed by measuring the predawn potential (psi(PD)) of 17 to 22 randomly selected saplings with a Scholander pressure chamber. All stands were then classified into class (1) without water stress (psi(PD) > -0.4 MPa), class (2) with moderate water stress (psi(PD) -0.4 MPa to -0.8 MPa) or class (3) with high water stress (psi(PD) < -0.8 MPa). Inventories of natural regeneration took place on permanently marked plots 0.12 ha to 0.25 ha in area. On six to eight subplots (20 m(2) area), up to 20 beech saplings were labeled and total aerial shoot length, root collar diameter, and terminal shoot length were recorded. A second inventory in September 2004 enabled relative length and diameter increment in 2003 and 2004 to be calculated in relation to plant size at the beginning of the growth period. Hemispherical photography was used to consider additional effects of below-canopy irradiance on plant performance by deriving the diffuse site factor (DIFFSF) of each subplot. Results showed that plant water status during July and August 200 had a considerable effect on the relative increment of saplings during 2003 and 2004. Increased water stress, indicated by decreased predawn plant potential, correlated to lower relative length and diameter increment. A carry-over effect of the summer drought on beech sapling performance was evident as a decrease in relative growth was observed during the 2004 wet growing season compared to sapling growth during the 2003 drought year. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) identified both water stress and diffuse site factor (DIFFSF) as parameters affecting relative and absolute growth increment of the saplings. Water stress had a stronger effect on plant performance than shading. However influence of canopy was more evident when water stress was increased. For the relative length increment in 2004, climatic water shortage and diffuse site factor (DIFFSF) were found to have an interactive effect. The latter may reflect the impact of soil resource depletion in addition to the impact of shelterwood competition on regeneration performance by limiting light availability. In addition, the limited ability of shaded beech regeneration to adapt to water stress can also play a role. This may be due to the lower osmotic potential and lower root/shoot ratios of these plants. The lower adaptation potential of shaded beech exacerbates the impact of competition from the overstorey. The predicted increase in summer drought events in Central Europe suggest that an optimization of soil water resource management in future silvicultural planning will be crucial for successful beech stand regeneration. In this context, a marked reduction in canopy after the successful establishment of young beech plants will reduce the risk of water stress, provided competition from ground vegetation is controlled. Irregular shelterwood systems creating gap openings with an initial area of up to 20 meters in diameter will provide those conditions, particularly in gap centres. Additional opportunities to increase the water stress tolerance of beech stands, such as the introduction of beech provenances from their eastern or southern boundaries where dryer climates prevail, need to be investigated.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Waldbau 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Czajkowski, T (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Waldbau 1, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",tczajko@gwdg.de; marcus-kuehling@web.de; abolte@gwdg.de,"Bolte, Andreas/A-3521-2009",,,,,67,28,30,2,43,J D SAUERLAENDERS VERLAG,BAD ORB,"BERLINER STRASSE 46, 63619 BAD ORB, GERMANY",Feb-52,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

In the subtropical forests of Puerto Rico, the major natural disturbances are hurricanes and droughts. We tested the ecosystem-level effects of these disturbances in sites with different land use histories. From 1989 to 1992, data were collected to determine the effects of Hurricane Hugo and two droughts on litterfall inputs, fine-root biomass, and decomposition rates in three topographic locations (stream, riparian, upslope) within two watersheds. From 1994 to 1998, we added a third watershed and an experiment in which coarse-wood levels were manipulated to simulate hurricane inputs. Data were collected on tree and palm growth rates, litterfall inputs, fine-root biomass, and decomposition rates. From 1994 to 1998, four hurricanes and three droughts were recorded. Measured parameters had unique responses and recovery rates to hurricanes and droughts. Litterfall inputs returned to long-term mean rates within one month following droughts and small-to-moderate hurricanes but required five years to recover after an intense hurricane. In contrast, fine-root biomass recovered seven months after an intense hurricane but failed to recover after five years following a severe drought. Despite the dramatic effects of these weather events on some ecosystem parameters, we found that aboveground measures of tree and palm growth were more affected by preexisting site conditions (e.g., nitrot,en availability due to past land use activities) than hurricanes or droughts. The addition of coarse woody debris increased tree and palm growth, fine-root biomass, and litter production; however, in the case of tree and palm growth, this effect was least measurable in the sites with the highest productivity. We found that decomposition rates were more controlled by litter quality than weather conditions. In conclusion, we found that certain ecosystem structures (e.g., canopy structure and fine-root biomass) generally recovered more slowly from disturbance events than certain ecosystem processes (e.g., plant growth rates, decomposition rates). We also found that past land use activities and disturbance legacies were important in determining the responses and recovery rates of the ecosystem to disturbance.","Utah State Univ, Forest Range & Wildlife Sci & Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Beard, KH (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Forest Range & Wildlife Sci & Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Crowl, Todd/C-9576-2011; Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495",,,,59,77,81,2,37,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",15-Dec,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

We used lipid analysis to determine feeding strategies in Collembola raised on various bacteria], fungal, plant, or nematode diets. Dietary fatty acids (FAs) were conserved and transferred through the trophic cascade into the neutral lipids of consumers. The presence of vaccenic type FAs (omega 7 family) was indicative of a bacterial diet in general. More specifically, methyl-branched (iso, anteiso) and cyclic forms of FAs were markers for consumption of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Fungal-feeding Collembola comprised a higher proportion of linoleic acid, whereas the profile of plant feeders showed an increased amount of oleic acid. The FA 20:1 omega 9 was only present in Collembola with nematodes as prey. Based on the assigned marker FAs, field populations of Collembola in three deciduous forest stands were ascribed to feeding guilds (i.e., fungivores, bacterivores, herbivores, predators). In conclusion, FA biomarkers provide a high-resolution method to define feeding strategies of decomposer invertebrates and to determine their diets in situ. Lipid analysis has considerable potential as a new tool in soil food web studies.","Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Cook Coll, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Ruess, L (reprint author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci, Emil Wolff Str 27, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",ruess@uni-hohenheim.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Haggblom, Max M/E-7597-2010; Turan, Veysel/G-7722-2011","Haggblom, Max M/0000-0001-6307-7863; ",,,,43,66,68,4,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2005,86,8,,,,,2075,2082,,10.1890/04-1399,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,953KO,WOS:000231075400014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhiyanski, M; Sokolovska, M; Lucot, E; Badot, PM",,,,"Zhiyanski, M.; Sokolovska, M.; Lucot, E.; Badot, P. -M",,,"Cs-137 contamination in forest ecosystems in southwest Rila Mountain, Bulgaria",ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cs-137; soil contamination; soil-to-plant transfer factor,RADIOCESIUM; PLANTS; SOIL,"We studied Cs-137 contamination and radionuclide transfer in mountain forest ecosystems from Bulgaria.

Measurements of soil water content, leaf growth, shoot elongation, sap flow in the xylem of stems and branches, leaf water potential, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance were carried out. Further, water use efficiency (WUE) over long-term periods was examined Via carbon isotope discrimination (&delta;C-13) on leaves. Whole tree and leaf specific hydraulic conductance were determined from sap flux or leaf transpiration and the water potential gradient between soil (as predawn potential) and canopy, respectively. Leaf growth and shoot elongation depended on soil water availability (SWC) and plant tissue water status. A. xanthophloea showed greater (40 kg d(-1)) water use compared to A. tortilis trees of comparable sizes (20 kg d(-1)) during favorable conditions of SWC. Decline in SWC reduced water use and the onset and rate of decline in sap flux was determined by the rooting depth. A. xanthophloea showed earlier response (onset at SWC = 0.24 m(3) m(-1)) to water stress than A. tortilis (onset at SWC = 0.14 m(3) m(-3)). Midday depression in stomatal conductance and subsequent decline in transpiration during favorable SWC as observed in A. xanthophloea was attributed to increased hydraulic resistance and stomatal closure. Rooting patterns and root characteristics could account for the observed morphological and physiological differences between A. tortilis and A. xanthophloea as well as between small and large A. tortilis trees. However, seasonal responses were modified by species-inherent characteristics, which are expressed during drought. Access to deeper soil water resources and the abilities of trees to extract and efficiently transport water may explain differences in drought resistance among species and tree distribution in the and savanna. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The possibility that mycorrhizal mutualists limit the distribution of seedlings may depend on the prevalence of the plant hosts that form the same type of mycorrhizal association as the target seedling species and thus provide inoculum. We tested this hypothesis by measuring ectomycorrhizal (EM) fine root distribution and conducting an EM inoculum potential bioassay along a gradient of EM host density in a pinyon-juniper woodland where pinyon is the only EM fungal host while juniper and other plant species are hosts for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We found that pinyon fine roots were significantly less abundant than juniper roots both in areas dominated aboveground by juniper and in areas where pinyon and juniper were co-dominant. Pinyon seedlings establishing in pinyon-juniper zones are thus more likely to encounter AM than EM fungi. Our bioassay confirmed this result. Pinyon seedlings were six times less likely to be colonized by EM fungi when grown in soil from juniper-dominated zones than in soil from either pinyon-juniper or pinyon zones. Levels of EM colonization were also reduced in seedlings grown in juniper-zone soil. Preliminary analyses indicate that EM community composition varied among sites. These results are important because recent droughts have caused massive mortality of mature pinyons resulting in a shift towards juniper-dominated stands. Lack of EM inoculum in these stands could reduce the ability of pinyon seedlings to re-colonize sites of high pinyon mortality, leading to long-term vegetation shifts.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Haskins, KE (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Kristin.Haskins@nau.edu,,,,,,51,19,20,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2005,145,1,,,,,123,131,,10.1007/s00442-005-0115-3,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,963CC,WOS:000231779500012,15891858,,,,10/31/19J,"Beauchamp, VB; Stromberg, JC; Stutz, JC",,,,"Beauchamp, VB; Stromberg, JC; Stutz, JC",,,"Interactions between Tamarix ramosissima (saltcedar), Populus fremontii (cottonwood), and mycorrhizal fungi: Effects on seedling growth and plant species coexistence",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; dark septate endophytes; Populus fremontii; restoration; riparian; Tamarix ramosissima,DARK SEPTATE ENDOPHYTES; CILIATA SSP AMBIGUA; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL; ATRIPLEX-CANESCENS; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEMS; FOURWING SALTBUSH; SOUTHWESTERN USA; SOIL DISTURBANCE; ROOT ENDOPHYTES,"Little is known about the composition and function of the mycorrhizal fungal community in riparian areas, or its importance in competitive interactions between Populus fremontii, a dominant tree in southwestern United States riparian forests which forms arbuscular and ectomycorrhizas, and Tamarix ramosissima, an introduced tree species that has spread into riparian areas. The objectives of this study were to determine the mycorrhizal status of Tamarixand to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal fungal inoculation on Tamarix growth and on the coexistence between Tamarix and Populus. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization of Tamarix was very low in both field and greenhouse grown roots, but levels of colonization by dark septate endophytes were high. Fungal inoculation had little effect on Tamarix seedling growth in monoculture. When Populus and Tamarix were grown together in a greenhouse pot experiment, fungal inoculation reduced the height and biomass of Tamarix but had no effect on Populus. Fungal inoculation shifted coexistence ratios. When Tamarix and Populus were grown together, Tamarix plants averaged 20 of pot biomass in the uninoculated control but only 5 of pot biomass in the inoculated treatment. These results indicate that Tamarix is non-mycotrophic and that in this greenhouse experiment inoculation altered patterns of coexistence between Populus and Tamarix.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Appl Biol Sci, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA","Beauchamp, VB (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",vanessa_beauchamp@usgs.gov,,,,,,65,31,32,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2005,275,2-Jan,,,,,221,231,,10.1007/s11104-005-1740-7,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,985MJ,WOS:000233381600020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fagerli, IL; Svenning, MM",,,,"Fagerli, IL; Svenning, MM",,,Arctic and subarctic soil populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii nodulating three different clover species: Characterisation by diversity at chromosomal and symbiosis loci,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arctic; clover; genetic diversity; Rhizobium; subarctic,GENETIC DIVERSITY; HOST PLANTS; VICIAE; STRAINS; BACTERIA; BRADYRHIZOBIUM; PROTEOBACTERIA; RESTRICTION; TOLERANCE; GENOTYPES,"Indigenous soil populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii from Arctic and subarctic regions have been characterised with emphasis on chromosomal and symbiotic genes.

Three treatments applying three different light levels (2, 9 and 43% relative light intensity) were combined with two soil water treatments ( control and drought). At the end of the experiment, seedlings were separated into leaves, stem and root and the seedlings' dry mass, leaf area and stem length was determined. Low irradiance (2%) had a strong negative effect on dry weights of seedling components, leaf area and specific leaf mass. Drought clearly affected biomass partitioning for seedlings at high irradiance levels (43%). An interaction between irradiance and drought on biomass partitioning in beech seedlings was observed at medium irradiance level (9%). Within a wide range of light levels in the forests, both light and drought may affect biomass partitioning in young seedlings.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; Univ Gottingen, Inst Silviculture, Dept 1, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany","Lof, M (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",magnus.lof@ess.slu.se,"Bolte, Andreas/A-3521-2009",,,,,37,39,39,0,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"PO BOX 12 POSTHUSET, NO-0051 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

All plants were growing in, or originated from, continental Mediterranean sites in central Spain. Seedlings tolerated moderate but not deep shade. Mortality was high and growth reduced in 1% sunlight. Survival was maximal in 12% sunlight and minimal in full sunlight, although the relative growth rate of the seedlings surviving in high light was similar to that of plants in moderate shade. Maximum photochemical efficiency at predawn was significantly lower in sun plants than in shade plants in the field, revealing chronic photoinhibition that was most pronounced in winter. Plasticity in response to available light varied according to the variable studied, being low for photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance, and high for specific leaf area root:shoot ratio and leaf area ratio, particularly in seedlings. Differences in water relations and hydraulic features between sun and shade plants in the field were marginal. High water potential at the turgor loss point of field-grown plants suggested that holly is sensitive to drought during both the seedling and the adult stage. Low relative growth rates in both high and low light with low physiological plasticity in response to light indicate the existence of a stress-tolerance mechanism. We conclude that holly is a facultative understory plant in areas of oceanic and relatively mild climate, but an obligate understory plant in dry continental areas such as the study site. The impact of abandonment of traditional management practices and climate change on these Mediterranean populations is discussed.","CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; INIA, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Montes, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Valladares, F (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, Serrano 115 Dpdo, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",valladares@ccma.csic.es,"Lorenzo, David/AAA-7217-2019; Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014; Sanchez-Gomez, David/K-5653-2014; Aranda, Ismael/B-7050-2008","Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682; Sanchez-Gomez, David/0000-0002-0588-9713; Aranda, Ismael/0000-0001-9086-7940",,,,82,75,84,2,48,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2005,25,8,,,,,1041,1052,,10.1093/treephys/25.8.1041,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,955EM,WOS:000231208200009,15929935,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Pennanen, T; Heiskanen, J; Korkama, U",,,,"Pennanen, T; Heiskanen, J; Korkama, U",,,Dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi and growth of Norway spruce seedlings after planting on a mounded forest clearcut,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhiza; mounding; Picea abies; outplanting success,BRITISH-COLUMBIA; SITE PREPARATION; PINUS-CONTORTA; MYCORRHIZAL; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS,"One- and two-year-old Norway spruce container seedlings (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were planted on mounded and untreated spots in two forest clearcuts in central Finland. The effects of mounding on shoot and root growth, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization and number of ECM-strains of the seedlings were assessed 1 and 2 years after outplanting. Mounding had no influence on the shoot growth of the seedlings during the first 2 years after outplanting, but increased root growth significantly. With mounding, the structure of the root systems was also better ramified. In all samples, the degree of ECM-colonization was high, but in seedlings planted on mounds it was even higher. No effects on ECM-diversity due to mounding were observed in fingerprints of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) or in ECM-morphotyping. However, mounding caused changes in the structure of the ECM-community. Many of the observed fungal sequences colonizing root tips that grew out into the soil probably originated from the nursery. Both altered soil characteristics caused by mounding and the effect of ECM-inoculum on growth and branching of the roots may affect seedling performance after mounding.

Three stands, each consisting of a burn and a control treatment of about 1 ha in size, were examined in the study. On each burn and control treatment, six to eight dominant white oak trees were randomly selected along the slope and four 2-m radius quadrats were set up around each selected tree. Prescribed fire increased seedling biomass but it did not affect seedling mortality and root to shoot ratio. Effects of prescribed fire on seedling density, forest floor depth, and understory light intensity depended on stands, where burning increased seedling density in stands 1 and 3 but not in stand 2. Burning also reduced forest floor depth and increased understory light intensity in stands 1 and 3 but not in stand 2. Regression analyses indicated that forest floor depth and understory light intensity were significantly related to seedling density and biomass, with thinner forest floor and higher light intensity favoring the establishment of new oak seedlings. We conclude that burning can benefit the establishment of new white oak seedlings as long as it significantly reduces forest floor depth and increases understory light intensity.

The time trajectory of mean shoot mass and density was modeled mathematically. The value of the self-thinning exponent was 1.519 during the final phase of stand development. This value, which is close to 3/2, can be regarded as evidence in favor of the 3/2 power law of self-thinning. By combining the allometric power relationship and the time trajectory of mean shoot mass and density, it was possible to mathematically derive the time trajectory of mean root mass and density. The self-thinning exponent for root mass was estimated to be 1.368, and thus lower than 3/2, because the allometric coefficient was less than unity. The time trajectories of mean shoot and root masses and density allowed the time trajectory of the mean whole seedling mass and density to be derived. In this case, the value of the self-thinning exponent was close to 3/2. From the time trajectories of mean shoot and root masses and density, the relationship between the root/shoot ratio and density was mathematically modeled, and competition in relation to shoots and roots is discussed.

The model needs as basic data: (1) data from the literature on rooting of individual species (root form, rooting density, main root depth, lateral extension) and (2) standard phytosociological values (e.g. subplot frequency or modified Braun-Blanquet frequency/abundance values) for the combination of the rooting values for each species to the community rooting value. Our data clearly show that the modelled results of the total rooting of vegetation communities correlate well with the measured values. The correlation coefficients obtained from the comparison are high (0.89-0.92) and always highly significant. However, when the model is used to calculate only the rooting of a partial soil layer, then the accuracy of the result increases with increasing soil layer thickness. The agreement between measured and calculated data indicate that the model is very sensitive to species-specific differences within a vegetation community. Due to the integrated data and the mathematical concept, the model is not subject to any bio-geographical restrictions. When the necessary data are available, this modelling approach could be used for the calculation of the rooting of all terrestrial biomes.

A physiologically multi-layer process-based model is built, completed with a carbon allocation model and coupled with a soil model. CASTANEA describes canopy photosynthesis and transpiration, maintenance and growth respiration, seasonal development, partitioning of assimilates to leaves, stems, branches, coarse and fine roots, evapotranspiration, soil heterotrophic respiration, water and carbon balances of the soil. Net primary productivity (NPP) is calculated as the difference between gross photosynthesis and plant respiration. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between soil-plant system and atmosphere is calculated as the difference between gross photosynthesis and total respiration (soil + plants). The meteorological driving variables are global radiation, rainfall, wind speed, air humidity and temperature (either half-hourly or daily values). A complete description of the model parameterization is given for an eddy flux station in a beech stand (Hesse, France). A parametric sensitivity analysis is carried out to get a classification of the model parameters according to their effect on the NEE. To determine the key input parameters, a +10% or -10% bias is applied on each of the 150 parameters in order to estimate the effect on simulated NEE. Finally 17 parameters, linked to photosynthesis, vegetative respiration and soil water balance, appear to have a significant effect (more than 2.5%) on the NEE. An uncertainty analysis is then presented to evaluate the error on the annual and daily NEE outputs caused by uncertainties in these input parameters. Uncertainties on these parameters are estimated using data collected in situ. These uncertainties are used to create a set of 17,000 simulations, where the values of the 17 key parameters are randomly selected using gaussian random distributions. A mean uncertainty of 30% on the annual NEE is obtained. This uncertainty on the simulated daily NEE does not totally explain the discrepancies with the daily NEE measured by the eddy covariance technique (EC). Errors on daily measurements by EC technique and uncertainty on the modelling of several processes may partly explain the discrepancy between simulations and measurements. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Organic certification prohibits use of synthetic N fertilizers, necessitating understanding of the Inga-rhizobia symbiosis. The objectives of this study were to: (1) establish a collection of isolates from Inga sp. nodules found on organic coffee farms in Chiapas, Mexico; (2) use phenotypic and genotypic approaches to characterize these isolates, and (3) examine cross-inoculation patterns of strains isolated from Inga sp. with other Inga species and N(2)-fixing trees. Eighty-three strains were isolated from root nodules of Inga oerstediana, Inga pavoniana and an unknown species of Inga. Aside from isolates of L pavoniana, Inga isolates demonstrate characteristics consistent with Bradyrhizobium. Dendrograms generated using phylogenetic and phenotypic traits showed strains to exhibit significant diversity, even among strains originating from the same farm. Strains isolated from I. pavoniana were 95% similar, and displayed strikingly different characteristics from strains isolated from other species. Cross-inoculation experiments used three Inga strains (cowpea miscellany CB756, and isolates from L oerstediana and I. sp.) as inoculants with I. edulis, L fuellii, Acacia mangium, Acacia koa, Vigna unguculata and Gliricidia sepium. All three strains formed nodules containing leghaemoglobin with V. unguculata, while isolates from L oerstediana, Inga sp. and cowpea miscellany formed nodules with L feulli and L edulis, but not with A. mangium and G. sepium. A. koa formed nodules containing leghaemoglobin when inoculated by cowpea miscellany strain CB756 and the strain from Inga sp., but nodules formed with the strain isolated from L oerstediana did not contain leghaemoglobin. One and two-way ANOVA results showed that no mean biomass of inoculated seedlings was significantly greater than the -N control for each of A. koa, G. sepium, A. mangium (p < 0.001), supporting our hypothesis that inoculation with non-Inga strains would have no effect on biomass production. We suggest that great spatial variation exists among Inga isolates from organic coffee farms in the Chiapas highland region, both between and within farms, and that more research is needed to identify reasons for the genetic distribution and function of Inga symbionts.

Transformation of fine-root volumes or lengths as seen with minirhizotrons into fine-root mass per unit of horizontal area requires an estimate of the mass density or specific root length of fine roots for the species of interest. We obtained values of mass density of fine roots using three different sampling strategies on temperate and boreal forested sites. The strategies examined were (1) the use of bulk root samples from soil cores, (2) the use of individual roots from seedlings, and (3) the use of individual roots from soil cores. Our results show that the mass density of fine roots taken from seedlings is strongly dependent on root diameter, as shown by the strong drop in mass density with a decrease in diameter in all species examined. However, the dependency of mass density of individual fine roots extracted from soil cores on root diameter varies with the species mixture. Examination of thin cross-sections of roots using microscopy reveals that the proportion of xylem cell walls as a percentage of total cell walls also decreases strongly as root diameter diminishes for seedling fine roots, but that this relationship is not as clear in fine roots obtained from soil cores. We conclude that using the mass density from core fine roots may yield the best estimate of fine-root productivity when deriving such a value from the analysis of minirhizotron images. We also discuss some of the problems associated with the use of specific root length.","Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Serv, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Bernier, PY (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Serv, 1055 Rue PEPS,POB 3800, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",pbernier@rncan.gc.ca,,,,,,20,9,10,0,11,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

At the beginning of the OTC experiment, all trees were 7 years old. We studied the single and interaction effects of CO2 and O-3 on silver birch below-ground carbon pools (i.e. effects on fine roots and mycorrhizas, soil microbial communities and sporocarp production) and also assessed whether there are any clonal differences in these below-ground CO2 and O-3 responses. The total mycorrhizal infection level of both clones was stimulated by elevated CO2 alone and elevated O-3 alone, but not when elevated CO2 was used in fumigation in combination with elevated O-3. In both clones, elevated CO2 affected negatively light brown/orange mycorrhizas, while its effect on other mycorrhizal morphotypes was negligible. Elevated O-3, instead, clearly decreased the proportions of black and liver-brown mycorrhizas and increased that of light brown/orange mycorrhizas. Elevated O-3 had a tendency to decrease standing fine root mass and sporocarp production as well, both of these O-3 effects mainly manifesting in clone 4 trees. CO2 and O-3 treatment effects on soil microbial community composition (PLFA, 2- and 3-OH-FA profiles) were negligible, but quantitative PLFA data showed that in 2001 the PLFA fungi : bacteria-ratio of clone 80 trees was marginally increased because of elevated CO2 treatments. This study shows that O-3 effects were most clearly visible at the mycorrhizal root level and that some clonal differences in CO2 and O-3 responses were observable in the below-ground carbon pools. In conclusion, the present data suggests that CO2 effects were minor, whereas increasing tropospheric O-3 levels can be an important stress factor in northern birch forests, as they might alter mycorrhizal morphotype assemblages, mycorrhizal infection rates and sporocarp production.","Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Natl Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Environm Hlth, FIN-70701 Kuopio, Finland; Lund Univ, Dept Microbial Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Finnish Fores Res Inst, Suonenjoki Res Stn, FIN-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-15140 Lahti, Finland","Kasurinen, A (reprint author), Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, POB 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",Anne.Kasurinen@uku.fi,,"Nilsson, Lars Ola/0000-0003-4514-3657",,,,75,53,59,2,50,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

These sesquiterpenoids inhibited both germination and seedling growth of tested species with deoxymikanotide possessing the strongest phytotoxicity. In a bioassay against lettuce (Lectuca sativa L.), deoxymikanolide reduced radicle elongation at low concentration (IC50 = 47 mu g/ml); dihydromikanolide showed a weaker effect (IC50 = 96 mu g/ml), and 2,3-epoxy-1-hydroxy-4,9-gertnacradiene12,8:15,6-diolide exhibited the least effect (IC50 = 242 mu g/ml). Deoxymikanolide caused yellowish lesions at the root tips of lettuce at a concentration of 50 mu g/ml, and a 250 mu g/ml solution killed lettuce seedlings. A bioassay against the monocot ryegrass (Lolium multiforum) revealed similar results on radicle elongation, which implied that the growth inhibition by these compounds was not selective. To evaluate their phytotoxicity to plants in natural habitats, three common companion tree species in south China, Acacia mangium, Eucalyptus robusta, and Pinus massoniana, were also tested and similar results were obtained.

Under well-watered conditions, mycorrhizal colonization resulted in an increase of net photosynthesis, growth and phosphorus uptake. When submitted to water stress, no growth reduction of mycorrhizal seedlings was observed. Mycorrhizal seedlings were more sensitive to drought than non-mycorrhizal ones in terms of carbon assimilation, but not with regard to stomatal closure. In contrast to previous studies on temperate tree seedlings, this result precludes a mycorrhizal effect on the hydraulic properties of this species. Furthermore, our results suggest that below a specific threshold of soil moisture, carbon assimilation of D. guianensis seedlings was decreased by the mycorrhizal symbiosis. This is probably related to the competition between the plant and its host fungus for carbon allocation under low light intensity, even though it did not seem to have a significant effect on mortality in our experiment.","UMR Ecofog, Kourou 97387, French Guiana; UMR Interact Arbres Microorganismes, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Bereau, M (reprint author), UMR Ecofog, BP 709, Kourou 97387, French Guiana.",bercau.m@kourou.cirad.fr,"BONAL, Damien/B-2384-2009",,,,,35,4,5,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

This study, conducted in the Chimalapas region of Oaxaca, Mexico, documents changes in live tree biomass, live fine-root biomass, and fallen and standing dead wood 4 y following deep ground fires occurring in TMCF during the -1997-98 El Nino Southern Oscillation event. Forests growing on two different substrates (metamorphic and sedimentary) and having three different statures (mean canopy heights: 20-30 m, 15-20 m and 4-6 m) were assessed within six paired plots established on adjacent burned and unburned forest sites. Total live tree biomass was 82%, and 88%,, lower for burned TMCF growing on metamorphic and sedimentary substrates, respectively, compared with unburned TMCF. Nearly 100'% of the living biomass was killed in elfin TMCF located on exposed sedimentary limestone at the highest elevations. Live fine-root biomass in the upper organic soil horizon of burned TMCF sites was 49%) lower on metamorphic substrates and 77%) lower on sedimentary substrates compared with unburned sites. The amount of total dead wood was 3- to 14-fold greater in burned forests compared with unburned forests. These results suggest that first-time fires in relatively undisturbed TMCF can cause dramatic changes in live above- and below-ground biomass at levels greatly exceeding values reported for most lowland tropical rain forests. These patterns may be attributed to the slower decomposition rates and thick organic soils typical of TMCF, combined with the relatively fast drainage associated with steep topography and, in some locations, sedimentary limestone-derived substrates.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50236 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Ecol Fisiol, Inst Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; Fondo Mundial Conservac, Oaxaca, Mexico; Inst Ecol AC, Herbario XAL, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico","Asbjornsen, H (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 253 Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50236 USA.",hasbjorn@iastate.edu,,,,,,54,32,36,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,1469-7831,,J TROP ECOL,J.

In this review, phylogenetic and ecological aspects of the four symbioses are first addressed, and then the symbioses are contrasted and compared in regard to infection and symbio-organ development, supply of carbon to the microsymbionts, regulation of O-2 flux to the microsymbionts, and transfer of fixed-N to the hosts. Although similarities exist in the genetics, development, and functioning of the symbioses, it is evident that there is great diversity in many aspects of these root-based N-2-fixing symbioses. Each symbiosis can be admired for the elegant means by which the host plant and microsymbiont integrate to form the mutualistic relationships so important to the functioning of the biosphere.","St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H, Canada; Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Stockholm, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Vessey, JK (reprint author), St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H, Canada.",kevin.vessey@smu.ca,,"Pawlowski, Katharina/0000-0003-2693-885X",,,,244,50,57,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2005,274,2-Jan,,,,,51,78,,10.1007/s11104-005-5881-5,,,28,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,992HW,WOS:000233876000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Becerra, A; Pritsch, K; Arrigo, N; Palma, M; Bartoloni, N",,,,"Becerra, A; Pritsch, K; Arrigo, N; Palma, M; Bartoloni, N",,,Ectomycorrhizal colonization of Alnus acuminata Kunth in northwestern Argentina in relation to season and soil parameters,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Alnus acuminata; ectomycorrhizal diversity; Andean forest; soil type,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EXIT GLACIER; GROWTH; FOREST; FERTILIZATION; SYMBIOSIS; NITROGEN; ROOTS; DEPTH,"The objective of this study was to determine patterns of ECM colonization of Andean alder at two natural forests in relation to soil parameters at two different seasons ( autumn and spring).

The ECM colonization varied among soil types and was affected positively by electrical conductivity. Multiple regression relationships among ECM colonization and edaphic properties variables showed no significant differences at two seasons and among soil types with respect to morphotype diversity values. Positive correlations were found between three morphotypes ( Cortinarius tucumanensis, Gyrodon monticola and Russula alnijorrulensis) and soil types and two other morphotypes (Naucoria escharoides and Lactarius sp.) between two seasons. Results of this study provide evidence that ECM colonization of A. acuminata is affected by some chemical edaphic parameters and indicate that some ECM morphotypes are sensitive to changes in seasonality and soil parameters.","Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; GSF Natl Res Ctr Environm & Hlth Gmbh, Inst Soil Ecol, D-85764 Oberschleissheim, Germany","Becerra, A (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",abecerra@imbiv.unc.edu.ar,,"Becerra, Alejandra Gabriela/0000-0002-9055-5223",,,,58,24,25,0,5,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Of the 62 plants representing 33 families surveyed, 59 plant species (about 95%) were arbuscular mycorrhizal and 3 species (5%) were possibly arbuscular mycorrhizal. Rhizosphere soils harbored abundant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores in a range of 240-6430 per 100 g soil with an average of 2096, and most spores were small with diameter less than 70 mu m (about 78%). The fungi most frequently found were members of the genera Acaulospora and Glomus. Acaulospora spinosa, A. denticulata, A. tuberculata, Glomus sinuosa, G. clarion, G. intraradices and G. microaggregatum were the most common species. These results revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizas are a common and important component in this semi-savanna vegetation; the high spore density and colonization were presumably a selective adaptation toward the hot and arid ecosystem.

Since positive interactions with soil microorganisms are essential for plant growth, the restoration of heavily disturbed habitats should include the re-introduction of both plants and their mutualists. In Mediterranean areas, shrubby legumes are key components of natural systems and good candidates for revegetation projects because of the ability to fix nitrogen as a result of the rhizobial symbiosis. This study analyses the role of soil microorganisms, and, specifically, of Bradyrhizobium sp., in the growth of six Iberian shrubby legumes in natural soils from central western Spain. Plants were grown in non-treated soils and in soils from which soil microorganisms were experimentally removed. The effect of rhizobial inoculation on plant performance was assessed using six Bradyrhizobium strains isolated from natural populations of the studied species. Plant growth was hindered in sterilized soils, whereas inoculation with native rhizobia significantly enhanced plant growth. The results highlight the importance of positive interactions with soil microorganisms for plant growth and advise the use of native organisms as inoculants in revegetation strategies.

Small size of logging gaps, lack of soil disturbance, and limited seed availability have each been blamed for observed regeneration failures. We investigated seed germination and seedling performance using a split-plot factorial design involving light availability and litter removal for six Central African timber tree species, hypothesizing that canopy gaps and litter removal would improve seedling establishment, and that less shade-tolerant species would show stronger responses to both factors. Contrary to our expectations, significantly more germinants established on intact litter than on exposed mineral soil 3 mo after seeding. After 18 me, seedling survival, height and diameter growth, leaf area, and rooting depth were all much higher in gap plots than in the understory for all species, with the exception of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, a highly shade-tolerant species whose survival was higher in the understory Leaf production was negatively influenced by litter removal in the least shade-tolerant species, Nauclea diderrichii, with weak or positive effects in other species. G. dewevrei, while displaying a low-light threshold for growth, exhibited a surprisingly high growth response to increasing light comparable to more shade-intolerant species, a response that may help explain its local competitive dominance in the region. Due to the rapid closure of small gaps, we suggest that shade-intolerant species such as N. diderrichii, Khaya anthotheca, and Entandrophragma utile might benefit from more intensive silvicultural practices that create larger canopy gaps.","Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada","Thomas, SC (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",sc.thomas@utoronto.ca,"THOMAS, Sean C./B-6089-2008","THOMAS, Sean C./0000-0002-0686-2483",,,,75,35,36,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",6-Jun,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUN,2005,37,2,,,,,227,237,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2005.00030.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,929ON,WOS:000229355500010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rowe, AR; Pringle, A",,,,"Rowe, AR; Pringle, A",,,Morphological and molecular evidence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations in Costa Rican epiphytic bromeliads,BIOTROPICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,cloud forest; Costa Rica; Monteverde; symbiosis; tropical mycorrhizae; VAM fungi,ACAULOSPORA-COLOSSICA; NATURAL-POPULATION; CLOUD FOREST; CANOPY; COLONIZATION; MONTEVERDE; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; GLOMALES; ROOTS,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influence the growth, morphology, and fitness of a variety of plant species, but little is known of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal associations of plant species in forest canopies. Plant species' associations with AM fungi are most often elucidated by examining the roots for fungal structures; however, morphological data may provide a limited resolution on a plant's mycorrhizal status. We combined a traditional staining technique with a molecular marker (the 18S ribosomal gene) to determine whether or not a variety of epiphytic bromeliads form arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations. Using these methods we show that the epiphytic bromeliad Vriesea werkleana forms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations with members of the genus Glomus. AM fungal sequences of this plant species formed three distinct clades nested within a larger Glomus clade; two of the clades did not group with any previously sequenced lineage of Glomus. Novel clades may represent novel species. Although Vriesea werkleana is associated with multiple AM fungal species, each individual plant is colonized by a single lineage. The combination of morphological and molecular methods provides a practical approach to the characterization of the mycorrhizal status of epiphytic bromeliads, and perhaps other tropical epiphytes.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rowe, AR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, 111 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",annierow@berkeley.edu,,"Rowe, Annette/0000-0002-8761-6857",,,,27,10,10,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",6-Jun,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUN,2005,37,2,,,,,245,250,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2005.00033.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,929ON,WOS:000229355500012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lazaruk, LW; Kernaghan, G; Macdonald, SE; Khasa, D",,,,"Lazaruk, LW; Kernaghan, G; Macdonald, SE; Khasa, D",,,Effects of partial cutting on the ectomycorrhizae of Picea glauca forests in northwestern Alberta,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PINE PINUS-CONTORTA; SHEATHING MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; OLD-GROWTH STANDS; DOUGLAS-FIR; WESTERN MONTANA; PSEUDOTSUGA-MENZIESII; ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; SOIL COMPACTION; DIFFERENT SIZES; BOREAL FOREST,"This study assessed the impact of various harvesting practices (including those designed to emulate natural disturbances) on ectomycorrhizae (ECM) associated with white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) in northwestern Alberta, Canada. Treatments included clearcuts, partial cuts (dispersed green-tree retention with 20%, 50%, and 75% residual live trees, and aggregated green-tree retention), unharvested control sites, and a burned stand. The percentage of active white spruce root tips and ECM richness and diversity, as observed in soil cores collected throughout the study site, all decreased with increasing disturbance intensity. Effects were particularly pronounced in clearcuts, machine corridors used for access by harvesting equipment in the dispersed green-tree retention stands, and in burned areas. Reductions in ECM biodiversity could be attributed to the sensitivity of late-stage ectomycorrhizae (e.g., Cortinarius spp., Lactarius spp., and Russula spp.) to soil disturbances and changes in microclimate associated with harvesting or burning. Areas of dispersed and aggregated green-tree retention were not dramatically different than unharvested forest in terms of root tip density and ECM richness, diversity, and composition. Harvesting practices that retain a percentage of residual live trees, either dispersed throughout the cutting unit or in aggregated patches, could be an effective means of maintaining ectomycorrhizal biodiversity at the stand level.","Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Macdonald, SE (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",ellen.macdonald@ualberta.ca,,,,,,64,29,30,0,26,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

In microcosms with nematode inoculations either with or without microorganism inoculation, aphids offspring production was significantly reduced by 31%. Aphid populations on both host plants Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum odoratum were lowest in microcosms with combined nematode and microorganism inoculations. Opposite results were found for parasitoids. While the number of emerged parasitoids did not differ between treatments, parasitoid mortality and the proportion of males were significantly lower in microcosms with nematode and microorganism inoculations. Parasitized aphids were significantly larger in microcosms with nematodes inoculated. Plant biomass did not differ, but in the preferred host plant A. odoratum, foliar phenolic content was reduced in the presence of nematodes, and also the concentration of amino acids in the phloem.

Fine root dynamics, inorganic N in the soil solution and in soil extracts, nitrate and ammonium uptake kinetics of beech as well as gross ammonification, nitrification and denitrification rates were determined in a beech stand consisting of paired sites that mainly differed in aspect (SW vs. NE) and stand density (controls and thinning treatments). Nitrate was the only inorganic N form detectable in the soil water. Its concentration was high in control plots of the NE aspect, but only in canopy gaps and not influenced by thinning. Neither thinning nor aspect affected the abundance of root tips in the soil. Maximum nitrate net uptake by mycorrhizal fine roots of beech, however, differed with aspect, showing significantly lower values at the SW aspect with warm-dry local climate. There were no clear-cut significant effects of local climate or thinning on microbial N conversion, but a tendency towards higher ammonification and nitrification and lower denitrification rates on the untreated controls of the SW as compared to the NE aspect. Apparently, the observed sensitivity of beech towards reduced soil water availability is at least partially due to impaired N acquisition. This seems to be mainly a consequence of reduced N uptake capacity rather than of limited microbial re-supply of inorganic N or of changed patterns of inorganic N partitioning between soil bacteria and roots.","Univ Freiburg, Chair Tree Physiol, Inst Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Environm Res Ctr, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, IMK IFU, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; Forestry Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg FVA, Dept Forest Protect, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Inst Soil Sci & Forest Nutr, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany","Gessler, A (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Tree Physiol, Inst Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Georges Kohler Allee 053-054, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",arthur.gessler@sonne.uni-freiburg.de,"Papen, Hans/A-8082-2013; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Rennenberg, Heinz/A-2083-2013","Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Rennenberg, Heinz/0000-0001-6224-2927",,,,78,77,80,0,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

Soils are one of the last great frontiers for biodiversity research and are home to an extraordinary range of microbial and animal groups. Biological activities in soils drive many of the key ecosystem processes that govern the global system, especially in the cycling of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. 2. We cannot currently make firm statements about the scale of biodiversity in soils, or about the roles played by soil organisms in the transformations of organic materials that underlie those cycles. The recent UK Soil Biodiversity Programme (SBP) has brought a unique concentration of researchers to bear on a single soil in Scotland, and has generated a large amount of data concerning biodiversity, carbon flux and resilience in the soil ecosystem. 3. One of the key discoveries of the SBP was the extreme diversity of small organisms: researchers in the programme identified over 100 species of bacteria, 350 protozoa, 140 nematodes and 24 distinct types of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Statistical analysis of these results suggests a much greater 'hidden diversity'. In contrast, there was no unusual richness in other organisms, such as higher fungi, mites, collembola and annelids. 4. Stable-isotope (C-13) technology was used to measure carbon fluxes and map the path of carbon through the food web. A novel finding was the rapidity with which carbon moves through the soil biota, revealing an extraordinarily dynamic soil ecosystem. 5. The combination of taxonomic diversity and rapid carbon flux makes the soil ecosystem highly resistant to perturbation through either changing soil structure or removing selected groups of organisms.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England","Fitter, AH (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",ahf1@york.ac.uk,"Twyman, Richard M/M-5016-2018; Kleczkowski, Adam/B-2016-2009","Twyman, Richard M/0000-0002-8764-3003; Kleczkowski, Adam/0000-0003-1384-4352",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/B502379/1],,,43,148,163,3,262,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Genotype by environment interactions for nectar production in Echium vulgare were studied. Nectar production was measured under high and low-water treatments for high and low nectar-producing genetic lines in a growth chamber. In the field the response of nectar production and pollinator behaviour to water availability for potted plants chosen from field populations was studied. 2. Plants selected from high-nectar lines produced significantly more nectar than those selected from low-nectar lines. Nectar production thus had a heritable component. 3. Under high water conditions plants produced more nectar than under low water conditions. The increase in nectar production under high water availability was strongest for the low-nectar plants, demonstrating a genotype by environment interaction. Only under dry conditions, which usually prevail during the flowering period of E. vulgare, high and low-nectar plants differ in nectar production. 4. Plants selected from high-nectar lines had a significantly higher root mass and root : shoot ratio. This suggests that they are less affected by low water availability and thus able to maintain high nectar production under dry conditions. 5. In the field, high-nectar plants produced significantly more nectar but did not receive more pollinator visits. Watered plants produced significantly more nectar and did receive an enhanced pollinator service. When watered, nectar production and pollinator service was similar for high and low-nectar plants.","Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2311 GP Leiden, Netherlands","Leiss, KA (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Kaiserstr 63, NL-2311 GP Leiden, Netherlands.",Leiss@rulsfb.leidenuniv.nl,"Leiss, Kirsten/R-6578-2017; Klinkhamer, Peter/S-1900-2017","Klinkhamer, Peter/0000-0001-8650-2199",,,,26,18,20,0,20,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Evolved tolerance may ultimately contribute to coexistence among natives and invaders, with our results suggesting that natural plant communities may be more coevolved and less individualistic than currently thought.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ray.callaway@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,41,154,171,4,105,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

However, the dynamics of individual roots with different life cycles, such as ephemeral and perennial, during root system development are still unknown. We examined individual roots during fine root system development in a mature stand of Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc. (Cupressaceae) using the sequential ingrowth core method and an anatomical method. The visual classification, i.e., orange, red, brown, intact dead, and fragmented dead, of fine roots corresponded well with the anatomical classification. Orange and red roots contained passage cells, and brown roots contained cork cambium. The proportions of protoxylem groups differed among visual classes. Brown secondary roots were mainly triarch (43%) and tetrarch (40%) and rarely diarch (12%), whereas fragmented dead roots, which constituted more than 95% of the dead roots, were mainly diarch (67%). These results imply that triarch and tetrarch roots tend to form secondary roots, whereas diarch roots tend to become dead roots without secondary growth. Using the numbers of root tips and clusters, root system development could be classified into three stages: colonization, branching within the root system, and maintenance. During the colonization stage, mainly triarch and tetrarch roots, which tend to be secondary growth, invaded ingrowth cores. During the branching stage, primarily diarch roots, which tend to be ephemeral, emerged. Fine root system development involved the recruitment of different individual roots during the life cycle depending on the growth stage.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Hishi, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",tak@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,18,30,35,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Inoculation levels were controlled by trimming the ectomycorrhizal roots to one of three selected root lengths. The results showed that the mantles of preformed ectomycorrhizae were lost during the 8 weeks of the liquid culture and that these preformed root tips became blackish and wrinkled, but Hartig nets remained in these blackish root tips. On the newly formed lateral root tips, no ectomycorrhizal mantles were formed, although Hartig nets were found. In addition, the level of inoculum did not affect the frequency of Hartig nets in newly formed root tips, suggesting that the density of inoculum was more important than the amount of inoculum for new infection. In conclusion, ectomycorrhizal fungi endured and infected new roots while submerged; however, only Hartig nets were formed and not mantles.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Ugawa, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",shin-u@nenv.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Fukuda, Kenji/Q-4216-2019; Fukuda, Kenji/F-9355-2017","Fukuda, Kenji/0000-0002-9980-3107; Fukuda, Kenji/0000-0002-9980-3107",,,,21,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Seven maternal families from two populations of each ecotype were grown on both Cd and Zn contaminated soil. Although both ecotypes presented a similar heavy metal tolerance in the experimental conditions tested, they differed in several points. The MET populations had markedly higher biomass and higher root:shoot ratio compared to NMET populations. The Zn, and at lesser extent, the Cd hyperaccumulation capacity tended to be higher in the NMET populations. The same trend was observed for the foliar concentrations of Mg, Ca and Fe with NMET populations having higher concentrations compared to MET ones. Cd and Zn concentrations were negatively correlated with the biomass of both ecotype. However, the negative correlation between the Zn and biomass was much lower in MET ecotype suggesting a tighter control of internal Zn concentration in this ecotype. Finally, although the Cd phytoextraction capacity was similar in both ecotype, a higher Zn phytoextraction capacity was detected in NMET ecotype when these plants grow on moderate Cd and Zn concentrations.","Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Genet & Ecol Vegetales Jardin Massart, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Physiol & Genet Mol Plantes, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Dechamps, C (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Genet & Ecol Vegetales Jardin Massart, Chaussee de Wavre 1850, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium.",cdechamp@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,35,32,34,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2005,273,2-Jan,,,,,327,335,,10.1007/s11104-005-0099-0,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,944AO,WOS:000230397500027,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ravit, B; Ehrenfeld, JG; Haggblom, MM",,,,"Ravit, B; Ehrenfeld, JG; Haggblom, MM",,,Salt marsh rhizosphere affects microbial biotransformation of the widespread halogenated contaminant tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA),SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,rhizosphere; sediment; microbial community; microbial diversity; PLFA; Spartina alterniflora; Phragmites australis; tetrabromobisphenol A; bisphenol A; reductive dehalogenation; estuarine contamination; salt marsh restoration,BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; DEGRADING BACTERIA; SOIL; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENTS; PATTERNS; PLANTS,"Estuarine sediments are the repository for a wide range of contaminants. Anthropogenic impacts and variations in the belowground biomass of salt marsh plants potentially select for different sediment microbial communities with different functional capabilities, including the ability to biotransform anthropogenic contaminants. There are large differences in both root morphology and the amount of fine root biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis; Spartina is the species commonly used to replace Phragmites in northeastern US salt marsh restoration projects. Our study compared the effect of these two macrophyte species on sediment microbial communities responsible for the biotransformation of the halogenated flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Sediments were obtained from contaminated and uncontaminated salt marsh field sites in New Jersey. Anaerobic methanogenic sediment microcosms were established and incubated for up to 130 days. TBBPA was reductively dehalogenated resulting in the transient formation of two intermediates, identified as tribromobisphenol A and dibromobisphenol A, and the formation and accumulation of bisphenol A (BPA) as the end product. Spartina sediments from both sites were found to dehalogenate TBBPA more rapidly than the Phragmites or unvegetated sediments, resulting in greater production of BPA. Microbial community diversity as measured by in situ sediment phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition prior to TBBPA exposure, was found to be higher in the uncontaminated sediments; differences in microbial PLFA diversity were not seen in contaminated sediments associated with either the different plant species or unvegetated sediment. The results of this study demonstrate that these two plant species affected sediment microbial community function with respect to dehalogenation capabilities, even though the disturbed and undisturbed sediments varied in microbial community composition.

Magoye nodulated in 80%, Hernon 147 in 50% and Roan in only 25% of the 92 soils tested. Rhizobia populations ranged from undetectable to 2.4 X 10(4) cells g(-1) of soil. Twenty-one of these isolates were tested for symbiotic effectiveness on two varieties, promiscuous Magoye and specific Roan. Differences in parameters such as nodule numbers, nodule weights and total N fixed reflected diversity among the indigenous isolates. Three isolates had significantly higher N-2-fixing potential in comparison with the commercial strain MAR 1491 on promiscuous Magoye. Host ranges of 34 isolates were evaluated on nine legume species: Arachis hypogaea, Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria juncea, Glycine max, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Phaseolus vulgaris, Sesbania sesbania, Vigna subterranea, Vigna unguiculata. Of these 34 isolates, 33 formed nodules with M. atropurpureum of which 61% were moderately effective to very effective while all nodulated V. unguiculata with 58% being moderately effective to very effective. Twenty-eight isolates nodulated V. subterranea and C. cajan (short season variety) with 76 and 36% of these being moderately to very effective, respectively. None of the isolates formed nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris, Arachis hypogaea or Sesbania sesban.

Kuntze is an indigenous conifer restricted to the southern region of South America. In this on-site field study, we provide a detailed description of the nitrogen compounds and sugars allocated to the different plant compartments in tall adult trees, young trees about 2-3 m tall and small seedlings at its northernmost occurrence in the mountains of Itatiaia (20 degrees 25'S; 44 degrees 50'W; 2,000 m a.s.l.), SE Brazil. We determined C and N contents, soluble sugars, soluble non-protein N-compounds and delta(15)N-signatures in leaves, roots, wood of stems, xylem- and phloem- sap. We also measured chlorophyll a fluorescence of photosystem II and carbon isotope discrimination reflecting photosynthetic activity and water-use efficiency. The high C and N concentrations in fine roots suggest that they are important reservoirs of N and C. Most nitrogen taken up from the soil was metabolised in the roots. The only inorganic nitrogen form detectable in the xylem sap was a small amount of ammonium. Glutamine was the dominant transport form of nitrogen in the xylem, while glutamate and the amides glutamine and asparagine were the most abundant soluble N compounds in the phloem. Total soluble non-protein N and sugar concentrations were significantly higher in the phloem of adult trees. In this particular site, A. angustifolia was apparently not exposed to water stress, as indicated by the high values of carbon isotope discrimination. The three developmental stages were clearly separated in terms of photosynthetic performance. Indeed, effective quantum yield of photosystem II increased from seedlings to adult trees under ambient irradiance.","Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Bot, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Inst Forstbot & Baumphysiol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; Fed Univ Rio De Janeiro, Dept Ecol, BR-21941970 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Franco, AC (reprint author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, Caixa Postal 04457, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",acfranco@unb.br,"Scarano, Fabio/F-6620-2012; Franco, Augusto/B-1615-2008; Rennenberg, Heinz/A-2083-2013; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; de Mattos, Eduardo/C-2593-2011","Scarano, Fabio/0000-0003-3355-9882; Franco, Augusto/0000-0003-0869-5989; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; de Mattos, Eduardo/0000-0002-9290-8715; Rennenberg, Heinz/0000-0001-6224-2927",,,,50,17,18,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

There were no significant differences in the soluble C fractions (water-soluble C and water-soluble carbohydrates) or the microbial biomass C values of the rhizosphere soil of L crithmoides among the different zones of the salt marsh. Dehydrogenase activity, hydrolases (urease, protease, phosphatase, and beta-glucosidase) and the extent of AM colonization in I. crithmoides roots were greater in the higher salt marsh zones, corresponding to those of lower rhizosphere soil salinity. This study shows that soil salinity is inversely associated with some parameters related to soil microbial activity, such as dehydrogenase activity and some hydrolases, as well as the extent of colonization by AM fungi, which can improve plant performance. However, bioactive organic matter fractions that determine soil productivity are not related to soil salinity.","CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Murcia 30100, Spain; Univ Liguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 03202, Spain","Caravaca, F (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, POB 164,Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",fcb@cebas.csic.es,"Caravaca, Fuensanta/K-6358-2017; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/M-3859-2014","Caravaca, Fuensanta/0000-0001-8247-6296; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/0000-0001-8495-8707; Roldan, Antonio/0000-0002-2610-7784",,,,30,17,18,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2005,25,2,,,,,350,355,,10.1672/11,,,6,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,940OD,WOS:000230152900011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Barnard, R; Leadley, PW; Lensi, R; Barthes, L",,,,"Barnard, R; Leadley, PW; Lensi, R; Barthes, L",,,"Plant, soil microbial and soil inorganic nitrogen responses to elevated CO2: a study in microcosms of Holcus lanatus",ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,global change; nitrification; denitrification; ammonium; nitrate,CARBON-DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT; FLORIDA SCRUB OAK; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; RHIZOSPHERE PROCESSES; LONG-TERM; CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND; MODEL ECOSYSTEM; LOLIUM-PERENNE; LOBLOLLY-PINE; WATER CONTENT,"The impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the nitrogen cycle was evaluated in a 2-month experiment in monospecific grassland microcosms (Holcus lanatus L.) grown on reconstituted grassland soil. The responses of the N pools in the plants, soil, and soil microbes were studied. The impact of high CO, on key stages of the N cycle, especially nitrification and denitrification processes, were also measured. Our study showed a strong plant response to high CO2: total biomass increased by 76% (P < 0.001) and root length density increased by 77% (P = 0.010). However, total plant N was not significantly modified by high CO2, because the percent N in the plant decreased by 40% (P < 0.001). We observed a large decrease in soil NO3- concentration under elevated CO2 (-50%; P = 0.002). Soil ammonium concentrations were much less affected by CO2 enrichment, and only in resin bags (-8%, P = 0.019). Soil nitrifying enzyme activity (NEA) had a tendency to increase (+17%; P = 0.061) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) decreased (-12%; P = 0.013). We found evidence of increased microbial N sink (microbial N increased by 17%, P = 0.004). This and other studies suggest that rising CO2 often reduces soil nitrate concentrations, which may lead to decreased nitrate leaching. Elevated CO2 led to environmental conditions that were less favourable for denitrification in our study. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Rooting depths were considered to be deep if 5% or more of all roots in a profile were located below 2 in depth. Spatially explicit global predictions were based on empirical models relating the probability of deep rooting with climate and soil texture. Based on these predictions, deep roots are most likely to occur in seasonally dry, semiarid to humid tropical regions under savanna or thorn-scrub vegetation or under seasonally dry semideciduous to evergreen forests. Deep roots are least likely to occur in arctic, boreal or cool-temperate regions and in per-humid climates such as equatorial rain forests. Under warm-temperate to tropical climates, rooting depths are more likely to be deep in coarse-textured and fine-textured soil than in soils of medium texture. These observations agree well with predictions based on a previously published conceptual model, according to which water infiltration depths and evaporative demand are the main climatic factors to determine vertical root distributions on a global scale.

In a 6-year field experiment, a dominant prairie bunchgrass, Schizachyrium scoparium, excluded species sharing similar phenology and rooting depth, but coexisted with species differing in phenology and rooting depth. We used a series of experimental plots that differed in S. scoparium abundance to measure the effect of S. scoparium on abundances of other species and on soil nitrate concentrations across time and depth. Because we found that S. scoparium most strongly reduced soil nitrate levels at mid-season and at shallow depths, we hypothesized that at higher S. scoparium abundance, species with mid-season phenology and shallow roots would be excluded and that deep-rooted and early season species would be more likely to persist. As predicted, the proportional number and cover of species exploiting different niches than S. scoparium (early season and deep-rooted species) increased across the S. scoparium abundance gradient. This work provides novel empirical evidence for the factors that contribute to species coexistence in the field. Our study suggests that spatial and temporal niche differentiation promote species coexistence in these grasslands.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Fargione, J (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",farg0001@umn.edu,,,,,,34,133,145,3,94,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2005,143,4,,,,,598,606,,10.1007/s00442-005-0010-y,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,935KL,WOS:000229781100012,15791430,,,,10/31/19J,"Guo, LB; Halliday, MJ; Siakimotu, SJM; Gifford, RM",,,,"Guo, LB; Halliday, MJ; Siakimotu, SJM; Gifford, RM",,,Fine root production and litter input: Its effects on soil carbon,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Austrodanthonia racemosa; Eucalyptus globulus; fine roots; Pinus radiata; plantation; root density; soil carbon; Themeda triandra,LAND-USE CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM; TURNOVER; GRADIENT; FOREST; SINKS,"Carbon storage by forests has potential for contributing to 'Kyoto Protocol' greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, but evidence about C-storage and loss below ground is conflicting. The study addresses why soil carbon stocks are increased by land use change from forest to pasture, but are reduced by planting conifer trees, though not broadleaf trees, onto prior pasture. Can species differences in fine root production and litter input play a role? Addressing that hypothesis, a 1-year pot experiment was established as a model system in a glasshouse. Two tree species, pine (Pinus radiata) and Blue Gum (Eucaljptus globulus), and two grass species, Kangaroo Grass (Themeda triandra) and Wallaby Grass (Austrodanthonia racemosa), were sown in pots of soil taken from a native pasture with Kangaroo Grass dominant or from an adjacent pine plantation forest. After 3 months, half of the grass pots were defoliated monthly to 7 cm above ground to test for any cutting effect. Fine root production and turnover was monitored via minirhizotrons, with a destructive harvest after I year. Fine root oven dry mass at the end of the year varied between species: Kangaroo Grass (17 g/pot), pine (13 g/pot), Blue Gum (8 g/ pot), Wallaby Grass (4 g/pot). Cutting significantly reduced fine root production in Kangaroo Grass but not in Wallaby Grass. From minirhizotron monitoring, 70% of the fine root length produced by pine during the year had disappeared, presumably by decomposition, before the final harvest. The equivalent loss for Wallaby Grass was only 26%, for Kangaroo Grass 36%, and for Blue Gum 45%. Despite the faster fine root disappearance under pines than under Kangaroo Grass, soil C declined under pines but increased under Kangaroo Grass as found in the field. Thus the experiment did not support the idea that a lower dead fine root production was the source of decline in soil C under pine. There was only a weak correlation between soil C change and the net amount of live fine root mass produced. However, the soil carbon changes in this study were positively correlated with live fine root length density in the soil. Kangaroo Grass maintained large lengths of very fine roots while pines produced a small length of thick fine roots. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the increase of soil carbon under Kangaroo Grass compared with pine may be caused more by the activity of live fine roots than by decomposition of fine root mass to humus. This hypothesis, formulated from the model experimental system, needs to be evaluated for field sites where pines have been planted onto pastures.","CSIRO, Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Cooperat Res Ctr Greenhouse Accounting, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Guo, LB (reprint author), CSIRO, Plant Ind, GPO 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",lanbin.guo@csiro.au,,,,,,20,32,40,3,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2005,272,2-Jan,,,,,1,10,,10.1007/s11104-004-3611-z,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,944AM,WOS:000230397300001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fahey, TJ; Yavitt, JB",,,,"Fahey, TJ; Yavitt, JB",,,An in situ approach for measuring root-associated respiration and nitrate uptake of forest trees,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine root; nitrate uptake; respiration; rhizosphere; sugar maple; white pine,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; GROWTH-RATE; TEMPERATURE; PINE; DEPOSITION; SEEDLINGS; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; TRAITS; AGE,"The ecophysiological characteristics of fine roots of mature forest plants are poorly understood because of difficulties of measurement.

Root-associated respiration was measured as CO, emission on four dates and nitrate uptake was quantified using N-15. All the roots were younger than 3 months at the time of measurement. Fine root respiration measured over the temperature range of 14.5-15.5 degrees C averaged 18.9-36.5 nmol gDM(-1) s(-1) across species. Nitrate uptake rates by these fine roots (1.3-6.8 nmol gDM-1 s-1) were comparable to other studies of forest trees. The root respiration rates were several times higher than measurements on detached roots of mature trees, concurring with literature observations that young roots respire much more rapidly than older roots. The root in-growth approach appears promising for providing information on the metabolic activity of fine roots of mature forest trees growing in soil.","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Fahey, TJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjf5@cornell.edu,,,,,,28,12,20,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2005,272,2-Jan,,,,,125,131,,10.1007/s11104-004-4212-6,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,944AM,WOS:000230397300011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Nobrega, FM; Santos, IS; Da Cunha, M; Carvalho, AO; Gomes, VM",,,,"Nobrega, FM; Santos, IS; Da Cunha, M; Carvalho, AO; Gomes, VM",,,Antimicrobial proteins from cowpea root exudates: inhibitory activity against Fusarium oxysporum and purification of a chitinase-like protein,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,chitinase; defense proteins; exudation; root; Vigna unguiculata,"LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN; WEEVIL CALLOSOBRUCHUS-MACULATUS; VIGNA-UNGUICULATA SEEDS; ANTIFUNGAL PROPERTIES; FUNGAL GROWTH; PLANT CHITINASES; STORAGE PROTEINS; CASTANEA-SATIVA; RESISTANCE; BETA-1,3-GLUCANASE","Plants exude a variety of substances through their external surfaces and from germinating seeds, some of which have an inhibitory action against plant pathogens.

Root exudates were collected from seedlings that were grown hydroponically in three different media, including, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5, water pH 6.0 and 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5. The proteins from these exudates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SDS-Tricine-PAGE and the presence of antimicrobial proteins in the exudates was investigated by immunological and enzymatic assays. Results showed that roots from cowpea seedlings contained beta-1,3-Glucanases, chitinases and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), all of which may potentially function as plant defense proteins. Immunolocalization of one of these proteins, chitinase, revealed its presence in the xylem cell wall vessel elements. These exudates also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the growth of the fungus, Fusariuin oxysporum, in vitro.

Such heterogeneity may be found among different successional communities (i.e., canopy types). We explore species associations in three forest-dominated canopy types, forest, gap, and edge, in Kibale National Park, Uganda and determine environmental, soil and light, differences among canopy types. To determine the strength of differences among forested canopy types, they are also compared to grasslands. Tree and shrub density and species richness using rarefaction analysis were determined based on data from 24 small plots (5 x 5 m) in all four canopy types and 16 large plots (10 x 50 m) in forest and grassland canopy types. Environmental variables were determined along 10 (20 m) transects in the four canopy types. Using analysis of variance and principal components analysis, we demonstrate that forest and gap environments had similar soils, but forest had lower light levels than gap. We also found that grassland and edge were more similar to one another than to forest and gap, but differed in a number of important biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil water availability (e.g., edge had higher root length density of small roots < 2 mm diameter in the top 20 cm than grassland). Using principal components analysis to assess similarities in community composition, we demonstrate that gap and forest had indistinguishable communities and that edge was similar to but distinct from both communities. Complete species turnover only occurred between grassland and the three forested canopy types. Even though overall community composition was similar in the three forested canopy types, in analyses of individual species using randomization tests, many common species were most frequently found in only one canopy type; these patterns held across size classes. These results suggest that despite differences among environments, community composition was similar among forested canopy types, which are likely intergrading into one another. Interestingly, individual species are more frequently found in a single canopy type, indicating species specialization.","Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA","Zanne, AE (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, 120 Dana Bldg,163 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",amy.zanne@tufts.edu,"Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019","Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140",,,,59,23,26,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2005,178,1,,,,,121,139,,10.1007/s11258-004-2562-z,,,19,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,950GK,WOS:000230845400010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pereira, OL; Costa, MD; Borges, AC; Araujo, EF; Kasuya, MCM",,,,"Pereira, OL; Costa, MD; Borges, AC; Araujo, EF; Kasuya, MCM",,,Compatibilety and ectomycorrhiza formation among Pisolithus isolates and Eucalyptus spp,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhiza colonization; Eucalyptus grandis; Eucalyptus urophylla; morphological characterization; sclerotia,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ROOTS; GROWTH; PINE; TINCTORIUS; MORPHOLOGY; SCLEROTIA,"Twenty-nine isolates of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus sp. from different geographical and host origins were tested for their ability to form ectomycorrhizae on Eucalyptus grandis and E. urophylla seedlings under greenhouse conditions.

Aggregate formation and aggregate strength depend on swelling and shrinkage processes and on biological activity and kinds of organic exudates as well as on the intensity, number and time of swelling and drying events. Such aggregates are more dense than the bulk soil. The intra-aggregate pore distribution consists not only of finer pores, but these are also more tortuous. Therefore, water fluxes in aggregated soils are mostly multidimensional and the corresponding water fluxes in the intra-aggregate pore system are much smaller. Furthermore, ion transport both by mass flow and diffusion are delayed, whereby the length of the follow path in such tortuous finer pores further retards chemical exchange processes. The rearrangement of particles by aggregate formation also induces an increased apparent thermal diffusivity as compared with the homogenized material. The aggregate formation also affects the aeration and the gaseous composition in the intra-aggregate pore space. Depending on the kind and intensity of aggregation, the intra-aggregate pores can be completely anoxic, while the inter-aggregate pores are already completely aerated. The possibility to predict physical properties on these various scales depends on the rigidity of the pore system. In general, this rigidity depends on the above-mentioned physical and chemical processes both with respect to intensity and frequency. Thus, aggregates like subangular block or plates are the most rigid systems, while physical processes in the seedbed cannot be modelled using existing approaches due to the low strength and consequent instability of the pore system.

We used molecular methods to compare belowground ECM species richness, composition, and abundance between adjacent stands of homogenous lodgepole pine (established after a fire around 1867) and old growth mixed conifer (around 300 years old) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). In each stand type, we collected soil cores to both identify mycorrhizae and assess soil chemistry. Although no statistical difference was observed in the mean number of ECM root tips per core between stand types, the total number of species identified (81 versus 35) and the mean number of species per core (8.7 +/- 0.5 versus 2.5 +/- 0.3) were significantly higher in lodgepole pine. Species compositions were widely disparate between stands where only four of 112 species were shared. Soil analysis revealed that mixed conifer was significantly lower in mean pH, but higher in mean organic matter, potassium, phosphorus, and ammonium when compared to lodgepole pine. Although analysis of covariance did not statistically demonstrate that soil chemistry is driving ECM community structure with certainty, our data are, nonetheless, consistent with this hypothesis. Our data further suggest that fungal richness declines and composition shifts some time after Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir colonize mature lodgepole pine stands, and that time since last wildfire influences soil chemistry in this system. Moreover, because of data limitations, future field experiments will be necessary to determine if soil chemistry, as well as other biotic and abiotic factors not examined in this study, is a primary influence on ECM community structure at our study site in YNP.

In earlier studies, batatasin-III has been found to be present in both soil and soil solutions. However, to understand the actual mechanisms by which batatasin-III may interact, we need to know more about the fate and behaviour of the compound in soil. In order to achieve this, we firstly evaluated the efficiency of different extraction methods in recovering batatasin-III from Empetrum humus and found that the highest yield was obtained using ethyl acetate (6.57 +/- 20 mu g g(-1) HDM, least square mean +/- SE). In contrast, no detectable amounts of batatasin-III were obtained when extracting the humus with distilled water, 0.125 M citric acid or 0.05 M NaOH. Secondly, we performed a series of experiments in which the recovery of batatasin-III was determined from humus samples exposed to different treatments. In summary, the recovery of batatasin-III was found to be initially strongly dependent on humus type (i.e. humus collected from under a cover of Empetrum, Vaccinium or forest herbs) as well as the temperature and the length of the incubation period. The amount of recovered batatasin-III was in general highest from the Empetrum humus and lowest from the herb humus, contrary to our hypothesis that microorganisms might be better adapted to batatasin-III in humus of the Empetrum origin than in humus of other origin. Regardless of humus type, the recovery was generally higher at + 2 degrees C than at + 18 degrees C suggesting that microbial degradation of batatasin-III did occur. However, when the recovery of batatasin-III from sterile and non-sterile humus was compared, microbial degradation was found to be of minor importance. In addition, no phenolic degradation products of batatasin-III were detected after batatasin-III had been added to non-sterile humus. The obtained results suggest that batatasin-III, when released into humus, becomes physically trapped by organic matter and metabolized by soil microbes to a less extent. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. 2. The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO2 flux. 6. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems. 7. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes.

Soils are believed to be exceptionally biodiverse parts of ecosystems, a view confirmed by recent data from the UK Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope, Scotland, where high diversity was a characteristic of small organisms, but not of larger ones. Explaining this difference requires knowledge that we currently lack about the basic biology and biogeography of micro-organisms. 2 It seems inherently plausible that the high levels of biological diversity in soil play some part in determining the ability of soils to undertake ecosystem-level processes, such as carbon and mineral cycling. However, we lack conceptual models to address this issue, and debate about the role of biodiversity in ecosystem processes has centred around the concept of functional redundancy, and has consequently been largely semantic. More precise construction of our experimental questions is needed to advance understanding. 3 These issues are well illustrated by the fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizas, the Glomeromycota. This ancient symbiosis of plants and fungi is responsible for phosphate uptake in most land plants, and the phylum is generally held to be species-poor and non-specific, with most members readily colonizing any plant species. Molecular techniques have shown both those assumptions to be unsafe, raising questions about what factors have promoted diversification in these fungi. One source of this genetic diversity may be functional diversity. 4 Specificity of the mycorrhizal interaction between plants and fungi would have important ecosystem consequences. One example would be in the control of invasiveness in introduced plant species: surprisingly, naturalized plant species in Britain are disproportionately from mycorrhizal families, suggesting that these fungi may play a role in assisting invasion. 5 What emerges from an attempt to relate biodiversity and ecosystem processes in soil is our extraordinary ignorance about the organisms involved. There are fundamental questions that are now answerable with new techniques and sufficient will, such as how biodiverse are natural soils? Do microbes have biogeography? Are there rare or even endangered microbes?","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Fitter, AH (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",ahf1@york.ac.uk,,,,,,87,176,197,5,128,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Tree mortality was clearly biased and more trees survived in the upper part of the slope than in the middle and the lower parts. There was no significant difference between the upper and the lower part of the slope in the number of feeding wounds made by the pine sawyer beetle, which demonstrates the opportunity of infection with this disease. There was no clear correlation between the development of mycorrhizae and the composition of the soil substrate such as total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

Microorganisms here assayed were isolated from Cd or Zn polluted soils. B. brevis increased the presymbiotic growth ( germination rate growth and mycelial development) of Glomus mosseae. Spore germination and mycelial development of both G. mosseae isolate were reduced as much as the amount of Cd or Zn increased in the growth medium. In medium supplemented with 20 mu g Cd mL(-1), the spore germination was only 12% after 20 days of incubation, but the coinoculation with B. brevis increased this value to 40% after only 15 days. The addition of 20 mu g Cd mL(-1) to the growth medium drastically inhibited hyphal development, but the presence of the bacterium increased hyphal growth of G. mosseae from 195% ( without Cd) until 254% ( with 20 mu g Cd mL(-1)). The corresponding bacterial effect increasing micelial growth ranged from 125% ( without Zn) to 232% ( 200 mu g Zn mL(-1)) in the case of G. mosseae isolated from Zn-polluted soil. Mycelial growth under 5 mu g Cd mL(-1) ( without bacterium) was similarly reduced from that produced at 15 mu g Cd mL(-1) in the presence of the bacteria. As well, 50 mu g Zn mL(-1) ( without bacterium) reduced hyphal growth as much as 200 mu g Zn mL(-1) did in the presence of B. brevis. The bacterial effect on the saprophytic growth of G. mosseae in absence of metal may be due to the involvement of indole acetic acid (IAA) produced by these bacteria. The Cd bioaccumulation ability exhibited (76%) by Cd-adapted B. brevis reduced the Cd damage on G. mosseae in Cd-contaminated medium. These capabilities of B. brevis isolates partially alleviate the inhibitory effects of Cd or Zn on the axenic growth of G. mosseae.","CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Azcon, R (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",rosario.azcon@eez.csic.es,"Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015; Azcon, Rosario/H-5240-2015","Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718; Azcon, Rosario/0000-0003-4568-4090",,,,40,25,30,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Soil phosphatase activity decreased only in the Ah horizon in plots receiving lime, either in combination with N or alone. The mass of root fwt. colonized by AM fungi increased in response to the treatments in the order nitrogen < lime < N plus lime. In contrast, root surface phosphatase activity decreased only in response to additions of nitrogen. A positive linear relationship was observed between root surface phosphatase activity and the P concentration of the plant shoots (R-2 = 28.7%, P = 0.004).

These soils induce two successive constraints in one-year cycle: water excess (and hypoxy) in winter and early spring, and water shortage in summer (water stress being more restrictive to oak). We determined the porosity and water properties of temporarily waterlogged clayey soils supporting forest stands of declining Quercus robur trees in a 101 yr-old oak stand in Belgium (50 degrees 06'N 4 degrees 16'E). Roots unevenly colonized the soil down to 1.6 in: fine roots (diameter < 5 mm) were mostly distributed on the surface horizons (0-0.3 in) and around 1.3 in deep, despite dense clayey horizons appearing at 0.35 in depth. Clay content below this depth reached 46-51%. Illite and vermiculite were the dominant clay minerals. The clayey horizons exhibited marked shrink-swell properties: bulk density at 30 kPa increased from 1.41 to 1.88 g cm(-3) from the surface to 2 m depth. There was also evidence of hypoxic conditions caused by water saturation of pore space in the rooting zone from October to mid-April. Extractable water (EW), calculated between moisture tensions of 5 and 1600 kPa was 152.8 mm.

Furthermore, we studied the influence of two types of uncontaminated subsoils (acidic vs. calcareous) and two types of irrigation water acidity (ambient rainfall chemistry vs. acidified chemistry) on the response of the vegetation. Each of the eight treatment combinations was replicated four times. The contamination (2700 mg kg(-1) Zn, 385 mg kg-1 Cu and 10 mg kg-1 Cd) was applied by mixing filter dust from a non-ferrous metal smelter into the upper 15 cm of the soil profile, consisting of silty loam (pH 6.5). The same vegetation was established in all 32 lysimeters. The model forest ecosystem consisted of seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies), willow (Salix viminalis), poplar (Populus tremula) and birch (Betula pendula) trees and a variety of herbaceous understorey plants. Systematic and significant effects showed up in the second and third growing season after canopies had closed. Evapotranspiration was reduced in metal contaminated treatments, independent of the subsoil type and acidity of the irrigation water. This effect corresponded to an even stronger reduction in root growth in the metal treatments. In the first two growing seasons, evapotranspiration was higher on the calcareous than on the acidic subsoil. In the third year the difference disappeared. Acidification of the irrigation water had no significant effect on water consumption, although a tendency to enhance evapotranspiration became increasingly manifest in the second and third year. Soil water potentials indicated that the increasing water consumption over the years was fed primarily by intensified extraction of water from the topsoil in the lysimeters with acidic subsoil, whereas also lower depths became strongly exploited in the lysimeters with calcareous subsoil. These patterns agreed well with the vertical profiles of fine root density related with the two types of subsoil. Leaf transpiration measurements and biomass samples showed that different plant species in part responded quite differently and occasionally even in opposite ways to the metal treatments and subsoil conditions. They suggest that the year-to-year changes in treatment effects on water consumption and extraction patterns were related to differences in growth dynamics, as well as to shifts in competitiveness of the various species. Results showed that the uncontaminated subsoil offered a possibility to compensate the reduction in root water extraction in the topsoil under drought, as well as metal stress.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETHZ, Inst Terr Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; EAWAG, Dubendorf, Switzerland","Menon, M (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETHZ, Inst Terr Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland.",manoj.menon@env.ethz.ch,"Gunthardt-Goerg, Madeleine/L-6461-2013; Menon, Manoj/B-1169-2016; Oswald, Sascha E/C-1441-2008","Menon, Manoj/0000-0001-5665-7464; Oswald, Sascha E/0000-0003-1667-0060",,,,36,40,44,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2005,271,2-Jan,,,,,227,241,,10.1007/s11104-004-2390-x,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,944AL,WOS:000230397200020,,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Niemi, K; Kevers, C; Haggman, H",,,,"Niemi, K; Kevers, C; Haggman, H",,,Lignosulfonate promotes the interaction between Scots pine and an ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius in vitro,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhizas; Fe-lignosulfonate; mycorrhiza formation; Pinus sylvestris; Pisolithus tinctorius,ADVENTITIOUS ROOT-FORMATION; HEBELOMA-CYLINDROSPORUM; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SHOOT HYPOCOTYLS; LACCARIA-BICOLOR; NORWAY SPRUCE; SOIL; PINASTER; SEEDLINGS; DYNAMICS,"Lignosulfonate (LS) is a lignin-based polymer obtained as a by-product from paper industry, which may have potential as an amendment with macronutrients.

Fe-LS enhanced P. tinctorius induced formation of lateral roots and had a dose-dependent positive effect on the establishment of mycorrhizas on the seedlings. The growth of the fungal mycelium was improved by Fe-LS, which might cause faster and more intensive contact with the roots and, thus, better root growth and mycorrhiza formation. P. tinctorius enhanced also adventitious root formation and subsequent root growth of the hypocotyl cuttings but without any synergistic effect with Fe-LS.

Root and rhizosphere soil samples of all the five species of rhododendrons, namely, Rhododendron anthopogon, R. arboreum, R. campanulatum, R. barbatum and R. lepidotum were collected from temperate, sub-alpine to alpine location in altitudinal range from 1500 to 4500 m amsl. The arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in root samples ranged from 28 to 42%; and maximum and minimum colonization was observed in R. arboreum and R. lepidotum, respectively. The highest number of intraradical vesicles (12.5 +/- 2.8 cm(-1) root segment) was recorded in R. arboreum and the lowest (7.0 +/- 1.7 cm(-1) root segment) in R. barbatum; vesicles were not observed in R. lepidotum. Spores were extracted from the rhizosphere soil by wet sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species. The maximum and minimum populations of spores were detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of R. anthopogon (52.0 +/- 1.5 spores 25 g(-1) soil) and R. lepidotum (32.0 +/- 2.5 spore 25 g(-1) soil), respectively. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera-Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellispora; genus Glomus was found to be dominant in the rhizosphere soil samples of all the rhododendron species. The most frequent and abundant species was G. fasciculatum, however, this species was not isolated from the rhizosphere soil of R. barbatum. Finger millet (Eleucine coracana) was used to cultivate the trap culture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to confirm the species identity. Spores of Glomus pustulatum, not detected in the rhizosphere soil, were recovered from the trap culture. Contrary to this, genus Gigaspora, which was present in the rhizosphere soil, did not sporulate in the trap culture. Shannon and Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's index of dominance indicated that the species richness, dominance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decrease with increasing altitude.

As root system is a key parameter in determining suitability of the tree pairs, we compared root architecture of Acacia cyanophylla Lindl. and Casuarina glauca Sieber ex. Spreng. (two N(2)-fixing trees) with Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn. and Ceratonia siliqua L. (two non-N(2)-fixing trees) at 4-year-old in Mediterranean-semiarid zone. The rhizobium strain used appeared more motile than Frankia strain. A. cyanophylla and E. camaldulensis had extensive rooting area and volume of fine roots, and both species tended to develop marked horizontal rooting, compared to C. glauca and C. siliqua. Characteristics of fine- and horizontal-root components can be used in selecting matched root systems of N(2)-fixing and reference-paired trees. Root architecture of C. glauca was more similar to C. siliqua, than to E. camaldulensis, and that of A. cyanophylla was more similar to E. camaldulensis than to C. siliqua. Accordingly, E. camaldulensis is an appropriate reference to estimate actual N(2) fixation by A. cyanophylla, and C. siliqua is an appropriate reference for C. glauca, when using soil-(15)N-labelling method in the prevailing site environment.

The experiments were conducted using 0.2 m(3) soil microcosms inside greenhouses with CO2 concentrations of either 360 or 500 mumol mol(-1). Carbon dioxide flux from the soil surface, as calculated using a diffusive transport model agreed well with CO2 flux measurements made using a dynamic flow system. Soil CO2 emissions did not differ significantly between the 360 and 500 mumol mol(-1) CO2 treatments when soils were dry (volumetric soil moisture content less than or equal to9%). A simulated precipitation event caused an immediate exhalation Of CO2 from soil, after which CO2 emissions declined slightly and remained constant for approximately 36 h. CO2 emissions from soil microcosms with F pratensis plants growing in 500 mumol mol(-1) CO2 then rose to levels that were significantly greater than CO2 emissions from soils in the microcosms, exposed to 360 mumol mol(-1) CO2. For A. absinthium growing in 500 mumol mol(-1) CO2, the rise in Soil CO2 emissions following the wetting event was not significantly greater than emissions from soils with A. absinthium growing under 360 mumol mol(-1) CO2. A. absinthium above ground biomass increased by 46.1 +/- 17.9% (mean +/- S.E., n = 4, P less than or equal to 0.05).

Virtually all previous experiments have used mobile insects confined in cages and have studied the effects of one, or at most two, species of mycorrhizae on one species of insect. The purpose of this study was to introduce a greater level of realism into insect-mycorrhizal experiments, by studying the responses of different insect feeding guilds to a variety of AM fungi. We conducted two experiments involving three species of relatively immobile insects (a leaf-mining and two seed-feeding flies) reared in natural conditions on a host (Leucanthemum vulgare). In a field study, natural levels of AM colonization were reduced, while in a phytometer trial, we experimentally colonized host plants with all possible combinations of three known mycorrhizal associates of L. vulgare. In general, AM fungi increased the stature (height and leaf number) and nitrogen content of plants. However, these effects changed through the season and were,dependent on the identity of the fungi in the root system. AM fungi increased host acceptance of all three insects and larval performance of the leaf miner, but these effects were also season- and AM species-dependent. We suggest that the mycorrhizal effect on the performance of the leaf miner is due to fungal-induced changes in host-plant nitrogen content, detected by the adult fly. However, variability in the effect was apparent, because not all AM species increased plant N content. Meanwhile, positive effects of mycorrhizae were found on flower number and flower size, and these appeared to result in enhanced infestation levels by the seed-feeding insects. The results show that AM fungi exhibit ecological specificity, in that different. species have different effects on host-plant growth and chemistry and the performance of foliar-feeding insects. Future studies need to conduct experiments that use ecologically realistic combinations of plants and fungi and allow insects to be reared in natural conditions.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Reading, Ctr Agrienvironm Res, Dept Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","Gange, AC (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",a.gange@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,33,54,58,1,33,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2005,86,3,,,,,603,611,,10.1890/04-0967,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906RJ,WOS:000227659700009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, X; Wu, N; Li, C",,,,"Zhang, X; Wu, N; Li, C",,,Physiological and growth responses of Populus davidiana ecotypes to different soil water contents,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,abscisic acid; carbon isotope composition; dry matter accumulation and allocation; gas exchange; Populus davidiana; water use efficiency,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS DEHNH; PROGRESSIVE DROUGHT STRESS; USE EFFICIENCY; ABSCISIC-ACID; POPULATION DIFFERENCES; MORPHOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS; BIOMASS PRODUCTIVITY; GAS-EXCHANGE; SEEDLINGS,"Changes in dry matter accumulation and allocation, gas exchange, abscisic acid content (ABA) and water use efficiency (WUE) of three contrasting Populus davidiana ecotypes were recorded after exposure to five different soil water contents.

In the controlled environment study, five different soil water contents which were watered to 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% field capacity were used, respectively. Significant differences in height growth (HT), total biomass (TB), total leaf area (LA), total leaf number (TLN), specific leaf area (SLA), root/shoot ratio (RS), net photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (C), transpiration efficiency (WUET) and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) between the ecotypes were detected under all soil water contents. Ecotypic differences in ABA and carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) were also detected under low soil water contents, but these differences were not significant under high soil water content. Compared with the wet climate ecotype, the dry climate ecotype had lower HT, TB, LA, TLN, SLA, A, E and C, and higher RS, WUET and WUEi under all soil water contents. On the other hand, the dry climate ecotype also exhibited higher ABA and delta(13)C as affected by low soil water contents than the wet climate ecotype. These morphological and physiological responses to water availability showed that the different ecotypes may employ different survival strategies under drought at the initial phase of seedling growth and establishment. The wet climate ecotype possesses a prodigal water use strategy and quick growth, while the dry climate ecotype exhibits a conservative water use strategies and slow growth. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The first and second order jackknife estimates were 116 and 143 types, respectively. Among Basidiomycetes, tomentelloid/thelephoroid, russuloid, and cortinarioid groups were the richest.

Diversity was lower at a drier high elevation oak forest site compared to a low elevation mesic cove - hardwood forest site. Fungal specificity for red oak vs. white oak seedlings was unresolved. The high degree of rarity in this system imposes limitations on the power of community analyses at finer scales.

In the Puget Trough of western Washington, Oregon white oak grows in coarse-textured glacial outwash soils on lowland sites. Our objective was to quantify the gross root system morphology of Oregon white oak in these soils, thereby improving our understanding of its belowground resource acquisition on these sites. Study trees were located on a Spanaway gravelly sandy loam soil near Olympia, Washington. Root systems of 27 oak trees (age 3-95 yr) were excavated and measured. Root systems of seedlings and small trees had prominent taproots, but root systems of larger trees were structurally dominated by shallow lateral roots. Vertical penetration of roots, including the taproot, was restricted by gravelly and cobbly layers within the C horizon, which began at a depth of about 70 cm. Although most roots were located in the finer-textured A horizon, some small roots penetrated to depths greater than 150 cm, where soils remain moist in summer. The predominance of shallow roots suggests that management of understory vegetation or overstory conifers, which both have a similar rooting zone, will likely influence growth and survival of oak. Activities, such as vehicular traffic, that significantly disturb surface soils may adversely affect oak trees.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Olympia, WA 98512 USA","Devine, WD (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, 3625 93rd Ave SW, Olympia, WA 98512 USA.",wdevine@fs.fed.us,"Harrington, Constance/G-6161-2012",,,,,35,12,12,0,15,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,PULLMAN,"PO BOX 645020, PULLMAN, WA 99164-5910 USA",0029-344X,,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,SPR,2005,79,3-Feb,,,,,179,188,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,995PE,WOS:000234115500010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Weber, A; Karst, J; Gilbert, B; Kimmins, JP",,,,"Weber, A; Karst, J; Gilbert, B; Kimmins, JP",,,Thuja plicata exclusion in ectomycorrhiza-dominated forests: testing the role of inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; colonization; dispersal; shade; tree distribution,PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NORTHERN VANCOUVER-ISLAND; MOUNT-ST-HELENS; DOUGLAS-FIR; RAIN-FOREST; PSEUDOTSUGA-MENZIESII; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; GROWTH-RESPONSES; LIGHT-INTENSITY; DIVERSITY,"The ability of trees dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to establish in ectomycorrhizal forests is unknown. On northern Vancouver Island, Canada, there are sharp boundaries between mixed red cedar (Thuja plicata)-hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) (CH) stands, and stands of hemlock and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis) (HA). We tested differences in AM colonization of red cedar between ectomycorrhiza-dominated (HA) stands and stands containing red cedar (CH), across a range of light levels. We used a soil bioassay approach to determine whether there was sufficient AM fungal inoculum in the HA tree stands to colonize red cedar seedlings. Seeds of hemlock and red cedar were sown in forest floor samples collected from the two types of forests, and shade treatments ranging from <1 to 53% of full sunlight were imposed. After 6 months, seedling survival and root and shoot biomass were quantified, and red cedar seedlings were sampled for AM fungal colonization. Hemlock survival and growth did not differ between soil types, suggesting there was no substrate-associated limitation to its establishment in either forest type. Red cedar colonization by AM fungi was significantly correlated with light levels in CH soils but arbuscular mycorrhizas were absent in roots of red cedar seedlings grown in HA soil. Red cedar survival and relative growth rate were significantly greater in the CH than in HA soil; higher growth was due primarily to greater shoot growth in CH soils at high light levels. The low soil inoculum potential for red cedar in ectomycorrhiza-dominated stands may account for the virtual exclusion of red cedar seedlings from these forests.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Karst, J (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",onoclea@hotmail.com,"Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822; Karst, Justine/0000-0003-0497-1552",,,,63,26,30,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,1,,,,,148,156,,10.1007/s00442-004-1777-y,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,902PT,WOS:000227369700016,15583941,,,,10/31/19J,"Shimizu, M; Ishida, A; Hogetsu, T",,,,"Shimizu, M; Ishida, A; Hogetsu, T",,,Root hydraulic conductivity and whole-plant water balance in tropical saplings following a shade-to-sun transfer,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,aquaporins; dry matter allocation; leaf mass per area; leaf osmotic potential; niche differentiation,MERCURIC-CHLORIDE; CANOPY GAP; CONDUCTANCE; LIGHT; AQUAPORINS; TRANSPORT; SEEDLINGS; FOREST; SOIL; ACCLIMATION,"We hypothesized that pioneer and late successional species show different morphological and physiological responses in water use after gap formation. The magnitude of the responses was compared between two pioneer species (Macaranga gigantea and Trema orientalis) and four late successional species (Shorea sp.), in an experiment in which saplings were transferred from shade to sun. Although transpiration demand increased following the transfer, root hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r)) decreased. Lp(r) was sensitive to brief treatments with HgCl2 (a specific inhibitor of aquaporins). This allows Lp(r) to be divided into two components: cell-to-cell and apoplastic pathways. The Lp(r) of cell-to-cell pathway decreased in all species following the transfer, relating to aquaporin depression in roots. Following the transfer, leaf osmotic potentials at full hydration decreased and both leaf mass per area [leaf mass/leaf area (LMA)] and fine-root surface area/leaf surface area (root SA/leaf SA) increased in almost all species, allowing saplings to compensate for the decrease in Lp(r). Physiologically, pioneer species showed larger decreases in Lp(r) and more effective osmotic adjustment than late successional species, and morphologically, pioneer species showed larger increases in root SA/leaf SA and LMA. Water balance at the whole-plant level should be regulated by coupled responses between the aboveground and the belowground parts. Interspecific differences in responses after gap formation suggest niche differentiation in water use between pioneer and late successional species in accordance with canopy-gap size.","Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Plant Ecol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan","Shimizu, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",michiru@fr.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Ishida, Atsushi/0000-0003-0620-5819",,,,44,19,21,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,2,,,,,189,197,,10.1007/s00442-004-1797-7,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907SN,WOS:000227738400002,15619094,,,,10/31/19J,"Schipka, F; Heimann, J; Leuschner, C",,,,"Schipka, F; Heimann, J; Leuschner, C",,,Regional variation in canopy transpiration of Central European beech forests,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fagus sylvatica; meta analysis; precipitation gradient; sap flow; soil moisture,SCOTS PINE STANDS; WATER-USE; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; SAP FLOW; FINE ROOTS; TREES; CONDUCTANCE; EVAPORATION; VEGETATION,"Forest hydrologists have hypothesised that canopy transpiration (E-c) of European temperate forests occurs at rather similar rates in stands with different tree species and hydrologic regimes. We tested this hypothesis by synchronously measuring xylem sap flow in four mature stands of Fagus sylvatica along a precipitation gradient with the aim (1) of exploring the regional variability of annual canopy transpiration (E-c(t)) in this species, and (2) of analysing the relationship between precipitation (P) and E-c(t). E-c(t) rates of 216, 225, 272 and 303 mm year(-1) corresponded to precipitation averages of 520, 710, 801 and 1,040 mm year(-1) in the four stands. We explored the regional variability of E-c(t) in Central European colline to sub-montane beech stands in two meta-analyses based on (1) existing sap flow data on beech (n=5 observations), or (2) all canopy transpiration data on beech obtained by different techniques (sap flow, micrometeorological or soil water budget approaches, n=25). With a coefficient of variation (CV) of 20%, the regional variability of E-c(t) (213-421 mm year(-1)) was smaller than the variation in corresponding precipitation (550-1,480 mm year(-1)). The mean E-c(t) for beech was 289 (+/- 58) mm year(-1) (n=25). A humped-shaped relationship between E-c(t) and P, with a broad transpiration maximum in the precipitation range from ca. 700 to 1,000 mm year(-1), was found which may indicate soil moisture limitation of transpiration for P < ca. 700 mm year(-1), and reduced transpiration by increased cloudiness or leaf wetness for P > 1,000 mm year(-1). Thus, the precipitation level significantly influences canopy transpiration of humid temperate forests; however, the size of the P influence on E-c(t) and, in part, the direction of its effect differ from forests in semi-arid or arid climates. European beech has the capacity to maintain high E-c rates in both humid and partly dry summer climates (P < 550 mm year(-1)).","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Tech Univ, Inst Ecol, Berlin, Germany","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,,,,,,48,24,29,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2005,143,2,,,,,260,270,,10.1007/s00442-004-1798-6,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907SN,WOS:000227738400010,15682345,,,,10/31/19J,"Parra-Colmenares, A; Kahn, ML",,,,"Parra-Colmenares, A; Kahn, ML",,,Determination of nitrogen fixation effectiveness in selected Medicago truncatula isolates by measuring nitrogen isotope incorporation into pheophytin,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,chlorophyll; legume productivity; legume-rhizobia combination; N-15 isotope dilution assay; nitrogen fixation; pheophytin,RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; N-2 FIXATION; SINORHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; SYMBIOSIS; VARIABILITY; PLANT; DILUTION; LUCERNE; STRAIN; CLOVER,"Effectiveness is a term used to describe the input that a bacterial nitrogen-fixing symbiosis makes to plant nitrogen metabolism.

In previous work, an isotope dilution mass spectrometry method, which uses the effect of nitrogen fixation on the nitrogen isotope composition of chlorophyll in plants grown on N-15 fertilizer as a measure of effectiveness, was developed for estimating the contribution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to plant nitrogen content. This N-15-dilution assay was used to evaluate the level of nitrogen fixation effectiveness in three Medicago truncatula lines that have been used as parents in generating recombinant inbred lines.

In both species, root biomass and morphological traits were strongly correlated with tree size, but only weakly with light availability. Increased root biomass was primarily allocated to coarse roots and secondarily to fine roots. Yellow birch roots were longer, had a larger area, more endings and branches and grew more rapidly than sugar maple roots. Mycorrhizal colonization increased with available light and declined with tree age in sugar maple and was positively associated with tree size in yellow birch.

The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of burning, grazing, and herbicide to reduce smooth brome production and cover while minimizing coincident detrimental effects on cool-season grasses in a reclaimed surface coal mine site. Concurrently, the project also investigated effects of microbial inoculation on respread topsoil subjected to long-term storage and associated effects on seeded cool-season grasses subjected to brome control treatments. Results indicated that grazing and burning were most effective after 2 years of treatment. Smooth brome biomass was lowest in reburned cells (mean +/- SE, 189 +/- 77 kg-ha(-1)) followed by regrazed (294 +/- 129) compared to untreated cells (824 +/- 42) (P < 0.0001). Native grass production was highest in grazed cells (141 67 kg-ha(-1)) followed by burning (104 +/- 41), herbicide (72 +/- 30), and untreated (30 +/- 27). Foliar cover response patterns were similar. Inoculation had little effect on microbial biomass and mycorrhizal infection. Retreated cells did show differences among months (P = 0.013) in 2000, and microbial carbon ranged from 0.07 +/- 0.01 mg/g in June to 0.12 +/- 0.01 in July and 0.12 +/- 0.01 in August, averaged across treatments. Root infection decreased as soil moisture declined. Results indicate grazing offers the greatest potential for controlling smooth brome without harming native, seeded grasses on reclaimed lands in northern mixed-prarie communities, and inoculation was unnecessary for enhancing seeded, cool-season grass growth.","Univ Nevada, Dept Anim Biotechnol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; USDA, NRCS, Price, UT 84501 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Perryman, BL (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Anim Biotechnol, MS202, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",bperryman@cabnr.unr.edu,,,,,,29,17,18,2,26,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

In general, these can be separated into extracellular PGPR (ePGPR), existing in the rhizosphere, on the rhizoplane or in the spaces between cells of the root cortex, and intracellular PGPR (iPGPR), which exist inside root cells, generally in specialized nodular structures. The latter includes rhizobia and Frankia species, both of which fix nitrogen in symbiosis with higher plants. There has been considerable development in understanding signaling mechanisms of rhizobia (iPGPR) during the establishment of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis, and this may serve as a model of knowledge regarding cross-talk and plant growth promoting mechanisms. We provide a detailed review of this process, including plant-to-bacteria signal molecules, followed by bacterial perception and consequent production of bacteria-to-plant signals. A history of PGPR discovery is also provided, indicating progress in understanding each of the PGPR groups. Recent advances in understanding plant growth responses to microbial signals are reviewed, along with the research areas that require attention. Based on new understandings of signaling mechanisms in the iPGPR (rhizobia) and recent findings with ePGPR we are able to speculate regarding general patterns of signaling in the ePGPR.

Each microcosms was composed of three plant species, Trifolium repens, Plantago lanceolata and Phleum pratense, growing in grassland soil with a diverse soil community. The experiment consisted of two treatment factors-defoliation and plant growth phase (PGP)-in a fully factorial design. Defoliation had two categories. i.e. no trimming or trimming a total of four times at 2 week intervals. The PGP treatment had four categories, i.e. 1, 3, 7 or 13 weeks growth following planting before the first defoliation (subsequently referred to as PGP1, PGP2, PGP3 and PGP4, respectively). In each PGP treatment category, microcosms were harvested I week after the final defoliation. Harvested shoot and root mass and total shoot production (including trimmed and harvested shoot mass) increased with time and were lower in defoliated than in non-defoliated systems. The fraction of root biomass of harvested plant biomass decreased with time but was increased by defoliation at PGP3 and PGP4. The proportion of T. repens in total shoot production increased and those of P. lanceolata and P. pratense decreased with time. Defoliation increased the proportions of P. lanceolata and P. pratense in total shoot production at PGP3 and PGP4. Root N and C concentrations increased and root C-to-N ratio decreased with time in non-defoliated systems. Defoliation increased root N concentration by 38 and 33% at PGP1 and PGP2, respectively, but decreased the concentration by 22% at PGP4. In contrast, defoliation reduced root C concentration on average by 1.5% at each PGP. As with the effects on root N concentration, defoliation decreased the root C-to-N ratio at PGP1 and PGP2 but increased the ratio at PGP4. Among soil animal trophic groups, the abundance of herbivorous nematodes was higher at PGP4 than at PGP1-3 and that of predacious nematodes higher at PGP2-4 than at PGP1, while the abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous and omnivorous nematodes and that of detritivorous enchytraeids did not differ between the PGP categories. Among bacterivorous nematodes, however, Acrobeloides. Chiloplacus and Protorhabditis species decreased and that of Plectus spp. increased with time. Defoliation did not affect the abundance of soil animal trophic groups, but reduced the abundance of herbivorous Coslenchus spp. at each PGP and raised the abundance of herbivorous Rotylenchus spp. and bacterivorous Eucephalobus spp. at PGP4. Confirming our hypothesis, the results suggest that the effects of defoliation on the attributes of grassland plants, such as biomass allocation between roots and shoots and root quality, may depend on the timing of defoliation within a growing season. However, contradicting our hypothesis, the results suggest that significant changes in plant attributes after defoliation may not always lead to substantial changes in the abundance of belowground organisms.

In this study, we determined the effect of elevated CO2 on decomposition of grass root material (Lolium perenne L.). C-14-labeled root material, produced under ambient (35 Pa PCO2) or elevated CO2 (70 Pa PCO2) was incubated in soil for 64 days. The soils were taken from a pasture ecosystem which had been exposed to ambient (35 Pa PCO2) or elevated CO2 (60 Pa PCO2) under FACE-conditions for 10 years and two fertilizer N rates: 140 and 560 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). In soil exposed to elevated CO2, decomposition rates of root material grown at either ambient or elevated CO2 were always lower than in the control soil exposed to ambient CO2, demonstrating a change in microbial activity. In the soil that received the high rate of N fertilizer, decomposition of root material grown at elevated CO, decreased by approximately 17% after incubation for 64 days compared to root material grown at ambient CO2. The amount of (CO2)-C-14 respired per amount of C-14 incorporated in the microbial biomass (q(14)CO(2)) was significantly lower when roots were grown under high CO2 compared to roots grown under low CO2. We hypothesize that this decrease is the result of a shift in the microbial community, causing an increase in metabolic efficiency. Soils exposed to elevated CO2 tended to respire more native SOC, both with and without the addition of the root material, probably resulting from a higher C supply to the soil during the 10 years of treatment with elevated CO2. The results show the importance of using soils adapted to elevated CO2 in studies of decomposition of roots grown under elevated CO2. Our results further suggest that negative priming effects may obscure CO2 data in incubation experiments with unlabeled substrates. From the results obtained, we conclude that a slower turnover of root material grown in an 'elevated-CO2 world' may result in a limited net increase in C storage in ryegrass swards.

A survival experiment was set-up to derive critical cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in a range of field-contaminated soils in the absence of their host plant (Trifolium repens L.). Soils applied with metal salts or sewage sludge > 10 years ago were sampled and were inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum, bv. trifolii (10(8) cells g(-1) soil) and incubated outdoors for up to 6 months. The most probable number (MPN) decreased 1-2 orders of magnitude in uncontaminated soils during the incubation. There was no significant effect of total metal concentrations on rhizobia survival in soils contaminated with Cd salts or with high Ni/Cd sewage sludge with highest Cd concentrations between 18 and 118 mg Cd kg(-1). In contrast, survival was strongly affected in soils contaminated by sewage sludge, where Zn was the principal metal contaminant. Neither total Cd nor soil solution Cd was large enough to attribute these effects to Cd when compared with the soil series, where Cd salts had been applied. The MPN decreased at least one order of magnitude above total Zn concentrations of 233 mg Zn kg(-1) (soil pH 5.6) and 876 mg Zn kg(-1) (soil pH 6.3). The EC50s of log MPN were 204 and 604 mg Zn kg(-1), respectively, and were lower than those for the symbiotic nitrogen fixation measured in the pot trial on the same soils (respectively 602 and 737 mg Zn kg(-1)). This study corroborates the evidence that symbiotic nitrogen fixation is affected by Zn in the field when Zn decreases the free-living population of rhizobia to below a critical threshold.

We found that the distribution of earthworms and soil microbes (e.g., fungi and bacteria) showed considerable spatial difference in these tropical landslides. We also found that endogenic earthworms (Pontoscolex corethrurus) occurred in all habitats (upper landslide 9.5 +/- 4 No. m(-2), lower landslide 43.8 +/- 11 No. m(-2), upper forest 35.7 +/- 8 No. m(-2), and lower forest 30.5 +/- 14 No. m(-2)), but anecic earthworms (Amynthas rodericensis) were only found in the undisturbed forests (3.4 +/- 0.6 No. m(-2)). Total bacterial and fungal biomasses were significantly higher in the forests than in the landslides. Active bacterial and fungal biomasses were significantly higher in the lower landslide area than in the upper landslide area. For all sampled soil parameters there was a dominance of microsite variation within landslides compared with seasonal changes or differences between landslides and adjacent forests. Earthworm density and biomass correlated positively with leaf litter, light-carbon fraction, and total bacteria and negatively with fine roots, suggesting that earthworm abundance and composition in landslides were regulated by carbon pools. Earthworm abundance and community structure as well as active and total fungal and bacterial biomass may reflect soil disturbance history and soil development processes over geological time in the Puerto Rican rainforest.","Nanjuing Forestry Univ, Fac Forest Resources & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Trop Ecosyst Studies, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Edmond, OK USA","Li, YQ (reprint author), Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",yiqingli@crssa.rutgers.edu,,"Zou, Xiaoming/0000-0001-9023-3067",,,,53,4,8,0,17,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0038-075X,1538-9243,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,MAR,2005,170,3,,,,,202,211,,10.1097/00010694-200503000-00006,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,908GE,WOS:000227774700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Allison, VJ; Miller, RM",,,,"Allison, VJ; Miller, RM",,,Soil grinding increases the relative abundance of eukaryotic phospholipid fatty acids,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; BIOMASS; PROFILES; SHIFTS,"Pretreatment of soil samples, such as grinding and sample size, can potentially affect phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) extraction efficiencies. The objective of this study was to determine how soil pretreatment affects PLFA analysis and interpretation. Two grinding (ground and control) and five soil sample sizes (0.125-5 g) in factorial combinations were applied to restored or remnant prairie soils. In the restored soil, the smaller soil aliquots were more likely to result in outlying values of community composition, suggesting small-scale heterogeneity in microbial community distribution. Grinding reduced this variability in community composition, with no outliers, even with the lowest size in ground soils. However, grinding increased the abundance of eukaryotic relative to prokaryotic PLFAs, and we hypothesize that grinding exposed root cells and the interior of fungal hyphae to extraction. We suggest that in soils with high root densities, soils should not be ground as grinding may obscure changes in the microbial community by exaggerating the eukaryotic signal from roots. However, in soils with low rooting densities, grinding will reduce heterogeneity and ensure that eukaryotic biomarkers are not underestimated.","Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Res, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Allison, VJ (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Res, Bldg 203,E-133,9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",vallison@anl.gov,,,,,,16,12,12,1,13,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

STANDS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH,"The applicability of a heuristic model for estimating mean fine-root biomass of Norway spruce stands based on the coordinates and the diameters at breast height (diameter at a height of 1.3 m, dbh) of their trees was tested. The model was developed based on the following assumptions which were derived from the literature: (1) the maximum distance the roots of a tree can be found depends on the dimension of the tree and exceeds the edges of the crown; (2) fine-root biomass decreases with increasing distance from the tree trunk; (3) fine-root biomass increases with the dbh; (4) maximum fine-root biomass of a tree is not allocated directly around the tree's trunk but at some distance from the stem. On the basis of these assumptions the model calculates a relative fine-root biomass at a given point within a stand. Four different versions of the model were compared, with each version differing with respect to the assumed decrease in fine roots with decreasing dbh and the approaches used to calculate the contribution of a subject tree to the fine-root biomass at a given point within a stand (additive versus consumptive). Using regression analysis we parameterised each model type with the data of 70 soil cores from a 75-year- old Norway spruce stand in southern Germany (Bavaria). The relative fine-root biomass calculated by the four different model types accounted for 62 - 72% of the variation of the measured fine-root biomass. The parameterised models were used to predict the fine-root biomass of 60 given points of a second Norway spruce stand based on its dbhs and stem coordinates. The comparison of measured and predicted mean fine-root biomasses of the second stand revealed no significant differences between the measured mean and the means estimated by three of the four model types. Whereas with two of the model types we achieved means and medians, respectively, nearly identical to the measured average, none of the model types was able to predict values as high as the measured maximum. Constraints of the models and points that need to be considered regarding the minimum number of soil cores needed for a reliable parameterisation of the model are discussed.","Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Waldbau, Dept Okosystemmanagement & Landnutzung, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Waldbau & Forstschutz, D-01735 Tharandt, Germany","Ammer, C (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Waldbau, Dept Okosystemmanagement & Landnutzung, Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",ammer@wbfe.forst.tu-muenchen.de,,"Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135",,,,72,33,34,8,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

To improve. our understanding of the role of a canopy opening on the physical environment in a natural forest. a case study was undertaken in and around a gap in a semi-natural, beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. spatial and temporal variations in photosynthetically active irradiance (I-P), soil and air temperature (T-S and T-A) and soil water content (SWC) were studied until the third growing season after natural formation of the gap. I-P was highest in the northern part of the gap and in the adjacent forest, particularly around mid-summer and on sunny days. when I-P was predominantly direct. Total Ip in the southern part of the gap and along Rap edges declined by about 19.6% from the first to the second year after gap formation, possibly due to growth of canopy and sub-canopy trees. Maximum and mean T-S were generally highest in the southern central part of the gap, and in late spring and summer also under the closed canopy east of the gap. The insulating effect of dense regeneration could to some extent explain the spatial variation of T-S. though this was not tested directly. SWC in the gap was near field capacity and generally higher than that under the closed canopy during summer. A decrease in SWC from the first to the second year after gap formation may have been attributed to released edge trees. although water use by the dense regeneration could not be ruled out. In general, the effect of this small irregular gap on light, soil and air temperature, and soil moisture was influenced by the considerable microsite variation. Furthermore, growth of regeneration and edge trees. resulting in increased interception, shading and water extraction by roots, may have modified the gap effect seen as early as the second year after gap formation.

Root systems of 5 sample trees each stand selected from 30-40 year-old Norway spruce in Ebergotzen/Gottingen, Barbis/Vorharz and Weidenbrunnen/Fichtelgebirge, in which soil acidity was different each other, were structural analysed. The roots collected manually were investigated for the number, diameter, length, weight, root branching forms and root cross section area (total area, sapwood). The major results are: The total root system structure was remarkable different between three studied stands (Fig. 4-6). The root structure of Ebergotzen stand showed a strong ""sinker"" type with many fine root developed deeply into soil layer (over 140 cm). Barbis stand showed a small number of root and thick root in diameter although roots were also well developed. The root structure of Weidenbrunnen stand were flat type or diagonal growing type with intensive branch form. In analysis of branching pattern, no big differences in branching forms could be found in the studied stands (Tab. 3, Fig, 3, 7). For average total root weight, Weidenbrunnen stand showed highest value of 37.2 (+/- 1.3) kg and that of Barbis and Ebergotzen was 16.6 (+/- 9.1) kg and 16.3 (+/- 5.6) kg, respectively. In the horizontal root weight, Weidenbrunnen also showed much higher value of 31.6 (+/- 10.7) kg than the other two stands of Babris and Ebergotzen with 12.2 (+/- 7.3) kg and 11.8 (+/- 4.5) kg, respectively. The vertical root weights of the three stands showed about same value with 4.5 (+/- 2.3) kg in Babris, 4.5 (+/- 1.7) kg in Ebergotzen and 5.6 (+/- 2.7) kg in Weidenbrunnen. In the ratio of vertical and horizontl root weight (v/h-relation) was 0.4 (+/- 0.2) with same value in both Babris and Ebergotzen and Weidenbrunnen was lowest value of 0.16 (+/- 0.06). The distribution of root cross sections and root numbers of a representative tree of each stand at soil depths of 40, 60, and 80 cm is shown graphically (Fig. 9). In view of root distribution after cross section areas (GWQF, LWQF (whole wood cross sectional area, conducting cross sectional area) below 80 cm soil depth, Ebergotzen showed higher value of 32.6 cm(2) in average compared to 29.2 cm(2) in Barbis and 10.9 cm(2) in Weidenbrunnen (Tab. 5a, b). The root systems of Babris showed remarkablely higher percental value in all of cross section area up to V100 cm soil layer and Weidenbrunnen showed the lowest percental value. Also to the analysis of sapwood cross section area (SchiLWQF) in applying layer model similar results could be found. The SchiLWQF correspondes to the fine root mass (Fig. 10). The total fine root mass was 2470 kg/ha in Babris, 3190 kg/ha in Ebergotzen and 5680 kg/ha in Weidenbrunnen, and the living fine root amout was 1380 kg/ha, 1500 kg/ha and 1020 kg/ha, respectively. In Weidenbrunnen, roots were not well developed deeply and 97% of total and 82% of dead fine root mass (necro mass) were in the upper 20 cm soil layer. For the mechanical and physiological stability, ""anchorage factor (GQF)"" and ""sapwood factor (SQF)"" of root system were defined as relation of cross section area by V80/H100 and calculated for root systems in the stands. Weidenbrunnen showed lowest value (0.075) compared to Ebergotzen (1.04 or 1.21) and Babris (0.32 or 0.23) which can be explained remarkablely low in mechanical and pysiological stability. In analysing annual rings on successive root cross sections, mean annual increments of real vertical and horizontal roots in same soil layers were calculated. Annual length growth of horizontal roots in 50-100 cm ranged between 6.3 cm (Weidenbrunnen, Babris) and 9.3 cm (Ebergotzen). In vertical root length growth, Weidenbrunnen showed lowest values, between 3.5 cm and 6.7 cm in average in deep soil layer (Tab. 7, Fig. 12). Annual ring analysis at branching points of horizontal mother root and sinker root proved that the development of the sinker roots from latent root meristems (GRUBER, 1992) can be delayed between 2 and 19 years. The different depth of rooting on the three stands is related to the different base saturation gradient (Ca, Mg, K and Na). A ph-gradient is not the cause of the flatness of the root systems.","Yeungnam Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forest Resources, Kyongsan 712749, South Korea","Gruber, VF (reprint author), Yeungnam Univ, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Forest Resources, Daedong 214-1, Kyongsan 712749, South Korea.",,,,,,,26,0,1,0,0,J D SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, D-60322 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",Feb-52,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

Microbial DNA isolated from samples was used to generate polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis molecular profiles of bacterial and fungal communities. Bacterial plate counts were also obtained. Neither plant species nor defoliation affected the bacterial and fungal community structures in both the root tip and mature root regions, but there were significant differences in the bacterial and fungal community profiles between the two root regions for each plant. Prior to defoliation, there was no difference between plants for bacterial plate counts of soils from the root tip regions; however, counts were greater in the mature root region of L. perenne than T. repens. Bacterial plate counts for T. repens were higher in the root tip than the mature root region. After defoliation, there was no effect of plant type, position along the root or defoliation status on bacterial plate counts, although there were significant increases in bacterial plate counts with time. The results indicate that a general effect existed during maturation in the root regions of each plant, which had a greater impact on microbial community structure than either plant type or the effect of defoliation. In addition there were no generic consequences with regard to microbial populations in the rhizosphere as a response to plant defoliation.","Inst Grassland & Environm Res, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England; Univ Reading, Dept Soil Sci, Reading RG6 6DW, Berks, England; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Environm Biol Grp, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Murray, PJ (reprint author), Inst Grassland & Environm Res, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England.",phil.murray@bbsrc.ac.uk,"Murray, Phil/B-1246-2009","Murray, Phil/0000-0002-5526-8317",,,,16,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Soil CO2 emission (F-CO2) was estimated using a univariate exponential model as a function of soil temperature based on 23 measurement dates over 5 years. Annual F-CO2 for the undisturbed northern hardwood forest was estimated at 660 +/- 54 g C(.)m(-2.)year(-1). Low soil moisture significantly reduced F-CO2 on three of the measurement dates. The proportion of F-CO2 derived from the forest floor horizons was estimated empirically to be about 58%. We estimated that respiration of root tissues contributed about 40% of F-CO2, with a higher proportion for mineral soil (46%) than for forest floor (35%). Soil C-balance calculations, based upon evidence that major soil C pools are near steady state at this site, indicated a large C flux associated with root exudation plus allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (80 g C(.)m(-2.)year(-1), or 17% of total root C allocation); however, uncertainty in this estimate is high owing especially to high error bounds for root respiration flux.

Using a simplified water-balance model, we propose a framework for conceptualizing how woody plant encroachment is likely to affect components of the water cycle within these ecosystems. We focus in particular on streamflow and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration. On the basis of this framework, we Suggest that streamflow and evaporation processes are affected by woody plant encroachment in different ways, depending on the degree and seasonality of aridity and the availability of subsurface water. Differences in landscape physiography, climate, and runoff mechanisms mediate the influence of woody plants on hydrological processes. Streamflow is expected to decline as a result of woody plant encroachment in landscapes dominated by subsurface flow regimes. Similarly, encroachment of woody plants can be expected to produce an increase in the fractional contribution of bare soil evaporation to evapotranspiration in semiarid ecosystems, Whereas such shifts may be small or negligible in both subhumid and and ecosystems. This framework for considering the effects of woody plant encroachment highlights important ecological and hydrological interactions that serve as a basis for predicting other ecological aspects of vegetation change-such as potential changes in carbon cycling within an ecosystem. In locations where woody plant encroachment results in increased plant transpiration and concurrently the availability of soil water is reduced, increased accumulation of carbon in soils emerges as one prediction. Thus, explicitly considering the ecohydrological linkages associated with vegetation change provides needed information on the consequences of woody plant encroachment on water yield, carbon cycling, and other processes.","Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; USDA, ARS, SW Watershed Res Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; USDA, ARS, Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Huxman, TE (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",huxman@arizona.edu,"Breshears, David D./B-9318-2009; small, eric/B-4939-2011; Pockman, William T/D-4086-2014; Small, eric/K-6007-2015","Breshears, David D./0000-0001-6601-0058; Pockman, William T/0000-0002-3286-0457; Scott, Russell/0000-0003-2987-5380; Small, ERIC/0000-0002-5010-4954",,,,74,423,446,10,231,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2005,86,2,,,,,308,319,,10.1890/03-0583,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,906IM,WOS:000227634400005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Thelen, GC; Vivanco, JM; Newingham, B; Good, W; Bais, HP; Landres, P; Caesar, A; Callaway, RM",,,,"Thelen, GC; Vivanco, JM; Newingham, B; Good, W; Bais, HP; Landres, P; Caesar, A; Callaway, RM",,,Insect herbivory stimulates allelopathic exudation by an invasive plant and the suppression of natives,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,allelopathy; biocontrol insects; exotic invasion; herbivory; noxious weed; phytotoxic exudates; root exudates; spotted knapweed,CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; ROOT HERBIVORY; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; SPOTTED KNAPWEED; SOIL FUNGI; GROWTH; WEED; OVERCOMPENSATION; RESPONSES,"Exotic invasive plants are often subjected to attack from imported insects as a method of biological control.

Here we demonstrate that aboveground plant mutualists, insect pollinators, are strongly influenced by belowground plant mutualists, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the roots of Chamerion angustifolium increased pollinator visitation and per cent seed set of this plant in the field by up to two times compared with non-mycorrhizal plants.

We conducted a 300-day (15)N field tracer experiment to determine how N moves through soil, microbial, and plant pools under different tree species and fertilization regimes. Samples were collected from single-species plots of American beech ( Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis L.), red oak ( Quercus rubra L.), and sugar maple ( Acer saccharum Marsh). Using paired plots we compared the effects of ambient levels of N inputs ( 11 kg N/ha/y) to additions of 50 kg N/ha/y that began 1.5 years prior to and continued throughout this experiment. Total plot (15)N recovery ( litter layer, organic and mineral soil to 12 cm, fine roots, and aboveground biomass) did not vary significantly among tree species, but the distribution of sinks for (15)N within the forest ecosystem did vary. Recovery in the forest floor was significantly lower in sugar maple stands compared to the other species. (15)Nitrogen recovery was 22% lower in the fertilized plots compared to the ambient plots and red oak stands had the largest drop in (15)N recovery as a result of N fertilization. Aboveground biomass became a significantly greater (15)N sink with fertilization, although it retained less than 1% of the tracer addition. These results indicate that different forest types vary in the amount of N retention in the forest floor, and that forest N retention may change depending upon N inputs.","Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Stable Isotope Biogeochem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Templer, PH (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Ecosyst Sci Div, 151 Hilgard Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ptempler@nature.berkeley.edu,"Lovett, Gary/H-3800-2013","Lovett, Gary/0000-0002-8411-8027",,,,78,65,72,1,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,FEB,2005,8,1,,,,,1,16,,10.1007/s10021-004-0230-8,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,900TG,WOS:000227236600001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Saint-Andre, L; M'bou, AT; Mabiala, A; Mouvondy, W; Jourdan, C; Roupsard, O; Deleporte, P; Hamel, O; Nouvellon, Y",,,,"Saint-Andre, L; M'bou, AT; Mabiala, A; Mouvondy, W; Jourdan, C; Roupsard, O; Deleporte, P; Hamel, O; Nouvellon, Y",,,Age-related equations for above- and below-ground biomass of a Eucalyptus hybrid in Congo,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,root; additivity; allometry; heteroscedasticity,TEAK TECTONA-GRANDIS; CARBON STORAGE; STAND BIOMASS; PLANTATION; EXCHANGE; PINE; TREE,"A complete set of equations for below- and above-ground biomass of a natural Eucalyptus hybrid in Congo was constructed. Heteroscedasticity of data was taken into account by fitting weighted non-linear regressions using maximum likelihood estimates. Stand age was introduced as a complementary variable in the equations for a majority of above-ground compartments and led to improved estimates of biomass. Because of the limited number of sampled trees for below-ground parts, it was not possible to develop the same kind of equations. Simple allometric relationships were then fitted for these components (stumps, large, medium, and fine roots). Additivity was verified and showed no significant deviation except for the youngest stand, where the sum of below- and above-ground biomass equations was preferable to the sum of component equations or to the total biomass equation. This set of equations will now be used to evaluate both the mean and the interval of confidence of biomass content and partitioning within the stands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Within-site diversity was examined at 16 sites. The limited genetic diversity (within and between sites) and lack of genetic substructuring according to geographic origin or host species suggest the rapid spread of a relatively recently introduced species. Two subgroups were distinguished and these may reflect an initial introduction of isolates of two different genetic backgrounds. The relatively low genetic diversity is probably because of the predominantly inbreeding (homothallic) nature of P. quercina. However, evidence of limited intra-site diversity, temporal variation and the lack of clonality within the European population suggest that some diversity is being maintained by occasional outcrossing and turnover of a reservoir of long-lived soil-borne oospore (sexually derived) inoculum.","Scottish Crop Res Inst, Host Parasite Co Evolut, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; Bavarian State Inst Forestry, Sect Forest Ecol & Forest Protect, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Plant Sci, Sect Forest Genet, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Cooke, DEL (reprint author), Scottish Crop Res Inst, Host Parasite Co Evolut, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",dcooke@scri.sari.ac.uk,"Jung, Thomas/F-1665-2013; Cooke, David/D-1933-2012","Jung, Thomas/0000-0003-2034-0718; Cooke, David/0000-0002-9154-7954",,,,83,29,30,0,9,BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 58, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",1437-4781,,,FOREST PATHOL,Forest Pathol.,FEB,2005,35,1,,,,,57,70,,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2004.00384.x,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,896EP,WOS:000226917700005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Caravaca, F; Aiguacil, MM; Torres, P; Roldan, A",,,,"Caravaca, F; Aiguacil, MM; Torres, P; Roldan, A",,,Plant type mediates rhizospheric microbial activities and soil aggregation in a semiarid Mediterranean salt marsh,GEODERMA,,,English,Article,,,,,,halophyte; microbial biomass; enzyme activity; labile C fractions; aggregate stability; salt marsh,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; STABILITY; INOCULATION; PHOSPHATASE; DEGRADATION; INDICATORS; EXTRACTION; NITROGEN; CARBON,"This study was carried out in a Mediterranean salt marsh from semiarid Southeastern Spain, to determine the influence of eight halophytes (Asteriscus maritimus (L.)

The objective of this study was to describe root-morphological characteristics of the natural nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator Thlaspi goesingense Halacsy. Plant samples were collected from a serpentine site near RedIschlag (East Austria), characterized by large soil Ni concentrations. Roots were evaluated for mass, length, surface area, diameter, and related ratios using an image-analysis approach. Results showed that on the indigenous site, T goesingense HaIacsy developed a fine-branched root system, confined within a shallow soil depth. Coarse roots (>1 mm) accounted for about 60% of the total root mass (fresh and dry), while their contribution to the surface area and especially to the length of the system was small. Conversely, fine roots (<1 mm) represented 99% of the total root length and 88% of the surface area. The largest proportion of root length and area was found in the smallest diameter class of 0.0 to 0.5 mm. Shoot-biomass production per unit root was high, in spite of the adverse soil conditions. Roots accounted for 8% of the total plant mass and about 4% of the total Ni accumulation.

Location: Subalpine Nothofagus pumilio forests at Challhuaco valley (41 degrees 13'S. 71 degrees 19'W), Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina. Methods: We fenced and transplanted soils of three burning severities alone a fire severity gradient produced by a fire in 1996. Over two growing seasons we monitored soil water, direct incoming solar radiation, seedling survival, final seedling total biomass and root/shoot ratio. Additionally, we assessed severity-related changes in soil properties. Results: Incoming radiation (an indicator of the amount of canopy cover left by the fire) was the primary factor influencing spring and summer top soil water availability, first and second-year seedling survival and seedling growth. While seedling survival and soil water content were negatively affected by increased radiation, seedling final biomass was highest in very open microsites. Burned soils showed lower water holding capacity and soil carbon; however these changes did not affect topsoil water, and, contrary to expectation, there was a slight tendency toward higher seedling survival on more heavily burned soils. Herbivory significantly reduced seedling survival, but only under high-radiation conditions. While the effect of radiation on final seedling biomass was not affected by herbivory, R/S ratios were significantly reduced by herbivory in high radiation microsites. Conclusions: Despite inducing faster aerial growth, increased radiation and herbivory in severely burned sites may effectively prevent post-fire regeneration in north Patagonian subalpine forest where seed sources are not limiting.","Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; Univ Nacl Comahue, Dept Quim, CRUB, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Kitzberger, T (reprint author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",tkitzber@crub.uncoma.edu.ar,"bravo, paulina/G-5427-2016; Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121",,,,40,35,40,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Monocarboxylic acids dominated in all three experimental systems. Formic, shikimic and oxalic acids were found in both spruce and birch microcosms. Fumaric acid was exclusive for spruce, while lactic, malonic, butyric and phthalic acids were only found in the birch microcosms. In spruce rhizoboxes oxalic, lactic, formic, butyric and pthalic acids were found. In addition, citric, adipic, propionic, succinic and acetic acids were observed in the rhizosphere of birch. Behind root windows in the field, only oxalic and lactic acids were found in the rhizosphere of spruce fine roots, whereas also formic and phthalic were observed close to birch fine roots, all at low concentrations. The rhizosphere of mycorrhizal short roots of birch contained butyric acid along with the acids observed for birch fine roots. Our results emphasise that characteristics of both the trees e.g. species, developmental stage, root density, mycorrhizal status, and the experimental system, i.e. growth conditions are important for the composition and the amount of organic acids. We conclude that the rhizosphere of birch contains more organic acids at higher concentrations than spruce. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined soil CO2 efflux and potential controlling factors in managed mixed pine forests in southwestern Georgia. Soil CO2 efflux was monitored periodically in two stands that differed in soil texture in 2001 and 2002, and in six additional stands in 2003. We also monitored controlling factors: soil temperature, moisture, organic layer mass, and A layer depth. Soil moisture and CO2 efflux varied with soil texture differences among the stands. As expected, soil temperature had a strong influence on soil CO2 efflux. Soil moisture, organic layer mass, and A layer depth also were correlated with soil CO2 efflux during periods of water stress, but these relationships differed with soil texture. Forest management activities can alter components of soil CO2 efflux, including soil carbon pools, temperature, and moisture; understanding the underlying variation of these components and resultant CO2 efflux over soil types can help guide management toward desired forest carbon balance trends in southeastern mixed pine forests.

Coffee plants were submitted to two fertilisation types. Cores were taken in the 0-40 cm soil profile two years after out-planting and subsequently in the following year in depth layers 0-10 and 10-20 cm, during and at the end of the rainy season, and during the dry season. Fine root density of coffee and timber shade trees was greater in the coffee fertilisation strip as compared to unfertilised areas close to the plants or in the inter-rows. Coffee fine roots were more evenly distributed in the topsoil (0-20 cm) whereas tree fine roots were mostly found in the first 10 cm. Although the two tree species had approximately the same fine root length density, lower coffee / tree fine root length density ratios in T. ivorensis suggest that this shade tree is potentially a stronger competitor with coffee than E. deglupta. Coffee and tree fine root length density for 0-10 cm measured during the rainy season increased progressively from two to five-year-aged associations and coffee fine root length density increased relatively more than E. deglupta fine root length density in the four and five-year-aged plantations suggesting that contrary to expectations, coffee fine roots were displacing tree fine roots.","Ctr Agr Res Suriname, Agroforestry Dept, Paramaribo South, Surinam; Natl Inst Res Amazon, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; CATIE, Dept Agr & Agroforestry, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; CATIE, Dept Watershed Management, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica","van Kanten, R (reprint author), Ctr Agr Res Suriname, Agroforestry Dept, POB 1914, Paramaribo South, Surinam.",rudivk@yahoo.com,"Jimenez Otarola, Francisco/J-8295-2015","Jimenez Otarola, Francisco/0000-0002-2639-0583",,,,23,15,16,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Significant differences in biomass increment were found among plots in relation to light regime and interspecific competition. Light regime had little effect on shoot-to-root ratio and biomass allocation, but had a clear impact on above- and belowground morphological variables. Beech seedlings displayed a lower specific root length (SRL) and a higher specific leaf area (SLA) under shade, thus indicating morphological adjustment to shade.

This review explores the herbivore-induced indirect effects mediated by such plant responses following herbivory in terrestrial systems. Herbivore-induced indirect effects are ubiquitous in many plant-herbivore systems, and indirect interactions occur among temporally separated, spatially separated, and taxonomically distinct herbivore species. Unlike interspecific competition, herbivores can benefit each other through plant-mediated indirect effects. Herbivore-induced changes in plants occur at low levels of herbivory, which increases the likelihood of plant-mediated indirect interactions between herbivores. ne herbivore-induced indirect effects result in interaction linkages, which alter species richness and abundance in arthropod communities. Such interaction linkages should be depicted using indirect interaction webs, which incorporate nontrophic, indirect links. The idea of interaction linkages by herbivore-induced indirect effects that shape community organization and biodiversity is an important revision of the traditional view of plant-based terrestrial food webs.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Ohgushi, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",ohgushi@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/B-6037-2011","thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/0000-0001-7201-6931",,,,106,272,292,5,190,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,,978-0-8243-1436-1,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

The model includes submodels for stand dynamics ( plot simulation, growth and yield, and cross-cutting of trees) and disease dynamics: (i) spore infection, (ii) stump colonization, (iii) colonization of stump roots, (iv) vegetative transfer to tree roots, (v) spread of disease in tree roots, (vi) spread of decay in stems, and (vii) disease effect on tree growth and survival. To illustrate the model, a simulation was carried out on a Swedish Norway spruce stand where logging occurred during the high-risk season for spore infection. The model provides a means of incorporating the impact of root disease into forest planning. A change of parameters indicated that model predictions were sensitive to the spread rate and presence of initial disease centers.

We measured the root and microbial components of soil respiration near Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2000 and 2001, in three black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) B. S. P.) forests. We hypothesized faster decomposition correlates with greater amounts of both root and microbial contributions to soil respiration. Contrary to our prediction, the site with the coolest summer soil temperatures and slowest decomposition (site identification ""high-np"") had significantly (p < 0.05) greater growing season soil respiration (485 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) than the two other sites (372 and 332 g C.m(-2).year(-1)). Spruce C allocation to root respiration was significantly greater, and fine-root N concentration was 10% and 12% greater (p < 0.05) at high-np than at the other two sites. High-np spruce foliage was also more enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15, suggesting either lower available moisture or slower N turnover. Either factor could drive greater C allocation to roots; however, a literature review suggests moisture deficit corresponds to greater C allocation to roots in black spruce forests across the boreal ecosystem. Controls on spruce C allocation need to be resolved before making the generalization that soil respiration will increase with warming in this forest type.","Univ Alaska, Dept Forest Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Vogel, JG (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Bot, 220 Bartram Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jvogel@ufl.edu,,,,,,53,65,83,0,34,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

This contrasts with the Flemish Manure Decree stating that the NO3--N residue in the soil profile (0-90 cm) must remain below 90 kg ha(-1) during a fixed curfew (i.e., October 1st until November 15th). This study was conducted to examine the feasibility of this prevailing standard for properly fertilized open-air vegetables (cauliflower, leek, lettuce, etc.). During 3 consecutive yr (i.e., 2000-2002), a scientifically sound N fertilization recommendation, based on an N-min measurement in the soil profile, was given for 136 experimental fields. Yield and product quality, as well as the NO3--N residue, were determined for each plot, and results were compared with a control plot. The results showed that during the curfew, only 44.9% of the experimental plots remained below 90 kg NO3--N ha(-1) as demanded by the Flemish Manure Decree. For the years 2000 and 2001, even at the lowest NO3--N-residues, no significant loss of yield and quality was observed for the harvested vegetables. However, results of the year 2002 showed distinct losses for both yield and quality, especially for cauliflower and leek. The results further indicated that for the vegetables mentioned above, which have a limited rooting depth and root development, the excessive NO3--N rates are partly linked with a high organic matter content in the soil and/or a labile organic matter pool, giving rise to large uncertainties in N fertilization recommendations. Thus, it appears to be rather difficult to meet the needs of the market for fresh vegetables, especially during late summer and early autumn, and meet the requirements of the manure decree. Furthermore, lowering the NO3--N residue in the soil after harvest will require specific measures and will result in an increase of the production cost for Flemish vegetables.","Univ Ghent, Dept Soil Management & Soil Care, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; REO Auct Mart, Roeselare, Belgium","Salomez, J (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Soil Management & Soil Care, Coupure 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",joost.salomez@UGent.be,,,,,,14,1,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",24-Oct,1532-2416,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Principal species sampled were Tsuga heterophylla and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Wood and bark tissue densities were weighted by sample fraction, adjusted for fragmentation, then regressed to determine k by tissue type for each species. After accounting for stand age, no significant differences were found between log and stump density within species, but P. menziesii decomposed more slowly (k = 0.015.y(-1)) than T. heterophylla (k = 0.036.y(-1)), a species pattern repeated both above- and below-ground. Small-diameter (1-3 cm) P. menziesii roots decomposed faster (k = 0.014-y(-1)) than large-diameter (3-8 cm) roots (k = 0.008.y(-1)), a pattern echoed by T. heterophylla roots (1-3 cm, k = 0.023.y(-1); 3-8 cm, k = 0.017.y(-1)), suggesting a relationship between diameter and k. Given our mean k and mean mass of coarse woody debris stores in each stand (determined earlier), we estimate decomposing logs, stumps, and snags are releasing back to the atmosphere between 0.3 and 0.9 Mg C.ha(-1).y(-1) (assuming all coarse woody debris is P. menziesii) or 0.8-2.3 Mg C.ha(-1).y(-1) (assuming all coarse woody debris is T. heterophylla). Including coarse roots increases these loss calculations (averages of all decomposition classes for the study year) to 0.5-1.9 Mg C.ha(-1).y(-1) or 1.0-3.5 Mg C.ha(-1).y(-1), respectively. Our results support substitution of log k in C flux models when stump k is unknown. Substitution of log k for coarse root k could, however, substantially overestimate C flux back to the atmosphere from these forests.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Janisch, JE (reprint author), Washington Dept Ecol, Environm Assessment Program, 300 Desmond Dr, Lacey, WA 98503 USA.",jaja461@ecy.wa.gov,,"Fasth, Becky/0000-0001-5006-6727",,,,47,54,59,1,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2005,12,2,,,,,151,160,,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-2-151.1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,941UK,WOS:000230239500001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Espelta, JM; Cortes, P; Mangiron, M; Retana, J",,,,"Espelta, JM; Cortes, P; Mangiron, M; Retana, J",,,"Differences in biomass partitioning, leaf nitrogen content, and water use efficiency (delta C-13) result in similar performance of seedlings of two Mediterranean oaks with contrasting leaf habit",ECOSCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,deciduous; evergreen; Mediterranean-type climate; Quercus cerrioides; Quercus ilex; regeneration,QUERCUS-ILEX; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; GAS-EXCHANGE; TRADE-OFFS; PUBESCENS; FORESTS; TRAITS; GROWTH; TREES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Co-occurrence of winter-deciduous and evergreen oaks is common in some Mediterranean-type climate areas. However, whether these species show an overlap in their regeneration niche is still poorly understood. We explored experimentally the changes in survival, growth, biomass partitioning, leaf nitrogen content, and water use efficiency (delta(13)C) in seedlings of a deciduous oak (Quercus cerrioides) and an evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) in response to co-variation in light and water availability. Quercus cerrioides exhibited higher root length, root area, leaf nitrogen content, and less negative delta(13)C, but lower leafiness than Q. ilex. The interaction between species and light in specific leaf area and root-shoot ratio indicated different mechanisms to overcome water stress in the two oaks, with Q. ilex relying on leaf hardening and Q. cerrioides relying on a high root-shoot ratio. However, the two species showed similar survival and growth in most of the light-water gradient. Ecological inference of these results indicates that seedlings of these species have a similar ability to cope with variations in light and water in spite of their contrasting leaf habit. This similar performance suggests a competition for similar micro-sites during establishment, rather than a partitioning of the regeneration niche.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Espelta, JM (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",josep.espelta@uab.es,"Espelta, Josep M/I-3891-2016; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Espelta, Josep M/0000-0002-0242-4988; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,44,22,22,0,15,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2005,12,4,,,,,447,454,,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-4-447.1,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,001ZU,WOS:000234582000002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Adams, CR; Galatowitsch, SM",,,,"Adams, CR; Galatowitsch, SM",,,Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass): Rapid growth and growth pattern in conditions approximating newly restored wetlands,ECOSCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass; establishment; invasion; root; shoot ratio,NITRATE-N; ESTABLISHMENT; COMPETITION; PLANTS; L.; INVASION; MESOCOSM,"Species invasions have several stages: 1) immigration of propagules, 2) establishment, and 3) spread and replacement of native species. The unconstrained growth of a species contributes to competitive ability during establishment and spread in bare soil conditions such as exist in newly restored wetlands. Phalaris arundinacea, an invasive perennial grass, is problematic in wetlands across temperate North America. Studies have shown that other wetland species have slower growth than P. arundinacea during the first 2 y following germination, implying that P. arundinacea invasiveness may be related to high rates of biomass production during establishment. We conducted a uniform planting study to observe P. arundinacea growth over two growing seasons. Phalaris arundinacea grew rapidly during establishment, producing a total biomass of 124 g(.)plant(-1) in four months and 525 g(.)plant(-1) at the end of two growing seasons. Root:shoot ratios were < 1 during the first four months of establishment, but were > 2 for the rest of the study. The shift in root:shoot ratio suggests R arundinacea may pre-empt other species during establishment by first securing above ground space and then spreading rapidly belowground. Phalaris arundinacea vegetative growth likely facilitates dominance of this species when growth is unconstrained. Species-specific information about unconstrained growth is important to developing a predictive understanding of early establishment of wetland plant communities in bare ground conditions, i.e., in newly created, restored, and disturbed wetlands.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Hort Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Adams, CR (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Environm Hort, POB 110675, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",creinhardt@ifas.ufl.edu,,,,,,32,23,26,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2005,12,4,,,,,569,573,,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-4-569.1,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,001ZU,WOS:000234582000015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Tuzinsky, L",,,,"Tuzinsky, L",,,Temporal dynamics of soil water in oak forest stand of southern slovakia,EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA,,,English,Article,,,,,,forest stand; soil water; hydrolimits; available water,,"Time and spatial variability of the soil water depends on the weather characteristic course, on soil hydrophysical characteristics and on forest stand transformation influence. Analysis of soil water available for plants during the growing season shows that the water dynamics in the soil under the oak forest stand is most intense in the upper (0-50 cm) layers of the soil profile. Water uptake and loss from this soil layer results in transition of the soil water from one category to another, especially due to the osmotic preassure of the soil and the water active transport via fine roots. At the beginning of the growing season capillary movable water category prevails in the soil profile with easy available water supply. Radiation and air temperature increase leads to the gradual decrease of soil water content. Increase of evapotranspiration (> 5 mm.day(-1)) is folowed by the process of water supply decrease. During the culminating drying off period (July, August) the soil water supply decreases to the category of capillary immovable water. During extremely dry season the water supply in the soil can decrease to the wilting point level. Soil water becomes capillary bound and non-available for plants. Loss of contact between the fine roots and water results in decrease of transpiration and assimilation. Premature fall off of physiologically weakened leaves is recorded. Under such conditions the oak resistance towards damaging factors is decreased.","Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Nat Environm, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia","Tuzinsky, L (reprint author), Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Dept Nat Environm, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia.",tuzinsky@vsld.tuzvo.sk,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SLOVAK ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,BRATISLAVA,"PO BOX 57 NAM SLOBODY 6, 810 05 BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",1335-342X,,,EKOL BRATISLAVA,Ekol.

However, these data may be patchy, and have gaps or biases. An alternative approach to generating C budgets has been to use process-based models, constructed to simulate the key processes involved in C exchange. However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined. This paper demonstrates why data assimilation (DA) techniques - which combine stock and flux observations with a dynamic model - improve estimates of, and provide insights into, ecosystem carbon (C) exchanges. We use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link a series of measurements with a simple box model of C transformations. Measurements were collected at a young ponderosa pine stand in central Oregon over a 3-year period, and include eddy flux and soil CO2 efflux data, litterfall collections, stem surveys, root and soil cores, and leaf area index data. The simple C model is a mass balance model with nine unknown parameters, tracking changes in C storage among five pools; foliar, wood and fine root pools in vegetation, and also fresh litter and soil organic matter (SOM) plus coarse woody debris pools. We nested the EnKF within an optimization routine to generate estimates from the data of the unknown parameters and the five initial conditions for the pools. The efficacy of the DA process can be judged by comparing the probability distributions of estimates produced with the EnKF analysis vs. those produced with reduced data or model alone. Using the model alone, estimated net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE)=-251+/-197 g C m(-2) over the 3 years, compared with an estimate of -419+/-29 g C m(-2) when all observations were assimilated into the model. The uncertainty on daily measurements of NEE via eddy fluxes was estimated at 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1), but the uncertainty on assimilated estimates averaged 0.47 g C m(-2) day(-1), and only exceeded 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) on days where neither eddy flux nor soil efflux data were available. In generating C budgets, the assimilation process reduced the uncertainties associated with using data or model alone and the forecasts of NEE were statistically unbiased estimates. The results of the analysis emphasize the importance of time series as constraints. Occasional, rare measurements of stocks have limited use in constraining the estimates of other components of the C cycle. Long time series are particularly crucial for improving the analysis of pools with long time constants, such as SOM, woody biomass, and woody debris. Long-running forest stem surveys, and tree ring data, offer a rich resource that could be assimilated to provide an important constraint on C cycling of slow pools. For extending estimates of NEE across regions, DA can play a further important role, by assimilating remote-sensing data into the analysis of C cycles. We show, via sensitivity analysis, how assimilating an estimate of photosynthesis - which might be provided indirectly by remotely sensed data - improves the analysis of NEE.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Edinburgh, NERC Ctr Terr Carbon Dynam, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Williams, M (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Darwin Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208",,,,47,192,208,1,93,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Wild-type 'Gifu' (nod(+)myc(+)) plants had typical colonization. The colonization of mutants by several fungi varied and provides a basis for studying recognition and compatibility between plants and mycorrhizal fungal species. These mutants also will be useful in studies of the genetics of the symbiosis between plant species and AM fungi.","[Solaiman, Zakaria] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Senoo, Keishi] Univ Tokyo, Lab Soil Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138654, Japan","Solaiman, Z (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",solaiman@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Solaiman, Zakaria/C-9645-2010; Senoo, Keishi/T-5846-2019","Solaiman, Zakaria/0000-0001-7014-7532; Senoo, Keishi/0000-0002-2938-2108","Scientific Research on Priority AreasMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [10182102]","The authors thank Dr Motoshi Suzuki and Mr Akihiko Narutaki of Idemitsu Kosan Co, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan for supplying inoculum of Glomus sp.

One year after planting, the available phosphorus content in the amended soils of both species was about fourfold higher than in the nonamended soil. Amendment addition increased the aggregate stability of the rhizosphere of C. albidus (by 56% with respect to control soil) while the mycorrhizal inoculation increased only the aggregate stability of the rhizosphere of Q. coccifera (by 13% with respect to control soil). Biomass C content and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, urease, protease-BAA, acid phosphatase, and P-glucosidase) of the rhizosphere of C. albidus were increased by amendment addition but not by mycorrhizal inoculation. Both treatments increased enzyme activities of the rhizosphere of Q. coccifera. The mycorrhizal inoculation of the seedlings with S. verrucosum was the most effective treatment for stimulating the growth of C. albidus (by 469% with respect to control plants) and Q. coccifera (by 74% with respect to control plants). The combined treatment, involving mycorrhizal inoculation of seedlings and addition of the amendment directly into soil, had no additive effect on the growth of either shrub species.","CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, Murcia 30100, Spain; CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol, E-18008 Granada, Spain; IRTA, Ctr Cabrils, Dept Plant Pathol, Barcelona 08348, Spain; Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante 03202, Spain","Caravaca, F (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Soil & Water Conservat, POB 164,Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",fcb@cebas.csic.es,"Parlade, Javier/G-8304-2015; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/M-3859-2014; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013; Azcon, Rosario/H-5240-2015; Caravaca, Fuensanta/K-6358-2017","Parlade, Javier/0000-0002-0867-3280; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/0000-0001-8495-8707; Azcon, Rosario/0000-0003-4568-4090; Caravaca, Fuensanta/0000-0001-8247-6296; Roldan, Antonio/0000-0002-2610-7784",,,,46,37,38,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Maximum-likelihood gene trees for atpD, glnII, recA, and nifH loci were estimated for diverse strains from all but one of the named Bradyrhizobitim species, And three unnamed ""genospecies,"" including photosynthetic isolates. Topological congruence and split decomposition analyses of the three housekeeping loci are consistent with a model of frequent homologous recombination within but not across lineages, whereas strong evidence was found for the consistent lateral gene transfer across lineages of the symbiotic (auxiliary) nifH locus, which grouped strains according to their hosts and not by their species assignation. A well resolved Bayesian species phylogeny was estimated from partially congruent glnII + recA sequences, which is highly consistent with the actual taxonomic scheme of the genus. Population-level analyses of isolates from endemic Canarian genistoid legumes based on REP-PCR genomic fingerprints, allozyme and DNA polymorphism analyses revealed a non-clonal and slightly epidemic population structure for B. canariense isolates of Canarian and Moroccan origin, uncovered recombination and migration as significant evolutionary forces providing the species with internal cohesiveness, and demonstrated its significant genetic differentiation from B. japonicum, its sister species, despite their sympatry and partially overlapped ecological niches. This finding provides strong evidence for the existence of well delineated species in the bacterial world.

While CO2 stimulates net primary production, O-3 reduces photosynthesis, altering plant C allocation and reducing ecosystem C storage. The effects of multiple air pollutants can alter below-ground C allocation, leading to changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the soil, chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC) and the rate of mineral weathering. As this system represents a linkage between the long- and short-term C cycles and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 changes in atmospheric chemistry that affect net primary production may alter the fate of C in these ecosystems. To date, little is known about the combined effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 on the inorganic C cycle in forest systems. Free air CO2 and O-3 enrichment (FACE) technology was used at the Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin to understand how elevated atmospheric CO2 and O-3 interact to alter pCO(2) and DIC concentrations in the soil. Ambient and elevated CO, levels were 360 +/- 16 and 542 +/- 81 mul 1(-1), respectively; ambient and elevated O-3 levels were 33 +/- 14 and 49 +/- 124 nl 1(-1), respectively. Measured concentrations of soil CO, and calculated concentrations of DIC increased over the growing season by 14 and 22%, respectively, under elevated atmospheric CO2 and were unaffected by elevated tropospheric O-3. The increased concentration of DIC altered inorganic carbonate chemistry by increasing system total alkalinity by 210%, likely due to enhanced chemical weathering. The study also demonstrated the close coupling between the seasonal delta(13)C Of Soil pCO(2) and DIC, as a mixing model showed that new atmospheric CO2 accounted for approximately 90% of the C leaving the system as DIC. This study illustrates the potential of using stable isotopic techniques and FACE technology to examine long- and short-term ecosystem C sequestration.","US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Geol & Mining Engn & Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Karberg, NJ (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, 410 Macinnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",nkarberg@fs.fed.us,,,,,,45,48,52,2,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2005,142,2,,,,,296,306,,10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,887DH,WOS:000226285000015,15378342,,,,10/31/19J,"Hille, M; den Ouden, J",,,,"Hille, M; den Ouden, J",,,Charcoal and activated carbon as adsorbate of phytotoxic compounds - a comparative study,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SEEDED SCOTS PINE; VACCINIUM-MYRTILLUS; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TEMPERATE FORESTS; CALLUNA-VULGARIS; STEAM TREATMENT; BOREAL; GROWTH; VEGETATION; LITTER,"This study compares the potential of natural charcoal from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and activated carbon to improve germination under the hypothesis that natural charcoal adsorbs phytotoxins produced by dwarf-shrubs, but due to it's chemical properties to a lesser extent than activated carbon. Activated carbon has been used in many bioassays as an adsorbate to clean aqueous solutions. We used aqueous extracts from young leaves of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull and Vaccinium myrtillus (L.) as phytotoxin sources in two different concentrations (10 and 14 gr. of dried leaves in 100 ml distilled water). Germination of pine seeds was prevented by the higher concentration of both species, while the lower ones did not show significantly reduced germination. Both ericaceous species showed a very similar potential to prevent germination of Scots pine seeds. Supplemented carbon (activated carbon, powdered or granulated pine charcoal) restored germination in strong extracts. Adding activated carbon resulted in germination of almost 100%. With pine charcoals added, lower germination percentages were observed. The charcoal powder was more effective (60% for C. vulgaris; 28% for V. myrtillus) than the charcoal granulate (30% and 16%, respectively) in restoring germination. Chemical and surface analysis of the three carbon supplements revealed that activated carbon had by far the biggest active surface area (641 m(2) g(-1)), and thus many more cavities to bind phytotoxins than natural charcoal (total surface area of 142 m(2) g(-1)). We conclude, that charcoal produced by forest fires can have a positive effect on seed germination, but to a much lesser extent than activated carbon. Previous studies, which used activated carbon as an equivalent for charcoal, overestimated the effect of charcoal on germination.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands","Hille, M (reprint author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Dept Environm Sci, POB 342, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.",marco.hille@wur.nl,,,,,,30,37,40,0,14,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2005,108,1,,,,,202,207,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13482.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,877OA,WOS:000225578700020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rillig, MC; Lutgen, ER; Ramsey, PW; Klironomos, JN; Gannon, JE",,,,"Rillig, MC; Lutgen, ER; Ramsey, PW; Klironomos, JN; Gannon, JE",,,Microbiota accompanying different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal isolates influence soil aggregation,PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,aggregation; arbuscular mycorrhiza; hyphae; PLFA; soil bacteria,METHYL-ESTER PROFILES; ORGANIC-MATTER; PLANT; GLOMALIN; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; ROOTS; COLONIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are key components of ecosystems through their influence on plant communities and ecosystem processes. A major source of information regarding the importance of AMF species richness on process rates are mesocosm experiments using different levels of diversity of AMF as provided by single-species cultures of AMF Since AMF inocula are generally made available in the form of non-sterile pot culture material, it is possible that AMF symbiosis-associated microbiota are at least partially responsible for some effects hitherto directly attributed to the AMF mycelium. Here, we provide evidence that microbiota associated with single-species cultures of AMF (after long-term pot culture enrichment of 7-8 years) can strongly affect the ecosystem process of soil aggregation. This effect occurred in an AMF isolate specific manner, but in the absence of live and active AMF mycelium. We additionally documented large differences in microbiota communities associated with the different AMF inocula (using PLFA analyses), suggesting that these differences were at least partly responsible for the observed changes in soil aggregation. This result points to AMF-microbiota interactions as a largely unexplored mechanism underlying soil aggregation (and potentially other ecosystem processes). We suggest that a reinterpretation of previous experiments using greenhouse-derived AMF cultures may be necessary, and the need to consider AMF symbiosis-associated microbiota, in mechanistic studies of AMF and mycorrhizae in general is emphasized.

We compared the external mycelium of three AMF isolates (Glomus intraradices, Glomus etunicatum and Gigaspora gigantea) during early colonization of plant roots. We investigated whether an AMF with the most rapid colonization would have higher numbers of infective structures (i.e., infection hyphae and contact points), an AMF with extensive root colonization would have more infection units, and (3) AMF with extensive soil colonization would have large numbers of all external features (including absorptive hyphae, runner hyphae and hyphal bridges). Using specially designed soil and root observation chambers, we followed the development of the external, mycelium for 7 weeks. We found that rapid colonization rate was due, in part, to the presence of more infective structures, in particular more infection hyphae and root contact points. Second, the extensive root colonizer had more, larger infection units. Third, data did not support the hypothesis that the extensive soil colonizer had more external structures. These results show that differences in the architecture of the external mycelium are responsible, in part, for variation in the colonization strategy of AMF (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Water repellency is a significant problem worldwide, with important environmental consequences, for which proximate causes are poorly understood. Hydrophobins are a recently discovered, seemingly ubiquitous class of fungal proteins that have numerous roles in the life history of filamentous fungi through their ability to act at surfaces. Hydrophobins are potent surfactants; they also have the ability to self-assemble at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, with concurrent changes in surface properties. Potential, but as yet unexplored consequences of hydrophobin presence in soils are discussed, and it is concluded that the study of water repellency (and soil ecology in general) could profit by applying some, of the knowledge obtained from molecular/biochemical studies on hydrophobins to the soil environment.

Phenotypic characteristics measured included growth rates in various media, colony morphology, and tolerances to extremes of temperature, salt and pH. The isolates were very diverse phenotypically. Among the 83 isolates that were screened, the majority were fast-growing rhizobia. Twenty eight strains tolerated high concentration of salt (4.5% NaCl) and grew well between temperatures of 37 and 45 degrees C. The majority of the strains also tolerated extreme pH in their medium from 3.5 to 12. All strains formed nitrogen fixing nodules, and the highest activity was detected in the legume Hedysarum crinita L. PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNAs revealed that the majority of the isolates belonged to the genera Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Agrobacterium. Only a single strain represented the genus Sinorhizobium. In addition, a strain related to Burkholderia from the beta-class of the Proteobacteria (CC-CC-5) was found within nodules of the legume Catenaria caudatum. The study contributes to the understanding of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in selected wild legumes that are native to Taiwan and provides insights into the distribution of nodulating and nitrogen-fixing bacteria from other distinct lineages.

Changes of soil moisture influenced only the CO2 efflux on meadow soils in field and climate chamber (14-34% explained variance), whereas on the bare soil and the forest soil there was no visible effect. The spatial variation of soil CO2 emission in the field correlated significantly with the soil pH and fine root mass, explaining up to 24% and 31% of the variability. A non-linear regression model was developed to describe soil CO2 efflux as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture, pH-value and root mass. With the model we could explain 60% of the variability in soil CO2 emission of all individual field chamber measurements. Through the model analysis we highlight the temporal influence of rain events. The model overestimated the observed fluxes during and within four hours of the last rain event. Conversely, after more than 72 h without rain the model underestimated the fluxes. Between four and 72 h after rainfall, the regression model of soil CO2 emission explained up to 91% of the variance.","Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Nat Syst Dept, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Reth, S (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",,"Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112",,,,66,96,124,2,78,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2005,268,2-Jan,,,,,21,33,,10.1007/s11104-005-0175-5,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,931TG,WOS:000229507800003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Milchunas, DG; Mosier, AR; Morgan, JA; LeCain, DR; King, JY; Nelson, JA",,,,"Milchunas, DG; Mosier, AR; Morgan, JA; LeCain, DR; King, JY; Nelson, JA",,,Root production and tissue quality in a shortgrass steppe exposed to elevated CO2: Using a new ingrowth method,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,belowground net primary production; C : N ratios; fiber and soluble constituents; lignin; nitrogen; root : shoot ratio,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; PLANT WATER RELATIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GLOBAL CHANGE; RAPID METHOD; FINE ROOTS; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; SOIL; RESPONSES,"A modified root ingrowth method was developed to minimize destructive sampling in experiments with limited space, and used to estimate belowground net primary production and root tissue quality in a native semiarid grassland exposed to elevated CO2 for five years. Increases in root production of over 60% were observed with elevated CO2 during years of intermediate levels of precipitation, with smaller effects in a very wet year and no effects in a very dry year. Aboveground to belowground production ratios, and the depth distribution of root production, did not differ between ambient and elevated CO2 treatments. Root soluble concentrations increased an average of 11% and lignin concentrations decreased an average of 6% with elevated CO2, while nitrogen concentrations decreased an average of 21%. However, most tissue quality responses to CO2 varied greatly among years, andC:N ratios were higher in only one year (22 ambient vs. 33 elevated). Among years, root nitrogen concentrations declined with increasing aboveground plant nitrogen yield, and increased over the study period. Estimates of root production by the ingrowth donut method were much lower than previous estimates in the shortgrass steppe based on C-14 decay. We discuss reasons why all ingrowth methods will always result in relative rather than absolute estimates of root production.","Colorado State Univ, Forest Range & Watershed Stewardship Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; USDA ARS, Soil Plant Nutr Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Milchunas, DG (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Forest Range & Watershed Stewardship Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Daniel.Milchunas@ColoState.edu,"King, Jennifer Y./I-5986-2015","King, Jennifer Y./0000-0003-3433-5952",,,,49,38,41,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2005,268,2-Jan,,,,,111,122,,10.1007/s11104-004-0230-7,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,931TG,WOS:000229507800010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chen, XY; Hutley, LB; Eamus, D",,,,"Chen, XY; Hutley, LB; Eamus, D",,,Soil organic carbon content at a range of north Australian tropical savannas with contrasting site histories,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Australia; carbon cycling; fire; savannas; tree clearing; wet-dry tropics,FINE-ROOT BIOMASS; SEASONAL PATTERNS; FOREST; FIRE; TREE; PRODUCTIVITY; RESPIRATION; CLIMATE; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS,"Soils play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and can be major source or sink of CO2 depending upon land use, vegetation type and soil management practices. Natural and human impact on soil carbon concentration and storage is poorly understood in native north Australian savanna, yet this represents the largest carbon store in the ecosystem. To gain understanding of possible management impacts on this carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) of the top 1 m of red earth sands and sandy loams common in the region was sampled at 5 sites with different vegetation cover and site history ( fire regime and tree removal). SOC was high when compared to other published values for savannas and was more comparable with dry-deciduous tropical forests. Sites sampled in this study represent high rainfall savannas of northern Australia (&GT; 1700 mm annual rainfall) that feature frequent burning ( 2 in 3 years or more frequent) and a cycle of annual re-growth of tall C-4 grasses that dominate the savanna understorey. These factors may be responsible for the higher than expected SOC levels of the surface soils, despite high respiration rates. Medium term fire exclusion (15 - 20 years) at one of the sampled sites ( Wildlife Park) dramatically reduced the grassy biomass of the understorey. This site had lower SOC levels when compared to the grass dominated and frequently burnt sites, which may be due to a reduction in detrital input to surface ( 0 - 30 cm) soil carbon pools. Exclusion of trees also had a significant impact on both the total amount and distribution of soil organic carbon, with tree removal reducing observed SOC at depth ( 100 cm). Soil carbon content was higher in the wet season than that in the dry season, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicated that annual cycle of grass growth and wildfire resulted in small carbon accumulation in the upper region of the soil, and removal of woody plants resulted in significant carbon losses to recalcitrant, deep soil horizons greater than 80 cm depth.","Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; Charles Darwin Univ, Fac Educ Hlth & Sci, Sch Sci & Primary Ind, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Chen, XY (reprint author), Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 3333 Coll Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",xchen@ouc.bc.ca,"Hutley, Lindsay B/A-7925-2011; Eamus, Derek/F-7375-2017","Hutley, Lindsay B/0000-0001-5533-9886; Eamus, Derek/0000-0003-2765-8040",,,,44,21,22,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2005,268,2-Jan,,,,,161,171,,10.1007/s11104-004-0249-9,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,931TG,WOS:000229507800014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Scogings, P; Macanda, M",,,,"Scogings, P; Macanda, M",,,Acacia karroo responses to early dormant season defoliation and debarking by goats in a semi-arid subtropical savanna,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,bark stripping; browse; coppice; induced responses; tannins,AFRICAN SAVANNA; SHOOT; HERBIVORY; TORTILIS; DEFENSE; BIOMASS; BROWSE; PLANTS; DAMAGE; DREPANOLOBIUM,"Research was conducted to investigate responses of Acacia karroo to severe defoliation, with or without debarking, in a semi-arid, subtropical savanna. A herd of 250 goats reduced available foliage by 87% in a 10.5-ha area of Acacia woodland over 3 weeks during the early dormant season (May). The goats debarked 37% of the trees. On average, bark was stripped less than halfway round a stem and 11% of the bark area was affected. Trees 1.6-2.5 m tall and 11-30 cm in basal circumference were most susceptible to debarking. A year later, there were no detectable effects of defoliation on the number of browseable shoots, internode length, shoot length, spine length, number of seed pods, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) or nitrogen (N). Defoliation tended to increase condensed tannin concentration (CT), but the effect was not significant (p>0.05). The absence of goats during the growth season following defoliation allowed the trees to recover. Debarking had greater impacts on the trees than defoliation had. Debarking reduced the number of browseable shoots, while ringing at the base reduced CT and increased N. Debarking tended to reduce shoot and spine length, and halve the number of pods, but the effects were not significant (p>0.05). Responses of basally ringed trees indicated rapid vertical growth when the trees were highly vulnerable to browsers and fires, suggesting strong selection for herbivore/fire tolerance. Among all treatments, excluding basal ringing, there were significant variations in NDF and CT between years. There was a positive relationship between N and NDF, and a negative relationship between N and CT, in 1 year, but not in the other. Among basally ringed trees, CT was negatively related to N, but NDF was not. The strong trade-off between N and CT in basally ringed trees probably indicates that large changes in root:shoot ratio are required to effect definite changes in defence.","Univ Zululand, Dept Agr, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa; Dohne Agr Dev Inst, ZA-4930 Stutterheim, South Africa","Scogings, P (reprint author), Univ Zululand, Dept Agr, Private Bag X1001, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South Africa.",pscoging@pan.uzulu.ac.za,,,,,,51,26,26,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,,2005,179,2,,,,,193,206,,10.1007/s11258-004-7809-1,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,964VS,WOS:000231909700006,,,,,10/31/19
