We investigated whether these differences depend on the chemical form of inorganic phosphorus. The closely related AMF Glomus custos and Rhizophagus irregularis were compared using Plantago lanceolata as the host plant, grown in quartz sand with either soluble orthophosphate or sparingly soluble hydroxyapatite as a sole source of phosphorus. In a growth experiment with AMF-inoculated plants in a climate chamber, sampling at 3-wk intervals enabled a detailed time-resolved analysis of shoot and root phosphorus concentrations and growth performance of P. lanceolata. The ability of AMF to enhance plant growth and deliver phosphate depended strongly on the identity of the available phosphorus source. In orthophosphate-amended substrate only modest differences in plant growth performance (dry matter accumulation and allocation, phosphorus acquisition) were observed between the two AMFs, despite evident AMF root colonization as shown by strain-specific mtLSU qPCR analysis. The treatment with hydroxyapatite however, created stringent growth-limiting conditions and significantly increased the growth benefit provided by R. irregularis over G. custos and the non-mycorrhizal treatment. Plants with R. irregularis could acquire much more phosphorus from apatite compared to G. custos. There were also differences in shoot-to-root dry matter allocation and plant tissue phosphorus concentrations between the R. irregularis and G. custos treatments. Our observations suggest that in experiments on the symbiosis between plants and mycorrhizal fungi more attention should be paid to the chemical form of phosphorus in soil.","[Pel, Roel; Dupin, Simon; Schat, Henk; Ellers, Jacintha; Kiers, E.

The GRSP contains glycoproteins produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as well as lipids, humic materials and non-mycorrhizal-related heat-stable proteins, which might be affected by environmental conditions. Current and predicted changes in global climate make it important to understand how GRSP might be affected by higher atmospheric temperatures and heavy metal contamination of soil. Here, we investigated the response of GRSP to higher temperature in the rhizosphere of Robinia pseudoacacia L. seedlings in cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soil. Easily extractable (EE) and total (T) GRSP concentrations increased significantly (P<0.05) under Cd pollution alone. Compared with ambient temperature, a higher temperature (2.7 degrees C) alone significantly (P<0.05) increased EE- and T-GRSP concentrations, the EE-GRSP:T-GRSP ratio and the GRSP:soil organic carbon (SOC) ratio, but significantly (P<0.05) decreased SOC content in the rhizosphere. Higher temperature significantly (P<0.05) increased EE- and T-GRSP concentrations, the EE-GRSP:T-GRSP ratio and the GRSP:SOC ratio, but decreased SOC content under Cd pollution. Under higher temperature, the amount of Cd bound to GRSP increased significantly (P<0.05), and available Cd content decreased significantly (P<0.05). Glomalin-related soil protein contributed more carbon to the rhizosphere SOC pool under higher temperature+Cd than under Cd alone, and the higher temperature led to a significant (P<0.05) decrease in available Cd. Under the higher temperature, T-GRSP contributed more to the decrease in available Cd than did EE-GRSP. Increases in GRSP resulting from higher temperatures could increase Cd binding in contaminated soil.","[Jia, X.; He, Y.; Chang, Y.] Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, Shaanxi Key Lab Land Consolidat,Minist Educ, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Y.] Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Jia, X (reprint author), Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, Shaanxi Key Lab Land Consolidat,Minist Educ, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jiaxianavy@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270665, 31 670 549]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University [310 829 173 501, 310 827 172 007]; Fund for Creative Research Groups of Shaanxi province [2016KCT-23]","This work was supported jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no 31270665; 31 670 549), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (310 829 173 501; 310 827 172 007) and Fund for Creative Research Groups of Shaanxi province (2016KCT-23).",,48,0,0,8,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,1365-2389,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

Hook) plantations are widely grown for timber production in southern China, they have low biodiversity and provide limited ecosystem services. To address this problem, C. lanceolata are increasingly mixed with broadleaf Schima superba Gardn. & Champ. (Theaceae). The success of these mixed plantations relies on introducing each species in the appropriate sequence, which requires understanding how tree species respond to light variations. We therefore compared S. superba and C. lanceolata seedling light tolerance in shaded houses under five light gradients (5%, 15%, 40%, 60%, and 100% sunlight). Our findings showed that S. superba seedlings exhibited greater net height increment (Delta Ht), net diameter growth (Delta Dia), leaf area, root mass, stem mass, leaf mass, and total mass under low light conditions (15% sunlight). However, as sunlight increased, these growth variables became higher in C. lanceolata seedlings. With more sunlight, both species experienced a drop in height to diameter ratio (HDR), and specific leaf area (SLA), but an elevated root to shoot ratio. Additionally, under the same light levels, S. superba seedlings exhibited greater leaf area and root to shoot ratio than C. lanceolata seedlings. Our results suggested that S. superba might be more suitable for underplanting beneath a heavy canopy due to its shade-tolerant traits. In contrast, C. lanceolata was less shade-tolerant, having an optimum seedling growth under full sunlight. These findings suggest that underplanting S. superba seedlings in C. lanceolata monoculture plantation (i.e., underplanting regeneration approach) could be a better silvicultural alternative than simultaneously planting both seedlings.","[Liu, Bo; Liu, Qingqing; Guo, Si; Huang, Zhijun; Wang, Zhengning; Ma, Xiangqing] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lixin] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Daryanto, Stefani] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Ma, XQ (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Wang, LX (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",liubo@fafu.edu.cn; liuqqing222@126.com; stdaryan@iupui.edu; fafugs2017@163.com; fjhuangzj@126.com; wangzn@fafu.edu.cn; lxwang@iupui.edu; lxymxq@126.com,"wang, xl/Y-8251-2019; Wang, Lixin/A-2572-2008","Wang, Lixin/0000-0003-0968-1247","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570448, 31670714]; National Key RD Project [2016YFD0600300]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201608350014]; Education Department of Fujian Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 31570448 and 31670714) and National Key R&D Project (grant number 2016YFD0600300).

Whilst the ability to avoid antagonists is well recognized, the opportunity to establish mutualistic associations is less known, even in widespread invasive species such as Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle. We sought to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on Ailanthus seedlings are maintained over time, under prolonged pot limitation. We compared three-month-, three-year- and four-year-old mycorrhizal seedlings grown in natural forest soil (NT) with seedlings grown in sterilized (ST) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) soils, in pots of 3.4 L (22 x 15 cm). Growth parameters and leaf traits were assessed, including carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) stable isotope compositions. NT seedlings showed relatively higher vigor in the early stage but, subsequently, the benefits provided by AMF were lost. Interestingly, mycorrhizal seedlings consistently showed about 2 parts per thousand C-13 enrichment, relatively to the other treatments. Negative linear relationships between leaf C-13 and N content were found. Higher photosynthesis rates and WUE are the likely causes of the early enhanced growth in mycorrhizal seedlings. The symbiotic relationship between AMF and Ailanthus could be driven by resource availability. Greater insights into such aspects could provide an improved perspective on the ecological limits of Ailanthus.","[Badalamenti, Emilio; La Mantia, Tommaso] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci SAAF, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Ciolfi, Marco; Lauteri, Marco] CNR IBAF, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol, Natl Res Council, Via Guglielmo Marconi 2, I-05010 Porano, TR, Italy; [Quatrini, Paola] Univ Palermo, Dept Biol Chem & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol STEBICE, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","La Mantia, T (reprint author), Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci SAAF, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",emilio.badalamenti@unipa.it; marco.ciolfi@ibaf.cnr.it; marco.lauteri@ibaf.cnr.it; paola.quatrini@unipa.it; tommaso.lamantia@unipa.it,"BADALAMENTI, Emilio/J-3406-2019; CIOLFI, MARCO/Q-4101-2018","BADALAMENTI, Emilio/0000-0002-8178-354X; CIOLFI, MARCO/0000-0003-4831-8053","CARBOTREES project (Climate change mitigation strategies in tree crops and forestry in Italy); Italian Ministry of Education, University and ResearchMinistero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR) [20085FL4E4]; EUEuropean Union (EU) [609550 FP4BATIW]","This research was funded by PRIN2010-11 ""CARBOTREES"" project (Climate change mitigation strategies in tree crops and forestry in Italy, national coordinator: R.

Recent field studies have provided detailed descriptions of the carbon cycle of mature tropical forests, but logged or secondary forests have received much less attention. Here, we report the first measures of total net primary productivity (NPP) and its allocation along a disturbance gradient from old-growth forests to moderately and heavily logged forests in Malaysian Borneo. We measured the main NPP components (woody, fine root and canopy NPP) in old-growth (n=6) and logged (n=5) 1ha forest plots. Overall, the total NPP did not differ between old-growth and logged forest (13.5 +/- 0.5 and 15.7 +/- 1.5 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1) respectively). However, logged forests allocated significantly higher fraction into woody NPP at the expense of the canopy NPP (42% and 48% into woody and canopy NPP, respectively, in old-growth forest vs 66% and 23% in logged forest). When controlling for local stand structure, NPP in logged forest stands was 41% higher, and woody NPP was 150% higher than in old-growth stands with similar basal area, but this was offset by structure effects (higher gap frequency and absence of large trees in logged forest). This pattern was not driven by species turnover: the average woody NPP of all species groups within logged forest (pioneers, nonpioneers, species unique to logged plots and species shared with old-growth plots) was similar. Hence, below a threshold of very heavy disturbance, logged forests can exhibit higher NPP and higher allocation to wood; such shifts in carbon cycling persist for decades after the logging event. Given that the majority of tropical forest biome has experienced some degree of logging, our results demonstrate that logging can cause substantial shifts in carbon production and allocation in tropical forests.","[Riutta, Terhi; Malhi, Yadvinder; Kho, Lip Khoon; Marthews, Toby R.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Kho, Lip Khoon] Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Trop Peat Res Inst, Biol Res Div, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; [Marthews, Toby R.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Huasco, Walter Huaraca] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Cuzco, Peru; [Khoo, MinSheng; Ewers, Robert M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England; [Tan, Sylvester] Smithsonian Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Turner, Edgar] Univ Cambridge, Univ Museum Zool, Insect Ecol Grp, Cambridge, England; [Reynolds, Glen] Royal Soc South East Asia Rainforest Res Partners, Danum Valley Field Ctr, Lahad Datu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Both, Sabine; Burslem, David F.

It is well known that root system inputs are the source of most grassland SOC, but the impact of grazing on partitioning of carbon allocation to root tissue production compared to fine root exudation is unclear. Given that different forms of root C have differing implications for SOC synthesis and decomposition, this represents a significant gap in knowledge. Root exudates should contribute to SOC primarily after microbial assimilation, and thus promote microbial contributions to SOC based on stabilization of microbial necromass, whereas root litter deposition contributes directly as plant-derived SOC following microbial decomposition. Here, we used insitu isotope pulse-chase methodology paired with plant and soil sampling to link plant carbon allocation patterns with SOC pools in replicated long-term grazing exclosures in subtropical pasture in Florida, USA. We quantified allocation of carbon to root tissue and measured root exudation across grazed and ungrazed plots and quantified lignin phenols to assess the relative contribution of microbial vs. plant products to total SOC. We found that grazing exclusion was associated with dramatically less overall belowground allocation, with lower root biomass, fine root exudates, and microbial biomass. Concurrently, grazed pasture contained greater total SOC, and a larger fraction of SOC that originated from plant tissue deposition, suggesting that higher root litter deposition under grazing promotes greater SOC. We conclude that grazing effects on SOC depend on root system biomass, a pattern that may generalize to other C4-dominated grasslands, especially in the subtropics. Improved understanding of ecological factors underlying root system biomass may be the key to forecasting SOC and optimizing grazing management to enhance SOC accumulation.","[Wilson, Chris H.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Strickland, Michael S.] Virginia Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Hutchings, Jack A.; Bianchi, Thomas S.] Univ Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Flory, S.

Although biotic interactions also underlie the biogeography of plants, the importance of plant-associated microbes is often overlooked when predicting ranges. In particular, symbiotic microbes may influence the distribution of plants that engage in strong interactions with them. We tested whether seedling response to inoculation by ectomycorrhizal fungi explains range size of trees. To examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between range size and response to inoculation, we also examined to what extent sympatry between host and fungi influenced this relationship. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Trees and fungi forming ectomycorrhizas. Methods: Using a dataset of 1,275 observations from 126 papers, we calculated mean biomass response (effect size) of 59 tree species to fungal inoculation. We extracted host range area from digitized maps of native distributions, and determined whether hosts were naturally sympatric with fungal species used as inoculum by searching herbaria databases with geospatially referenced data. Results: Tree species with seedling effect sizes falling above or below the average response tended to have small ranges and those with average responses, large ranges. Moreover, hosts inoculated with fungi whose ranges were allopatric to their own had higher biomass compared to those that were inoculated by sympatric fungi, suggesting that the extent of geographical overlap between trees and symbiotic fungi may attenuate the mutualism. Main conclusions: We demonstrate that mycorrhizas may underlie host biogeographical patterns at the continental scale. Our study is novel in the scope of species and scale tested, and points to a possible mechanism underlying this pattern related to the process of mutualism breakdown accruing over time at local geographical scales. For ectomycorrhizal tree species, performance may increase when exposed to fungal partners without a recent shared evolutionary history.","[Karst, Justine; Burns, Cole; Cale, Jonathan A.; La Fleche, Marc] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada; [Woods, Michaela; Rua, Megan A.] Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Lamit, Louis J.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Zabinski, Catherine] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Gehring, Catherine A.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Karst, J (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",karst@ualberta.ca,,"Karst, Justine/0000-0003-0497-1552; La Fleche, Marc/0000-0002-0070-3350",NSERC Industrial Research ChairCanada Research Chairs; Wright State University; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs,NSERC Industrial Research Chair; Wright State University; NSERC Discovery Grant; Canada Research Chair,,80,3,3,8,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

This study compared the effects on total net primary production (NPP) of first-rotation monoculture (34-year-old) plantations of Pinus taeda and Eucalyptus cloeziana and adjacent mountain miombo woodland in Mozambique. Total NPP was defined as the sum of annual carbon (C) sequestration in total aboveground tree biomass, belowground coarse root biomass, fine roots (<= 2 mm) and fine litterfall. Field measurements were conducted over one year in three 30m x 30m permanent sampling plots for each forest type and involved monitoring litterfall and fine root production using in-growth cores and stem diameter growth. Carbon increment in aboveground tree biomass and belowground coarse root biomass was determined using allometric equations, for P. taeda, E. cloeziana, and root-to-shoot ratio, for miombo woodland. Major findings were that total NPP in P. taeda (14.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and E. cloeziana (19.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) stands was significantly higher than in miombo woodland stands (5.9 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). These differences were largely attributable to lower basal area and presumably lower leaf biomass in miombo stands. There were several indications that the miombo stands studied had been degraded by selective cutting and other forms of use of forest resources. The difference in total NPP was also reflected in differences in patterns of C sequestration. Carbon in litterfall was the largest component of total NPP in miombo stands (41%), whereas C increment in aboveground tree biomass was the largest component of total NPP in plantation stands (44% in P. taeda and 51% in E. cloeziana). If the aim of forest management is to increase NPP and C sequestration in biomass of degraded miombo stands, our results indicate that replacement with plantations of P. taeda or E. cloeziana can be a useful management option, provided that the plantations are protected from anthropogenic disturbances, particularly fire. However, this aim needs to be balanced against other environmental aims and the socio-economic needs of local communities, since miombo woodland provides a wide range of unique economic, social and ecological benefits.

Bacteria interact with fungi in diverse ways, and endobacteria that reside inside fungal cells represent the most intimate interaction. The most significant bacterial endosymbionts that have been studied are associated with Mucoromycota and include two main groups: Burkholderia-related and Mycoplasmarelated endobacteria (MRE). Examples of Burkholderia-related endobacteria have been reported in the three Mucoromycota subphyla. By contrast, MRE have only been identified in Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina. This study aims to understand whether MRE dwell in Mortierellomycotina and, if so, to determine their impact on the fungal host. We carried out a large-scale screening of 394 Mortierellomycotina strains and employed a combination of microscopy, molecular phylogeny, next-generation sequencing and qPCR. We detected MRE in 12 strains. These endosymbionts represent novel bacterial phylotypes and show evidence of recombination. Their presence in Mortierellomycotina demonstrates that MRE occur within fungi across Mucoromycota and they may have lived in their common ancestor. We cured the fungus of its endosymbionts with antibiotics and observed improved biomass production in isogenic lines lacking MRE, demonstrating that these endobacteria impose some fitness costs to their fungal host. Here we provided the first functional insights into the lifestyle of MRE. Our findings indicate that MRE may be antagonistic to their fungal hosts, and adapted to a non-lethal parasitic lifestyle in the mycelium of Mucoromycota. However, context-dependent adaptive benefits to their host at minimal cost cannot not be excluded. Finally, we conclude that Mortierellomycotina represent attractive model organisms for exploring interactions between MRE and fungi.","[Desiro, Alessandro; Hao, Zhen; Liber, Julian A.; Benucci, Gian Maria Niccolo; Bonito, Gregory] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lowry, David; Roberson, Robert] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA","Desiro, A (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",adesiro@msu.edu; bonito@msu.edu,,"Benucci, Gian Maria Niccolo/0000-0003-1589-947X; Liber, Julian/0000-0002-9941-8268; Desiro, Alessandro/0000-0003-1347-2843",US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1737898]; Michigan State University AgBioResearch NIFA project [MICL02416]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1441728],"We thank M Chilvers, G Doehring, A Gryganskyi, A Miller, KO'Donnell, A Porras-Alfaro, N Vande Pol, AM Vazquez Catoni, TJ Torres-Cruz, X Wang, CBS-Knaw Fungal Biodiversity Centre and NRRL Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection for fungal strains, and A Fryday, G Nderitu Mwangi and D Ojwang for soil samples.

Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition represents a major global change driver; however, it is still debated whether the impacts of N deposition on soil microbial biomass and respiration are ecosystem-type dependent. Moreover, the extent of N deposition impacts on microbial composition remains unclear. Here we conduct a global metaanalysis using 1408 paired observations from 151 studies to evaluate the responses of soil microbial biomass, composition, and function to N addition. We show that nitrogen addition reduced total microbial biomass, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass, biomass carbon, and microbial respiration. Importantly, these negative effects increased with N application rate and experimental duration. Nitrogen addition reduced the fungi to bacteria ratio and the relative abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and gram-negative bacteria and increased gram-positive bacteria. Our structural equation modeling showed that the negative effects of N application on soil microbial abundance and composition led to reduced microbial respiration. The effects of N addition were consistent across global terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that atmospheric N deposition negatively affects soil microbial growth, composition, and function across all terrestrial ecosystems, with more pronounced effects with increasing N deposition rate and duration.","[Zhang, Tian'an; Ruan, Honghua] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

We determined the species identity, density, frequency and diversity of AMF spores from soil under the canopies of three native perennial grass species in rangelands of Argentina: 1) Poa ligularis and Nassella tenuis (preferred by livestock) and 2) Amelichloa ambigua (not preferred). For each species, plants either remained undefoliated or were defoliated twice to a 5 cm stubble height during the growing season. Most active meristems remained on the plants after defoliations. AMF communities were sampled prior to (i.e., 48 soil samples) and following (i.e., 72 soil samples) each defoliation event. Spores were grouped in 15 moiphospecies. Density, richness and diversity of AMF spores were not influenced by defoliation, and species richness and diversity of AMF were similar among species. Total spore density was greatest for P. ligularis at the sampling prior to defoliation, but this difference did not persist following the defoliation events. The most abundant AMF families were: Acaulosporaceae, Diversisporaceae and Glomeraceae. These results demonstrate that responses of the studied variables were insensitive to the defoliation treatments, and were largely unaffected by the studied grass species.","[Lis Ambrosino, Mariela] Univ Nacl La Pampa, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, CONICET, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Republ Argentina, RA-6300 Santa Rosa, Provincia De La, Argentina; [Noemi Cabello, Marta] UNLP, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Inst Bot Spegazzini, Comis Invest Cient Provincia Buenos Aires,CIC, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Alberto Busso, Carlos; Soledad Ithurrart, Leticia] Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, Ctr Recursos Nat Renovables Zona Semiarida, CERZOS,Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Silvana Velazquez, Maria] UNLP, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, CONICET, Inst Bot Spegazzini, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Alejandra Torres, Yanina] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, CIC, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Solange Cardillo, Daniela] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CERZOS, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Alberto Montenegro, Oscar; Giorgetti, Hugo; Rodriguez, Gustavo] Minist Asuntos Agr, Chacra Expt Patagones, RA-8504 Carmen De Patagones, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Busso, CA (reprint author), Univ Nacl Sur, CONICET, Ctr Recursos Nat Renovables Zona Semiarida, CERZOS,Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",marielalisambrosino@yahoo.com.ar; mcabello@ymail.com; carlosbusso1@gmail.com; mariasilvanavelazquez@gmail.com; yatorres@criba.edu.ar; danicardillo@yahoo.com; leticia.ithurrart@uns.edu.ar; chacraexpp@gmail.com; chacraexpp@gmail.com; chacraexpp@gmail.com,,,Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS) [PGI 24/A196]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas de la Republica Argentina (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 00211]; Comision de Investigaciones Cientificas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (CIC),"We thank Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS, PGI 24/A196), the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas de la Republica Argentina (CONICET, PIP 00211) and the Comision de Investigaciones Cientificas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (CIC) for providing financial support to C.A.B and M.N.C.

Drought-induced tree mortality is expected to increase globally due to climate change, with profound implications for forest composition, function and global climate feedbacks. How drought is experienced by different species is thought to depend fundamentally on where they access water vertically below-ground, but this remains untracked so far due to the difficulty of measuring water availability at depths at which plants access water (few to several tens of metres), the broad temporal scales at which droughts at those depths unfold (seasonal to decadal), and the difficulty in linking these patterns to forest-wide species-specific demographic responses. 2. We address this problem through a new eco-hydrological framework: we used a hydrological model to estimate below-ground water availability by depth over a period of two decades that included a multi-year drought. Given this water availability scenario and 20year long-records of species-specific growth patterns, we inversely estimated the relative depths at which 12 common species in the forest accessed water via a model of water stress. Finally, we tested whether our estimates of species relative uptake depths predicted mortality in the multi-year drought. 3. The hydrological model revealed clear below-ground niches as precipitation was decoupled from water availability by depth at multi-annual scale. Species partitioned the hydrological niche by diverging in their uptake depths and so in the same forest stand, different species experienced very different drought patterns, resulting in clear differences in species-specific growth. Finally, species relative water uptake depths predicted species mortality patterns after the multi-year drought. Species that our method ranked as relying on deeper water were the ones that had suffered from greater mortality, as the zone from which they access water took longer to recharge after depletion. 4. Synthesis. This research changes our understanding of how hydrological niches operate for trees, with a trade-off between realized growth potential and survival under drought with decadal scale return time. The eco-hydrological framework highlights the importance of species-specific below-ground strategies in predicting forest response to drought. Applying this framework more broadly may help us better understand species coexistence in diverse forest communities and improve mechanistic predictions of forests productivity and compositional change under future climate.","[Chitra-Tarak, Rutuja; Dattaraja, Handanakere S.; Suresh, Hebbalalu S.; Sukumar, Raman] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Chitra-Tarak, Rutuja; Ruiz, Laurent; Kumar, M.

Here, we analyzed and compared the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities and soil characteristics from the root zone of invasive and native plants, and tested how these AMF communities affect the development of four invasive plant species (Cryptostegia madagascariensis, Parkinsonia aculeata, Prosopis juliflora, and Sesbania virgata). Our field sampling revealed that AMF diversity and frequency of the Order Diversisporales were positively correlated with the root zone of the native plants, whereas AMF dominance and frequency of the Order Glomerales were positively correlated with the root zone of invasive plants. We grew the invasive plants in soil inoculated with AMF species from the root zone of invasive (I (changed)) and native (I (unaltered)) plant species. We also performed a third treatment with sterilized soil inoculum (control). We examined the effects of these three AMF inoculums on plant dry biomass, root colonization, plant phosphorous concentration, and plant responsiveness to mycorrhizas. We found that I (unaltered) and I (changed) promoted the growth of all invasive plants and led to a higher plant dry biomass, mycorrhizal colonization, and P uptake than control, but I (changed) showed better results on these variables than I (unaltered). For plant responsiveness to mycorrhizas and fungal inoculum effect on plant P concentration, we found positive feedback between changed-AMF community (I (changed)) and three of the studied invasive plants: C. madagascariensis, P. aculeata, and S. virgata.","[Feitosa de Souza, Tancredo Augusto; de Andrade, Leonaldo Alves] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agr Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil; [Freitas, Helena] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Sandim, Aline da Silva] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Soil & Environm Resources, Coll Agr Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil","de Souza, TAF (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agr Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil.",tancredo_agro@hotmail.com,,"Souza, Tancredo/0000-0001-8729-5478",,,,69,0,0,6,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

We collected soils across an elevational (788-1940 m) gradient, encompassing both abiotic (soil chemistry) and biotic (vegetation community) gradients, at eight locations in the southern Appalachian Mountains of southwestern North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. We measured soil chemistry (total N, C, extractable PO4, soil pH, cation exchange capacity [ECEC], percent base saturation [% BS]) and dissected soil fungal communities using ITS2 metabarcode Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Total soil N, C, PO4, % BS, and pH increased with elevation and plateaued at approximately 1400 m, whereas ECEC linearly increased and C/N decreased with elevation. Fungal communities differed among locations and were correlated with all chemical variables, except PO4, whereas OTU richness increased with total N. Several ecological guilds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae, saprotrophs, plant pathogens) differed in abundance among locations; specifically, saprotroph abundance, primarily attributable to genus Mortierella, was positively correlated with elevation. Ectomycorrhizae declined with total N and soil pH and increased with total C and PO4 where plant pathogens increased with total N and decreased with total C. Our results demonstrate significant turnover in taxonomic and functional fungal groups across elevational gradients which facilitate future predictions on forest ecosystem change in the southern Appalachians as nitrogen deposition rates increase and regional temperature and precipitation regimes shift.","[Veach, Allison M.; Jumpponen, Ari] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Veach, Allison M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Stokes, C.

However, its magnitude remains highly uncertain at the global scale. Here we apply an emergent constraint approach that integrates CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) with 33 field T/ET measurements to re-estimate the global T/ET value. Our observational constraint strongly increases the original ESM estimates (0.41 +/- 0.11) and greatly alleviates intermodel discrepancy, which leads to a new global T/ET estimate of 0.62 +/- 0.06. For all the ESMs, the leaf area index is identified as the primary driver of spatial variations of T/ET, but to correct its bias generates a larger T/ET underestimation than the original ESM output. We present evidence that the ESM underestimation of T/ET is, instead, attributable to inaccurate representation of canopy light use, interception loss and root water uptake processes in the ESMs. These processes should be prioritized to reduce model uncertainties in the global hydrological cycle.","[Lian, Xu; Piao, Shilong; Li, Yue; Zeng, Zhenzhong; Wang, Xuhui; Peng, Shushi; Yang, Hui] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Wang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Wang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Ciais, Philippe; Ottle, Catherine] CEA CNRS UVSQ, LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [McVicar, Tim R.; Zhang, Yongqiang] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McVicar, Tim R.] Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yang, Yuting] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Piao, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Piao, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn,"YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008; OTTLE, Catherine/K-3895-2012; Huntingford, Christopher/A-4307-2008; Li, Yue/M-8824-2019; Yang, Yuting/C-8527-2014; Zeng, Zhenzhong/A-2212-2019; PENG, Shushi/J-4779-2014","YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323; OTTLE, Catherine/0000-0003-1304-6414; Huntingford, Christopher/0000-0002-5941-7770; Li, Yue/0000-0003-2997-6368; Yang, Yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; Zeng, Zhenzhong/0000-0001-6851-2756; McVicar, Tim/0000-0002-0877-8285; PENG, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41561134016, 41530528]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B14001]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology National Capability fund in the UK","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41561134016 and 41530528), the 111 Project (B14001) and the National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China.

While the importance of land-use legacies in modulating these processes have been increasingly recognised, evidence of former land-use mediated climate-growth relationships remain rare. We analysed how differences in former land-use (i.e. forest continuity) affect the growth response of European beech to climate extremes. Here, using dendrochronological and fine root data, we show that ancient forests (forests with a long forest continuity) and recent forests (forests afforested on former farmland) clearly differ with regard to climate-growth relationships. We found that sensitivity to climatic extremes was lower for trees growing in ancient forests, as reflected by significantly lower growth reductions during adverse climatic conditions. Fine root morphology also differed significantly between the former land-use types: on average, trees with high specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) and low root tissue density (RTD) were associated with recent forests, whereas the opposite traits were characteristic of ancient forests. Moreover, we found that trees of ancient forests hold a larger fine root system than trees of recent forests. Our results demonstrate that land-use legacy-mediated modifications in the size and morphology of the fine root system act as a mechanism in regulating drought resistance of beech, emphasising the need to consider the 'ecological memory' of forests when assessing or predicting the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to global environmental change.","[Mausolf, Katharina; Haerdtle, Werner; Jansen, Kirstin; Delory, Benjamin M.; Temperton, Vicky M.; Fichtner, Andreas] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci Plant Ecol & E, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, Tharandt, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Mausolf, K (reprint author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",katharina.mausolf@leuphana.de,"von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015","von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Temperton, Vicky/0000-0003-0543-4521",German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) [AZ20013/279],"We thank the local forest owners for allowing us to take increment cores and are grateful to Mechthild Stange, Thomas Niemeyer and Rafael Weidlich for assisting with fine root and soil analyses.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the response of delta N-15 to water availability differs between C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways. We investigated plant delta N-15 of coexisting C3 and C4 species as a function of aridity along a 3200 km aridity gradient across the arid and semi-arid grasslands of northern China. Aridity was positively correlated with plant delta N-15 values in both C3 and C4 plants and also in the entire plant community, whereas soil bulk delta N-15 values increased first and then decreased along the aridity gradient. The N uptake by C4 plants appeared to be more affected by competition pressure of neighboring plants and soil microbes than for C3 plants along the transect. The decoupled relationship between plant and soil delta N-15 values indicated that variations in vegetation and soil delta N-15 values were driven by differential biogeochemical processes, while different soil N sources were used for plant growth along the climatic gradient. The advantage of C3 plants in the use of N may counteract the competitive advantage that C4 plants have over C3 plants due to their higher water use efficiency under drier conditions. These findings can help understand why C4 plants do not completely replace C3 plants in drier environments despite their higher water use efficiency.","[Luo, Wentao; Wang, Xiaoguang; Wang, Zhengwen; Lu, Xiao-Tao; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoguang] Dalian Minzu Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China; [Sardans, Jordi; Penuelas, Josep] UAB, CSIC, CREAF, Global Ecol Unit, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Sardans, Jordi; Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles (18193, Catalonia, Spain; [Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney Inst Agr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Lu, XT (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",lvxiaotao@iae.ac.cn,"Dijkstra, Feike A/H-2182-2012; Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016; Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Luo, Wentao/J-7634-2015","Dijkstra, Feike A/0000-0002-6191-6018; Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; Luo, Wentao/0000-0002-9543-1123","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2016YFC0500601, 2016YFC0500700, 2015CB150802]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41600302, 3231470505, 41273094]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010403]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2014174]; Key Research Program from CAS [KFZD-SW-305-002]; European Research Council Synergy grantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-SyG-2013-610028]; Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2013-48074-P]; Catalan Government [SGR 2014-274]","We thank all members of the Field Expedition Team from the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for assistance with the collection of the field data.

To better understand the role of drought and low Ca/Mg quotients in plant adaptation to serpentine soil, we compared the effects of different Ca/Mg quotients (0.18, 2 and 4) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-imposed osmotic stress on growth and Ca and Mg uptake and translocation between two Iranian serpentine endemic plant species, the Ni-hyperaccumulator Alyssum inflatum, and the non-accumulator Fortuynia garcinii. Seedlings were grown in modified Hoagland's solution with varying Ca/Mg molar quotients (0.18, 2 and 4) and then exposed to PEG (209.7 g L-1) for 8 days. In both species, shoot dry weight was highest at the highest Ca/Mg quotient (4). However, at this Ca/Mg quotient A. inflatum suffered much more from PEG-induced drought (84% mortality and severe growth inhibition in the survivors), compared with the lower Ca/Mg quotients (< 20% mortality and no significant growth inhibition). In F. garcinii, the PEG*Ca/Mg interaction was not significant. Shoot Ca concentrations and translocation factors in A. inflatum were higher than in F. garcinii in all the treatments. In both species the Mg translocation factor was highest at the highest Ca/Mg quotient (4) in the PEG treatment. We conclude that a high Ca/Mg quotient stimulated growth in the absence of PEG in both species, but strongly decreased survival and growth in combination with PEG in A. inflatum. In F. garcinii root dry weight and the root to shoot dry weight ratio were significantly decreased at the highest Ca/Mg quotient (4), particularly after PEG treatment, suggesting that F. garcinii also may require a moderate or low Ca/Mg quotient to cope with natural drought.","[Salehi-Eskandari, Behrooz; Ghaderian, Seyed Majid] Univ Isfahan, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran; [Salehi-Eskandari, Behrooz] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Biol, Tehran 193953697, Iran; [Schat, Henk] Vrije Univ, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Ecol Sci, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Salehi-Eskandari, B (reprint author), Univ Isfahan, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran.",ghaderian@sci.ui.ac.ir,"Schat, Henk/AAB-8723-2019",,Plant Antioxidants Center of Excellence (PACE) University of Isfahan,We would like to thank the Graduate School of University of Isfahan for providing research facilities.

Densities of the most abundant endogeic earthworm, Diplocardia spp., were positively correlated with the previous-year production of leaf litter (r = 0.66, P = 0.02) and fine roots (r = 0.62, P = 0.03); and with the leaf-litter production (r = 0.63, P = 0.03) and fine root production (r = 0.59, P = 0.05) two years before earthworms were sampled. Within two years after the CO2 fumigation ceased, the C-13/C-12 ratio increased in leaf litter (P = 0.01) and in fine roots (P = 0.05), showing an ecosystem legacy effect on soil C inputs. However, the C isotopic composition of soil, endogeic earthworms and casts had not changed the two years after the CO2 fumigation ended. The positive response of earthworms to increased root NPP, caused by elevated [CO2], is consistent with the increased soil aggregate formation and increased soil C at the ORNL FACE in the e[CO2] treatment.","[Sanchez-de Leon, Yaniria; Wise, David H.; Gonzalez-Meler, Miguel A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, M-C 066,845 West Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Sanchez-de Leon, Yaniria] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Agroenvironm Sci, Call Box 9000, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA; [Wise, David H.] Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, 2121 West Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Lugo-Perez, Javier] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Nat Sci, POB 2500, Utuado, IL 00641 USA; [Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, One Bethel Valley Rd,Bldg 2040,MS-6301, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, One Bethel Valley Rd,Bldg 2040,MS-6301, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [James, Samuel W.] Univ Iowa, Dept Biol, 143 Biol Bldg,129 E Jefferson St, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Sanchez-de Leon, Y (reprint author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Agroenvironm Sci, Call Box 9000, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA.",yaniria.sanchez@upr.edu; javier.lugo3@upr.edu,"Wise, David./J-6111-2019","Wise, David./0000-0003-4072-0080","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919276]; University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC); UIC Stable Isotope Laboratory; University of Puerto Rico at Utuado (UPRU); University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez; United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant #DEB-0919276), the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the UIC Stable Isotope Laboratory, the University of Puerto Rico at Utuado (UPRU) and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.

In the present study, soil and root fungal communities in a fine-scale grassland were determined using high through-put sequencing, and our aims are to evaluate the relative importance of plant composition, soil elements and space factors on these two fungal communities. Our results showed that (1) fungal communities in soil and plant roots were distinct from each other, and OTU richness in soil was significantly higher than that in plant roots; (2) biomass of perennial rhizome grass, soil carbon content, and soil C/P ratio were key drivers for both soil and root fungal community; (3) dissimilarity of the soil fungal community significantly correlated with spatial distance, while no significant correlations were found between dissimilarity of root-associated fungal community and spatial distance. These results suggest the different spatial patterns of root and soil fungal communities which may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms maintaining root and soil fungal communities at small scales in this grassland ecosystem.","[Li, Shan; Shakoor, Abdul; Zhang, Naili; Liang, Yu; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Li, Shan; Shakoor, Abdul] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wubet, Tesfaye] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str, D-06120 Halle, Salle, Germany; [Wubet, Tesfaye] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Plate 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Liang, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",coolrain@ibcas.ac.cn,"Wubet, Tesfaye/C-6241-2012","Wubet, Tesfaye/0000-0001-8572-4486","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470565, 31170495]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB0203]; National Science and Technology Ministry Major Project [2017YFA0605103]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470565 and 31170495), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDPB0203), and National Science and Technology Ministry Major Project (2017YFA0605103).

To which extent fungal grazers modify the composition of complex fungal communities, however, remains little explored. We therefore addressed the question how micro arthropods influence rhizospheric fungal communities and compared the effects of microarthropods among functional guilds of fungi as well as with those of the plant's mycorrhizal type, the key bottom up factor structuring microbial communities in the rhizosphere. In a greenhouse experiment, we cultivated Tripleurospermum inodorum (Asteraceae), a host plant for arbuscular mycorrhizal, and Salix caprea, an ectomycorrhizal host, or both hosts together in soil from a locality where both plants coexist. The defaunated soil contained its native fungal community while microarthropods were either left absent or re-introduced in two experimental treatments, combined in a factorial design with the three host plant treatments. While only plant combination influenced the composition of the fungal communities by the main functional guilds (arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi, endophytes, plant pathogens and saprotrophs), microarthropod presence had a significant effect on their taxonomic composition. Of the more abundant fungal genera (over 1% community share), microarthropods approximately doubled the relative abundances of five (Cadophora, Exophiala, Truncatella, Meliniomyces, Trichosporon), and significantly increased the absolute abundances of four. In contrast, only one genus (Inocybe) was significantly suppressed by the microarthropods. The genera belonged to all the main functional guilds except arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tolerance to mechanical disturbance, dispersion in soil or response to low intensity grazing are suggested as mechanisms behind the observed stimulation of some fungal taxa.","[Janouskova, Martina; Kohout, Petr; Doubkova, Pavia; Vosolsobe, Stanislav; Rydlova, Jana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dept Mycorrhizal Symbioses, Zdmek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Kohout, Petr; Vosolsobe, Stanislav] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Expt Plant Biol, Fac Sci, Vinicna 5, CR-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Kohout, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Lab Environm Microbiol, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic; [Moradi, Jabbar; Frouz, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic","Janouskova, M (reprint author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dept Mycorrhizal Symbioses, Zdmek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",martina.janouskova@ibot.cas.cz,"Moradi, Jabbar/P-6167-2019; Kohout, Petr/B-4975-2011; Vosolsobe, Stanislav/H-9104-2017; Janouskova, Martina/H-1595-2014","Moradi, Jabbar/0000-0002-1370-2103; Kohout, Petr/0000-0002-3985-2310; Vosolsobe, Stanislav/0000-0002-1180-3250; Janouskova, Martina/0000-0002-6041-8068",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GA13-103775]; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Charles University in Prague [NPUi LO1417],This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation [grant No. GA13-103775]; the long-term research development project of Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences [grant No. RVO 67985939]; and the Charles University in Prague [grant No. NPUi LO1417 MSMT - PK and SV].,,80,2,2,2,33,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

In addition to traditional civil engineering measures, a potential solution for this problem is the application of soil bioengineering techniques. The mechanical reinforcement effect of plant roots is one of the major contributions of vegetation to the mitigation of shallow landslides. Given the lack of information on the mechanical properties of common Hyrcanian forest species, the present study assessed the root strength of 10 common species of this forest. Eight tree species occurring in natural regeneration sites (Carpinus betulus, Fagus orientalis, Parrotia persica and Quercus castaneifolia) and plantations (Ater yelutinum, Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus excelsior and Picea abies) and two shrub species (Crataegus microphylla and Mespilus germanica) were selected. Fresh roots were collected and mechanical tests were carried out on 487 root samples. The ranges of root diameter, tensile force, and root resistance were 0.29-5.90 mm, 3.80-487.20 N, and 2.41-224.35 MPa, respectively. Tzvo different algorithms, including the nonlinear least square method and log-transformation, were used to obtain power regressions for diameter-force and diameter-resistance relationships. The results of the two algorithms were compared statistically to choose the optimal approach for soil bioengineering applications. The nonlinear least square method resulted in lower Akaike information criteria and higher adjusted R-2 values for all species, which means that this model can more efficiently predict tensile force and resistance based on root diameter. Log-transformation regressions generally underestimate tensile force and resistance. Significant differences were found among mean root tensile force (ANCOVA; F=37.36, p<0.001) and resistance (ANCOVA; F=34.87, p<0.001) of different species. Also, root diameter was significant as a covariate factor in tensile force (F=1453.77, p<0. 001) and resistance (F=274.26, p<0.001). Shrub species and trees in natural regeneration sites had higher tensile forceand resistance values, while trees from plantation stands had lower values. The results of this study contribute to the knowledge on the root force and resistance characteristics of several shrub and free species of the Hyrcanian forest and can be used in evaluating the efficiency of different species for bioengineering purposes.","[Abdi, Ehsan] Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry, POB 31585-4314, Karaj, Iran","Abdi, E (reprint author), Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry, POB 31585-4314, Karaj, Iran.",abdie@ut.ac.ir,"Abdi, Ehsan/N-3589-2017","Abdi, Ehsan/0000-0002-3382-7683",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [93022486],"The author would like to acknowledge the financial support of the ""Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)"" under the project number 93022486.

Here, we conducted a removal experiment to examine how AMF suppression and plant functional group (PFG) removal affect above-ground productivity and community composition in a grassland, and to determine whether AMF alter the compensation ability of the remaining plants. LocationInner Mongolian grassland, China. MethodsWe suppressed AMF activities by applying Topsin((R))-M as a soil drench and selectively removed PFGs to give three treatments (no removal, removal of C-3 grasses and removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs). We then measured various plant, soil and AMF parameters for each treatment combination. ResultsThe addition of Topsin-M effectively reduced mycorrhizal root colonization across all of the PFG removal treatments. Furthermore, above-ground productivity was significantly impacted by both the presence of AMF and the removal of PFGs. When C-3 grasses were removed, neither C-4 grasses nor forbs compensated for the biomass decline, and the presence of AMF did not affect their compensation ability. Conversely, C-3 grasses could completely compensate for the removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs, but the presence of AMF reduced their compensation ability. The removal of both C-4 grasses and forbs dramatically increased the shoot P content of C-3 grasses but AMF slightly decreased this. In contrast, AMF significantly increased the plant P content of C-4 grasses and forbs across all three PFG removal treatments. ConclusionOur results highlight the importance of AMF in structuring natural above-ground productivity under various biodiversity loss scenarios, and indicate that AMF will be able to modify vegetation dynamics in response to the future loss of plant diversity.","[Yang, Xin; Guo, Yanping; Zhang, Yingjun] China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yue] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jishan] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Paratacultural Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Zhang, YJ (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangyj@cau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31472137]; Major State Basic Research Development Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB138805]; Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS-34],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31472137; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2014CB138805; Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System (CARS-34)",,57,0,0,4,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

In this work, the variation of mycorrhization parameters (mycorrhizal rate, colonization intensity, arbuscular and vesicular content) are studied according to the seasonal and bioclimates variation, in order to understand the best conditions for the establishment of the symbiosis in this species. The physicochemical properties of soils (pH, electric conductivity, organic matter and total limestone amount) were determined for five sampling sites. Spores harvested fungi from the rhizosphere area were morphologically identified, and the specific diversity of mycorrhizal fungi was measured in the different sites. Microscopic observations of the roots revealed the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The frequency of mycorrhization and the intensity of colonization are higher in the arid bioclimate, characterized by alkaline soils, low organic matter with relatively low levels of calcium carbonates. A total of 19 species of mycorrhizal fungi has been isolated. This set is dominated by two families (Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae) but the most common genus is Gigaspora. Analysis of Variance (bioclimate factor and bioclimate x season interaction) showed a very significant difference for the frequency of mycorrhization and highly significant difference for soil variables. The Fisher (LSD) test revealed the presence of heterogeneous groups for all studied parameters except for the vesicle amount. PCA, as well, showed an aridity gradient on the first axis and a thermic gradient on the second one.","[Bouabdelli, Zahra; Belhadj, Safia] Univ Ziane Achour Djelfa, Fac Sci Nat & Vie, Dept Agron, Route Moudjebara, Djelfa 17000, Algeria; [Smail-Saadoun, Noria] Univ Mouloud Mammeri Tizi Ouzou, Lab Ressources Nat, Route Hasnaoua, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria; [Mevy, Jean Philippe; Gauquelin, Thierry] Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr St Charles, Equipe Diversite & Fonctionnement Mol Ecosyst, IMBE,IRD 237,UMR CNRS 7263, Marseille, France; [Notonnier, Roger; Tonetto, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, Ctr Marseille, Plateforme Rech Analyt Technol & Imagerie PRATIM, Federat Sci Chim Marseille FR 1739,CNRS, F-13000 Marseille, France; [Ortas, Ibrahim] Univ Cukurova, Fac Agr, Dept Soil & Plant Nutr, Adana, Turkey","Bouabdelli, Z (reprint author), Univ Ziane Achour Djelfa, Fac Sci Nat & Vie, Dept Agron, Route Moudjebara, Djelfa 17000, Algeria.",bouabdelli_z@yahoo.fr; belhadjsafia@yahoo.fr; noria.saadoun@gmail.com; jean-philippe.mevy@imbe.fr; roger.notonier@univ-amu.fr; alain.tonetto@univ-amu.fr; iortas@cu.edu.tr; thierry.gauquelin@imbe.fr,"ortas, ibrahim/D-3971-2012","ortas, ibrahim/0000-0003-4496-3960",,,,58,0,0,2,14,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

In the drier, western interior of North America, however, the spread of tree-of-heaven appears to be limited to areas where supplemental water is available such as in urban areas or in riparian environments. To explore the effect of summer drought on tree-of-heaven seedlings and to look for genetic variation for drought tolerance among half-sibling families, we collected samaras from 12 open-pollinated mother trees growing in Utah County, Utah, and measured the samaras' area, maximum width, length, and weight. We then planted 10 samaras per mother tree into 10-cm pots in the greenhouse, measured the height of each resulting seedling, and randomly assigned them to a watering treatment (well-watered or droughted) that lasted for 20 wk. We examined the relationship between tree-of-heaven samara size parameters and seedling height before we started our drought treatment and for additional growth parameters after our drought treatment. Several growth parameters (relative growth, final height, final dry mass, final stem dry mass, final dry root mass, and root-to-shoot ratios) were reduced significantly by drought but differed among seedlings from different mothers only for relative growth. There was no genetic variation for drought tolerance observed for any of the growth parameters. These results suggest that tree-of-heaven seedlings from this part of western North America are uniformly and negatively affected by drought and may explain the relative dearth of tree-of-heaven in the interior West.","[Stevens, Michael T.; Roush, Caleb D.; Chaney, Lindsay] Utah Valley Univ, Dept Biol, 800 W Univ Pkwy, Orem, UT 84058 USA; [Chaney, Lindsay] Snow Coll, Dept Biol Sci, 150 Coll Ave, Ephraim, UT 84627 USA","Stevens, MT (reprint author), Utah Valley Univ, Dept Biol, 800 W Univ Pkwy, Orem, UT 84058 USA.",michael.stevens@uvu.edu,,"Stevens, Michael/0000-0003-3267-2285","Undergraduate Research, Scholarly, and Creative Activities program through the Office of Engaged Learning at Utah Valley University","We thank Nick Read, Utah Valley University's greenhouse manager, for offering advice on propagation and for caring for the experimental seedlings.

Predicting the structure and dynamics of communities is difficult. Approaches linking functional traits to niche boundaries, species co-occurrence and demography are promising, but have so far had limited success. 2. We hypothesized that predictability in community ecology could be improved by incorporating more accurate measures of fine-scale environmental heterogeneity and the context-dependent function of traits. We tested these hypotheses using long term whole-community demography data from an alpine plant community in Colorado. 3. Species distributions along microenvironmental gradients covaried with traits important for below-ground processes. Positive associations between species distributions across life stages could not be explained by abiotic microenvironment alone, consistent with facilitative processes. Rates of growth, survival, fecundity and recruitment were predicted by the direct and interactive effects of trait, microenvironment, macroenvironment and neighbourhood axes. 4. Synthesis. Context-dependent interactions between multiple traits and microenvironmental axes are needed to predict fine-scale community structure and dynamics.","[Blonder, Benjamin] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Blonder, Benjamin; Kapas, Rozalia E.; Graae, Bente J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Blonder, Benjamin; Kapas, Rozalia E.; Dalton, Rebecca M.; Graae, Bente J.; Heiling, Jacob M.; Opedal, Oystein H.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Blonder, Benjamin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Dalton, Rebecca M.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Univ Program Ecol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Heiling, Jacob M.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, David Clark Labs, Raleigh, NC USA; [Opedal, Oystein H.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway","Blonder, B (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.; Blonder, B (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway.; Blonder, B (reprint author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.; Blonder, B (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",bblonder@gmail.com,"Heiling, Jacob/J-1366-2014; Opedal, Oystein H./H-7137-2019","Heiling, Jacob/0000-0002-3654-1701; Opedal, Oystein H./0000-0002-7841-6933","Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of Norway [250233, 223257]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M019160/]","Norwegian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: KLIMAFORSK # 250233 and 223257; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/M019160/",,60,8,9,6,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The importance of symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation in shaping the coupled nitrogen-carbon cycle is now known for most humid terrestrial ecosystems. However, whether N-2 fixation can play a key role in the nitrogen and carbon budget of water-limited and seasonally dry ecosystems remains a mystery. 2. The maintenance of metabolically and physiologically costly symbiotic fixation in water-limited environments is highly complex. These costs are particularly high during the first developmental season, when allocation to deep rooting and drought resistance mechanisms is essential for seedling survival of prolonged seasonal drought. 3. We, therefore, evaluated how drought-adapted legume species change their allocation to symbiotic nitrogen fixation as a function of soil nitrogen availability. We tested this on seedlings of a suite of four common Mediterranean legume shrubs with a strong seasonal behaviour, which we grew under controlled nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities. We asked: (1) Do species differ in their investment and regulation of nitrogen fixation? (2) Is fixation regulated via plant allocation to nodules, fixation rate or both? and (3) Does phosphorus availability limit symbiotic nitrogen fixation? 4. All Mediterranean perennial legumes in the experiment established and grew, nodulated, and fixed nitrogen, even under severe nitrogen limitation. The four species reacted similarly to nitrogen supply, by strongly downregulating fixation through both decreased nodulation and lower rate of fixation. However, we found a significant interspecific difference in fixation (both nodulation and rate), biomass production and growth rate. Our experimental species presented a range of fixation investment strategies corresponding to life-history and resource partitioning patterns. Phosphorus limitation had a minor influence on both fixation and plant growth. 5. Synthesis. The high physiological cost of symbiotic fixation imposes the need to tightly regulate fixation in perennial legumes coping with severe water stress. Control of fixation allows legume species to colonize recently disturbed nitrogen-deficient habitats, cope with grazing, survive long seasonal droughts and recover nitrogen fixation later in the wet season, and survive over time by reducing nitrogen inputs to the ecosystem.","[Dovrat, Guy; Masci, Tania; Bakhshian, Hila; Sheffer, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Rehovot, Israel; [Gati, Einav Mayzlish; Golan, Sivan] ARO, IGB, Volcani Ctr, Bet Dagan, Israel","Dovrat, G; Sheffer, E (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Rehovot, Israel.",dovratg@bgu.ac.il; efrat.sheffer@mail.huji.ac.il,,,Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [508/16],"Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 508/16",,67,1,1,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Fungi are both agents of disease and mutualistic partners of plants. Previous studies have tested the effects of abiotic or biotic factors on plant-associated fungal communities in isolation. However, to better understand patterns of plant-fungal associations, the combined effects of abiotic and biotic drivers across environmental gradients may be important. 2. We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, soil moisture, vegetation cover and distance to host plant on the occurrence and abundance of fungi associated with Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We did this by DNA metabarcoding 288 soil samples taken across and beyond the elevation range of P. cembra (i.e. 1,850-2,250m a.s.l.) in two valleys in the Swiss Alps. We modelled the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on DNA read abundance of pathogenic and mutualistic fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with P. cembra. We also tested whether abiotic and biotic factors differentially affected fungi of varying host specificity (i.e. host generalists, host specialists). 3. We found that the occurrences of both host generalist and specialist fungi exceeded the current elevational range of their host plant. Abiotic factors had only minor effects on the abundances of all fungal OTUs. However, we found positive effects of the host plant on the abundance of a host specialist pathogenic fungus, providing support for a Janzen-Connell effect of high pathogen accumulation close to conspecific host plants. We also found a positive response to the host plant in a specialist ectomycorrhizal fungus, suggesting an inverse Janzen-Connell effect. 4. Synthesis. Our findings imply that negative distance dependence shapes not only the distribution of host-specific fungal pathogens, but also host-specific fungal mutualists. We conclude that the occurrence of both pathogenic and mutualistic fungi beyond the current elevational range of host plants may determine their potential range shifts under projected climate warming.","[Merges, Dominik; Balint, Miklos; Schmitt, Imke; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin; Neuschulz, Eike Lena] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Merges, Dominik; Schmitt, Imke; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Biol Sci, Frankfurt, Germany","Merges, D (reprint author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.; Merges, D (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Biol Sci, Frankfurt, Germany.",mergesd01@gmail.com,"Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019; Merges, Dominik/Y-1730-2019","Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Neuschulz, Eike Lena/0000-0001-7526-2580",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [NE 1863/2-1],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: NE 1863/2-1",,80,8,9,14,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, there is little information available on AMF community structures of in natural As-contaminated soils and their changing pattern along soil As concentration gradient, as well as their best predictor of environmental variables. In this study, soil samples from four sites with different As concentrations in Hunan Province of China were collected. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate AMF community in the rhizosphere soils of P. vittata. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and mantel tests were used to determine the significance of environmental variables that may affect AMF community composition. A total of 95 OTUs were identified, with Glomeraceae, Gigasporaceae, Acaulosporaceae, and Scutellosporaceae shared by all sampling sites. Among Glomeraceae and Glomus were the dominant family and genus, respectively. The highest value of Shannon index was found when As concentration in soil was 147.92 mg/kg (site 2, p < 0.05). RDA and mantel tests indicated that As concentrations in fronds of P. vittata (As-F) and bioconcentration factors (BCF) were significantly related to the succession of AMF community. As-F was the key environmental variable that can predict the shifts of AMF community structures in the rhizosphere of P. vittata at As-contaminated sites. This research offers preliminary insight into AMF communities in the rhizosphere of P. vittata, which is of great help toward predicting and managing microbiome for the better agroecosystem outcomes.","[Huang, Zhi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Environm Microbiol, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fei] China CO OP, Nanjing Inst Comprehens Utilizat Wild Plants, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hua, Jianfeng] Jiangsu Prov & Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hua, Jianfeng; Ma, Zuohao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Hua, JF (reprint author), Jiangsu Prov & Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Hua, JF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jfhua2009@gmail.com,,,"State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture [Y412201436]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41671267, 41430859]; CAS Strategic Priority Research Program Grant [XDB15020103]; National Key R D Program [2016YFD0200306]; National Basic Research Program (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954500]; Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesKnowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [ISSASIP1639]","This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture (Y412201436), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 41671267, 41430859), the CAS Strategic Priority Research Program Grant (XDB15020103), National Key R& D Program (2016YFD0200306), National Basic Research Program (973 Program) (2014CB954500), and Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. ISSASIP1639).

Four global or European most successful invaders (Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Rudbeckia laciniata, Solidago gigantea) and two expansive plants native to Europe (Artemisia vulgaris, Phalaris arundinacea) were grown in pots to elucidate the magnitude and direction of changes in AMF abundance, species richness, and species composition in soils from under multispecies native vegetation. In a second stage, the effects of these changes on a native plant, Plantago lanceolata, were assessed. Plant species identity had larger impact on AMF abundance, species richness, and species composition as well as on P. lanceolata than origin of the species (alien vs. native). This could be due to the character of AMF relationships with the plants, i.e., their mycorrhizal status and dependency on AMF. However, the alterations induced by the plant species in soil chemical properties rather than in AMF community were the major drivers of differences in shoot mass and photosynthetic performance of P. lanceolata. We determined that the plants produced species-specific effects on soil properties that, in turn, resulted in species-specific soil feedbacks on the native plant. These effects were not consistent within groups of invaders or natives.","[Majewska, Marta L.; Rola, Kaja; Nobis, Marcin; Zubek, Szymon] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Fac Biol, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Stefanowicz, Anna M.] Polish Acad Sci, W Szafer Inst Bot, Lubicz 46, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Baszkowski, Janusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Dept Ecol Protect & Shaping Environm, Slowackiego 17, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland","Zubek, S (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Fac Biol, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",szymon.zubek@uj.edu.pl,,"Zubek, Szymon/0000-0003-1338-9572; Nobis, Marcin/0000-0002-1594-2418; Majewska, Marta/0000-0002-5243-1211; Stefanowicz, Anna/0000-0003-1803-6872; Rola, Kaja/0000-0003-2241-1081","Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2011/03/B/NZ8/00008]; Institute of Botany at the Jagiellonian University [K/ZDS/006300, K/ZDS/007340, K/DSC/003932]","The research was funded by the Polish National Science Centre, under project DEC-2011/03/B/NZ8/00008.

The presented study investigated the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) of major plant species in these ecosystems to find possible links between Pinus pinaster, three native Cistaceae shrubs and the Acacia invasive species. We successfully identified 13 ECM fungal taxa. Within those, two species from the order Helotiales were found in all plant species, and over half of the fungal ECM species found in Pinus pinaster were also common to the Cistaceae shrubs. Network analysis points to the Cistaceae shrubs having a central role in these below-ground communities, therefore enforcing the idea that they are key to these communities and should not be underestimated. Our results also point to the evolving role of invasive plant species in the ecosystem dynamics in the rhizosphere, which host fungal species that are common to native plants, although it is not yet clear whether these fungal taxa are native or a consequence of the presence of Acacia longifolia.","[Carvalho, Pedro; Martins, Rui; Portugal, Antonio; Teresa Goncalves, M.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, CFE, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal","Carvalho, P (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, CFE, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.",pedro.carvalho@itqb.unl.pt,"Portugal, Antonio/Q-7335-2019","Portugal, Antonio/0000-0003-1748-6345; Martins, Rui/0000-0001-9837-7831; Carvalho, Pedro/0000-0002-0760-323X","FCT/MEC; FEDER, within the PT2020 Partnership Agreement; COMPETE 2020 [UID/BIA/04004/2013]","We would like to thank Susana Rodriguez-Echeverria for the valuable input in the experimental design and on data interpretation crucial for this paper.

Uncertainties stem from persistent methodological limitations and the difficulty of resolving top-down estimates of ecosystem C exchange with bottom-up measurements of individual pools and fluxes. To address this, we derived estimates and associated uncertainties of ecosystem C fluxes for a 100-125 year old mixed temperate forest stand at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, using three different approaches: (1) tower-based eddy covariance, (2) a biometric approach involving C flux measurements of individual ecosystem subcomponents, and (3) an inventory approach involving changes in major C stocks over time. Our analysis made use of 13 years of data, collected over the period from 2004 to 2016. Estimates of mean annual net ecosystem production (NEP) ranged from 120 to 133 g C m(-2), demonstrating strong agreement among methods and suggesting that this aging forest acts as a moderate C sink. The use of multiple approaches to measure C fluxes and their uncertainties helped place constraints on difficult-to-measure processes such as aboveground contributions to ecosystem respiration and belowground allocation to mycorrhizal fungal biomass (which was estimated at 20% of net primary production). Analysis of interannual variability in C fluxes revealed a decoupling etween annual wood growth and either current year or lagged NEP or GPP, suggesting that source limitation (C supply) is likely not controlling rates of wood production, at least on an interannual scale. Results also demonstrated a strong association between the maximum rate of C uptake during the growing season (Amax) and the length of the vernal window, defined as the period of time between soil thaw and the onset of photosynthesis. This suggests an important, but poorly understood, influence of winter and spring climate on mid-summer canopy physiology. Efforts to resolve the mechanisms responsible should be prioritized in light of ongoing and predicted changes in climate for the northeastern U.S. region, particularly during the winter and winter-spring transition period.","[Ouimette, Andrew P.; Ollinger, Scott, V; Lepine, Lucie C.; Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Richardson, Andrew D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hollinger, David Y.] USDA Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 271 Mast Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Keenan, Trevor F.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA; [Keenan, Trevor F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA","Ouimette, AP (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Andrew.Ouimette@unh.edu,"Hollinger, David Y/G-7185-2012; Keenan, Trevor F./B-2744-2010; Richardson, Andrew D./F-5691-2011; Ollinger, Scott V/N-3380-2014","Keenan, Trevor F./0000-0002-3347-0258; Richardson, Andrew D./0000-0002-0148-6714; Ollinger, Scott V/0000-0001-6226-1431; Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708","USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1114804, 1638688, 1114804]; Northeastern States Research Cooperative [12DG11242307065]; Hubbard Brook Long Term Ecological Research program [NSF1114804]; NH EPSCoR Program NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Award [EPS 1101245]; NASA Carbon Cycle Science Awards [NNX08AG14G, NNX14AJ18G]; NASA Terrestrial Ecology Award [NNX11AB88G]; Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy as part of the RGCM BGC-Climate Feedbacks SFA [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Research at the Bartlett Experimental Forest is supported by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.

We compare responses of root morphology to changes in container size and shape in both deep-rooting (Acacia caven) and shallow-rooting (Baccharis linearis) species, both commonly used in active restoration plans in central Chile. For both species, seedlings were cultivated in four different PVC container-types varying in size (440 mL and 880 mL) and shape ([10, 20, 35, and 45] cm in length), and a control treatment that consists in the commonly container-type used in Chilean nurseries (440 mL black polyethylene bag). Seedlings were cultivated for one growing season under controlled conditions and a set of above- and belowground morphological parameters were evaluated. A second short experiment was performed afterwards to evaluate potential seedling quality through the root growth potential (RGP) test. Results showed that an increase in container volume differently affected morphological parameters of A. caven and B. linearis seedlings. The control treatment had high presence of spiral roots for the deep-rooting species, restricting normal root growth. For both species, elongated containers (>35 cm) produced seedlings with smaller shoots with longer root systems and without deformations in the taproot or main root. Elongated containers also restarted growth of new roots more deeply in the container as result of the RGP test. We concluded that contrasting root architecture of native species require different container size in nursery to promote an adequate root development and growth.","[de la Fuente, Luz Maria; Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile; [Ovalle, Juan F.] Univ Chile, Dept Silvicultura & Conservac Nat, Santiago, Chile; [Ovalle, Juan F.; Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile","Ginocchio, R (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile.; Ginocchio, R (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile.",rosanna.ginocchio@uc.cl,"Arellano, Eduardo/N-6901-2014; Ginocchio, Rosanna/C-9637-2016","Arellano, Eduardo/0000-0002-2000-3386; Ovalle, Juan/0000-0002-8487-3487; Ginocchio, Rosanna/0000-0003-4089-8188",Chilean Research Center for Mining and Metallurgy (CIMM); CAPES UC [CONICYT FB-0002-2014],"Authors would like to thank the Chilean Research Center for Mining and Metallurgy (CIMM) and the CONICYT FB-0002-2014 (CAPES UC) for funding the study.

In spite of the importance of its geographical extension, studies of this type of vegetation with a socio-ecological approach are rare. The silvicultural scientific approach has been the predominating type of studies in this ecosystem, guided by the vision of maintaining a continuous flow of timber for the market and paying regard to the income of forest owners, without considering the provision of ecosystem services and other benefits. This study recommends the integration of a socioecological approach that promotes the integration of the society-nature dependencies that occur in temperate forests. In this context, it is imperative to understand: 1) the influence of temperate pine and oak species on the structure and functioning of these forests, particularly on primary productivity; 2) the impact of soil, regulated and unregulated biomass harvest on the structure and functioning of the ecosystem and 3) the social and economic aspects related to different conservation tools (natural protected areas and payment for environmental services), which represent schemes of society interaction with nature. It is discussed how research and evaluation under this approach can contribute to reducing the enormous deficit in timber production that persists in Mexico, protecting biological diversity and maintaining the provision of ecosystem services for human well-being.","[Galicia, Leopoldo; Kolb, Melanie; Isela Jasso-Flores, Rosa; Rodriguez-Bustos, Laura A.; Elizabeth Solis, Lesly; Perez-Campuzano, Enrique] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Dept Geog Fis, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Manuel Chavez-Vergara, Bruno] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Guerra de la Cruz, Vidal] Inst Nacl Invest Forest Agr & Pecuarias, Sitio Expt Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Villanueva, Antonio] Campus Int Baillarguet, Montpellier, France; [Manuel Chavez-Vergara, Bruno] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Nacl Geoquim & Mineral, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Galicia, L (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Dept Geog Fis, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",lgalicia@igg.unam.mx,,"Rodriguez-Bustos, Laura Alicia/0000-0002-3839-9788; Mendoza, Solis/0000-0002-0342-2917; Galicia, Leopoldo/0000-0002-5808-6471; Kolb, Melanie/0000-0002-3329-3861; Chavez-Vergara, Bruno/0000-0003-1061-5685",,,,115,1,1,0,1,INST ECOLOGIA A C,XALAPA,"KM 2 5 CARR ANT A COATEPEC NO 351, CONGREGACION EL HAYA, XALAPA, VER 00000, MEXICO",2448-7597,,,MADERA BOSQUES,Madera Bosques,SUM,2018,24,2,,,,,,,UNSP e2421443,10.21829/myb.2018.2421443,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,HI9OC,WOS:000456784900004,,Other Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Liu, S; Qin, FC; Yu, SX",,,,"Liu, Shu; Qin, Fangcuo; Yu, Shixiao",,,Eucalyptus urophylla root-associated fungi can counteract the negative influence of phenolic acid allelochemicals,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Eucalyptus urophylla; Phenolic acids; Helotiales sp.; Biodegradation; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer,ERICOID MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL; GROWTH; PLANTS; WATER; BIODEGRADATION; TRANSFORMATION; DEGRADATION; ENDOPHYTES; VEGETATION,"Root-associated fungi can potentially affect plant allelopathy by degrading or transforming allelochemicals. However, no microorganism has been identified as an allelochemical moderator in Eucalyptus plantations. In this study, three Helotiales sp. (EU03, EU04, and EU05) were isolated from the roots of Eucalyptus urophylla, and all three of the isolated fungi were grown in vitro with mixed phenolic acids (benzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic acid) as the sole carbon source. EU03 and EU05 can degrade 99% of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid in an inorganic culture medium within 9 days, while EU04 can degrade 100% of the three phenolic acids in potato dextrose broth medium within 7 days. A mixed inoculation with the three isolates can alleviate the allelopathic effects of phenolic acids and E. urophylla litter decomposition on Albizia julibrissin (Fabaceae) nodulation ex situ. The number of nodules on A. julibrissin grown with inoculated fungi plus 50 mg kg(-1) or 100 mg kg(-1) mixed phenolic acids were 2.17 times and 1.67 times greater than those grown without the inoculation treatments, respectively. These results highlight the role of E. urophylla root associated fungi, which have the potential to moderate the phenolic acid allelopathy caused by E. urophylla. Manipulating root associated fungi is an effective way to alleviate the effects of ecological suppression caused by Eucalyptus allelochemicals.","[Liu, Shu; Qin, Fangcuo; Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Yu, SX (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lssysx@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Shixiao/0000-0003-1943-0185",National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31361140363]; Zhang-Hongda Science Foundation in Sun Yat-sen University,We are grateful to Yang Bo for his assistance in the experiment.

Here, to provide insights into the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the root growth, we examined the morphology and longevity of different-order fine roots in two poplar (Populus x euramericana (Dode) Guinier) plantations with contrasting forest productivities. The results indicated that the biomass of fine roots decreased significantly as the root orders increased (P < 0.05). In the plantation with relatively high productivity, the specific root length of the first-and second-order roots was significantly greater than that of the third-to fifth-order roots (P < 0.05). Observations of minirhizotrons showed that roots of the third-order and higher lived longer than the first-and second-order roots. Compared with those in the plantation with relatively low productivity, the cumulative survival rate of the first-order roots was significantly higher in the plantation with relatively high productivity, while that of the third-order or higher roots was lower. The life-span of the first-order roots correlated negatively with soil available inorganic nitrogen, while that of the second-order roots correlated positively with the soil phenolic acid content. A Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that soil conditions, root orders, season of root birth, and soil depth significantly affected fine-root longevity. These findings suggest that roots of different orders contribute unequally to the poplar plantation productivity.","[Zhu, Wanrui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wanrui; Sang, Ya Lin; Zhu, Qiliang; Wang, Yanping] Shandong Agr Univ, Taishan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, State Forestry Adm, Coll Forestry, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Duan, Baoli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanping] Soil Eros & Ecol Restorat Lab Shandong Prov, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, YP (reprint author), Shandong Agr Univ, Taishan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, State Forestry Adm, Coll Forestry, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (reprint author), Soil Eros & Ecol Restorat Lab Shandong Prov, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",sdauwyp@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570618]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of ChinaChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572070]; Outstanding Scientists Foundation of Shandong Province, China [BS2012NY006]; Shandong Double Tops Program [SYL2017XTTD03]","This work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31570618), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (grant No. 2015M572070), and the Outstanding Scientists Foundation of Shandong Province, China (grant No. BS2012NY006).

Cataloging this diversity has also challenged the methods that are currently used to isolate and grow microorganisms, because most of the microbiota that are present in environmental samples have been described as unculturable. Factors such as geographic isolation and host preference also hinder the assessment of microbial diversity. However, prejudiced historical practices, including the prioritization of some species of microorganisms merely because they cause diseases, have long shifted research on fungi and bacteria towards medically relevant microorganisms. Thus, most microorganisms that inhabit the planet are still unknown, as is the potential of these species. Current estimates allow us to predict that the diversity of microorganisms that are present in the various terrestrial ecosystems is enormous.

Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120000year soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and, in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions and suggesting trajectories for restoration.","[Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Tylianakis, Jason M.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Tylianakis, Jason M.; Dickie, Ian A.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Martinez-Garcia, Laura B.; Richardson, Sarah J.; Peltzer, Duane A.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Martinez-Garcia, Laura B.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Tylianakis, JM (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.; Tylianakis, JM (reprint author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.; Tylianakis, JM (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",jason.tylianakis@canterbury.ac.nz,"Peltzer, Duane A/A-9463-2009","Peltzer, Duane A/0000-0001-7724-3738","NZ's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge funding; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); Bio-protection Research Centre; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship","We thank P.J.

Three successional stages along gradients of log attributes were identified. In the initial stage, the communities were composed by yeasts, plant pathogens and cosmopolitan saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate utilization. In the intermediate stage, bark was colonized mainly by saprotrophs common in decaying wood, symbionts of epixylic plants and nematode-trapping fungi. The final stage was characterized by the dominance of mycorrhizal fungi. Wood-decaying fungi occurred in all stages. However, their sporadic appearance in bark samples suggests that they are not essential for bark decomposition.

With warming, these permafrost soils may thaw and become available for microbial decomposition, potentially providing a positive feedback to global warming. Warming may directly stimulate microbial metabolism but may also indirectly stimulate organic matter turnover through increased plant productivity by soil priming from root exudates and accelerated litter turnover rates. Here, we assess the impacts of experimental warming on turnover rates of leaf litter, active layer soil and thawed permafrost sediment in two high-arctic tundra heath sites in NE-Greenland, either dominated by evergreen or deciduous shrubs. We incubated shrub leaf litter on the surface of control and warmed plots for 1 and 2 years. Active layer soil was collected from the plots to assess the effects of 8 years of field warming on soil carbon stocks. Finally, we incubated open cores filled with newly thawed permafrost soil for 2 years in the active layer of the same plots. After field incubation, we measured basal respiration rates of recovered thawed permafrost cores in the lab. Warming significantly reduced litter mass loss by 26% after 1 year incubation, but differences in litter mass loss among treatments disappeared after 2 years incubation. Warming also reduced litter nitrogen mineralization and decreased the litter carbon to nitrogen ratio. Active layer soil carbon stocks were reduced 15% by warming, while soil dissolved nitrogen was reduced by half in warmed plots. Warming had a positive legacy effect on carbon turnover rates in thawed permafrost cores, with 10% higher respiration rates measured in cores from warmed plots. These results demonstrate that warming may have contrasting effects on above- and belowground tundra carbon turnover, possibly governed by microbial resource availability.","[Blok, Daan; Faucherre, Samuel; Banyasz, Imre; Rinnan, Riikka; Michelsen, Anders; Elberling, Bo] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Blok, Daan] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Rinnan, Riikka; Michelsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark","Elberling, B (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Blok, D (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden.",daanblok@gmail.com; be@ign.ku.dk,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Rinnan, Riikka/AAB-8552-2019; Rinnan, Riikka/C-9771-2010; Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Rinnan, Riikka/0000-0001-7222-700X; Rinnan, Riikka/0000-0001-7222-700X; Faucherre, Samuel/0000-0002-2464-4260; Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X",Danish National Research FoundationDanmarks Grundforskningsfond [CENPERM DNRF100]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2015-00465]; Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions [INCA 600398],"Danish National Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: CENPERM DNRF100; The Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 2015-00465; Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions, Grant/Award Number: INCA 600398",,51,2,2,18,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Most research has posited that these soil C gains are driven primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with elevated N leading to declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes. Recent research, however, suggests that plants and soil microbes are dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C subsidies to rhizosphere microbes to enhance enzyme production and the mobilization of N. Thus, under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C allocation leading to cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade soil organic matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in plant-microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial responses to N fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the primary agents of soil decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial community composition, root-microbial interactions, and extracellular enzyme activity in the rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils sampled from a long-term (> 25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization experiment at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We observed significant declines in plant C investment to fine root biomass (24.7%), root morphology, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization (55.9%). Moreover, we found that declines in extracellular enzyme activity were significantly correlated with a shift in bacterial community composition, but not fungal community composition. This bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal colonization indicating that declines in plant investment belowground drive the response of bacterial community structure and function to N fertilization. Collectively, we find that enzyme activity responses to N fertilization are not solely driven by fungi, but instead reflect a whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the strength of belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil environment.","[Carrara, Joseph E.; Walter, Christopher A.; Hawkins, Jennifer S.; Peterjohn, William T.; Brzostek, Edward R.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Walter, Christopher A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Averill, Colin] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Carrara, JE (reprint author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",jocarrara@mix.wvu.edu,,,"Division of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [DGE-1102689]; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DEB-0417678, DEB-1019522]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program at the National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)","Division of Graduate Education, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1102689; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB-0417678, DEB-1019522; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program at the National Science Foundation; NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, administered by Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (CPAESS); University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)",,84,12,13,23,135,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Deciphering the physiological basis of species-species and species-environment interactions in spatially organized environments requires reductionist approaches using ecologically and functionally relevant species. To this end, we focus here on a defined system to study the metabolic interactions in a spatial context among the plant-beneficial endophytic fungus Serendipita indica, and the soil-dwelling model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Focusing on the growth dynamics of S. indica under defined conditions, we identified an auxotrophy in this organism for thiamine, which is a key co-factor for essential reactions in the central carbon metabolism. We found that S. indica growth is restored in thiamine-free media, when co-cultured with B. subtilis. The success of this auxotrophic interaction, however, was dependent on the spatial and temporal organization of the system; the beneficial impact of B. subtilis was only visible when its inoculation was separated from that of S. indica either in time or space. These findings describe a key auxotrophic interaction in the soil among organisms that are shown to be important for plant ecosystem functioning, and point to the potential importance of spatial and temporal organization for the success of auxotrophic interactions. These points can be particularly important for engineering of minimal functional synthetic communities as plant seed treatments and for vertical farming under defined conditions.","[Jiang, Xue; Zerfass, Christian; Eichmann, Ruth; Asally, Munehiro; Schafer, Patrick; Soyer, Orkun S.] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Zerfass, Christian; Asally, Munehiro; Schafer, Patrick; Soyer, Orkun S.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Feng, Song] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Div T 6, Ctr Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Schafer, P; Soyer, OS (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.; Schafer, P; Soyer, OS (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Integrat Synthet Biol Ctr, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",P.Schafer@warwick.ac.uk; O.Soyer@warwick.ac.uk,"Soyer, Orkun/I-4863-2014; Feng, Song/J-7377-2016","Soyer, Orkun/0000-0002-9504-3796; Zerfass, Christian/0000-0001-8960-1926; Feng, Song/0000-0003-3983-9009","Biotechnological and Biological Research Council (BBSRC) of the United KingdomBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/K003240/2, BB/M017982/1]","This work is funded by research grants from Biotechnological and Biological Research Council (BBSRC) of the United Kingdom, with grant IDs: BB/K003240/2 (to OSS) and BB/M017982/1 (to the Warwick Integrative Synthetic Biology Center, WISB).",,90,5,5,2,27,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,JUN,2018,12,6,,,,,1443,1456,,10.1038/s41396-018-0095-z,,,14,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,GG0GW,WOS:000432357500005,29572468,"Green Published, Other Gold",,,10/31/19J,"Hamann, E; Kesselring, H; Stocklin, J",,,,"Hamann, Elena; Kesselring, Halil; Stocklin, Jurg",,,Plant responses to simulated warming and drought: a comparative study of functional plasticity between congeneric mid and high elevation species,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass allocation; common garden; climate change; perennial herbaceous species; phenotypic plasticity; SLA; Swiss Alps; transplant experiment,PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; SUMMER DROUGHT; ALPINE PLANT; LEAF-AREA; EVOLUTION; TRAITS; GROWTH,"Effects of climate change, especially changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns, are particularly pronounced in alpine regions. In response, plants may exhibit phenotypic plasticity in key functional traits allowing short-term adjustment to novel conditions. However, little is known about the degree of phenotypic plasticity of high elevation species relative to mid elevation congeners. We transplanted 14 herbaceous perennial species from high elevation into two common gardens (1050 and 2000 m.a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps, and we examined plastic responses in key functional traits to changes in temperature and soil water availability. This design was replicated with 14 congeneric species from mid elevation to assess if the degree of phenotypic plasticity differs between mid and high elevation species. Survival was assessed across two growing seasons, while aboveground biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured after the first growing season, and biomass allocation to belowground and reproductive structures after the second. Moreover, a phenotypic plasticity index was calculated for the functional traits to compare the degree of plasticity between mid and high elevation species. Aboveground biomass was higher in mid elevation species relative to high elevation congeners in all treatments, yet decreased for both with elevation and drought. Similarly, SLA decreased with elevation and drought. Root mass fraction (RMF) was generally higher in high elevation species, and decreased with drought at the lower site. Drought increased the allocation to reproductive structures, especially when plants were grown at their elevation of origin. Interestingly, no difference was found in the degree of phenotypic plasticity averaged across mid and high elevation species for any of the studied functional traits. These results indicate that phenotypic plasticity in the focal traits did not depend on the elevation of origin of the species. Plasticity was not related to environmental heterogeneity, nor constrained by selective pressures at high elevation. However, both species groups showed a remarkable capacity for short-term acclimation to a prospective climate through rapid adjustments in key functional traits.","[Hamann, Elena; Kesselring, Halil; Stocklin, Jurg] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Inst Bot, Sect Plant Ecol, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Hamann, E (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Inst Bot, Sect Plant Ecol, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",elena.hamann@yahoo.fr,,"Hamann, Elena/0000-0003-2888-6440",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [3100A-135611],This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (3100A-135611) to J.

Few studies have explicitly addressed how intraspecific variation in functional traits influences alien plant distribution across environments. In an old-growth temperate rainforest, we evaluated alien plant distribution across the light gradient, its relationship with native plant diversity and abundance, and variation in functional traits related to light capture that could explain the ecological breadth of alien plant species across the light gradient. In addition, we estimated possible ecological and phylogenetic constraints to intraspecific variation in these functional traits. In sixty 8-m(2) plots we recorded light availability together with richness and abundance of alien and native plant species. We measured in 14 alien plant species three functional traits (specific leaf area, chlorophyll content and root/shoot ratio) and calculated their coefficient of variation. We estimated ecological constraints by measuring correlations among traits that could limit functional responses to light. We assessed phylogenetic constraints by calculating the phylogenetic signal of those functional traits. Richness and abundance of alien plant species were positively associated with light availability, while abundance was negatively related to native plant species abundance. Dominance of alien species increased with light availability, but some of them were dominant even in the shade. Phenotypic variation of functional traits was positively associated with ecological breadth and dominance of alien plant species. We found little evidence of ecological or phylogenetic constraints on functional trait variation. Light availability and functional trait variation correlated with the distribution and dominance of alien plants in this temperate rainforest. Alien plant species showed considerable phenotypic variation in low light, which may facilitate colonization of the forest understory. This process would not be hindered by ecological or phylogenetic constraints. Intraspecific variation in functional traits can render insightful information on current and future alien plant distribution across environmental gradients.","[Canessa, Rafaella; Saldana, Alfredo; Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Rios, Rodrigo S.; Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile","Gianoli, E (reprint author), Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile.",rcaness1@uc.cl; asaldana@udec.cl; srrios@userena.cl; egianoli@userena.cl,"Rios, Rodrigo/C-5098-2015; Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015","Rios, Rodrigo/0000-0003-3068-0118; Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640","CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [22131483]; Direccion de Postgrado (Universidad de Concepcion); FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140070, 1140455]","RC was supported by fellowships for graduate studies from CONICYT (22131483) and Direccion de Postgrado (Universidad de Concepcion).

Coexisting plant species may vary in rooting depth, reflecting niche partitioning in water source use. Our goal was to assess the soil water partitioning of woody plant communities across northern Arizona along an elevational moisture gradient using stem and soil water isotopes from two sampling periods to estimate the use of different water sources. We hypothesized that niche overlap of water sources would be higher and monsoon precipitation uptake would be lower at sites with higher moisture availability. Pairwise niche overlap of coexisting species was calculated using mixing model estimates of proportional water use for three sources. Across the moisture gradient, niche overlap increased with site moisture index (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) across seasons, and site moisture index explained 37% of the variation in niche overlap of intermediate and deeper sources of water. Desert trees utilized more winter source water than desert shrubs, suggesting the partitioning of water sources between functional groups. However, seasonal differences in surface water use were primarily found at intermediate levels of site moisture availability. Our findings support classical niche partitioning theory in that plants exhibit higher overlap of water sources when water is not a limiting resource.","[Guo, Jessica S.; Hungate, Bruce A.; Koch, George W.] No Arizona Univ, Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Guo, Jessica S.; Hungate, Bruce A.; Koch, George W.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Kolb, Thomas E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Guo, JS (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Guo, JS (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",jsg88@nau.edu,,,Science Foundation Arizona Graduate Research Fellowship [GRF 0449-10],JG was supported by a Science Foundation Arizona Graduate Research Fellowship under Award GRF 0449-10.,,100,0,0,4,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2018,219,6,,,,,719,735,,10.1007/s11258-018-0829-z,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GF4XZ,WOS:000431968900009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gutierrez-Ruacho, O; Coronado, ML; Sanchez-Teyer, F; Sanchez, A; Gutierrez, A; Esqueda, M",,,,"Gutierrez-Ruacho, Oscar; Coronado, Martha L.; Sanchez-Teyer, Felipe; Sanchez, Alfonso; Gutierrez, Aldo; Esqueda, Martin",,,"Abundance of rhizospheric bacteria and fungi associated with Fouquieria columnaris at Punta Cirio, Sonora, Mexico",REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bacteria; Actinobacteria; Filamentous fungi; Mycorrhizae; Cirio,BAJA-CALIFORNIA; DESERT; ESTABLISHMENT; PLANTS; ROOTS; SOIL; MYCORRHIZAE; INFECTION,"A unique relictual population of Fouquieria columnaris is located in Sonora, along a 45-km strip of land encompassing Punta Cirio in the Sonoran Desert.

The total bacterial, actinobacterial, and filamentous fungal counts did not differ among sites or elevations; no interaction between site and elevation was found. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria varied according to site but not elevation, whereas phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria were undetected. Filamentous fungi were dominated by Aspergillus spp. (48%) and Penicillium spp. (28%), which together represented 76% of the total average colony-forming units. The spore density of AMF ranged from 109 to 245 per 100 g of soil, and 65 to 80% of roots were colonized by hyphae, vesicles, or arbuscles of AMF.

However, whether the results obtained on productivity can be generalized to other ecosystem processes remains unclear. We investigated the effects of tree species mixtures on fine root biomass turnover and biomass loss from mortality by sampling 18 stands dominated by Populus tremuloides and Pinus banksiana, respectively, and their relatively even mixtures in post-fire boreal forests of two stand ages (8 and 34 years following stand-replacing fire). Fine root biomass turnover and mortality were higher in mixtures than expected from those of single species-dominated stands in both stand ages, with a higher magnitude of mixture effects in the 34-year-old than in the 8-year-old stands. Mixture effects on turnover and mortality did not differ with soil depth in 8-year-old stands, but turnover increased while mortality decreased from the forest floor to the mineral layers in 34-year-old stands. Both turnover and mortality significantly increased with tree species evenness in 34-year-old stands, but not in 8-year-old stands. Root turnover and biomass loss from mortality were positively associated with annual fine root production across all stand types and ages. Our results provide the first evidence for positive mixture effects on fine root biomass turnover and biomass loss from mortality in natural forests. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive mixture effects resulted from increased competition induced by the increase of fine root biomass production in tree species mixtures.","[Ma, Zilong; Chen, Han Y.

This study investigated the response of the NSC (soluble sugars and starch) concentration of different tissues/organs (current- to 4-year-old needles, inner-bark, xylem, and coarse and fine roots) toward thinning and understory removal in a plantation of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook), which is an evergreen coniferous species. Results showed that thinning significantly increased the NSC concentration of the needles. The NSC concentrations of the inner-bark and xylem did not respond to thinning. In contrast to the aboveground tissues/organs, the NSC concentration of the coarse root was significantly reduced by thinning. Thus, the thinning-induced NSC response of the above- and belowground tissues/organs varied, indicating that the NSC was remobilized after thinning. However, understory removal had a very reduced effect on the NSC concentration of all the mentioned above- and belowground tissues/organs. Our findings suggest the need to simultaneously consider above- and belowground tissues/organs in future forest management studies.","[Li, Renshan; Yang, Qingpeng; Zhang, Weidong; Zheng, Wenhui; Wang, Silong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qingpeng; Zhang, Weidong; Wang, Silong] Huitong Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China; [Li, Renshan; Zheng, Wenhui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Yang, QP; Wang, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Yang, QP; Wang, SL (reprint author), Huitong Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China.",yqp226@gmail.com; slwang@iae.ac.cn,"Yang, qingpeng/B-3632-2014","Yang, qingpeng/0000-0003-2471-6233","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-DQC002-03]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41630755, 31570402]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2017239]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416905]","This study was supported by the key research program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant no.

One possible resolution to this puzzle is that there is a tradeoff between partner quality and other fitness-related traits. Here, we tested whether susceptibility to parasitism is one such tradeoff in the mutualism between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We performed two greenhouse experiments with the legume Medicago truncatula. In the first, we inoculated each plant with the rhizobia Ensifer meliloti and with one of 40 genotypes of the parasitic root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. In the second experiment, we inoculated all plants with rhizobia and half of the plants with a genetically variable population of nematodes. Using the number of nematode galls as a proxy for infection severity, we found that plant genotypes differed in susceptibility to nematode infection, and nematode genotypes differed in infectivity. Second, we showed that there was a genetic correlation between the number of mutualistic structures formed by rhizobia (nodules) and the number of parasitic structures formed by nematodes (galls). Finally, we found that nematodes disrupt the rhizobia mutualism: nematode-infected plants formed fewer nodules and had less nodule biomass than uninfected plants. Our results demonstrate that there is genetic conflict between attracting rhizobia and repelling nematodes in Medicago. If genetic conflict with parasitism is a general feature of mutualism, it could account for the maintenance of genetic variation in partner quality and influence the evolutionary dynamics of positive species interactions.","[Wood, Corlett W.; Pilkington, Bonnie L.; Vaidya, Priya; Biel, Caroline; Stinchcombel, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stinchcombel, John R.] Univ Toronto, Koffler Sci Reserve, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Wood, CW (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",corlett.wood@utoronto.ca,,,NSERC grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Toronto EEB Postdoctoral Fellowship,"We are grateful to Benjamin Mimee at Agriculture and Agri-food Canada for providing nematode inoculum, and Dennis VanDyk at the University of Guelph's Muck Crops Research Station for providing tomato cv.

In addition, native plants might be hardier and more ecologically sound choices than non-native plants in green roof systems. The objectives of this research were to (1) compare the performance of plant communities with that of monocultures and (2) compare the growth of natives to non-natives in a simulated green roof setting. We conducted a two-year experiment at an outdoor site in a desert environment using four plant morphological types (groundcover, forb, succulent and grass). Native plants selected were Chrysactinia mexicana, Melampodium leucanthum, Euphorbia antisyphilitica, and Nassella tenuissima, and non-natives were Delosperma nubigenum, Stachys byzantina, Sedum kamtschiaticum and Festuca glauca. Plants were assigned randomly to either monoculture or community and grown in 1 m x 1 m custom-built trays filled with 15 cm of a proprietary blend of 50/20/30 lightweight aggregate/sand/compost (by volume). Native forb, Melampodium, in community had greater coverage for four of the five measurements in the first year over native forb in monoculture and non-native forb regardless of setting. Native forb coverage was also greater than non-native forb for three of the four measurements in year 2, regardless of setting. Coverage of native grass was significantly greater than non-native grasses throughout the experiment. Coverage was also greater for eight of nine measurements for native succulent over non-natives succulent. However, non-native groundcover coverage was significantly greater than native groundcover for seven of nine measurements. On 1 November 2016, relative water content (RWC) for succulents (p = 0.0424) was greatest for native Euphorbia in monoculture at 88%. Native Euphorbia also had greater RWC than non-native Sedum on 4 April 2017 (78%) and 4 July 2017 (80%). However, non-native Sedum had greater root length (6548 cm), root dry weight (12.1 g), and root-to-shoot dry weight ratio (0.45) than native Euphorbia. At the end of year 2, the relative growth rate (RGR) of native Euphorbia of 0.15 gg(-1)d(-1) was greater than that of Sedum. While the native succulent had a smaller root biomass, its greater RWC and RGR would indicate it had better plant water status and grew faster than the non-native. The lack of differences in plant performance regardless of assignment to monoculture or community would imply that communities and monocultures are equally suitable for arid region green roofs.","[Gioannini, Rachel; St Hilaire, Rolston] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Al-Ajlouni, Malik] Univ Jordan, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Kile, Richard] Amer Hydrotech Inc, 303 E Ohio,Suite 2700, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [VanLeeuwen, Dawn] New Mexico State Univ, Agr Biometr Serv, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","St Hilaire, R (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",rachelgi@nmsu.edu; m.ajlouni@ju.edu.jo; rkile@hydrotechusa.com; vanleeuw@nmsu.edu; rsthilai@nmsu.edu,"Al-Ajlouni, Malik/H-5332-2017","Al-Ajlouni, Malik/0000-0001-6898-2774",Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences; NM Agriculture Experiment Station,"This project was provided with significant material support from American Hydrotech, Inc.

A disproportionate carbon investment in root maintenance has been pointed as a cause of the widespread decline of abandoned coppices. We aimed at assessing how coppicing has influenced root and shoot development and related carbon loss ascribed to maintenance of woody tissues in Quercus pyrenaica. For this goal, results from published studies on root dynamics, woody biomass and respired CO2 fluxes in an abandoned Q. pyrenaica coppice were integrated and extended to quantify overall respiratory expenditures of above- and below-ground woody organs. Internal and external CO2 fluxes together with soil CO2 efflux were monitored in eight stems from one clone across a growing season. Stems and roots were later harvested to quantify the functional biomass and scale up root and stem respiration (R-R and R-S, respectively) to the clone and stand levels. Below- and above-ground biomass was roughly equal. However, the root-to-shoot ratio of respiration (R-R/R-S) was generally below one. Relatively higher R-S suggests enhanced metabolic activity aboveground during the growing season, and highlights an unexpected but substantial contribution of R-S to respiratory carbon losses. Moreover, soil and stem CO2 efflux to the atmosphere in Q. pyrenaica fell in the upper range of reported rates for various forest stands distributed worldwide. We conclude that both R-S and R-R represent an important carbon sink in this Q. pyrenaica abandoned coppice. Comparatively high energetic costs in maintaining multiple stems per tree and centennial root systems might constrain aboveground performance and contribute to coppice stagnation.","[Luis Salomon, Roberto; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Gil, Luis; Valbuena-Carabana, Maria] Tech Univ Madrid, ETS Forestry Engn, Forest Genet & Ecophysiol Res Grp, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Luis Salomon, Roberto] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Lab Plant Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Salomon, RL (reprint author), Tech Univ Madrid, ETS Forestry Engn, Forest Genet & Ecophysiol Res Grp, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Salomon, RL (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Lab Plant Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",robertoluis.salomonmoreno@ugent.be,"Valbuena-Carabana, Maria/V-2104-2017; Salomon, Roberto/E-8530-2010","Valbuena-Carabana, Maria/0000-0002-4321-2711; Salomon, Roberto/0000-0003-2674-1731","Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [CAM P2009/AMB-1668, S2013/MAE-2760]; Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales [PPNN 1148/2014]; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","We are grateful to Javier Dones (Centro de Montes y Aserradero de Valsain) for economic and logistical support.

Little attention has been paid to morphological and physiological responses of DBLRs. Here, we investigated the relation between plant growth and DBLR development, enzymatic activities involved in P acquisition, and the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which contribute to P uptake, to clarify the function of DBLRs. We investigated DBLR development induced by localized application of P fertilizer and we compared the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) and acid phosphatase (APase) between DBLRs and non-DBLRs. Additionally, plants were grown with or without AMF to investigate the effect of AMF colonization on the numbers of DBLRs and plant P uptake, and we compared AMF colonization between DBLRs and non-DBLR roots. Secondary to quaternary lateral DBLRs were produced after the primary lateral roots passed near P fertilizer. P-i content per DBLR increased as DBLRs developed, promoting higher shoot growth. Under P deficiency, PEPCase and APase activities increased in non-DBLR, but were significantly lower in DBLRs in the same plants. AMF inoculation changed the root system architecture by significantly decreasing the number of DBLRs, and AMF colonization was lower in DBLRs than in non-DBLRs. Our results indicate that DBLR formation is a P-coacquisition strategy of S. cannabina grown in P-deficient andosolic soil. Roots that form DBLR are clearly different from non-DBLR roots in morphological and biochemical response and AMF symbiosis.","[Funakoshi, Yuri; Daimon, Hiroyuki; Matsumura, Atsushi] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan; [Daimon, Hiroyuki] Ryukoku Univ, Fac Agr, Seta Oe Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan","Matsumura, A (reprint author), Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan.",matsu@plant.osakafu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP26850008]",This study was financially supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP26850008.,,32,0,0,0,11,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

The effects of nitrogen form on the morphology of adventitious roots, carbohydrate metabolism in potential storage roots, and number of storage roots per plant in sweet potato were investigated. The results show that during the early growth phase, the AN treatment significantly increased the number of adventitious roots, root tips, root length density, and fresh weight of roots (in pot trials). This treatment also significantly decreased the sucrose concentration of potential storage roots and increased the activities of cell wall, vacuolar, and cytoplasmic invertases. However, XN-treated potential storage roots showed a relatively high starch concentration, activities of sucrose synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and transcription of sporamin genes. At the canopy closure period, the AN treatment significantly increased the number of storage roots of 0.5-5.0cm in diameter and decreased the number of those > 5 cm in diameter compared to the control. The XN treatment induced the opposite effects. In the harvesting period, the AN treatment produced the highest storage root yield and number of storage roots per plant. Thus, in field trials the AN treatment induced a greater increase in production by increasing the number of storage roots.","[Si, Chengcheng; Shi, Chunyu; Liu, Hongjuan; Zhan, Xiangdong; Liu, Yongchen] Shandong Agr Univ, Agr Coll, Shandong Key Lab Crop Biol, State Key Lab Crop Biol, 61 Daizong St, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shi, CY (reprint author), Shandong Agr Univ, Agr Coll, Shandong Key Lab Crop Biol, State Key Lab Crop Biol, 61 Daizong St, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",scyu@sdau.edu.cn,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [31371577]; Shandong Agriculture Innovation team [SDAIT-16-01]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2014CQ040],"This work was funded by a grant from the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC; 31371577), the Shandong Agriculture Innovation team (SDAIT-16-01), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014CQ040).

We examined how the spatial ecology of this biota, particularly distance-decay and species-area relationships, could better inform habitat thresholds for EMF conservation planning. Location: Southeast Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Methods: Using a stratified sampling design, 11 plots (0.15ha in size) were established at 0.05-17.5km apart across 2,800ha of mesic old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii and Tsuga heterophylla forests. EMF communities were compiled through molecular analysis of root tips and sporocarps. Results: The EMF community was comprised of many Cortinarius, Piloderma, Russula and Tricholoma species typical of mesotrophic habitat. A total of 238 EMF species were observed, of which 86 species were detected only once. The ratio of average species richness per plot (84 taxa) to total richness was low at 0.35, and inherent stochasticity of the EMF community was estimated to be 31% community dissimilarity for species incidence. Distance decay of EMF communities was nonlinear, with an estimated slope break at 2.6km, followed by a largely unchanging trend in -diversity. Accumulated species-area curves were fitted best by the cumulative Weibull sigmoid model, and the asymptote (367 species) at approx. 50ha was consistent with nonparametric estimates of -diversity (342-362 spp.). Main conclusions: Old-growth forests host an impressive amount of EMF diversity, and many of the Ramaria, Inocybe and Russula species are likely to be endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Both niche- and neutral-based processes influenced EMF community composition, resulting in a minimum threshold of 50ha (1.8% of the sample area) for capturing -diversity. These spatial patterns will help design and evaluate conservation efforts, such as retention forestry, to sustain fully diverse EMF communities over managed landscapes.","[Kranabetter, J. M.; Ott, P.

Impatiens parviflora is one of the most widespread invasive plant species in Central Europe, but it is unknown whether this species exhibits any form of plant-soil feedback, previously seen in other invasive species. In this study, we examined intraspecific plant-soil feedback of I. parviflora and compared it to feedbacks of other three alien, but noninvasive, Impatiens species growing in Central Europe. Moreover, we studied the effect of environmental conditions on this feedback. The four species were studied in a two-phase feedback experiment. In the first phase, soil was conditioned by a species or left unconditioned (control). During the second phase, plants were grown in soil conditioned by the same species and in control, not cultivated soil, under four different environmental conditions (two levels of watering x two levels of shading). All the studied species showed positive plant-soil feedback in some types of environment indicating they can potentially become invasive. The feedbacks for total biomass and for root-shoot ratio were significantly affected by environmental conditions. Individual species and studied performance measures responded differently to individual treatments. In most cases, the feedback was changing from positive in optimal treatment to neutral and in I. balsamina to negative under some suboptimal treatments. No effect of the environmental conditions on the feedback for germination was observed. These results indicate that environmental conditions play an important role in plant-soil feedbacks. We show that some feedbacks detected in highly controlled experiments using just one type of environmental conditions might not exist in the field, and similarly some existing feedbacks might remain undetected. We therefore recommend using multiple environmental conditions or conditions closely resembling conditions in natural sites to increase the realism of the results.","[Florianova, Anna; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic; [Florianova, Anna; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Florianova, A (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic.",ancaflorianova@centrum.cz,"Florianova, Anna/D-3305-2017; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013","Florianova, Anna/0000-0002-8037-623X; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR 16-09659S]; Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MSMT)Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic;  [RVO67985939]","We are grateful to J.

However, limited information is available on the occurrence and spatial patterns of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in soil independent of the orchid host. In this study, we investigated the in situ distribution of Tulasnella spp. associated with the critically endangered Australian orchid Diuris fragrantissima. We tested and implemented a meta-barcoding approach (fungal ITS1 region) using three soil sources: orchid rhizosphere, orchid-associated bulk soil and bulk soil from the orchid native site. The quality-filtered data set revealed that the occurrence of Tulasnella spp. in situ is restricted to the orchid rhizosphere, suggesting that a limited number of potential recruitment micro-sites with suitable mycorrhizal taxa exists in the D. fragrantissima natural habitat. The meta-barcoding approach also revealed a distinctive fungal community associated with the orchid rhizosphere. Overall, Next Generation Sequencing technology has proven to be a suitable method for large-scale screening of mycorrhizal fungi in orchid-associated soil.

To assess sequence variation within fungal individuals, we sequenced single spores of Rhizophagus irregularis. We observed that the relative abundance and taxonomic identity of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within AM fungal families closely matched expected values, but this decreased at lower taxonomic levels. Multiple OTUs were observed within single spores, suggesting that using OTUs to estimate species richness may inflate richness estimates and reflect sequence variation within individuals. While HTS may introduce some bias in relative abundance estimates and taxonomic identification, we observed high consistency among replicate samples from the same mock community, indicating that these data can inform ecological patterns.

We measured the amount of root exudate C produced by Q. crispula, as well as environmental factors including solar radiation and soil and air temperature throughout the growing season. The model best explaining the amount of exudate C, based on the lowest Akaike's information criterion, was selected to determine the environmental factors that affect exudation. The quantity of exudates did not show clear seasonality, and instead varied widely among sampling dates. A regression model with daily solar radiation for 1 day before sample collection as the sole factor affecting the quantity of exudates was selected as the best model. Solar radiation, which fluctuated greatly among days, more strongly affected the quantity of exudates produced than factors that fluctuated seasonally, such as average temperature. Furthermore, most root exudates from Q. crispula are released within 1 day of being generated by photosynthesis, rather than over several days.","[Nakayama, Masataka] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Tateno, Ryunosuke] Kyoto Univ, Filed Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Nakayama, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",nakayama.masataka.32x@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696","JSPS-KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26292085, 16H04937, 17H03833]","We would like to thank Chikae Iwaoka and Makoto Yasumatsu for supporting chemical analysis, Karibu Fukuzawa and the member of Forest Information Laboratory for their helpful suggestions.

However, the temporal partitioning of plant transpiration and hillslope flow is still poorly understood. In a growing season, the stable isotopes of precipitation, soil water, groundwater, plant water and hillslope flow in a subtropical climate in Southwest China were determined to assess the compartmentalization of vegetation water use and flow generation. The results suggest that the hillslope flow and plant water have different isotopic characteristics in most cases. The lc-excess values of plants significantly differed from those of the hillslope flow. These different isotopic signatures for plants and the hillslope flow were associated with the different proportions of various water sources in each water pool. Precipitation, the hillslope flow and soil water plot approximately along the local meteoric water line (LMWL), and the studied plant xylem waters plot partly below the LMWL, supporting ecohydrological separation. In this subtropical climate with seasonal droughts, the hydrological separation is temporal and does not occur during the wet season due to the increase in hydrological connectivity. On dry days, the various water sources poorly mix in the subsurface. Thus, the ecohydrological separation between the plant water and hillslope flow water sources varies depending on the rooting depth of plant species and moisture conditions. The implications underlying these findings will be helpful for constructing a process-based ecohydrological model and for understanding the mechanisms underlying the hydrologic interactions between plants and subsurface water flow.","[Zhao, Pei] Shangluo Univ, Coll Urban Rural Planning & Architectural Engn, Shangluo 726000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Pei; Tang, Xiangyu; Tang, Jialiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Peng] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Pei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Tang, XY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xytang@imde.ac.cn,"Tang, Xiang-Yu/D-5349-2009","Tang, Xiang-Yu/0000-0003-0467-9180; Tang, Jialiang/0000-0001-8006-153X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41471188, 41371241, 41790431]; Innovative Talents Promotion Plan in Shaanxi Province [2017KJXX-74]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC006]; 135 Strategic Program of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS [SDS-135-1702]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41471188, 41371241 and 41790431), the Innovative Talents Promotion Plan in Shaanxi Province (2017KJXX-74), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences (QYZDJ-SSW-DQC006) and the 135 Strategic Program of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment (No. SDS-135-1702), CAS.

However, we know little about how intraspecific trait variability mediated the effects of environmental gradients on population stability. We applied generalized multilevel path models to investigate multivariate causal hypotheses that environmental effects on population stability of a macrophyte species - Potamogeton maackianus - are mediated by physiological and morphological traits variability. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured quarterly nine physiological traits, and monthly ten morphological traits from 9720 individuals at 27 plots along water depth gradients in Lake Erhai, China. Results showed that changes in water depth and light availability caused significant shifts in intraspecific trait variability, with cascading direct and indirect effects on temporal stability of P. maackianus. Water depth exerted major control over population stability, both directly and indirectly via shifts in morphological and physiological traits. Light availability affected population stability indirectly by altering morphological traits. Size traits (shoot morphology and root/shoot ratio) and metabolic traits captured the effect of water depth and light availability on population stability with a relative high accuracy. Our study provide a strong support to the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variability mediate the combined effects of variations on water depth and light conditions on the temporal stability of a dominant macrophtye species in Lake Erhai. Maintaining and enhancing trait variability within plant populations may help to buffer negative effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on population stability.","[Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang] Hunan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol, Ecol Dept, Coll Biosci Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang; Lou, Qian; Dai, Taotao; Zhong, Jiayou] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jun; Cao, Te; Ni, Leyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, Donghu South Rd 7, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fang, Shaowen] Hydrol Bur Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Fu, H (reprint author), Hunan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol, Ecol Dept, Coll Biosci Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Cao, T (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, Donghu South Rd 7, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",huifu367@163.com; caote@ihb.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31560145, 31770510, 31760148]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20171BAB214006, 2015ZBBF6008, 20161BAB214153]","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31560145, 31770510, 31760148), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China (Grant No. 20171BAB214006, 2015ZBBF6008, 20161BAB214153).

However, it remains far from clear whether plant biomass partitioning to aboveground and belowground is isometric (equal partitioning) or allometric (unequal partitioning) at community levels and what factors are necessary in order to regulate the partitioning. This study aimed to comprehensively find out the patterns of biomass partitioning and their regulatory factors across forests in China. The data of AGB and BGB were compiled from 1542 samples for communities across forests in China. Standardized major axis regression was conducted to examine whether AGB and BGB were allocated isometrically or allometrically at a community level. Redundancy analysis was used to analyze the relationships of BGB/AGB ratio with climatic factors and soil properties. We found that the slopes of the relationship between logAGB and logBGB were not always comparable to 1.0 (isometric allocation) at community levels, including primary forest, secondary forest, and planted forest. Meanwhile, samples in clay, loam, and sand soil types also presented the same phenomenon. Furthermore, the radically different allocations of AGB and BGB were found in northern and southern China. Environmental factors totally explained 3.86% of the variations in the BGB/AGB ratio at the community level, which include the mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, potential water deficit index, soil carbon content, soil nitrogen content, soil clay, soil loam, soil sand, soil pH, and soil bulk density. In addition, the environmental factors also have effects on the BGB/AGB ratio in other categories. The patterns revealed in this study are helpful for better understanding biomass partitioning and spreading the carbon circle models.","[Sun, Jian; Niu, Shuli] Chinese Acad Sci, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinniu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat &, Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu Inst Biol, 9 Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 640019, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinniu] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal","Niu, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",sniu@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Sun, Jian/I-9740-2016","Sun, Jian/0000-0001-8765-5015","CAS Strategic Priority Research Program [XDA05050702]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31420103917, 31290221, 41661144045]; Thousand Youth Talents Plan Project; Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modelling","This study was jointly supported by CAS Strategic Priority Research Program (grant no.

The response of fungi colonization and host growth were monitored under different concentrations of L. stoechas leaves and essential oil. The major compounds of L. stoechas essential oil were fenchone (47.2%) and 1,8-cineole (14.3%). S. deserticola and R. intraradices colonized successfully the host plants. The plants growth was positively influenced after fungi inoculation. The addition of L. stoechas leaves-flowers in the soil altered mycorrhiza levels. Small amount of L. stoechas leaves-flowers (up to 2 g L-1) or L. stoechas essential oil (up to 25 mg L-1) was beneficial for fungi colonization. The level of inhibition was positively correlated with the added amount of aromatic plant in the soil. Inhibition was recorded in concentrations over 25 mg L-1 (essential oil/soil). It is suggested in soils that have accumulated a large amount of L. stoechas litter, to remove part of it avoiding mycorrhiza inhibition.","[Hassiotis, Christos N.] Etherio Res Lab, Essential Oils, Eratera 50003, Askio, Greece; [Orfanoudakis, Michail] Democritus Univ Thrace, Forest Soil Lab, Dept Forestry & Management Environm & Nat Resourc, Pandazidou St 193, Orestiada 68200, Greece","Hassiotis, CN (reprint author), Etherio Res Lab, Essential Oils, Eratera 50003, Askio, Greece.",chasioti@for.auth.gr; morfan@fmenr.duth.gr,,,,,,77,0,0,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Recent work suggests that biotic interactions among plants and between plants and soil organisms drive key aspects of resource use complementarity. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for integrating positive biotic interactions across guilds of organisms, more specifically between plants and mycorrhizal types, to explain resource use complementarity in plants and its consequences for plant competition. Our overarching hypothesis is that ecosystem functioning increases when more plant species associate with functionally dissimilar mycorrhizal fungi because differing mycorrhizal types will increase coverage of habitat space for and reduce competition among plants. We introduce a recently established field experiment (MyDiv) that uses different pools of tree species that associate with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi to create orthogonal experimental gradients in tree species richness and mycorrhizal associations and present initial results. Finally, we discuss options for future mechanistic studies on resource use complementarity within MyDiv. We show how mycorrhizal types and biotic interactions in MyDiv can be used in the future to test novel questions regarding the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships.","[Ferlian, Olga; Cesarz, Simone; Craven, Dylan; Hines, Jes; Bruelheide, Helge; Buscot, Francois; Haider, Sylvia; Herrmann, Sylvie; Pruschitzki, Ulrich; Schaedler, Martin; Weigelt, Alexandra; Wubet, Tesfaye; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ferlian, Olga; Cesarz, Simone; Hines, Jes; Pruschitzki, Ulrich; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan; Schaedler, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Barry, Kathryn E.; Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge; Haider, Sylvia; Heklau, Heike; Kuehn, Paul] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Buscot, Francois; Herrmann, Sylvie; Wubet, Tesfaye] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Wagg, Cameron] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Ferlian, O (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Ferlian, O (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",olga.ferlian@idiv.de,"Wagg, Cameron/O-4318-2019; Wubet, Tesfaye/C-6241-2012; Schadler, Martin/H-3176-2011; Cesarz, Simone/A-8468-2012; Craven, Dylan/K-2717-2012; Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014; BUSCOT, Francois/A-4125-2016; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Wagg, Cameron/0000-0002-9738-6901; Wubet, Tesfaye/0000-0001-8572-4486; Schadler, Martin/0000-0001-9700-0311; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Craven, Dylan/0000-0003-3940-833X; Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Barry, Kathryn/0000-0001-6893-6479; BUSCOT, Francois/0000-0002-2364-0006; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356",European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [677232]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118],"NE, OF, and UP acknowledge support by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement no. 677232).

In nature, grasses simultaneously establish multiple symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The effect of these multiple interactions on competitive interactions between plants remains poorly understood. 2. In this study, we tested whether endophytes and AMF (Glomus mosseae or Glomus etunicatum) alter plant competition between a subordinate plant species that associates with both symbionts (Achnatherum sibiricum) and a dominant plant species, Stipa grandis, that only associates with one symbiont (AMF). And we hypothesized that endophytes can facilitate the coexistence of the subordinate plant species (A. sibiricum) and the dominant plant species (S. grandis). 3. The results demonstrated that endophyte infection significantly enhanced the competitive ability of the subordinate plant species compared to the dominant plant species. The effects of AMF on plant competition were variable and depended on the identity of the AMF species. Glomus etunicatum gave A. sibiricum plants a higher competitive ability, while G. mosseae gave S. grandis a higher competitive ability. Simultaneous infections of both endophytes and AMF in A. sibiricum also altered the competitive relationships with S. grandis. 4. In conclusion, these results suggest that endophytic fungi can facilitate the coexistence of a subordinate plant species with a dominant plant species. Moreover, endophytes could not only affect the competitive ability of the host plant directly but also indirectly by interacting with different AMF to change the growth of competing plant species.","[Zhou, Yong; Gao, Yuan; Liu, Hui; Gao, Yu-Bao; Ren, An-Zhi] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Xia] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding, Peoples R China; [van der Heijden, Marcel G.

These degraded soils can be restored by using native perennial plants inoculated with specific microorganisms. We studied the changes in root growth and the rhizosphere bacterial community of mesquite seedlings (Prosopis articulata) after inoculation with the endophytic bacteria Bacillus pumilus ES4, over 3 cycles of growth in the same soil under desert climatic conditions, and found that inoculation significantly enhanced root biomass during the growth cycles but not shoot biomass or root and shoot lengths. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that B.pumilus colonized the root cap, apical meristem, and elongation zone, forming small colonies, on roots from soil-grown mesquite. Inoculation also significantly changed the bacterial community structure of rhizophere and nonrhizosphere (without plants) soils based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles. The changes were highly stable, and the bacterial community structure was maintained throughout the experimental period and not affected by plant replacement. The 16S rRNA pyrosequencing confirmed the changes on structure of bacterial community and revealed an impact on the top taxonomic levels analyzed. The rhizospheres of inoculated plants showed a significant increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria coupled with a concomitant decrease in Actinobacteria, whereas an opposite response was observed in nonrhizospheric degraded soils. Overall, inoculation with B.pumilus reduced bacterial diversity but increased the Rhizobium population in the soil. The class Bacilli, despite B.pumilus inoculum, showed minimal variation.","[Galaviz, Cristina; Lopez, Blanca R.; de-Bashan, Luz E.; Bashan, Yoav] Northwestern Ctr Biol Res CIBNOR, Environm Microbiol Grp, Ave IPN 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico; [Lopez, Blanca R.; de-Bashan, Luz E.; Bashan, Yoav] Bashan Inst Sci, 1730 Post Oak Ct, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [de-Bashan, Luz E.; Bashan, Yoav] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, 301 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hirsch, Ann M.; Maymon, Maskit] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hirsch, Ann M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Mol Biol Inst, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Bashan, Y (reprint author), Northwestern Ctr Biol Res CIBNOR, Environm Microbiol Grp, Ave IPN 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico.",bashan@bashanfoundation.org,"Hirsch, Ann M/D-3562-2009","Galaviz, Cristina/0000-0001-5982-8900","CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); UC Mexus-CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Bashan Institute of Science, USA; Shanbrom Family Foundation; CONACYT graduation scholarship [364014]","(CONACYT); UC Mexus-CONACYT; Bashan Institute of Science, USA; Shanbrom Family Foundation; CONACYT graduation scholarship, Grant/Award Number: 364014",,89,2,2,9,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

The widespread expansion of woody shrubs into historically herbaceous alpine plant zones is likely to interact with climate to affect soil microbial community structure and function; however, our understanding of alpine soil ecology remains limited. This study aimed to (i) determine whether the diversity and community composition of soil fungi vary across elevation gradients and to (ii) assess the impact of woody shrub expansion on these patterns. In the White Mountains of California, sagebrush (Artemisia rothrockii) shrubs have been expanding upwards into alpine areas since 1960. In this study, we combined observational field data with a manipulative shrub removal experiment along an elevation transect of alpine shrub expansion. We utilized next-generation sequencing of the ITS1 region for fungi and joint distribution modelling to tease apart effects of the environment and intracommunity interactions on soil fungi. We found that soil fungal diversity declines and community composition changes with increasing elevation. Both abiotic factors (primarily soil moisture and soil organic C) and woody sagebrush range expansion had significant effects on these patterns. However, fungal diversity and relative abundance had high spatial variation, overwhelming the predictive power of vegetation type, elevation and abiotic soil conditions at the landscape scale. Finally, we observed positive and negative associations among fungal taxa which may be important in structuring community responses to global change.","[Collins, Courtney G.; Weber, Soren E.; Diez, Jeffrey M.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Stajich, Jason E.; Pombubpa, Nuttapon] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Microbiol & Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Collins, CG (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",courtney.collins@email.ucr.edu,"Stajich, Jason Eric/C-7297-2008","Stajich, Jason Eric/0000-0002-7591-0020; Collins, Courtney/0000-0001-5455-172X",National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [CA-R-PPA-5062-H]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1701979],"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: CA-R-PPA-5062-H; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1701979",,115,3,3,11,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We hypothesize that in conifers, stocks of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in fine roots are high enough to provide energy for root growth and production throughout the year, even when photosynthesis is reduced. Methods We measured monthly root production (i.e. the number of roots undergoing elongation) and their elongation rate (RER) in mature Picea abies for one year, along a soil temperature gradient (three altitudes of 1400, 1700 and 2000 m). Every two months we harvested needles, branches, stem, large, medium and fine roots, and quantified starch and soluble sugars in each organ using analytical methods and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS). Soil water potential was monitored continuously. We analysed RER data with regard to climate variables and NSC levels of the current and preceding month. Results NIRS was a reliable method for measuring starch and soluble sugars. NSC was high in the crown and roots but very low in the trunk all year round. Soil temperature was positively correlated to RER (of the current month) between 0 and 8 degrees C, above which RER stabilised and was not explained by NSC levels or soil water potential. However, mean RER of fine roots in the month following the measurement of NSC was significantly and negatively correlated to soluble sugar and positively correlated with starch content. Very fine root starch content was also positively correlated with root production in the month following the starch measurement. Conclusion Soil temperature was a major driver of fine root elongation, but at low temperatures only. At soil temperatures > 8 degrees C, no particular driver was dominant. NSC levels were negligible in the stem and root-bases, suggesting that wood production is a major sink that depletes carbohydrates. A large pool of NSC, principally in the form of starch, existed in fine roots of P. abies, and acted as an energy supply for root production throughout the year, even when photosynthesis was limited. Soluble sugars were depleted in fine roots during the growing season, but no relationship was found between fine root production and soluble sugars. The physiological mechanism by which NSC accumulation actively or passively occurs in fine roots is not known but could be due to the symplastic pathway of phloem unloading in conifer root tips, which suggests a passive mechanism.","[Wang, Y.; Mao, Z.; Rey, H.; Stokes, A.] Univ Montpellier, INRA, Amap, CNRS,Ird,Cirad, Montpellier, France; [Bakker, M.

The aims of this study were to quantify the tap and horizontal root structure and evaluate their relationship with the above-ground parts under different groundwater levels in a coastal P. thunbergii forest. Methods Two plots, sea- and land-side, with different groundwater levels, in a P. thunbergii stand, were established, and the entire root-systems of three select trees each were harvested to evaluate the biomass, lengths, and cross-sectional areas of the tap and horizontal roots. Results In the sea-side plot, which had a shallower groundwater level, plate root systems with thicker and longer horizontal roots, but fewer tap roots were observed, whereas tap root systems were well developed in the land-side plots, where the groundwater level was deeper. The root-to-shoot ratio was significantly higher in the sea-side plot than in the land-side plot.

The novel weapons hypothesis suggests that non-native plants bring competitive traits against which native species have not adapted defenses. Novel weapons may directly affect plant competitors by inhibiting germination or growth, or indirectly by attacking competitor plant mutualists (degraded mutualisms hypothesis). Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) are widespread plant invaders that produce potent secondary compounds that negatively impact plant competitors. We tested whether their impacts were consistent with a direct effect on the tree seedlings (novel weapons) or an indirect attack via degradation of seedling mutualists (degraded mutualism). We compared recruitment and performance using three Ulmus congeners and three Betula congeners treated with allelopathic root macerations from allopatric and sympatric ranges. Moreover, given that the allelopathic species would be less likely to degrade their own fungal symbiont types, we used arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species to investigate the effects of F. japonica (no mycorrhizal association) and Rhamnus cathartica (ECM association) on the different fungal types. We also investigated the effects of F. japonica and R. cathartica exudates on AMF root colonization. Our results suggest that the allelopathic plant exudates impact seedlings directly by inhibiting germination and indirectly by degrading fungal mutualists. Novel weapons inhibited allopatric seedling germination but sympatric species were unaffected. However, seedling survivorship and growth appeared more dependent on mycorrhizal fungi, and mycorrhizal fungi were inhibited by allopatric species. These results suggest that novel weapons promote plant invasion by directly inhibiting allopatric competitor germination and indirectly by inhibiting mutualist fungi necessary for growth and survival.","[Pinzone, Philip; Potts, Daniel; Pettibone, Gary; Warren, Robert, II] SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA","Warren, R (reprint author), SUNY Buffalo State, Dept Biol, 1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",hexastylis@gmail.com,,,,,,59,2,3,10,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2018,219,5,,,,,539,548,,10.1007/s11258-018-0816-4,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GB8ZC,WOS:000429362800006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Koyama, A; Harlow, B; Kuske, CR; Belnap, J; Evans, RD",,,,"Koyama, Akihiro; Harlow, Benjamin; Kuske, Cheryl R.; Belnap, Jayne; Evans, R.

However, significantly higher abundance of n-alkanes, a major constituent of foliage wax material, occurred in the elevated compared to ambient [CO2] plots in the soils collected under L. tridentata, but no such difference was found in the soils at plant interspace or the biological soil crusts. There was no significant difference in abundance of microbial phospholipid fatty acids between the CO2 treatments in the soils of either cover types. However, neutral lipid fatty acid abundance was significantly higher under elevated than ambient [CO2] in the soils under L. tridentata, whereas no such significant difference was observed at plant interspace. These results emphasize important roles of the dominant shrubs in SOM formation under elevated [CO2] in arid ecosystems. Elevated [CO2] stimulated growth of L. tridentata in wet years, and aboveground litter deposition via senescence contributed to SOM formation in islands of fertility. In addition, elevated [CO2] stimulated soil microbial turnover rates in rhizosphere of L. tridentata, which left more soil microbial necromass, a major SOM source. We concluded that responses of dominant shrubs to elevated [CO2] can stimulate SOM formation in arid ecosystems, but biological soil crusts may have limited capacity.","[Koyama, Akihiro; Harlow, Benjamin; Evans, R.

However, it remains unclear what specific root traits contribute to the three SOM stabilization mechanisms: recalcitrance against decomposition, occlusion in soil aggregates and interaction with soil minerals and metals. This is likely because research is highly fragmented and hampered by disciplinary barriers. By reviewing both plant functional ecology and soil science literature, we identified 18 different traits: architectural, morphological, physiological, symbiotic and chemical root characteristics, influencing the three SOM stabilization mechanisms. We found that traits increasing root recalcitrance promote short term stabilization by slowing decomposition, but that traits reducing recalcitrance contribute to long term stabilization by reaction of microbial products with mineral surfaces. Root length density, mycorrhizal association and rhizodeposition contribute to microaggregation. These and other traits, such as hemicellulose, soluble compounds, and high root branching index, favor macroaggregation. For stabilization by minerals and metals, those root traits promoting higher microbial activity: root nitrogen, hemicellulose and soluble compound concentrations are fundamental, while polyphenols, and litter Al and Mn also contribute to complexification and stabilization. Root depth distribution is the most important trait to control root C storage and stabilization in the subsoil; once roots have reached deeper soil layers, other traits, such as rhizodeposition and root chemistry, influence interaction with minerals and metals. Both mycorrhizal presence and root suberin promote SOC stabilization by means of all three mechanisms, indicating that these are important targets for continued work. Surprisingly, morphological traits commonly measured, namely specific root length and root diameter, poorly relate to stabilization mechanisms. Alternative traits such as chemical composition of the different root orders, root apex characteristics, quantity and quality of rhizodeposits as well as mycorrhizal fungal traits, should be further investigated. For future research, this review highlights the need to evaluate root decomposition and root-C stabilization concomitantly over the long-term, considering simultaneously root litter quality, estimated by root traits, the microbial products and properties of the soil matrix. The information accrued in this review can be used to evaluate the potential of plant species and cultivars to promote SOM stabilization, based on their root traits.","[Poirier, Vincent] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Stn Rech Agroalimentaire, URDAAT, 79 Rue Cote, Notre Dame Du Nord, PQ J0Z 3B0, Canada; [Roumet, Catherine] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Munson, Alison D.] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Dept Sci Bois & La Foret, Ctr Forest Res, 2405 Rue La Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Poirier, V (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Stn Rech Agroalimentaire, URDAAT, 79 Rue Cote, Notre Dame Du Nord, PQ J0Z 3B0, Canada.",vincent.poirier@uqat.ca,,,"Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [121569]; Groupement de Recherche International ""Dynamique de la biodiversite et traits d'histoire de vie"" (CNRS, France) [BFC 44745]","We acknowledge the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies for financial support through a postdoctoral fellowship attributed to Vincent Poirier and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for a Discovery grant (121569) attributed to Alison D.

Objectives: To describe the colonization of three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculated in two tree legumes and to determine the morphological type of the symbiotic association. Materials and methods: The seeds of Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. and Platymiscium diadelphum S. F. Blake were inoculated with three pure strains of AMF: Rhizophagus manihotis (R. H. Howeler, Sieverd. & N. C. Schenck) C. Walker & A. SchuBler, Funneliformis mosseae (T. H. Nicolson & Gerd.) C. Walker & A. SchuBler y Scutellospora heterogama (T. H. Nicolson & Gerd.) C. Walker & F. E. Sanders. At 105 days, the secondary roots were sampled, clarified and stained with acid fuchsin and trypan blue. The fungal structures were observed under an optical microscope and the colonization percentage was determined. Results and discussion: The colonization of the AMF was greater than 60 %. Thin, transparent and cenocitic hyphae, as well as hylopodia and arbuscules, were observed. In P. dulce, S. heterogama tends to produce more arbuscules. In P. diadelphum, the percentages of colonization and fungal structures of the AMF were similar. The morphological association in the two arboreal species was mainly from the Paris type, with occasional presence of the type Arum. Conclusion: The inocula of the AMF established high symbiotic association with the legumes studied. The applied techniques evidenced the structures of the AMF inside the root and allowed to identify the morphological association of the symbionts.","[Parra-Rivero, Solenny M.; Maciel-De Sousa, Norberto M.; Sanabria-Chopite, Maria E.; Pineda, Juan] Univ Centroccident Lisandro Alvarado, Decanato Agron, Posgrad Agron, Calle 1 Entre Av Gen Patino & Redoma de Agua Viva, Cabudare, Lara, Venezuela","Parra-Rivero, SM (reprint author), Univ Centroccident Lisandro Alvarado, Decanato Agron, Posgrad Agron, Calle 1 Entre Av Gen Patino & Redoma de Agua Viva, Cabudare, Lara, Venezuela.",olennyparra@ucla.edu.ve,,,"Council for Scientific, Humanistic and Technological Development (CDCHT), of the Universidad Centroccidental University Lisandro Alvarado [020-AG-2013]","The authors wish to thank the Council for Scientific, Humanistic and Technological Development (CDCHT), of the Universidad Centroccidental University Lisandro Alvarado, for the partial grant provided to this research through project 020-AG-2013.",,35,0,0,1,6,UNIV AUTONOMA CHAPINGO,"CHAPINGO, EDO DE MEXICO","CUBICULO 113, CHAPINGO, EDO DE MEXICO, 56230, MEXICO",2007-3828,2007-4018,,REV CHAPINGO SER CIE,Rev.

We studied the impact of increasing drought on root exudation and its subsequent recovery in the Mediterranean tree species Quercus ilex L. in a greenhouse study by measuring the amount of total organic carbon in exudates. The amount of exudation per unit root area increased with drought duration and was 21% higher under the most extreme drought scenario compared with the non-droughted control. The amount of root exudation did not differ between the treatments following 6 weeks of re-watering, indicating a strong capacity for recovery in this species. We concluded that drought could affect the amount of root exudation, which could in turn have a large impact on microbial activity in the rhizosphere, and alter these microbial communities, at least in the short term. This tree species may be able to return to normal levels of root exudation after a drought event, but long-term exudate-mediated impacts on Mediterranean forest soils may be an unforeseen effect of drought.","[Preece, Catherine; Farre-Armengol, Gerard; Llusia, Joan; Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Preece, Catherine; Farre-Armengol, Gerard; Llusia, Joan; Penuelas, Josep] CREAF CSIC UAB, CSIC Global Ecol Unit, Bellaterra 08193, Spain","Preece, C (reprint author), CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain.; Preece, C (reprint author), CREAF CSIC UAB, CSIC Global Ecol Unit, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",catherine.preece09@gmail.com,"Preece, Catherine/A-9712-2018; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Llusia, Joan/AAA-8510-2019","Preece, Catherine/0000-0001-6584-3541; ",European FP7 S-Clima project [PIEF-GA-2013-626234]; European Research Council Synergy grantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2013-726 SyG-610028 IMBALANCE-P]; Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2016-79835-P]; Catalan Government [SGR 2014-274],"Funding was provided by the European FP7 S-Clima project PIEF-GA-2013-626234, the European Research Council Synergy grant ERC-2013-726 SyG-610028 IMBALANCE-P, the Spanish Government project CGL2016-79835-P (FERTWARM) and the Catalan Government project SGR 2014-274.",,48,7,8,8,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2018,38,5,,,,,690,695,,10.1093/treephys/tpx163,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,GJ7NV,WOS:000435575100005,29304257,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Ming, AG; Yang, YJ; Liu, SR; Wang, H; Li, YF; Li, H; Nong, Y; Cai, DX; Jia, HY; Tao, Y; Sun, DJ",,,,"Ming, Angang; Yang, Yujing; Liu, Shirong; Wang, Hui; Li, Yuanfa; Li, Hua; Nong, You; Cai, Daoxiong; Jia, Hongyan; Tao, Yi; Sun, Dongjing",,,Effects of Near Natural Forest Management on Soil Greenhouse Gas Flux in Pinus massoniana (Lamb.) and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.)

Near natural forest management is one of the most promising options for improving the function of forests as carbon sinks. However, its effects on greenhouse gas emissions are not yet clear. It is therefore necessary to characterise the effects of near natural forest management on greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon management in plantation ecosystems. We analysed the influence of near natural management on the flux of three major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)) in Pinus massoniana Lamb. and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. plantations. The average emission rates of CO2 and N2O in the near natural plantations were higher than those in the corresponding unimproved pure plantations of P. massoniana and C. lanceolata, and the average absorption rate of CH4 in the pure plantations was lower than that in the near natural plantations. The differences in the CO2 emission rates between plantations could be explained by differences in the C:N ratio of the fine roots. The differences in the N2O emission rates could be attributed to differences in soil available N content and the C:N ratio of leaf litter, while the differences in CH4 uptake rate could be explained by differences in the C:N ratio of leaf litter only. Near natural forest management negatively affected the soil greenhouse gas emissions in P. massoniana and C. lanceolata plantations. The potential impact of greenhouse gas flux should be considered when selecting tree species for enrichment planting.","[Ming, Angang; Li, Hua; Nong, You; Cai, Daoxiong; Jia, Hongyan; Tao, Yi; Sun, Dongjing] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Pingxiang 532600, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yujing; Liu, Shirong; Wang, Hui] State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yujing; Liu, Shirong; Wang, Hui] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Ming, Angang; Yang, Yujing; Li, Hua; Nong, You; Cai, Daoxiong; Jia, Hongyan; Tao, Yi; Sun, Dongjing] Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Pingxiang 532600, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuanfa] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.; Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",mingangang0111@163.com; yangyujing8809@hotmail.com; liusr@caf.ac.cn; wanghui@caf.ac.cn; xianggelilalyf@sina.com; lihua782003@163.com; imnongyou@163.com; rlzxcdx@126.com; rlzxjhy@163.com; tyrzjl@126.com; happysdj@163.com,,"Yang, Yujing/0000-0003-4878-8063","Agriculture College, Guangxi University; fundamental research funds of CAF [CAFYBB2014QA033]; Guangxi forestry science and technology projects (Document of Guangxi forestry department) [37]; Guangxi Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province [2014GXNSFBA118100]; International cooperation projects [2015DFA31440]; China's National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470627]","We are grateful to Ji Zeng, Zhang Zhao, Zhaoying Li, Lili Li, Wenlian Zhou, Yuan He, Zhongguo Li, Hai Chen and Yanling Huang of Chinese Academy of Forestry's Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry for their assistance in field sampling and data collection.

Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong is a tree found in contrasting light environments and used in reforestation programs because of its rapid growth. This study analyzed the performance of tamboril seedlings grown in three light environments: FSfull sun (100% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a red/far-red ratio (R/FR) of 1.66), Sshade net (38% of PAR and a R/FR of 1.54) and IInsulfilm((R)) (Insulfilm, SAo Paulo, Brazil) shade cloth (24% of PAR and a R/FR of 0.69). Greater net assimilation, higher root/shoot ratio, higher stomatal density, and reduced leaf area are some of the functional traits developed by tamboril to acclimate to full sun. On the other hand, a larger leaf area associated with a greater specific leaf area, higher leaf area ratio, higher leaf number and leafing intensity, as well as higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are among the most important traits for tamboril to acclimate to shade. The seedlings growing in FS displayed the best quality index. However, the traits developed in the nursery under each light condition could promote the successful installation and survival of tamboril seedlings under similar conditions in the field.","[Naves, Vicente Luiz] Univ Lavras UFLA, Dept Biol, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil; [Rambal, Serge] CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Barbosa, Joao Paulo R.

Despite their importance, relatively little is known about the effects of livestock grazing on different functional groups of fungi. Methods We used structural equation modelling to examine how grazing by domestic livestock and native herbivores, and aridity, plant cover and soil carbon influenced four functional groups of soil fungi (ectomycorrhizal fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dung saprobes, plant pathogens) from three microsites (tree, shrub, grass) at 54 woodland sites across 0.4 million km(2) of dryland in eastern Australia. Results Structural equation modelling showed that aridity influenced fungi indirectly by affecting different herbivores and by changing plant cover, which had different effects on different fungal groups. Rabbit grazing had a direct negative effect on ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, most likely by disrupting hyphal networks through soil disturbance. Increased cattle grazing was directly positively associated with fungal dung saprobe abundance, and indirectly, negatively associated with dung saprobes by suppressing the positive effects of soil carbon. Sheep had direct and indirect negative effects on the abundance of plant pathogens. Conclusions Grazing was always an important predictor of the relative abundance of all fungal groups, either directly or indirectly. Thus, overgrazing is likely to have substantial effects on a range of important soil processes controlled by these microorganisms. Overall, our work indicates that increasing grazing, linked to on-going land use intensification to support a growing global population, will have major impacts on fungal functional groups.","[Eldridge, David J.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol Fisa & Quim Inorgan, Calle Tulipan Sin, Mostoles 28933, Spain","Eldridge, DJ (reprint author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",d.eldridge@unsw.edu.au,"Eldridge, David/H-3532-2019","DELGADO-BAQUERIZO, MANUEL/0000-0002-6499-576X",,,,35,4,4,6,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2018,426,2-Jan,,,,,51,60,,10.1007/s11104-018-3617-6,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GF4VR,WOS:000431962400004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gonzalez, JB; Petipas, RH; Franken, O; Kiers, ET; Veblen, KE; Brody, AK",,,,"Gonzalez, Jonathan B.; Petipas, Renee H.; Franken, Oscar; Kiers, E.

Here, we hypothesized that herbivore exclusion changes the AMF community and alters the ability of AMF to enhance plant tolerance to grazing. We grew the perennial bunchgrass, Themeda triandra Forssk in inoculum from soils collected in the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment where treatments representing different levels of herbivory have been in place since 1995. We assessed AMF diversity in the field, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and compared fungal diversity among treatments. We conducted clipping experiments in the greenhouse and field and assessed regrowth. Plants inoculated with AMF from areas accessed by wild herbivores and cattle had greater biomass than non-inoculated controls, while plants inoculated with AMF from where large herbivores were excluded did not benefit from AMF in terms of biomass production. However, only the inoculation with AMF from areas with wild herbivores and no cattle had a positive effect on regrowth, relative to clipped plants grown without AMF. Similarly, in the field, regrowth of plants after clipping in areas with only native herbivores was higher than other treatments. Functional differences in AMF were evident despite little difference in AMF species richness or community composition.

One explanation is pathogen accumulation in the center of a long-lived plant, which could cause central dieback and the formation of a ring as the plant grows toward pathogen-free soil. We tested this mechanism by comparing the growth of blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) in live and sterilized soils from inside or outside naturally occurring grass rings. Field collected roots from the inner edge of grass rings had higher fungal colonization than roots from the outer edge, suggesting the potential for intensified pathogen interactions on the inside of rings. However, while plants grown in live soils performed worse than those in sterile soils, this pathogenic effect did not differ between soils collected from inside versus outside of grass rings. Further work on the spatial distribution of plant-microbe interactions is needed to confirm their direct role in ring formation. Our findings suggest that soil and root microbes, in addition to known mechanisms such as soil hydrology, potentially promote ring formation of a widespread North American grass species.","[Carlton, Lance; Chung, Y.

Willows are usually planted in marginal lands like flood prone areas. For willow plantations developed from rootless cuttings, the establishment phase is crucial, because the cuttings are still developing a shoot and root system and have a higher vulnerability to stress. A flooding episode during this early period may have a negative effect upon plants. We analyzed the responses to flooding of eight willow genotypes, representing important species from the economic and ecological point of view (Salix alba, S. matsudana, S. amygdaloides and S. matsudana x S. nigra hybrids). The treatments started when the plants were 2 months old and lasted for 3 weeks. They were identified as: Control (watered to field capacity); F10 (plants submerged 10 cm above soil surface) and F50 (plants submerged 50 cm above soil surface). The F50 treatment showed a greater growth reduction than the F10 treatment in most clones, either measured in height, diameter or total biomass. Both flooding treatments reduced significantly the root-to-shoot ratio compared to control plants. The F50 treatment increased the leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area in all genotypes. Both treatments changed plant and leaf traits in different ways according to the depth of the floodwater. These changes may have lasting effects on growth recovery in the post-flooding period. Willow clones with a fast initial growth will be the best option to minimize growth reduction in areas prone to experience flooding episodes.","[Rodriguez, Maria E.; Doffo, Guillermo N.; Luquez, Virginia M.

Manipulating the light regime in forests is one of the main tools available to control the forest development. This study analysed the effect of a drastic light addition through gap creation on beech saplings (Pagus sylvalica L.) that had initially established under the canopy of mature trees. Altogether 6 gaps of varying size were created on an area of 4 ha. A total of 51 saplings were incorporated in this study. The saplings' above- and belowground biomass compartments were destructively harvested along a light gradient. Relationships between light availability and growth increment, stress relief, biomass allocation, and growth morphology were analysed. Along the gradient of increasing light availability, beech saplings responded with an increased diameter growth, whereas the height growth remained unaffected. Also the root mass fraction increased at the expense of the leaf mass fraction. Other biomass compartments showed no significant trend. The mean branch weight also increased and the specific leaf area decreased. Other morphological traits were not affected by the light availability. The results lead to the conclusion that the morphological plasticity of the beech saplings towards light was not as high as initially expected. Furthermore, the sudden increase of light availability did not impose stress on the saplings. Finally, managing the light regime is appropriate to achieve specific goals.","[Annighoefer, Peter] Univ Gottingen, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Annighofer, P (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",pannigh@gwdg.de,,,,,,60,5,5,5,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

When seedlings of deciduous Cappadocian maple (Acer cappadocicum Gled.) were grown in a greenhouse in a loamy soil under a wide range of soil compactions, all morphological variables studied changed significantly with increasing SPR. The relationships between increasing SPR and all morphological responses except lateral root length followed a negative quadratic curve. All biomass variables except lateral root biomass showed a bell-shaped response with respect to SPR, with a maximum biomass variable between 0.6 and 1.2 MPa, decreasing at higher soil compaction values. All allocation ratios were significantly affected by soil penetration resistance. Biomass allocation to roots was also affected by soil compaction. There was not a significant relationship between the specific stem length and increasing soil penetration resistance. The specific root length showed two trends to increasing SPR; it first decreased in response to the moderate compaction treatment (up to about 1.2 MPa), then increased significantly. We concluded that increasing soil compaction caused morphological changes to root and shoot sections of A. cappadocicum seedlings.","[Jourgholami, Meghdad] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Alborz POB 31585-4314, Karaj, Iran","Jourgholami, M (reprint author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Alborz POB 31585-4314, Karaj, Iran.",mjgholami@ut.ac.ir,"Jourgholami, Meghdad/L-4512-2019","Jourgholami, Meghdad/0000-0003-3676-278X",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [93014726],This study was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) (No. 93014726).,,43,1,1,2,14,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

These feedbacks are driven by the variable modification of soil microbial communities by different plant species. However, other factors besides plant species can influence soil communities and potentially interact with plant-microbial feedbacks. We tested for plant-microbial feedbacks in two Eucalyptus species, E. globulus and E. obliqua, and the influence of forest fire on these feedbacks. We collected soils from beneath mature trees of both species within native forest stands on the Forestier Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia, that had or had not been burnt by a recent forest fire. These soils were subsequently used to inoculate seedlings of both species in a glasshouse experiment. We hypothesized that (i) eucalypt seedlings would respond differently to inoculation with conspecific versus heterospecific soils (i.e., exhibit plant-microbial feedbacks) and (ii) these feedbacks would be removed by forest fire. For each species, linear mixed effects models tested for differences in seedling survival and biomass in response to inoculation with conspecific versus heterospecific soils that had been collected from either unburnt or burnt stands. Eucalyptus globulus displayed a response consistent with a positive plant-microbial feedback, where seedlings performed better when inoculated with conspecific versus heterospecific soils. However, this effect was only present when seedlings were inoculated with unburnt soils, suggesting that fire removed the positive effect of E. globulus inoculum. These findings show that external environmental factors can interact with plant-microbial feedbacks, with possible implications for plant community structure and dynamics.","[Senior, John K.; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M.; Potts, Brad M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Senior, John K.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SLU, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Schweitzer, Jennifer A.; Bailey, Joseph K.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA; [Potts, Brad M.] Univ Tasmania, ARC Training Ctr Forest Value, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Senior, JK (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SLU, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",john.senior@slu.se,"Potts, Brad M/C-6489-2013; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/J-7275-2014","Potts, Brad M/0000-0001-6244-289X; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/0000-0003-4801-4412",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120102889],"We thank Hugh Fitzgerald for his assistance in the field as well as assisting with the planting, measurement, and harvesting the experiment.

It consists of many sub-components, such as aboveground plant respiration and belowground root and microbial respiration, each of which may respond differently to abiotic factors, and thus to global climate change. To correctly predict future carbon cycles in forest ecosystems, R-eco must therefore be partitioned and understood for each of its various components. In this study we used the eddy covariance technique together with manual and automated closed-chambers to quantify the individual components of R-eco in a temperate beech forest at diel, seasonal and annual time scales. R-eco was measured by eddy covariance while respiration rates from soil, tree stems and isolated coarse tree roots were measured bi-hourly by an automated closed-chamber system. Soil respiration (R-soil) was measured in intact plots, and heterotrophic R-soil was measured in trenched plots. Tree stem (R-stem) and coarse root (R-root) respiration were measured by custom made closed-chambers. We found that the contribution of R-stem, to total R-eco varied across the year, by only accounting for 6% of R-eco during winter and 16% during the summer growing season. In contrast R-soil was approximately half of R-eco during winter (52%), spring (45%) and summer (49%), while the contribution increased to 79% during autumn. Based on observed fluxes in the trenched and intact soil plots, we found that autotrophic R-soil accounted for 34% of R-soil during summer, i.e. a relatively low fractional estimate compared to findings from other studies. It is likely that dead roots were still decomposing in the trenched soil plots thus causing overestimation of heterotrophic R-soil. Diel R-stem and R-root measurements showed a distinct pattern during summer with the highest respiration rates around 13:00-15:00 CET for R-stem, and the highest respiration seen from 9:00-15:00 for R-root. In contrast, R-soil showed the lowest respiration during daytime with no clear difference in the diel pattern between the intact and trenched soil plots. Finally, we calculated annual R-soil for different transects, and found that annual R-soil estimated from the previously used transect at the site was underestimated due to R-soil of the transect not being representative for the spatial heterogeneity of R-soil at the site. This highlights the importance of performing a sufficient number of chamber measurements at a site to adequately capture the spatial variation and estimate R-soil correctly.","[Braendholt, Andreas; Ibrom, Andreas; Larsen, Klaus Steenberg; Pilegaard, Kim] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Environm, Lyngby, Denmark; [Larsen, Klaus Steenberg] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark","Braendholt, A (reprint author), Bygning 115, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",andbr@env.dtu.dk,"Larsen, Klaus S/C-7549-2015","Larsen, Klaus S/0000-0002-1421-6182","Danish Ministry for Research, Innovation and Higher Education; Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF - 1323-00182]","This study was funded by the Danish Ministry for Research, Innovation and Higher Education, the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF - 1323-00182).",,88,4,5,4,50,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

We made our fungal community comparisons based on high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of fungal ribosomal DNA of soil samples associated with the roots of different species of maple collected from six sites throughout Central Pennsylvania. In our system, we found that weedy species, regardless of nativity, had the greatest soil fungal richness and that the nonnative invasive Norway maple had the highest abundance of mycorrhizal mutualists. Despite that much of the fungal community variability in our system was attributable to inter-site variability, we found that the core fungal communities associated with nonnative tree species were an inclusively larger set that included nearly all of those associated with native trees in addition to many not found with the natives, and the core communities of non-weedy species were largely a subset of those associated with weedy maples. In addition to confirming the strong influence that site variation has on soil fungal communities, our findings are also largely consistent with positive feedback from native fungal communities, possible co-invasion by fungal associates that are only associated with the nonnative trees, and generally add to the growing number of studies that have observed a greater abundance of mutualists associated with invasive trees that interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","[Toole, David R.; Lamendella, Regina; Muth, Norris Z.] Juniata Coll, Dept Biol, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA; [Cannon, Gabrielle H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, McKusick Nathans Inst Genet Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Brislawn, Colin J.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Div Biol Sci, Richland, WA USA; [Graves, Jennifer M.] Trout Unltd, Lock Haven, PA USA; [Muth, Theodore R.] CUNY Brooklyn Coll, Dept Biol, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA","Muth, NZ (reprint author), Juniata Coll, Dept Biol, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA.",muth@juniata.edu,"Muth, Norris Z./C-3324-2008","Muth, Norris Z./0000-0002-8005-4492",GCAT-SEEK through the National Science Foundation [DBI-1248096]; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Juniata College Student Research Fellowship Committee,"Funding for this project was provided by GCAT-SEEK through the National Science Foundation (DBI-1248096), by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and by Juniata College Student Research Fellowship Committee.

We investigate changes in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community composition across a precipitation gradient in North American grasslands as well as changes occurring with varying degrees of site disturbance that have resulted in invasive plant establishment. We find strong differentiation of AM fungal communities in undisturbed remnant grasslands across the precipitation gradient, whereas communities in disturbed grasslands were more homogeneous. These changes in community differentiation with disturbance are consistent with more stringent environmental filtering of AM fungal communities in undisturbed sites that may also be promoted by more rigid functional constraints imposed on AM fungi by the native plant communities in these areas. The AM fungal communities in eastern grasslands were particularly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, with disturbed sites having low numbers of AM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) commonly found in undisturbed sites, and also the proliferation of AM fungal OTUs in disturbed sites. This proliferation of AM fungi in eastern disturbed sites coincided with increased soil phosphorus availability and is consistent with evidence suggesting the fungi represented by these OTUs would provide reduced benefits to native plants. The differentiation of AM fungal communities along the precipitation gradient in undisturbed grasslands but not in disturbed sites is consistent with AM fungi aiding plant adaptation to climate, and suggests they may be especially important targets for conservation and restoration in order to help maintain or re-establish diverse grassland plant communities.","[House, Geoffrey L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 2041 Haworth Hall,1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, 2041 Haworth Hall,1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [House, Geoffrey L.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","House, GL (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.; House, GL (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",ghouse@lanl.gov,,,Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) [RC-2330]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1556664],"K.

The net impact of invasive plants on soil biota has been recognized; however, the relative contributions of different resource input pathways have not been quantified. Through a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial field experiment, a pair of invasive and native plant species (Spartina alterniflora vs. Phragmites australis) was compared to determine the relative impacts of their living roots or shoots and root litter on soil microbial and nematode communities. Living root identity affected bacteria-to-fungi PLFA ratios, abundance of total nematodes, plant-feeding nematodes and omnivorous nematodes. Specifically, the plant-feeding nematodes were 627% less abundant when living roots of invasive S. alterniflora were present than those of native P. australis. Likewise, shoot and root biomass (within soil at 0-10 cm depth) of S. alterniflora was, respectively, 300 and 100% greater than those of P. australis. These findings support the enemy release hypothesis of plant invasion. Root litter identity affected other components of soil microbiota (that is, bacterial-feeding nematodes), which were 34% more abundant in the presence of root litter of P. australis than S. alterniflora. Overall, more variation associated with nematode community structure and function was explained by differences in living roots than root or shoot litter for this pair of plant species sharing a common habitat but contrasting invasion degrees. We conclude that belowground resource input is an important mechanism used by invasive plants to affect ecosystem structure and function.","[Zhang, Pei; Li, Bo; Wu, Jihua] Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Neher, Deborah A.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Wu, JH (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",ritazhang1991@gmail.com; Deborah.Neher@uvm.edu; bool@fudan.edu.cn; jihuawu@fudan.edu.cn,"Neher, Deborah/H-2716-2019; Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Neher, Deborah/0000-0002-9647-8783; Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371258]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430404]; Collaborative Innovation Center for Biodiversity and Conservation in the Three Parallel Rivers Region of China,"This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41371258), National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2013CB430404) and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biodiversity and Conservation in the Three Parallel Rivers Region of China.",,63,1,1,11,73,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2018,21,3,,,,,469,481,,10.1007/s10021-017-0162-8,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA7YZ,WOS:000428556200006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Settineri, G; Mallamaci, C; Mitrovic, M; Sidari, M; Muscolo, A",,,,"Settineri, Giovanna; Mallamaci, Carmelo; Mitrovic, Miroslava; Sidari, Maria; Muscolo, Adele",,,Effects of different thinning intensities on soil carbon storage in Pinus laricio forest of Apennine South Italy,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pine forest; Carbon storage; Clear cut; Dendrometric parameters; Thinning intensity; Soil biological activity,FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-MATTER; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; TEMPERATE FOREST; LAND-USE; NITROGEN; RESPIRATION; MANAGEMENT; PLANTATIONS,"This study investigated, in a Pinus laricio forest of south Italy, how systematic thinning of different intensities (intense thinning, T45; moderate thinning, T25; clear cut, CC; and no thinning, T0) affected soil biological properties, organic matter trend and carbon (C) storage in soil and plants. Soil carbon content and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio were significantly higher in the T45 than in control, T25 and CC. Under T45, the soils had also the highest enzymatic activities, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and colonies of fungi and bacteria. The humification parameters (humification ratio, HR; the degree of humification, DH; humification index, HI) indicated T45 as the best silvicultural practice-approach method to manage Pinus laricio forest for increasing soil carbon storage. The dendrometric parameters evidenced that T45 caused the greatest increment in wood growth (diameter and height), showing that the positive effect of the intense systematic thinning (T45) on the mechanical stability of plantation was related to the ability of trees to accumulate large amounts of carbon in their wood tissues. These data were confirmed by wood density value that was the highest in pine trees under the T45. This study showed that in Pinus laricio forest under T45 C stock increased in soil and plant, already 4 years after thinning.","[Settineri, Giovanna; Mallamaci, Carmelo; Sidari, Maria; Muscolo, Adele] Mediterranea Univ, Agr Dept, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Mitrovic, Miroslava] Univ Belgrade, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankovic, Dept Ecol, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, Belgrade 11060, Serbia","Muscolo, A (reprint author), Mediterranea Univ, Agr Dept, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",amuscolo@unirc.it,"Muscolo, Adele M/O-5875-2015","Muscolo, Adele M/0000-0002-0439-1614","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of Serbia [173018]; DIBAF, UNITUS Viterbo, Italy","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of Serbia, Grant No. 173018 and by Ph.D. scholarship DIBAF, UNITUS Viterbo, Italy.

Decomposition is a vital process underlying many ecosystem functions. Although a growing number of studies have tested how litter richness affects the decomposition of above-ground plant organs, knowledge remains limited about the decomposition of root mixtures. Here, we used a field experiment in a subtropical forest to investigate how species richness in root litter mixtures (air-dried fresh fine roots) affects the decomposition of root litter material. 2. On the basis of the concept of resource complementarity, we hypothesized that root litter would decompose faster as the richness of the root litter mixture increased. In addition, we expected the presence of detritivores would modify the effect of root richness on mass loss, because detritivores might experience bottom-up effects from specific plant species and might affect microbial decomposer communities. 3. We found that the richness level of root litter mixtures did not affect mass loss in the absence of detritivores. In the presence of detritivores, all root litter types decomposed faster. Notably, the positive effect of detritivores was stronger at low root litter richness than at high root litter richness, particularly during the early stages of decomposition (the first two sampling points) when litter mass loss was roughly double at low root litter richness compared to that at high root litter richness. The composition of the root fungal community measured at the last sampling point did not differ significantly across root richness levels, and was not affected by the presence of detritivores. 4. Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that detritivores modify the relationship between root litter diversity and root litter decomposition in subtropical forest ecosystems. This highlights an importance of cascade effects between different trophic organisms on ecosystem functioning.","[Li, Yinong; Liang, Yu; Zhang, Naili; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yinong; Zhou, Xiaomei] Jilin Normal Univ, Inst Modern Agr Biotechnol, Siping, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Special Anim & Plant Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Veen, G.

In this study, the pattern of dominance by families in Glomeromycota in maritime sand dunes worldwide ""was examined to test the hypothesis that soil pH is a major factor shaping AMF community structure. We analyzed 38 publications from the literature containing data on soil chemistry and species compOsition and calculated relative species richness (RSR) for each of the families Gigasporaceae, Glomeraceae, and Acaulosporaceae. Regression and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the relationship and association of RSR of families with soil pH, temperature and precipitation and biogeographical realms. Of the 119 AMF species found in sand dunes, members of Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae dominated in all studies. In Nearctic dunes, Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae co-dominated fungal communities while Gigasporaceae dominated in Neotropical dunes and Glomeraceae dominated Palearctic and Oriental/Sino-Japanese realms. Overall, the proportion of species in Gigasporaceae was above 40% in soil pH < 6.5 while the proportion of those in Glomeraceae exceeded 40% in soil pH > 6.5. Soil pH was negatively correlated with RSR of Gigasporaceae but positively correlated with RSR of Glomeraceae. Thirteen species were detected in at least four biogeographical realms and are considered cosmopolitan. Redundancy analysis evidenced soil pH and one Moran's spatial variable as significant predictors of Glomeromycota family composition. Moran's I correlograms showed positive spatial autocorrelation only at distances < 2000 km for soil pH and family composition. We conclude that soil pH was a major factor influencing the dominance of Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae in sand dunes worldwide, and the proportional dominance of each family was distinct amongst biogeographical realms.

However, little is known regarding the three-dimensional distribution of fine roots in savanna ecosystems at the landscape scale. We quantified spatial patterns of fine root density to a depth of 1.2 m in a subtropical savanna landscape using spatially specific sampling. Kriged maps revealed that fine root density was highest at the centers of woody patches, decreased towards the canopy edges, and reached lowest values within the grassland matrix throughout the entire soil profile. Lacunarity analyses indicated that spatial heterogeneities of fine root density decreased continuously to a depth of 50 cm and then increased in deeper portions of the soil profile across this landscape. This vertical pattern might be related to inherent differences in root distribution between trees/shrubs and herbaceous species, and the presence/absence of an argillic horizon across this landscape. The greater density of fine roots beneath woody patches in both upper and lower portions of the soil profile suggests an ability to acquire disproportionately more resources than herbaceous species, which may facilitate the development and persistence of woody patches across this landscape.","[Zhou, Yong; Boutton, Thomas W.; Wu, X.

Using monoculture plots of six ECM and eight AM tropical trees planted in a common garden, we examined whether the contrasting effects of ECM and AM trees on soil N cycling could be explained by their differences in plant traits. Furthermore, rhizosphere effects on soil N transformations and soil exploration by fine roots were also measured to assess whether ECM and AM trees differed in N acquisition capacities. Results showed that soil NH4+-N concentration, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were markedly lower, but soil C:N ratio was significantly higher beneath ECM trees than beneath AM trees. This more closed N cycling caused by ECM trees was attributed to their resource-conservative traits, especially the poorer leaf litter decomposability compared with AM trees. To adapt to their induced lower soil N availability, ECM trees were found to have greater rhizosphere effects on NO3--N concentration, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates to mine N, and higher soil exploration in terms of root length density to scavenge N from soils, indicating that these two strategies work in synergy to meet N demand of ECM trees. These findings suggest that ECM and AM trees have contrasting effects on soil N cycling owing to their differences in leaf litter decomposability and correspondingly possess different N acquisition capacities.","[Lin, Guigang; Zeng, De-Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, CN-110016 Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Lin, Guigang; Zeng, De-Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Daqinggou Ecol Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dali; Li, Liang; Ma, Chengen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Forest Ecosyst Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dali; Li, Liang; Ma, Chengen] Chinese Acad Sci, Qianyanzhou Ecol Stn, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China","Lin, GG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, CN-110016 Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Lin, GG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Daqinggou Ecol Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",linguigang@126.com,,"Zeng, De-Hui/0000-0002-3130-3050","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC002]; National Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAD07B0505]","This work was supported by the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (no.

The assemblages of bacterivorous nematodes in the LMA fraction were significantly different from those in the MA and SMA fractions, primarily because of the higher abundance of the dominant genus Protorhabditis. Results of structural equation modelling indicated that the ratios of B/F and GP/GN showed stronger positive correlations with the sizes and turnover rates of SOC pools in the MA fraction compared with the LMA fraction. Conversely, bacterivores exhibited indirect relationships with the sizes and turnover rates of SOC pools through the B/F ratio in the SMA and LMA fractions. Taken together, these results highlight the functional role of nematodes and microbial community in controlling SOC pool dynamics at the aggregate scale.","[Jiang, Yuji; Qian, Haiyan; Wang, Xiaoyue; Chen, Lijun; Sun, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, 71 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Qian, Haiyan] Ctr Remote Sensing Informat Syst Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330046, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Manqiang; Li, Huixin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Sun, B (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, 71 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",bsun@issas.ac.cn,"Liu, Manqiang/G-6566-2012; Li, huixin/H-5573-2011","Liu, Manqiang/0000-0001-6654-7795; ","National Key RD Project [2016YDFD0200309]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15030201, KFZD-SW-112]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41530856, 41771297]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB441003]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceJiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research FundsNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20171520]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2017361]","We thank Guangqiang Long for his works on the field experiment.

However, little is known about spatial patterns of delta N-15 within soil profiles in arid and semiarid ecosystems, especially those undergoing vegetation change with a distinct shift in dominance and/or functional type. We quantified how changes from grass to woody plant dominance altered spatial patterns of delta N-15 throughout a 1.2 m soil profile by collecting 320 spatially-specific soil cores in a 160 m x 100 m subtropical savanna landscape that has undergone encroachment by Prosopis glandulosa (an N-2-fixer) during the past century. Leaf delta N-15 was comparable among different plant life-forms, while fine roots from woody species had significantly lower delta N-15 than herbaceous species across this landscape. Woody encroachment significantly decreased soil delta N-15 throughout the entire soil profile, and created horizontal spatial patterns of soil delta N-15 that strongly resembled the spatial distribution of woody patches and were evident within each depth increment. The lower soil delta N-15 values that characterized areas beneath woody canopies were mostly due to the encroaching woody species, especially the N-2-fixer P. glandulosa, which delivered N-15-depleted organic matter via root turnover throughout the soil profile. Soil delta N-15 increased with depth, reached maximum values at intermediate depths, and slightly decreased at greater depths. This vertical pattern may be related to the decrease of N-15-depleted organic matter inputs with depth, and to the presence of a subsurface clay-rich argillic horizon at intermediate depths across this landscape, which may favor the accumulation of N-15-enriched residues. These results indicate that succession from grassland to woodland has altered the spatial variation in soil delta N-15 across the landscape and to considerable depth, suggesting significant changes in the relative rates of N-inputs vs. N-losses in this subtropical system after vegetation change.","[Zhou, Yong; Mushinski, Ryan M.; Hyodo, Ayumi; Ben Wu, X.; Boutton, Thomas W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mushinski, Ryan M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Zhou, Y (reprint author), TAMU, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Kleberg Ctr, Rm 210,474 Olsen Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",zhouyong1222@tamu.edu,"Zhou, Yong/H-9048-2019; Wu, X.

The study was performed at three sites (Penhalonga, Rotanda and Inhamacari) in the western highlands of Manica province in Mozambique, bordering Zimbabwe. One 30 m x 30 m sampling plot was established for each forest type per site. Pre-tested allometric equations were used to determine total C stocks within aboveground tree biomass of each forest type and data from the literature on the relationship between aboveground and belowground biomass were used to estimate C stocks in belowground woody biomass (i.e. coarse roots). Measured soil and litter layer C data were taken from a previous study. Carbon stocks in mountain miombo woodland were used as a baseline to estimate C sequestration at the ecosystem scale, i.e. net ecosystem production (NEP) in the plantations, considering 34 years as stand age of the planted forests. Total ecosystem C stocks in miombo woodlands (similar to 116 Mg ha(-1)) were significantly lower than in stands of P. taeda (363 Mg ha(-1)) and E. grandis (similar to 407 Mg ha(-1)). Carbon sequestration rate at ecosystem scale (NEP) was 7.24 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in P. taeda stands and 8.54 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in E. grandis stands. NEP was dominated by the increment in biomass (similar to 80%). This was also reflected in higher ratio between biomass C and soil organic C stocks in the plantations compared with miombo forest. The plantation species showed similar performance with respect to total C stocks and NEP. It was concluded that plantations of P. taeda or E. grandis have significant potential to increase C stocks and C sequestration rate in both soil and tree biomass on replacing degraded mountain miombo woodlands in the western highlands of Manica province.

A popular framework for understanding plant responses to drought characterizes species along a spectrum from isohydry to anisohydry based on their regulation of gas exchange and leaf water potential under drying conditions. One prediction that arises from this theory is that plant drought responses may hinge, in part, on their usage of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools. For example, trees that respond to drought by closing stomates (i.e., isohydric) are predicted to deplete NSC reserves to maintain metabolism, whereas plants that keep stomata open during water stress (i.e., anisohydric), may show little change or even increases in NSC concentration. However, empirical tests of this theory largely rely on aboveground measurements of NSC, ignoring the potentially conflicting responses of root NSC pools. We sought to test these predictions by subjecting potted saplings of Quercus alba L. (an anisohydric species) and Liriodendron tulipifera L. (an isohydric species) to a 6 week experimental drought. We found that stem NSC concentrations were depleted in the isohydric L. tulipifera but maintained in the anisohydric Q. alba-as predicted. However, when scaled to whole-plant NSC content, the drought-induced decreases in stem NSCs in L. tulipifera were offset by increases in root NSCs (especially soluble sugars), resulting in no net change to whole-plant NSC content. Similarly, root sugars increased in Q. alba in response to drought. This increase was concurrent with declines in growth, suggesting a potential trade-off between allocation of photoassimilates to root sugars vs biomass during drought. Collectively, our results suggest that the responses of NSC in coarse roots can differ from stems, and indicate a prominent role of coarse roots in mitigating drought-induced declines in whole-tree NSC pools.","[Kannenberg, Steven A.; Phillips, Richard P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47403 USA; [Novick, Kimberly A.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Kannenberg, SA (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47403 USA.",sakannen@indiana.edu,"Phillips, Richard P/C-6429-2009","Kannenberg, Steven/0000-0002-4097-9140","Department of Energy, through the Ameriflux Management Project","Funding was by the Department of Energy, through the Ameriflux Management Project administered by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",,47,2,3,9,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2018,38,4,,,,,582,590,,10.1093/treephvs/tpx119,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,GJ7NK,WOS:000435573900008,29036648,,,,10/31/19J,"Suarez, JO; Pajares, JA; Diez, JJ",,,,"Olaizola Suarez, Jaime; Alberto Pajares, Juan; Javier Diez, Julio",,,In vitro antagonism of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi against Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium verticillioides,FORESTRY CHRONICLE,,,English,Article,,,,,,biological control; edible ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM); seedling diseases; in vitro selection; culture filtrates,ECTOTROPHIC MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DAMPING-OFF; PAXILLUS-INVOLUTUS; LACCARIA-LACCATA; ROOT-ROT; PATHOGENIC INFECTIONS; PINUS-TABULAEFORMIS; INTEGRATED CONTROL; SPRUCE SEEDLINGS; RESISTANCE,"Twenty-one isolates of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) of 15 different species were tested in vitro for mycelial growth and spore germination against two isolates each of Fusarium oxysporum and F. verticillioides.

In paired cultures, growth of all Fusariumisolates was significantly reduced by Rhizopogon roseolus, Suillus luteus, Tricholoma portentosum, Amanita rubescens, Amanita ovoidea, Boletus fragrans and Laccaria laccata. Spore germination of all Fusariumisolates was strongly inhibited by culture filtrates of R. roseolus and the two S. luteus isolates. Different behavior between ectomycorrhizal fungi and Fusarium species, as well as among isolates of the same species was observed in both assays. Inhibition of Fusarium species suggests that several isolates of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi have a high potential for biological control of damping off.

Although soil pH influences dispersivity, it is usually relatively constant within a site, and thus not considered a driver of aggregation dynamics. However, land-use change that results in shifts in tree-species composition can result in alteration of soil pH, owing to species-specific traits, e.g., support of nitrogen fixation and Al accumulation. In a long-term, randomized complete block experiment in which climate, soil type, and previous land-use history were similar, we evaluated effects of individual native tropical tree species on water-stable macroaggregate size distributions in an Oxisol. We conducted this study at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, in six vegetation types: 25-year-old plantations of four tree species grown in monodominant stands; an unplanted Control; and an adjacent mature forest. Tree species significantly influenced aggregate proportions in smaller size classes (0.25-1.0 mm), which were correlated with fine-root growth and litterfall. Tree species altered soil pH differentially. Across all vegetation types, the proportion of smaller macroaggregates declined significantly as soil pH increased (p <= 0.0184). This suggests that alteration of pH influences dispersivity, and thus macroaggregate dynamics, thereby playing a role in soil C, N, and P cycling.","[Russell, Ann E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Russell, AE (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",arussell@iastate.edu; skivlin@utk.edu; chawkes@austin.utexas.edu,"Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1119223, 1119169, 1120015]","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1119223, 1119169, and 1120015.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) and coarse roots are concentrated close to tree trunks, a region usually unmeasured during soil carbon sampling. Soil carbon estimates and their variation with land-use change have not been correspondingly adjusted. Our aim was to deduce allometric equations that will allow improvement of SOC estimates and tree trunk carbon estimates, for primary forest stands that include large trees in rugged terrain. Terrestrial digital photography, photogrammetry and GIS software were used to produce 3D models of the buttresses, roots and humus mounds of large trees in primary forests dominated by Eucalyptus regnans in Tasmania. Models of 29, in situ eucalypts were made and analysed. 3D models of example eucalypt roots, logging debris, rainforest tree species, fallen trees, branches, root and trunk slices, and soil profiles were also derived. Measurements in 2D, from earlier work, of three buttress 'logs' were added to the data set. The 3D models had high spatial resolution. The modelling allowed checking and correction of field measurements. Tree anatomical detail was formulated, such as buttress shape, humus volume, root volume in the under-sampled zone and trunk hollow area. The allometric relationships developed link diameter at breast height and ground slope, to SOC and tree trunk carbon, the latter including a correction for senescence. These formulae can be applied to stand-level carbon accounting. The formulae allow the typically measured, intertree SOC to be corrected for not sampling near large trees. The 3D models developed are irreplaceable, being for increasingly rare, large trees, and they could be useful to other scientific endeavours.","[Dean, Christopher; Kirkpatrick, Jamie B.; Osborn, Jon; Fitzgerald, Nicholas B.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Doyle, Richard B.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Roxburgh, Stephen H.] CSIRO Land & Water, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Dean, C (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",christopher.dean@utas.edu.au,,"Dean, Christopher/0000-0002-8919-8871; Osborn, Jon/0000-0003-2278-3766",University of Tasmania; Natural and Environmental Studies Elite Research Scholarship,"The research was supported by the University of Tasmania, including by a Natural and Environmental Studies Elite Research Scholarship.",,97,2,2,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,APR,2018,10,2,,,,,,,ply015,10.1093/aobpla/ply015,,,20,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GH6GG,WOS:000433541400004,29593855,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,10/31/19J,"Palakurty, SX; Stinchcombe, JR; Afkhami, ME",,,,"Palakurty, Sathvik X.; Stinchcombe, John R.; Afkhami, Michelle E.",,,Cooperation and coexpression: How coexpression networks shift in response to multiple mutualists,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,mycorrhizal fungi; nonadditive; rhizobia; RNA-Seq; symbiosis; transcriptome; weighted gene coexpression network analysis,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LEGUME MEDICAGO-TRUNCATULA; LEGHEMOGLOBIN GENE VFLB29; ROOT-NODULES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; GENOME; NODULATION; SYMBIOSIS; RHIZOBIA,"A mechanistic understanding of community ecology requires tackling the nonadditive effects of multispecies interactions, a challenge that necessitates integration of ecological and molecular complexitynamely moving beyond pairwise ecological interaction studies and the ""gene at a time"" approach to mechanism. Here, we investigate the consequences of multispecies mutualisms for the structure and function of genomewide differential coexpression networks for the first time, using the tractable and ecologically important interaction between legume Medicago truncatula, rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi. First, we found that genes whose expression is affected nonadditively by multiple mutualists are more highly connected in gene networks than expected by chance and had 94% greater network centrality than genes showing additive effects, suggesting that nonadditive genes may be key players in the widespread transcriptomic responses to multispecies symbioses. Second, multispecies mutualisms substantially changed coexpression network structure of 18 modules of host plant genes and 22 modules of the fungal symbionts' genes, indicating that third-party mutualists can cause significant rewiring of plant and fungal molecular networks. Third, we found that 60% of the coexpressed gene sets that explained variation in plant performance had coexpression structures that were altered by interactive effects of rhizobia and fungi. Finally, an ""across-symbiosis"" approach identified sets of plant and mycorrhizal genes whose coexpression structure was unique to the multiple mutualist context and suggested coupled responses across the plant-mycorrhizal interaction to rhizobial mutualists. Taken together, these results show multispecies mutualisms have substantial effects on the molecular interactions in host plants, microbes and across symbiotic boundaries.","[Palakurty, Sathvik X.; Afkhami, Michelle E.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada","Afkhami, ME (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",mea187@miami.edu,,"Palakurty, Sathvik/0000-0002-2222-4553",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1401840]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Miami,"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: IOS-1401840; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Miami",,82,3,3,5,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Methods Rhizobia were sampled four times from nodules of chickpea grown in four sites of Mulei County and Qitai County in Xinjiang, China during 2009-2016. The recA genes of rhizobia representing different populations were phylogenetically compared for their genotypic differentiation. Soil properties were examined to explore their hypothetical incidence on the rhizobial succession. Results The 628 isolates were all identified as Mesorhizobium muleiense, belonging to 28 genotypes distinguished by recA phylogeny. For each site, 15, 17, 10 and 7 genotypes were detected during the whole sampling period; while 4, 15, 12 and 17 genotypes were evidenced in each of the 4 sampling years (2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016) from all the four sites. Four major genotypes (T12 through T15) were found throughout the four years in the four sites at various frequencies. While the other genotypes were site and/or year specific. Both increased genetic diversity as revealed by Shannon-Weaver index and shifts in the population composition as revealed by genotyping were detected in the chickpea rhizobial populations during the study period. Nitrogen content, available phosphorus and potassium, and pH were the main factors correlated to the genotype distribution of chickpea rhizobia in the soil over years. Conclusions The genetic diversity of M. muleiense increased and the population composition shifted over years and at different sampling sites. The recA gene is an adequate molecular marker to estimate the intraspecific variation and succession of M. muleiense genotypes. The rhizobial genotype succession/evolution in the fields might be driven by the fluctuations of soil characteristics like nitrogen content, available phosphorus and potassium, and pH.","[Zhang, Junjie; Guo, Chen; Shang, Yimin; Yang, Xu; Zheng, Jianqiang] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Food Prod & Safety Henan P, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Environm Pollut Control &, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Rhizobium Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [de Lajudie, Philippe] IRD, LSTM, Campus Baillarguet TA-A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Mao, Peihong] Xinjiang Univ, Inst Ion Beam Biotechnol, Coll Phys Sci & Technol, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, En Tao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico","Zhang, JJ (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.; de Lajudie, P (reprint author), IRD, LSTM, Campus Baillarguet TA-A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.; Wang, ET (reprint author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico.",kirka640@163.com; philippe.lajudie@ird.fr; entaowang@yahoo.com.mx,"de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008","de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352; Wang, En Tao/0000-0001-6606-6916","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400008, 11575149, 31571778]; National human and social security ministry of science and technology for overseas returnees [21104000005]; Scientific Research Funds of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry [2014bsjj006]; State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology [2017SKLAB7-1];  [SIP20171259]","This work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31400008, 11575149 and 31571778), National human and social security ministry of science and technology for overseas returnees (Project No. 21104000005) and the Scientific Research Funds of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry (Project No. 2014bsjj006).

On one hand, increased primary productivity, for example, in response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), can result in greater inputs of organic matter to the soil, which could increase C sequestration belowground. On other hand, many of the interactions between plants and microorganisms that determine soil C dynamics are poorly characterized, and additional inputs of plant material, such as leaf litter, can result in the mineralization of soil organic matter, and the release of soil C as CO2 during so-called priming effects. Until now, very few studies made direct comparison of changes in soil C dynamics in response to altered plant inputs in different wooded ecosystems. We addressed this with a cross-continental study with litter removal and addition treatments in a temperate woodland (Wytham Woods) and lowland tropical forest (Gigante forest) to compare the consequences of increased litterfall on soil respiration in two distinct wooded ecosystems. Mean soil respiration was almost twice as high at Gigante (5.0molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) than at Wytham (2.7molCO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) but surprisingly, litter manipulation treatments had a greater and more immediate effect on soil respiration at Wytham. We measured a 30% increase in soil respiration in response to litter addition treatments at Wytham, compared to a 10% increase at Gigante. Importantly, despite higher soil respiration rates at Gigante, priming effects were stronger and more consistent at Wytham. Our results suggest that in situ priming effects in wooded ecosystems track seasonality in litterfall and soil respiration but the amount of soil C released by priming is not proportional to rates of soil respiration. Instead, priming effects may be promoted by larger inputs of organic matter combined with slower turnover rates.","[Brechet, Laetitia M.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Plants & Ecosyst PLECO Res Grp, Res Ctr Excellence Global Change Ecol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Brechet, Laetitia M.; Lopez-Sangil, Luis; Birkett, Ali J.; Baxendale, Catherine; Sayer, Emma J.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [George, Charles] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Castro Trujillo, Biancolini; Sayer, Emma J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Sayer, Emma J.] Open Univ, Sch Environm Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Lopez-Sangil, Luis] TEAGASC, Environm Res Ctr, Johnstown Castle, Wexford, Ireland","Brechet, LM (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Plants & Ecosyst PLECO Res Grp, Res Ctr Excellence Global Change Ecol, Antwerp, Belgium.",laeti.brechet@gmail.com,,"Birkett, Ali/0000-0002-5161-9896; Lopez-Sangil, Luis/0000-0002-8921-2581; Brechet, Laetitia/0000-0002-2744-8820",FP7 Ideas: European Research Council [ERC/307888],"FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: ERC/307888",,39,1,1,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, it is still unclear and poorly understood the nature of plant activity control over SR, especially under drought conditions. We studied the plant activity-SR relationship at different timescales in a water-limited mixed Mediterranean forest where Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) are undergoing drought-induced die-off and are being replaced by the more drought-resistant Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.). Half-hourly sap flow (SF), as a proxy of photosynthesis, coupled with measures of SR using solid-state CO2 sensors, were monitored during nine months in four different trees, representative of the diversity and health condition of the forest. SF was strongly associated with SR at both daily and seasonal timescales. At daily timescales, almost no lags were found between SF and SR, indicating a fast control of photosynthesis on SR. However, the association between SF and SR weakened during the summer drought. These temporal patterns were not constant across the trees representing the die-off and replacement processes. SR beneath living pines was highly controlled by SF at daily scale, whereas Holm oak seemed to be more controlled by SF at seasonal scale. The relationship between SF and SR measured beneath dead pine and Holm oak at the daily and seasonal scales was consistent with the colonization of soil gaps by holm oak roots following Scots pine death and suggests that surviving Scots pines are unable to expand their root system in these gaps. Our results collectively show how drought modulates the link between canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration, and increase our understanding on how belowground processes may be affected by the successional dynamics following drought-induced forest mortality.","[Barba, Josep; Lloret, Francisco; Poyatos, Rafael; Molowny-Horas, Roberto] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Barba, Josep; Lloret, Francisco; Poyatos, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Poyatos, Rafael] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Plant Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Curiel Yuste, Jorge] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Curiel Yuste, Jorge] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Maria Diaz de Haro 3,6 Solairua, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain","Barba, J (reprint author), CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain.; Barba, J (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",jbarba@udel.edu,"ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Poyatos, Rafael/F-8305-2010; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/A-6438-2011; Molowny-Horas, Roberto/D-1171-2014","Poyatos, Rafael/0000-0003-0521-2523; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/0000-0002-3221-6960; Molowny-Horas, Roberto/0000-0003-2626-6379; Barba, Josep/0000-0001-9094-9516","Spanish Government project SECASOL [CGL2009-081 01]; Spanish Government project DRIM [CGL2010-16373]; Spanish Government project VULGLO [CGL 2010-22180-C03-03]; Spanish Government project SECADIN [CGL2012-32965]; Spanish Government project BIOCLIM [CGL2015-67419-R]; Spanish Government project SAP-FLUXNET [CGL2014-5583-JIN]; Spanish Government project VERONICA [CGL2013-42271-P]; Government of CataloniaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2009-SGR-00247, 2014-SGR-453]; Community of Madrid grant REMEDINAL 2 [CM S2009/AMB-1783]; FPI scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2010-036558]","The authors thank D.

Calculations of regional-scale forest carbon storage that rely on maps of land cover typically reflect only coarse forest classes. How differences in carbon stored by different tree species may affect such assessments is largely unexplored. We examined a range of forest carbon storage models to understand the effects of forest type specificity on carbon storage estimates in the northeastern United States. Models estimated forest carbon in total aboveground and coarse root biomass based on three levels of forest classification specificity: (1) relative basal area by species, (2) species associations, and (3) broad forest types per IPCC (in: IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, IPCC, Japan, 2006) guidelines. The specificity of forest type classifications influenced results with generally lower carbon storage estimates resulting from higher-specificity forest classifications. The two most specific models, with mean carbon storage estimates of 103-107 Mg/ha, were most accurate compared to field validation points. These estimates are greater than 2013 field-based U.S. Forest Service estimates (84-90 Mg/ha). There are many sources of uncertainty in landscape-scale carbon storage assessments. Here we show that improving detail in one of these sources, forest stand composition, increases the accuracy of these assessments, and better reflects carbon storage patterns across heterogeneous landscapes. While more work is needed, particularly to improve stand age maps, this information can inform the interpretation of current carbon storage estimates and improve future estimates in heterogeneous forests.","[Adams, Alison B.; Pontius, Jennifer; Galford, Gillian L.; Gudex-Cross, David] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Adams, Alison B.; Galford, Gillian L.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, 617 Main St, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Pontius, Jennifer] US Forest Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Merrill, Scott C.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Adams, AB (reprint author), Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",alison.adams@uvm.edu,"Galford, Gillian/K-6240-2012","Galford, Gillian/0000-0003-2192-7385; Merrill, Scott/0000-0001-5574-9703; Pontius, Jennifer/0000-0002-0065-304X","U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire-Stennis project at the University of Vermont [1002440]; U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station, Northern States Research Cooperative","This study was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire-Stennis project (Grant Number 1002440) at the University of Vermont, and by the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station, Northern States Research Cooperative.",,44,1,1,2,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

In spite of the large number of previous studies on allocation patterns within single species, knowledge of general patterns in species allocation is still very limited. This is because each study was done in different conditions using different methodology, making generalization difficult. We investigate intraspecific above-versus below-ground biomass allocation among individuals across a spectrum of dry-grassland plant species at two different developmental stages and ask whether allocation is age-and species specific, and whether differences among species can be explained by their life-history traits and phylogeny. Methods We collected data on above-and below-ground biomass of seedlings and adult plants of 20 species from a common garden experiment. We analysed data on shoot-root biomass allocation allometrically and studied the relationship between the allometric exponents (slopes on log-log scale), species life-history traits and phylogenetic distances. Important Findings We found isometric as well as allometric patterns of biomass allocation in the studied species. Seedlings and adult individuals of more than half of the species differed in their above-versus below-ground biomass allometric exponents. Seedlings and adult individuals of the remaining species differed in their allometric coefficients (intercepts). Annual species generally allocated proportionally more to above-than below-ground biomass as seedlings than as adults, whereas perennial species showed the opposite pattern. Plant life-history traits, such as plant life span, age of first flowering, month in which the species begin flowering and specific leaf area were much more important in explaining differences in shoot-root allometry among species than were phylogenetic relationships. This suggests that allocation patterns vary greatly among closely related species but can be predicted based on species life-history traits.","[Husakova, Iveta; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12801 Prague, Czech Republic; [Husakova, Iveta; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Husakova, Iveta; Weiner, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg, Denmark","Husakova, I (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12801 Prague, Czech Republic.",iveta.husakova@volny.cz,"Husakova, Iveta/W-1324-2017; Weiner, Jacob/E-1839-2011; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013","Husakova, Iveta/0000-0002-4778-1874; Weiner, Jacob/0000-0002-0736-7943; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220","Charles University in Prague [658313]; Foundation of Josef, Marie and Zdenka Hlavkovych; Danish Government Scholarships under the Cultural Agreements","This study was supported by the Charles University in Prague, project GA UK No. 658313.

To analyze in how far adaption to natural soil conditions and the use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) influence reintroduction success, five rare plant species from three habitat types in north-west Germany were exposed to three different soil types, with or without the application of PGPR inoculum. Plant seeds were germinated in a greenhouse and seedlings were transplanted to natural field habitats. Growth and survival was monitored for 2 years. Natural soil from the field yielded the best results for four out of five species, indicating that the ""home soil advantage"" might have great potential value in the cultivation and reintroduction of rare plants. Commercial potting soil resulted in good to intermediate growth in forest and riverside species, but was the least successful option for the heathland species. Overall, plant grew least on an artificially mixed substrate, mimicking physicochemical soil properties from the natural soil, probably due to incomplete soil forming processes. The application of PGPR had no effect on germination rate and on plant growth in the field, and no consistent effect during cultivation. Based on these results, the use of a generalist PGPR inoculum does not provide a significant benefit to reintroduction efforts. In contrast, the use of home soil might have a great potential to boost reintroduction success.","[Michaelis, Jana; Diekmann, Martin] Univ Bremen, Inst Ecol, Vegetat Ecol & Conservat Biol, FB 2, Leobener Str 5, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Michaelis, J (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Inst Ecol, Vegetat Ecol & Conservat Biol, FB 2, Leobener Str 5, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",jana.michaelis@uni-bremen.de; mdiekman@uni-bremen.de,"Diekmann, Martin/L-8854-2019",,,,,40,2,2,5,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2018,219,4,,,,,441,453,,10.1007/s11258-018-0807-5,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FZ3RQ,WOS:000427508300008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhou, XG; Zhang, JH; Pan, DD; Ge, X; Jin, X; Chen, SC; Wu, FZ",,,,"Zhou, Xingang; Zhang, Jianhui; Pan, Dandan; Ge, Xin; Jin, Xue; Chen, Shaocan; Wu, Fengzhi",,,p-Coumaric can alter the composition of cucumber rhizosphere microbial communities and induce negative plant-microbial interactions,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Autotoxin; Cucumis sativus L.; Plant-microbial interactions; Rhizosphere microbial communities,FERULIC ACID; SEEDLING GROWTH; SOIL FEEDBACKS; PHENOLIC-ACIDS; BENZOIC-ACID; DEGRADATION; FUNGI; MICROORGANISMS; DIVERSITY; CHEMICALS,"Phenolics from root exudates or decaying residues are usually referred as autotoxins of several plant species. However, how phenolics affect soil microbial communities and their functional significances are poorly understood. Rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings treated with p-coumaric acid, an autotoxin of cucumber, were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicons. Then, feedback effects of the rhizosphere biota on cucumber seedlings were evaluated by inoculating non-sterilized and sterilized rhizosphere soils to sterilized background soils. p-Coumaric acid decreased the bacterial diversity of rhizosphere but increased fungal diversity and altered the compositions of both the bacterial and fungal communities. p-Coumaric acid increased the relative abundances of microbial taxa with phenol-degrading capability (such as Chaetomium, Humicola, and Mortierella spp.) and microbial taxa which contained plant pathogens (such as Fusarium spp.). However, p-coumaric acid inhibited the relative abundances of Lysobacter, Haliangium, and Gymnoascus spp., whose species can have pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant-growth-promoting effects. The positive effect of cucumber rhizosphere microbiota on cucumber seedling growth was reduced by p-coumaric acid. Overall, our results showed that, besides its direct phytotoxicity, p-coumaric acid can inhibit cucumber seedling growth through generating negative plant-soil microbial interactions.","[Zhou, Xingang; Zhang, Jianhui; Pan, Dandan; Ge, Xin; Jin, Xue; Chen, Shaocan; Wu, Fengzhi] Northeast Agr Univ, Dept Hort, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xingang; Wu, Fengzhi] Minist Agr, Key Lab Biol & Genet Improvement Hort Crops North, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Wu, FZ (reprint author), Northeast Agr Univ, Dept Hort, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.; Wu, FZ (reprint author), Minist Agr, Key Lab Biol & Genet Improvement Hort Crops North, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",fzwuneau@yahoo.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31772361, 41401271]; ""Academic Backbone"" Project of Northeast Agricultural University [17XG05]; University Nursing Program for Young Scholars with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province [UNPYSCT-2015002]; China Agricultural Research System [CARS-23-C-10]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31772361, 41401271), ""Academic Backbone"" Project of Northeast Agricultural University (17XG05), University Nursing Program for Young Scholars with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province (UNPYSCT-2015002), and China Agricultural Research System (CARS-23-C-10).",,56,23,23,22,110,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

We tested whether soil waterlogging affects resistance of seedlings to physical disturbance, thereby potentially influencing the distribution of saltmarsh species. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate effects of waterlogging on plant traits, in particular root growth, and tolerance of seedlings to sediment erosion. Three species, each dominating different elevations in NW European salt marshes (Salicornia europaea, Atriplex portulacoides and Elytrigia atherica), were selected for the experiments. Individual seedlings were grown under different waterlogging treatments and finally subjected to an erosion treatment. The depth of erosion at which the seedlings toppled (E-crit) was determined and related to above-and below-ground morphological traits of the seedlings. Resistance to erosion decreased in all 3 species from drained to completely waterlogged soil conditions, with the strongest negative impact of waterlogging on the upper marsh species E. atherica. Root length and biomass, shoot biomass and the root: shoot biomass ratio were the most important traits positively affecting E-crit. The experiment demonstrates that rapid root growth is essential for the stability of seedlings, and is presumably of great importance for their successful establishment on tidal flats where sediment erosion may be a limiting factor. Root growth is in turn affected by a species-specific response to waterlogging. Our study suggests that this species-specific effect of waterlogging on seedling stability contributes to species sorting along the inundation gradient of coastal ecosystems.","[Redelstein, Regine] Univ Gottingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Zotz, Gerhard; Balke, Thorsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Balke, Thorsten] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Redelstein, R (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",regine.redelstein@biologie.uni-goettingen.de,"Zotz, Gerhard/Q-5365-2018","Zotz, Gerhard/0000-0002-6823-2268; Balke, Thorsten/0000-0001-7733-5069","Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany [ZN2930]","A special thanks to the team of the Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (ICBM) (University of Oldenburg) mechanical workshop for help with the setup of the experiment.

These species must be controlled to prevent their spread and to restore native grassland. Research on alternative revegetation methods is urgently needed since seed based grassland restoration is often unsuccessful. The effectiveness of transplanting to restore foothills fescue grassland following implementation of non-native plant management was investigated at three disturbed sites in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. Non-native plant abundance was reduced by cutting, glyphosate application, and steaming. Greenhouse grown seedlings of native fescue grassland species (13 forbs, five grasses, two shrubs) were outplanted into plots following management treatments, as three different sizes of container stock. The effects of prior non-native plant management and container size on transplant survival and growth were assessed over two growing seasons. Rhizomatous forbs and bunchgrasses with well-developed root systems had highest survival (> 50% over 14 months). Transplants with 10- to 15-cm rooting depth in cones and root trainers had significantly higher within-year survival than tray transplants with a shallow rooting depth. Transplant survival was improved by glyphosate application to control non-native plants prior to planting. Transplanting was effective for increasing native cover and species richness although high winter mortality reduced this effect. Key species for fescue grassland function were introduced at all sites and persisted for two growing seasons.","[Stover, Holly J.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, Biol & Geol Sci Bldg, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Naeth, M.

Root pruning enhanced stem biomass at the expense of roots in later growth stages. Alteration of biomass allocation due to nursery practices may result in greater susceptibility to injury and death of the seedlings under unfavorable environmental conditions. Context Plants adjust their growth and modulate the resource allocation in response to applied treatments and environmental conditions. Aims The aim was to examine how taproot pruning in seedlings grown at different densities affected long-term growth of Quercus robur. Methods Seedlings, sown as acorns at two planting densities, with or without pruned roots were harvested in the second, fourth, and fifth years of growth. The effect of root pruning on biomass allocation was determined by measuring leaf, stem, and root mass fractions; carbohydrate concentrations in the roots; and C/N ratios. Specific leaf area and root length were also determined to assess morphological adaptations to growth conditions. Results Total seedling mass was affected more by planting density than by taproot pruning. After 4 years of growth, root mass fractions were lower and stem mass fractions were greater in seedlings planted at a higher density. Five-year old root-pruned seedlings also had a lower root mass fraction and higher stem mass fractions than unpruned seedlings. Specific root length was not affected by root pruning or planting density. Conclusion Decrease of relative root biomass with simultaneous increase of stem biomass may be a long-term consequence of taproot pruning of Q. robur, and the effects may manifest years after the seedling stage.","[Mucha, Joanna; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.; Talaska, Adrian M.; Oleksyn, Jacek; Zadworny, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Game Management & Forest Protect, Wojska Polskiego 71e, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Bulaj, Bartosz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Sites & Ecol, Wojska Polskiego 71e, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Lakomy, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Pathol, Wojska Polskiego 71e, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Talaska, Adrian M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland; [Oleksyn, Jacek] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Mucha, J (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",jmucha@man.poznan.pl,,"Jagodzinski, Andrzej/0000-0001-6899-0985; Lakomy, Piotr/0000-0002-1510-6217; Bulaj, Bartosz/0000-0002-8945-1355; Zadworny, Marcin/0000-0002-7352-5786; Mucha, Joanna/0000-0002-1290-9639","National Science Centre of Poland [2011/01/D/NZ9/02871]; Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland","The research was supported financially by the National Science Centre of Poland (project no. 2011/01/D/NZ9/02871) and the Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland.",,66,2,2,3,10,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

We tested this assumption by comparing these correlations with models of survival probability using 46 perennial species from long-term permanent plots in pine forests of Arizona. Survival was modelled as a function of trait x environment interactions, plant size, climatic variation and neighbourhood competition. The effect of traits on survival depended on the environmental conditions, but the two statistical approaches were inconsistent. For example, CWM-specific leaf area (SLA) and soil fertility were uncorrelated. However, survival was highest for species with low SLA in infertile soil, a result which agreed with expectations derived from the physiological trade-off underpinning leaf economic theory. CWM trait-environment relationships were unreliable estimates of how traits affected survival, and should only be used in predictive models when there is empirical support for an evolutionary trade-off that affects vital rates.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Strahan, Robert T.] Southern Oregon Univ, Biol & Environm Sci & Policy Programs, 1250 Siskiyou Blvd, Ashland, OR 97520 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Moore, Margaret M.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Laughlin, DC (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",daniel.laughlin@uwyo.edu,,,Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU); U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [08-JV-11221633-233]; McIntire-Stennis,"This research was supported by the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU), a Joint Venture Agreement (#08-JV-11221633-233) with the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS), and McIntire-Stennis appropriations to the NAU School of Forestry.",,49,7,7,4,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We found that the termination of photosynthate flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound changes in soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community composition. The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist and starts to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate from bulk soil and develop into hotspots of decomposition and important fungal biomass pools. We found no support for the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the decomposition of roots, but we found some evidence that root endophytic fungi may have an important role in the early stages of this process.

Restoration of degraded grasslands through active revegetation often involves re-establishing populations of native grasses, which must withstand increasing drought stress to persist beyond initial establishment. In perennial species, superior dehydration tolerance is expected to result in more conservative growth, but this trade-off has seldom been studied among populations of herbaceous species. 2. We measured seasonal growth and foliar and root functional traits under non-limiting water conditions, followed by recovery after severe drought in four populations of Elymus glaucus, a perennial grass from California's Mediterranean-climate region. We hypothesized that populations from harsher sites would be more dehydration tolerant, summer dormant and resource-conservative. 3. Dehydration tolerance and summer dormancy were associated with a more conservative strategy (lower productivity, lower specific leaf area and specific root length), as well as earlier reproductive phenology. 4. Multivariate trait variation was associated with water availability in both the growing season and summer, while greater dehydration tolerance and summer dormancy were associated with increasing summer climatic water deficit. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides evidence of an intraspecific trade-off between dehydration tolerance and rapid resource acquisition. We discuss the implication that restored populations with superior drought survival may therefore be less competitive, and recommend further investigation to inform plant materials selection protocols and management practices.","[Balachowski, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Volaire, Florence A.] CNRS, CEFE UMR 5175, INRA USC 1338, Montpellier, France; [Balachowski, Jennifer A.] Univ Calif Davis, USDA, ARS, Calif Climate Hub,John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Balachowski, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Balachowski, JA (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, USDA, ARS, Calif Climate Hub,John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbalachowski@ucdavis.edu,,,US National Science Foundation REACH IGERT; Franco-American Fulbright Commission,US National Science Foundation REACH IGERT; Franco-American Fulbright Commission,,56,3,3,11,145,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Interactions with symbiotic microbes, such as mycorrhizal fungi, have the potential to greatly influence plant growth, but it is unclear whether field variation in symbiont availability is common and, if so, sufficient to influence interspecific plant competition. 2. In a greenhouse experiment using natural field soils, I varied the timing of ectomycorrhizal inoculation and the presence of an arbuscular mycorrhizal plant competitor, and measured their effects on pine seedling growth. 3. I found that ectomycorrhizal colonization was absent in some field soils, and that in soils without mycorrhizal inoculum, delayed arrival of ectomycorrhizal spores progressively reduced pine seedling growth and favoured growth of the competitor. Competition had significant negative effects on pine seedling growth, but the competition effect was much smaller than the effect of delayed mutualist arrival. 4. Synthesis. The importance of mycorrhizal spore arrival time on pine growth suggests that plants may experience mutualist limitation more frequently than previously expected, and the relative magnitude of seedling responses to mycorrhizal fungi and competing plants show that in some systems mutualism is likely of equal or greater importance compared with interspecific competition in affecting plant community assembly.","[Peay, Kabir G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Peay, KG (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kpeay@stanford.edu,,"Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412",Biological and Environmental Research [DE-SC0016097]; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [DBI-1046115],"Biological and Environmental Research, Grant/Award Number: DE-SC0016097; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DBI-1046115",,68,11,11,4,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, effects of order of arrival of different plant functional groups (PFGs) on root development have not yet been investigated under field conditions. We measured standing and fine root length density in the first and third year of a grassland field experiment. We wanted to know if manipulating PFG order of arrival would affect root development, and if priority effects are modulated by soil type. Sowing legumes first created a priority effect that was found in the first and third year, with a lower standing root length density in this treatment, even though the plant community composition was different in each of the studied years. Fine root length density was not affected by order of arrival, but changed according to the soil type. Synthesis.

In casts, different processes such as organic matter mineralization and signal molecule production follow a complex temporal dynamics. An adaptation of root morphology to cast dynamics could allow an efficient nitrogen capture by the plant. The plant Brachypodium distachyon was grown in a laboratory experiment with different proportions of casts of increasing ages. Casts were labelled with N-15 to quantify the plant N uptake from the casts. Plant biomass and morphology, especially root system structure, were analysed. The age of casts had an effect on fine root length, highlighting the importance of the dynamics of cast maturation in root adaptation. Plant biomass production was affected by the interaction between the age and proportion of casts. A positive correlation between the N-15 proportion in plant tissues and plant biomasses indicated that plants were more efficient in foraging N in casts than in the bulk soil. Our results suggested that both a timely adaptation of the root system structure and a significant proportion of casts are necessary to observe a positive effect of casts on plant growth.","[Agapit, Corinne; Gigon, Agnes; Puga-Freitas, Ruben] UPEC, UPMC, IRD, INRA,CNRS,UMR 7618,IEES Paris, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Zeller, Bernd] INRA, Ctr Nancy Lorraine, UR 1138, BEF,Labex ARBRE, Champenoux, France; [Blouin, Manuel] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, CNRS, Agroecol,AgroSup Dijon, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Blouin, Manuel] AgroSup Dijon, Dept Agron Agroequipements Elevage Environm 2A2E, 26 Bd Docteur Petitjean,BP 87999, F-21079 Dijon, France","Blouin, M (reprint author), AgroSup Dijon, Dept Agron Agroequipements Elevage Environm 2A2E, 26 Bd Docteur Petitjean,BP 87999, F-21079 Dijon, France.",manuel.blouin@agrosupdijon.fr,"Blouin, Manuel/K-6013-2019","Blouin, Manuel/0000-0002-3928-9070",Region Ile-de-FranceRegion Ile-de-France [R2DS 2014-08]; French national program CNRS/INSU EC2CO,"We thank Christelle Ngueda for the technical help and Beatriz Decenciere, Amandine Hansart and Florent Massol of the CEREEP - Ecotron IDF/UMS CNRS/ENS 3194 for soil provision.

Observations of phenological events belowground for most ecosystems are difficult to obtain and very little is known about the relationship between tree shoot and root phenology. We examined the influence of environmental factors on fine root production and mortality in relation with shoot phenology in hybrid walnut trees (Juglans sp.) growing in three different climates (oceanic, continental and Mediterranean) along a latitudinal gradient in France. Eight rhizotrons were installed at each site for 21 months to monitor tree root dynamics. Root elongation rate (RER), root initiation quantity (RIQ) and root mortality quantity (RMQ) were recorded frequently using a scanner and time-lapse camera. Leaf phenology and stem radial growth were also measured. Fine roots were classified by topological order and 0-1 mm, 1-2 mm and 2-5 mm diameter classes and fine root longevity and risk of mortality were calculated during different periods over the year. Root growth was not synchronous with leaf phenology in any climate or either year, but was synchronous with stem growth during the late growing season. A distinct bimodal pattern of root growth was observed during the aerial growing season. Mean RER was driven by soil temperature measured in the month preceding root growth in the oceanic climate site only. However, mean RER was significantly correlated with mean soil water potential measured in the month preceding root growth at both Mediterranean (positive relationship) and oceanic (negative relationship) sites. Mean RIQ was significantly higher at both continental and Mediterranean sites compared to the oceanic site. Soil temperature was a driver of mean RIQ during the late growing season at continental and Mediterranean sites only. Mean RMQ increased significantly with decreasing soil water potential during the late aerial growing season at the continental site only. Mean root longevity at the continental site was significantly greater than for roots at the oceanic and Mediterranean sites. Roots in the 0-1 mm and 1-2 mm diameter classes lived for significantly shorter periods compared to those in the 2-5 mm diameter class. First order roots (i.e. the primary or parents roots) lived longer than lateral branch roots at the Mediterranean site only and first order roots in the 0-1 mm diameter class had 44.5% less risk of mortality than that of lateral roots for the same class of diameter. We conclude that factors driving root RER were not the same between climates. Soil temperature was the best predictor of root initiation at continental and Mediterranean sites only, but drivers of root mortality remained largely undetermined.","[Mohamed, Awaz; Stokes, Alexia; Mao, Zhun; Sabatier, Sylvie; Pailler, Francois; Fourtier, Stephane; Monnier, Yogan] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, AMAP,IRD,CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Jourdan, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, Eco&Sols, CIRAD, INRA,IRD,Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Dufour, Lydie] INRA, UMR Syst, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France","Mohamed, A (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, AMAP,IRD,CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",awazmsm@yahoo.com,"MOHAMED, Awaz/M-7536-2019; JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019","JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; /0000-0001-8042-6316; stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911; Mohamed, Awaz/0000-0002-6130-9496","Campus France; Kurdish Institute, France; la Fondation de FranceFondation de France; FOARDAPT project, INRA metaprogram AAFCC (Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change), France","Funding for a Ph.D. bursary was provided by Campus France and the Kurdish Institute, France (AM), la Fondation de France (YM) and fieldwork was funded by the FOARDAPT project, INRA metaprogram AAFCC (Adaptation of Agriculture and Forests to Climate Change), France.",,83,2,2,4,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2018,424,2-Jan,,,SI,,103,122,,10.1007/s11104-017-3417-4,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GD0LJ,WOS:000430192000008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Germon, A; Guerrini, IA; Bordron, B; Bouillet, JP; Nouvellon, Y; Goncalves, JLD; Jourdan, C; Paula, RR; Laclau, JP",,,,"Germon, Amandine; Guerrini, Irae Amaral; Bordron, Bruno; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre; Nouvellon, Yann; de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo; Jourdan, Christophe; Paula, Ranieri Ribeiro; Laclau, Jean-Paul",,,Consequences of mixing Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis trees on soil exploration by fine-roots down to a depth of 17 m,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Plantation; Forest; Deep root; Fine-root density; Root traits; Diversity; Over-yielding; Brazil,MIXED-SPECIES PLANTATIONS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; BEECH FAGUS-SYLVATICA; ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOREAL FOREST; NORWAY SPRUCE; WATER-TABLE; BRAZIL; NITROGEN,"Fine-root functioning is a major driver of plant growth and strongly influences the global carbon cycle. While fine-root over-yielding has been shown in the upper soil layers of mixed-species forests relative to monospecific stands, the consequences of tree diversity on fine-root growth in very deep soil layers is still unknown. Our study aimed to assess the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis trees on soil exploration by roots down to the water table at 17 m depth in a tropical planted forest. Fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) were sampled in a randomized block design with three treatments: monospecific stands of Acacia mangium (100A), Eucalyptus grandis (100E), and mixed stands with 50% of each species (50A50E). Root ingrowth bags were installed at 4 depths (from 0.1 m to 6 m) in the three treatments within three different blocks, to study the fine-root production over 2 periods of 3 months. Down to 17 m depth, total fine-root biomass was 1127 g m(-2) in 50A50E, 780 g m(-2) in 100A and 714 g m(-2) in 100E. Specific root length and specific root area were 110-150% higher in 50A50E than in 100A for Acacia mangium trees and 34% higher in 50A50E than in 100E for Eucalyptus grandis trees. Ingrowth bags showed that the capacity of fine roots to explore soil patches did not decrease down to a depth of 6 m for the two species. Belowground interactions between Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis trees greatly increased the exploration of very deep soil layers by fine roots, which is likely to enhance the uptake of soil resources. Mixing tree species might therefore increase the resilience of tropical planted forests through a better exploration of deep soils.","[Germon, Amandine; Guerrini, Irae Amaral; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Solos & Recursos Ambientais, BR-18610300 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Germon, Amandine; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre; Nouvellon, Yann; Jourdan, Christophe; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Montpellier, Eco&Sols, INRA, CIRAD,IRD,Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Bordron, Bruno; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre; Nouvellon, Yann; de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo; Paula, Ranieri Ribeiro; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Bouillet, Jean-Pierre; Nouvellon, Yann; Jourdan, Christophe; Laclau, Jean-Paul] CIRAD, Eco&Sols, Montpellier, France; [Paula, Ranieri Ribeiro] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Ciencias Florestais & Madeira, BR-2955000 Jeronimo Monteiro, ES, Brazil","Laclau, JP (reprint author), CIRAD, Eco&Sols, Montpellier, France.",laclau@cirad.fr,"Laclau, Jean-Paul/O-2189-2019; Germon, Amandine/M-4403-2015; Guerrini, Irae A/C-5472-2012; JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019; Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo/G-4979-2013; Nouvellon, Yann/C-9295-2016; Paula, Ranieri Ribeiro/F-8410-2013","Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; Germon, Amandine/0000-0001-8687-294X; Guerrini, Irae A/0000-0002-1336-0318; JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo/0000-0003-1068-5448; Nouvellon, Yann/0000-0003-1920-3847; Paula, Ranieri Ribeiro/0000-0002-2520-1779","Agence national de la rechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2010-STRA-004-03]; Sao Paulo Research foundation (FAFESP) [2015/24911-8, 2011/20510-8]; Ecofor; Allenvi; French National Research Infrastructure ANAEE-F","We are truly grateful to Daise Silva Ferreira for the huge work carried out in the field and in the laboratory.

We aimed to better understand the influence of soil physical and chemical components, vegetation and fungal abundance on MWD of a Ferralsol along a successional gradient of vegetation in New Caledonia. Five plant communities (sedge dominated, open sclerophyllous shrubland, Arillastrum forest, Nothofagus forest and mixed rainforest) were studied. For each community, MWD, soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) sesquioxides, root length density (RLD), specific root length (SRL), root mass density (RMD) and fungal abundance were measured. Generalized linear models were used to predict MWD from soil and plant trait data. The best prediction of MWD combined abiotic and biotic factors. Along the gradient, Fe increased MWD, while root traits, fungal abundance and SOC modified MWD. From the sedge-dominated community to Arillastrum forest, RMD and SOC increased MWD, while between Nothofagus and mixed rainforest, it was likely that floristic composition and fungal communities influenced MWD. Plant community, the intrinsic nature of Ferralsol and fungal abundance all modified MWD. However, the specific effect of microbial communities should be addressed through a metagenomics approach to elucidate microbial interactions with plant communities.","[Demenois, Julien; Ibanez, Thomas; Carriconde, Fabian] Inst Agron Neocaledonien IAC, Equipe Sol & Vegetat SolVeg, BP18239, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Demenois, Julien] AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Freddy] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, UR EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Stokes, Alexia] Univ Montpellier, Cirad, INRA, Amap,Ird,Cnrs, Montpellier, France","Demenois, J (reprint author), Inst Agron Neocaledonien IAC, Equipe Sol & Vegetat SolVeg, BP18239, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.; Demenois, J (reprint author), AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France.",julien.demenois@cirad.fr,"Demenois, Julien/P-1020-2019; Ibanez, Thomas/I-6061-2019","Demenois, Julien/0000-0002-2271-8465; Ibanez, Thomas/0000-0002-3192-1721",INRAInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA); IAC [DE2013-041]; French Ministry of Agriculture; Societe Le Nickel [DE2013-041],"We gratefully acknowledge the field staff of IAC ('Unite SARA'): A.

Large macroaggregates contained greater abundance of Pedosphaerales, Planctomycetales, Syntrophobacterales, and Glomeromycota (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). To demonstrate the potential for additional insights into soil microbial diversity, we calculated of a weighted proportional whole soil diversity, which accounted for microbes found in aggregate fractions and resulted in 65% greater bacterial richness and 100% greater fungal richness over independently sampled whole soil (i.e. bulk soil). Our results show microaggregates support highly diverse microbial communities, including several unidentified genera. Isolating aggregates with a microbially sensitive approach provides new opportunities to explore soil microbial communities and the factors shaping them at relevant spatial scales.","[Bach, Elizabeth M.; Williams, Ryan J.; Hargreaves, Sarah K.; Yang, Fan; Hofmockel, Kirsten S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Hofmockel, Kirsten S.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA","Hofmockel, KS (reprint author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",Kirsten.Hofmockel@pnnl.gov,,"Bach, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0073-7016; Hofmockel, Kirsten/0000-0003-1586-2167","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Carbon Cycle Science Program [2011-01033]; Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Lois F.

Here, we used neutron radiography to examine in situ root-soil water dynamics of a previously droughted black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) seedling, contrasting water uptake by the two major components of the root system that differed in initial recovery rate as apparent by 'new' (whiter, thinner), or 'old' (darker, thicker) parts of the fine root system. The smaller diameter 'new' roots had greater water uptake per unit surface area than the larger diameter 'old' roots, but they had less total surface area leading to less total water extraction; rates ranged from 0.0027-0.0116 g cm(-2) h(-1). The finest most-active roots were not visible in the radiographs, indicating the need to include destructive sampling. Analysis based on root-free bulk soil hydraulic properties indicated substantial redistribution of water via saturated/unsaturated flow and capillary wicking across the layers - suggesting water uptake dynamics following an infiltration event may be more complex than approximated by common soil hydraulic or root surface area modeling approaches. Our results highlight the need for continued exploration of root-trait specific water uptake rates in situ, and impacts of roots on soil hydraulic properties - both critical components for mechanistic modeling of root function.","[Dhiman, Indu; Bilheux, Hassina; DeCarlo, Keito; Santodonato, Lou] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Chem & Engn Mat Div, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [DeCarlo, Keito] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Painter, Scott L.; Warren, Jeffrey M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Painter, Scott L.; Warren, Jeffrey M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Warren, JM (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.; Warren, JM (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",warrenjm@ornl.gov,"Bilheux, Hassina Z/H-4289-2012; Warren, Jeff/B-9375-2012","Bilheux, Hassina Z/0000-0001-8574-2449; Warren, Jeff/0000-0002-0680-4697","Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL); DOE Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); DOE, Office of Science, Office of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) program; DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-1008 00OR22725]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); United States Government;  [DE-AC05-06OR23100]","We thank Deanne Brice for plant propagation and root analysis.

Empirical evidence concerning the contribution of different traits to niche differentiation and the ability to supress and tolerate competitors is very limited, particularly when considering belowground interactions. We grew 26 temperate grassland species along a density gradient of interspecific competitors to determine which belowground traits a) explain species' ability to suppress and tolerate neighbours and b) contribute to niche differentiation, such that species with dissimilar trait values experience reduced competition. We found that having larger root systems with extensive horizontal spread and lower root tissue density enabled efficient suppression of neighbours but did not significantly contribute to the ability to tolerate competition. Species with deeper root systems, lower specific root length and less branched roots were better at tolerating competition, but these traits did not significantly affect the ability to suppress neighbours. None of the measured traits contributed significantly to niche differentiation, either individually or in combination. This study provides little support for belowground traits contributing to species co-existence through niche differentiation. Instead, different sets of weakly correlated traits enable plants to either suppress or tolerate their competitors.","[Semchenko, Marina] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Lepik, Anu; Abakumova, Maria; Zobel, Kristjan] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia","Semchenko, M (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",marina.semchenko@manchester.ac.uk,,,"Estonian Science foundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [9332, 9269]; Institutional Research Funding of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 20-31]; University of Manchester","We thank Aime Randveer, Sirgi Saar and Siim-Kaarel Sepp for help in planting, harvesting and measuring plants.

We analyzed the soil attached to the roots (i.e., rhizospheric soil) under 13 Mediterranean species grown in monocultures in a common garden experiment for four years, and compared it to a bare soil. The mass distribution of aggregates in six size-classes and aggregate MWD were calculated, both on a rhizospheric soil and root biomass basis. Compared to bare soil, macroaggregate mass increased by an average of 13% in the presence of plants, with a strong effect of species and life forms (both P < 0.0001); some species such as Sanguisorba minor showing increases of up to similar to 40%. Although the soil under graminoids had a greater macroaggregate mass, their MWD was lower than under non-woody dicots. Large (2000-1000 mu m) and intermediate (1000-500 mu m) macroaggregate mass increased with root mass and length density and decreased with root lignin concentration, while very large macroaggregate (6000-2000 mu m) mass and the MWD increased with root soluble compound concentration. Species and life forms differently influenced the distribution of macroaggregates among size-classes and aggregate MWD. Easily-decomposable roots with traits related to resource acquisition (i.e., high fine root length, high water-soluble compound concentration) are more favorable for the development of water-stable macroaggregates than roots traits related to resource conservation (high lignin concentration, thick roots).","[Poirier, Vincent; Munson, Alison D.] Univ Laval, Ctr Forest Res, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Roumet, Catherine] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Angers, Denis A.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Quebec Res & Dev Ctr, 2560 Hochelaga Blvd, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada; [Poirier, Vincent] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Unite Rech & Dev Agroalimentaire Abitibi Temiscam, 79 Rue Cote, Quebec City, PQ J0Z 3B0, Canada","Poirier, V (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Unite Rech & Dev Agroalimentaire Abitibi Temiscam, 79 Rue Cote, Quebec City, PQ J0Z 3B0, Canada.",vincent.poirier@uqat.ca,"Angers, Denis/AAA-9510-2019",,"Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Groupement de Recherche International ""Dynamique de la biodiversite et traits d'histoire de vie"" (GDRI, CNRS, France) [BFC 44745]; Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-STRA-09]","The authors would like to thank the Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies for financial support through a postdoctoral fellowship awarded to Vincent Poirier, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for a Discovery grant awarded to Alison D.

Regarding the shift towards managing forests as complex adaptive systems, we also need insight into the effects of structural diversity. Strict forest reserves, left for spontaneous development, offer unique opportunities for studying the effects of diversity in tree species and stand structure. We used data from repeated inventories in ten forest reserves in the Netherlands and northern Belgium to study the growth of pine and oak. We investigated whether the diversity of a tree's local neighbourhood (i.e., species and structural diversity) is important in explaining its basal area growth. For the subcanopy oak trees, we found a negative effect of the tree species richness of the local neighbours, which - in the studied forests - was closely related to the share of shade-casting tree species in the neighbourhood. The growth of the taller oak trees was positively affected by the height diversity of the neighbour trees. Pine tree growth showed no relation with neighbourhood diversity. Tree growth decreased with neighbourhood density for both species (although no significant relationship was found for the small pines). We found no overall diversity-growth relationship in the studied uneven-aged mature forests; the relationship depended on tree species identity and the aspect of diversity considered (species vs. structural diversity).

To assess this riparian restoration, we compared this experimental site (ES) with a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS) with regard to soil organic matter, humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA), glomalin, soil aggregation and porosity. The results did not show significant differences between ES and PS with regard to soil aggregation and porosity. The cation exchange capacity and the HA and FA contents of ES were significantly different from those in PS and DS. Whereas the HA content of ES was less than that in PS, FA was significantly increased. The order of aromatic composition of humic substances by site was PS>ES>DS and contrasted with the aliphatic composition, which was DS>ES>PS. A principal component analysis based on all variables demonstrated that ES was closer to PS than to DS but that there was no overlap among sites, as PS was driven by humic aromatic substances and the experimental site by fulvic and aliphatic compounds. We concluded that there was a functional recovery of ecosystem services related to soil aggregation and porosity, but the qualitative differences in organic matter formation between the restored and preserved sites were not consistent with ES being fully restored.","[Santos, H.

We examined potential effects of the invasive annual plant Impatiens glandulifera Royle on soil fungal and bacterial communities in temperate forests. Using a space-for-time approach, we established 72 plots in forest areas invaded by I. glandulifera and in forest areas, which were not yet invaded, equally distributed over three coniferous and three deciduous forests. In each plot, we determined plant species richness and abundance in the above-ground vegetation as well as the diversity and composition of the soil fungal community using T-RFLP analysis. Biolog Ecoplates were used to assess the activity of soil bacteria. The invasion of I. glandulifera caused significant shifts in plant species composition. Invaded plots were characterized by a higher diversity and an altered composition of the soil fungal community and by a lower soil bacterial activity in late spring. Carbon substrate utilization patterns of soil bacteria were also changed in invaded plots. Our experiment shows that I. glandulifera can modify soil fungal and bacterial communities, indicating an indirect effect of altered soil properties induced by the invasive plant, combined with the release of allelopathic compounds into the soil.","[Gaggini, Luca; Rusterholz, Hans-Peter; Baur, Bruno] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johann Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Gaggini, L (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johann Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",luca.gaggini@unibas.ch; hans-peter.rusterholtz@unibas.ch; bruno.baur@unibas.ch,,,,,,90,7,8,5,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

All seedlings of early-successional species died under competition, but 30-40 days earlier when the grass was mycorrhizal, compared with the non-mycorrhizal grass. The grass' root system seems to use the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) hyphae network to increase its competitiveness with the woody seedlings, reducing their lifetime. In the second trial, AMF showed to be vital for three fast-growing exotic grasses (U. brizantha, Megathyrsus maximus, and Paspalum notatum) grown in a low-fertility soil. Conversely, in a high-fertility soil, the non-mycorrhizal grasses produced three times more shoot dry mass than mycorrhizal grasses. The growth depression of mycorrhizal grasses was attributed to the carbon drain for AMF maintenance. In the third trial, we excluded the effect of U. brizantha root competition using a steel mesh that allowed the passage of only AMF hyphae. Seedlings of early- and late successional woody species were grown around non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal U. brizantha which roots were confined within the steel mesh. The AMF hyphae associated to U. brizantha passed through the net and colonized the woody seedling roots, forming a common mycorrhizal network (CMN). The seedlings of early-successional woody species grew three-times more without CMN, suggesting that the CMN associated with the root grass increased the competition and anticipated the seedlings death, as observed in the first trial. Conversely, the seedlings of late-successional woody species were not affected by the CMN. Fine root traits of the early- and late successional woody species can explain the differences in seedlings establishment during below-ground competition with U. brizantha, whereas the AMF increase the competitiveness of the grass and make harder the survival and establishment of early-successional woody seedlings.","[Zangaro, Waldemar; Matsuura, Enio Massao; Lirio Rondina, Artur Berbel] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Azevedo Marques Lescano, Luis Eduardo] Univ Estadual Norte Parana, Campus Luiz Meneghel, BR-86360000 Bandeirantes, PR, Brazil; [Nogueira, Marco Antonio] Embrapa Soja, POB 231, BR-86001970 Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Zangaro, Waldemar; Matsuura, Enio Massao; Lirio Rondina, Artur Berbel] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Azevedo Marques Lescano, Luis Eduardo; Nogueira, Marco Antonio] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Microbiol, Programa Posgrad Microbiol, Londrina, PR, Brazil","Zangaro, W (reprint author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil.",wzangaro@uel.br,"Zangaro, Waldemar/A-2890-2008",,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [470170],This study was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (470170).

The accumulation of beneficial or antagonistic biota over time can have strong positive or negative effects on the recruitment of new individuals into the population (i.e., plant-soil feedback, PSF). Despite the potential influence of PSF on plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of its determinants remains incomplete. Within forests, recent evidence indicates that mycorrhizal type can regulate PSF: Arbuscular mycorrhizal trees typically experience negative PSF, while ectomycorrhizal trees experience positive PSF. Other studies have found that plant traits and the local environment also affect PSF; yet, these studies are based on arbuscular mycorrhizal plants in herbaceous systems. Consequently, the relationship between PSF and plant traits or the environment may depend on the mycorrhizal type of the tree. Using PSF measurements for 520 populations belonging to 52 North American temperate forest tree species, we tested whether mycorrhizal type influences how plant traits and climate relate to PSF. For both mycorrhizal types, species that produced larger seeds and were less drought tolerant had more positive (or less negative) PSF. Precipitation during the dry season was negatively related to PSF, but only for arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. These results suggest that investing more resources in seeds may minimize PSF for tree species, irrespective of mycorrhizal type. Species that have historically been exposed to greater pathogen abundances in wetter environments may also be better defended against attack, minimizing negative PSF. However, for species currently found in wetter environments, PSF may be strongly negative if their mycorrhizas do not defend them against attack, as is common among arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. Combined, these results highlight the importance of mycorrhizal type in determining the relationship between PSF and climate, but indicate that the relationship between PSF and plant traits may be independent of mycorrhizal type. Nevertheless, mycorrhizal type remains an important consideration when studying PSF, and forest dynamics in general.","[Bennett, Jonathan A.; Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Bennett, Jonathan A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada","Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.; Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",jon.a.bennett@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC Accelerator Award; NSERC postdoctoral fellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This research was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant and NSERC Accelerator Award to JK and an NSERC postdoctoral fellowship awarded to JAB.,,53,6,6,2,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAR,2018,9,3,,,,,,,e02132,10.1002/ecs2.2132,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1JO,WOS:000428071900008,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"d'Entremont, TW; Lopez-Gutierrez, JC; Walker, AK",,,,"d'Entremont, Tyler W.; Lopez-Gutierrez, Juan C.; Walker, Allison K.",,,"Examining Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Saltmarsh Hay (Spartina patens) and Smooth Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia",NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WETLAND RESTORATION; CRYPTOCOCCUS-AUREUS; PLANT ZONATION; GROWTH; VEGETATION; TOLERANCE; BACTERIA; STRESS; ISLAND; SALINE,"Saltmarshes are highly productive ecosystems that provide nursery and refuge habitat for animals, buffer storm-wave effects, and stabilize coastlines.

However, tests of OPT applied to the root system of mature trees or stands exposed to long-term drying show mixed, partly contradicting, results, indicating an overly simplistic understanding of how moisture affects plant-internal carbon allocation. We investigated the response of the root system (0-240 cm depth) of European beech to long-term decrease in water supply in six mature forests located across a precipitation gradient (855-576 mm mean annual precipitation, MAP). With reference to OPT, we hypothesized that declining precipitation across this gradient would: (H1) cause the profile total of fine root biomass (FRB; roots < 2 mm) to increase relative to total leaf mass; (H2) trigger a shift to a shallower root system; and (H3) induce different responses in the depth distributions of different root diameter classes. In contradiction to H1, neither total FRB (0-240 cm) nor the FRB:leaf mass ratio changed significantly with the MAP decrease. The support for H2 was only weak: the 95% rooting depth of fine roots decreased with decreasing MAP, whereas the maximum extension of small coarse roots (2-5 mm) increased, indicating contrasting responses of different root diameter classes. We conclude that long-term decline in water supply leads to only minor adaptive modification with respect to the size and structure of the beech root system, with notable change in the depth extension of some root diameter classes but limited capacity to alter the fine root:leaf mass ratio. It appears that OPT cannot adequately predict C allocation shifts in mature trees when exposed to long-term drying.

Plant litter, root exudates and microbial biomass can be used as C substrates to form organo-mineral complexes. Drought effects on plants and microbes could potentially compromise these relative stable soil C pools, by reducing plant C inputs and/or microbial activity. We conducted a 2-year drought experiment using rainout shelters in a semi-natural grassland. We measured aboveground biomass and C and nitrogen (N) in particulate organic matter (Pom), the organo-mineral fraction (Omin), and microbial biomass within the first 15 cm of soil. Aboveground plant biomass was reduced by 50% under drought in both years, but only the dominant C4 grasses were significantly affected. Soil C pools were not affected by drought, but were significantly higher in the relatively wet second year compared to the first year. Omin-C was positively related to microbial C during the first year, and positively related to clay and silt content in the second year. Increases in Omin-C in the second year were explained by increases in legume biomass and its effect on Pom-N and microbial biomass N (MBN) through structural equation modeling. In conclusion, soil C pools were unaffected by the drought treatment. Drought resistant legumes enhanced formation of organo-mineral complexes through increasing Pom-N and MBN. Our findings also indicate the importance of microbes for the formation of Omin-C as long as soil minerals have not reached their maximum capacity to bind with C (that is, saturation).","[Canarini, Alberto; Mariotte, Pierre; Ingram, Lachlan; Merchant, Andrew; Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Carbon Water & Food, 380 Werombi Rd, Camden, NSW 2570, Australia; [Canarini, Alberto] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosystem Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Mariotte, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Mariotte, Pierre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Canarini, A (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Carbon Water & Food, 380 Werombi Rd, Camden, NSW 2570, Australia.; Canarini, A (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosystem Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",alberto.canarini@hotmail.it,"Merchant, Andrew/C-8689-2011; Canarini, Alberto/J-1245-2019; Mariotte, Pierre/G-4798-2011; Dijkstra, Feike A/H-2182-2012; Ingram, Lachlan/E-3529-2013","Merchant, Andrew/0000-0001-8979-6786; Mariotte, Pierre/0000-0001-8570-8742; Dijkstra, Feike A/0000-0002-6191-6018; Ingram, Lachlan/0000-0002-4697-9504",University of Vienna; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT100100779]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P300P3_154648]; Australian Research Council future fellowshipAustralian Research Council [FT120100200],"Open access funding provided by University of Vienna.

Plants contribute to soil mineral weathering, mainly by producing acidic or complexing root exudates. In addition, many plants produce antioxidant compounds and phenolic substances that could also contribute to mineral transformation processes, but have rarely been considered in relation to mineral weathering. An incubation experiment was carried out for 2months under controlled conditions to assess the effects of antioxidant plant metabolites on the weathering processes of a clay mineral. A freshly excavated, sulphur-rich Callovo-Oxfordian argillite (COx) sample was artificially leached with three concentrations of three antioxidant compounds (linalool, thymol and carvacrol) or water as a control. The weathering of COx was followed by the analysis of amounts of anions and cations in the leachates. Chlorine, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and potassium were found in the leachates, whereas iron and aluminium were close to the detection limits. Sulphate leaching reflected oxidation of the pyritic matter contained in COx (mainly fine pyrite particles) by air. Water alone was enough to cause notable leaching of elements such as S and P, but the percentage of leached sulphate increased in the presence of two antioxidant compounds, carvacrol and thymol, and increased to 38% with thymol at 2mgl(-1) compared with the antioxidant-free control. Thus, antioxidant compounds could contribute to the leaching of elements from COx, depending on their nature and concentration.","[Ubersfeld, D.; Leyval, C.; Mustin, C.] Univ Lorraine, Fac Sci & Technol, LIEC, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Ubersfeld, D.; Leyval, C.; Mustin, C.] CNRS, Fac Sci & Technol, LIEC, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Redon, P.

Although the role of roots in plant anchoring and support is important, previous studies have focused much attention on the morphological traits of above-ground parts, with relatively less attention given to the root structures of aquatic plants. In this study, we aimed to compare differences in root morphological and structural traits between introduced and native plants in response to different substrates. We hypothesized that introduced aquatic plants have an advantage over native plants with regard to root trait values and plasticity. A total of six aquatic plants were used: Two invasive and one exotic noninvasive species were paired with their native counterparts according to life form (amphibious emergent, submerged and floating-leaved) and cultivated in substrates of clay, a clay/sand mixture (v:v = 1:1) or sand. Root morphological traits, topological indices and root relative distance plasticity indices were quantified. The results indicated that different substrates have various effects on the root traits of these six aquatic plants; the introduced plants generally exhibited higher plasticity than did their native counterparts of the same life form.","[Huang, Xiaolong; Shen, Nan; Guan, Xin; Xu, Xuan; Kong, Fanjiao; Liu, Chunhua; Yu, Dan] Wuhan Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China","Liu, CH (reprint author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liuchh@163.com,,"Huang, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4727-6090",Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research [2013FY112300]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2015ZX07503-005],"We would like to thank A/Prof. Sidinei M.

Mycorrhizal fungal necromass is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to soil organic carbon pools, particularly in forest ecosystems. While its decomposition rate is primarily determined by biochemical composition, how traits such as melanin content affect the structure of necromass decomposer communities remains poorly understood. 2. To assess the role of biochemical traits on microbial decomposer community composition and functioning, we incubated melanized and non-melanized necromass of the mycorrhizal fungus Meliniomyces bicolor in Pinus-and Quercus-dominated forests in Minnesota, USA and then assessed the associated fungal and bacterial decomposer communities after 1, 2 and 3 months using high-throughput sequencing. 3. Melanized necromass decomposed significantly slower than non-melanized necromass in both forests. The structure of the microbial decomposer communities depended significantly on necromass melanin content, although the effect was stronger for fungi than bacteria. On non-melanized necromass, fungal communities were dominated by r-selected ascomycete and mucoromycete microfungi early and then replaced by basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi, while on melanized necromass these groups were co-dominant throughout the incubation. Bacterial communities were dominated by both specialist mycophageous and generalist taxa. 4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that necromass biochemistry not only strongly affects rates of decomposition but also the structure of the associated decomposer communities. Furthermore, the observed colonization patterns suggest that fungi, and particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi, may play a more important role in necromass decomposition than previously recognized.","[Fernandez, Christopher W.; Kennedy, Peter G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Kennedy, Peter G.] Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN USA","Fernandez, CW (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",cwfernan@umn.edu,,"Fernandez, Christopher/0000-0002-6310-6027",Norwegian Centennial Chairs Research Grant,Norwegian Centennial Chairs Research Grant,,62,12,12,6,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The distribution of mycorrhizal associations across biomes parallels a distinct gradient of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, raising the question of how mycorrhizal traits relate to ecosystem properties. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) hosts and fungi employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may manifest in differences in soil C and N pools and/or soil C: N. However, cross-biome comparisons are confounded with climatic and edaphic gradients as well as phylogenetic and functional trait distributions of component plant species. Here, we test emerging hypotheses that soil C, N and C: N are related to the dominance of EM trees within a temperate forest region where AM and EM trees largely coexist but vary in local abundance. 2. To determine the importance of mycorrhizal type on soil C and N, we analysed data from c. 1,000 forest inventory plots in the eastern United States. For each plot, we quantified the dominance of trees with different mycorrhizal associations and accounted for potentially confounding variables including phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), leaf N, soil clay content and climate. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to determine how these variables explained the patterns of soil C and N in the forest floor and mineral soil layers. 3. Increasing EM dominance was associated with higher C: N across all soil layers. This relationship remained even after accounting for tree phylogeny, leaf N content, soil clay content, temperature and precipitation, which were all important for explaining soil C: N. However, this mycorrhizal pattern of soil C: N was not related to increases in soil C content; rather, increasing EM dominance was associated with reductions in soil N. 4. Synthesis. Our findings are consistent with the proposition that mycorrhizal associations are related to terrestrial ecosystem properties. The mycorrhizal effect on soil C: N may result from differences in how arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants interact with their fungal symbionts, decomposers and organic matter, to sustain differential cycling of C and N. Alternatively, these patterns could arise from differential success of the two mycorrhizal types in contrasting soil conditions; both processes may occur simultaneously, leading to a self-reinforcing positive feedback.","[Zhu, Kai] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [McCormack, M.

We investigated the competitive abilities for belowground resources of Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper) and Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush) based on fine root traits and spatial patterns of water uptake inferred from stem and soil stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18). Data were collected from neighboring J. osteosperma and A. tridentata plants in northern Colorado and included measurements of different size classes of J. osteosperma: short (< 30 cm), intermediate (30 cm(-3) m), and tall (> 3 m). Short J. osteosperma switched from utilizing shallow to primarily deep water sources across the growing season. Artemisia tridentata had root traits associated with faster root proliferation and resource acquisition (significantly greater specific root length and smaller root diameter, p <.01), but greater J. osteosperma fine root biomass (p <.01) resulted in similar root length densities between the two species at most soil depths (p >.1). Additionally, we found that short J. osteosperma individuals can quickly develop deep root systems, but there is little difference in below ground foraging between individuals of J. osteosperma and A. tridentata based on the depth of water uptake and root length density.","[Chesus, K.

Such stocks are difficult to assess in heterogeneous landscapes where the soil properties and the forest structure and functionality vary in space and time. Here we show that geopedological mapping is useful to quantify the above and belowground C stocks in the different land units of the Lacandon tropical rainforest, southeast Mexico. We used an ordination method to recognize major gradients in the soil and we applied regression analyses to identify relationships between soil properties and AGB. Total forest C stocks differed among land units (287 to 478 Mg C ha(-1) in limestone mountains and fluvial terraces, respectively). Soil constrains like rooting depth (ranging from 0.13 to 1.34 m), available water storage capacity (ranging from 32.3 to 161.4 L m(-2)) and Al saturation in the ion exchange complex (0 to 22.6% Al-sat) were correlated with the aboveground biomass (AGE) C stock by affecting the stem size and density of trees. Soil organic carbon (SOC) in the solum represented 22 to 46% of the total forest C stock in the different landscape units, of which 28 to 45% was stored below 30 cm depth. Therefore, an accurate assessment of forest C stocks must consider not only the variation between land units with contrasting soil properties, but also the solum depth. Our results indicate that stratified sampling based on geopedologic mapping is useful to allocate incentives assessment of C storage at relatively low costs and with reasonable effort.","[Navarrete-Segueda, Armando; Siebe, Christina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Ciudad Univ,Circuito Invest Cient S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Martinez-Ramos, Miguel; Ibarta-Manriquez, Guillermo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Potzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Vazquez-Selem, Lorenzo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geog, Ciudad Univ,Circuito Invest Cient S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Navarrete-Segueda, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Ciudad Univ,Circuito Invest Cient S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",anavarretesegueda@yahoo.com.mx; mmartinez@cieco.unam.mx; gibarra@cieco.unam.mx; lselem@igg.unam.mx; siebe@unam.mx,", Armando Navarrete-Segueda/U-8454-2019; Vazquez-Selem, Lorenzo/F-9329-2019; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019","Vazquez-Selem, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7798-6187; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Navarrete-Segueda, Armando/0000-0001-6614-8751","DGAPA-PAPIIT program of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN221613-3, IN212617]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Laboratorio Universitario de Nanotecnologia Ambiental of the Centro de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnologico, UNAM","This paper constitutes a partial fulfilment of the Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) as part of the doctorate degree of A.

The mechanism of transport and translocation of PAHs within mangrove sediment is not well understood. In the present study, the mobility of pyrene-in two typical mangrove sediments was studied using soil thin layer chromatography (TLC). The mobility of pyrene in the sediments displayed an inverse trend with organic carbon (fob content. As one of the important fraction in sediment organic matter pool, the influence of root exudates on adsorption of pyrene within the tested sediments was also evaluated. In particular, root exudates significantly enhanced the bioavailability and mobility of pyrene in the sediments. The effectiveness of root exudates in promotion of pyrene mobility follows an order: citric acid > oxalic acid > malic acid > artificial root exudates (ARE). In addition, mobility factors of pyrene from root exudate treatments were significantly higher than the value determined in the control, and the magnitude of mobility factor (R-f) showed a positive correlation with root exudate concentrations. Results of this study could promote our understanding of the mobility of PAHs in contaminated mangrove sediments.","[Jia, Hui; Dai, Minyue; Lu, Haoliang; Yan, Chongling] Xiamen Univ, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jia, Hui; Hou, Deyi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Yan, CL (reprint author), Xiamen Univ, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.",ycl@xmu.edu.cn,,,Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31530008]; National Important Scientific Research Programme of China [2013CB956504]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370516]; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [17KJD180002],"This work was supported by Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31530008), National Important Scientific Research Programme of China (2013CB956504), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370516), Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (17KJD180002).

Soil organic matter has a relevant role together with the renaturalization process of shallow soil under vines (V) and olive groves (OL), cork oak (S) and pine (P1) trees, pasture (PR), Cisttis (MC) and Erica (MB) scrub in abandoned areas of NE Spain that are sensitive to fire. Physical, chemical, biological and biochemical properties of the soil determined season by season warned against its fragility. Pyrolysis-GC products showed in general moderate to strong positive and negative correlation with soil organic carbon (OC), easily extractable glomalin (EE-GRSP) and total glomalin (GRSP), f3-glucosidase and protease, which strengthens the hypothesis that both less and mote recalcitrant SOM fractions might be inferred and so there is a scale of potential carbon storage in the environments studied. Recently abandoned V and OL soil had small OC contents (mean 2.51 +/- 0.25 and 15.26 +/- 1.39 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 1.04 +/- 0.22 and 2.84 +/- 0.53 g kg(-1)) and large contents of aromatic compounds. By contrast, PR and MB soil had large OC (mean 36.24 +/- 0.75 and 37.66 +/- 2.38 g kg(-1)) and GRSP (mean 4.85 +/- 0.87 and 3.88 +/- 0.76 g kg(-1)) content and smaller contents of aromatic compounds. This suggested a renewal of active OC in older soil. In fact, EE-GRSP and GRSP of more organic soil were positively correlated with the mineralization indices N/O (Furfural/Pyrrole) and O/Y (Pyrrole/Phenol) from active organic compounds (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively), and negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the humification index B/E3 (Benzene/Toluene) from recalcitrant organic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified those environments where soil renaturalization is better. Our findings might indicate the potential for carbon storage in different abandoned shallow soil environments under renaturalization in Mediterranean climate conditions.","[Gispert, Maria; Pardini, Giovanni] Univ Girona, Dept Chem Engn Agr & Food Technol, Soil Sci Unit, C Maria Aurelia Capmany 61, Girona 17003, Spain; [Emran, Mohamed] City Sci Res & Technol Applicat, Arid Lands Cultivat Res Inst, Land & Water Technol Dept, Alexandria 21934, Egypt; [Doni, Serena; Masciandaro, Graziana] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Sect Soil Chem, Via Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy","Pardini, G (reprint author), Univ Girona, Dept Chem Engn Agr & Food Technol, Soil Sci Unit, C Maria Aurelia Capmany 61, Girona 17003, Spain.",maria.gispert@udg.edu; giovanni.pardini@udg.edu; memran@srtacity.sci.eg; serena.doni@ise.cnr.it; g.masciandaro@ise.cnr.it,"Gispert, Maria/L-1205-2014; Emran, Mohamed/G-6731-2015","Gispert, Maria/0000-0002-5074-2307; Emran, Mohamed/0000-0001-7828-1322; Doni, Serena/0000-0002-9428-9778; Masciandaro, Grazia/0000-0003-2983-1943","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain [CGL2007-66644-004-02, BES-2008-010099]",Research supported by the project CGL2007-66644-004-02 and the pre-doctoral grant BES-2008-010099 both funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.,,44,4,4,4,53,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,MAR,2018,162,,,,,,402,413,,10.1016/j.catena.2017.10.019,,,12,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,FT2VT,WOS:000423004800038,,,,,10/31/19J,"Shu, WW; Shen, XX; Lei, PF; Xiang, WH; Ouyang, SA; Yan, WD",,,,"Shu, Weiwei; Shen, Xiaoxiao; Lei, Pifeng; Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Yan, Wende",,,Temporal changes of fine root overyielding and foraging strategies in planted monoculture and mixed forests,BMC ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fine root biomass; Vertical distribution; Specific root length; Overyielding; Stand age,FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; NORWAY SPRUCE; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; STANDS; BEECH; EUCALYPTUS; PRODUCTIVITY; MORPHOLOGY,"Background: Mixed forests are believed to enhance ecosystem functioning and sustainability due to complementary resource use, environmental benefits and improved soil properties. The facilitation between different species may induce overyielding. Meanwhile, the species-specific fine root foraging strategies and tradeoffs would determine the structure and dynamics of plant communities. Here the aim was to investigate the admixing effects of fine-root biomass, vertical distribution and morphology in Pinus massoniana-Cinnamomum camphora mixed plantations and corresponding monocultures at 10-, 24- and 45-year old stands. Results: The fine root biomass in the Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed forest exerted a certain degree of overyielding effect. These positive admixing effects, however, did not enhance with forest stand development. The overall relative yield total ranged from 1.83 and 1.51 to 1.33 in 10-, 24- and 45-year-old stand, respectively. The overyielding was mainly attributed to the over-performance of late successional species, Cinnamomum, in mixed stands. The vertical fine root biomass distribution model showed fine roots of pioneer species, Pinus, shifted to the superficial layer when mixed with Cinnamomum. Furthermore, the specific root length (SRL) of Pinus was significantly higher in Pinus-Cinnamomum mixed stands than that in monocultures, and the magnitude of differences increased over time. However, the vertical fine-root distribution and SRL for Cinnamomum did not show significant differences between monoculture and mixtures. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the magnitude of fine root overyielding in mixed forests showed a high degree of consistency with the total amount of fine root biomass itself, suggesting the overyielding effects in mixed forests were correlated with the degree of belowground interaction and competition degree involved. The late successional species, Cinnamomum, invested more carbon to belowground by increasing the fine root biomass in mixtures. While the pioneer species, Pinus, adapted to the presence of the species Cinnamomum by modification of vertical distribution and root morphological plasticity in the mixtures. These species-specific fine root foraging strategies might imply the differences of forest growth strategies of co-occurring species and contribute to the success and failure of particular species during the succession over time.","[Shu, Weiwei; Shen, Xiaoxiao; Lei, Pifeng; Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Yan, Wende] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lei, Pifeng; Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Yan, Wende] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Natl Engn Lab Appl Technol Forestry & Ecol South, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China","Lei, PF (reprint author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Lei, PF (reprint author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Natl Engn Lab Appl Technol Forestry & Ecol South, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.",pifeng.lei@outlook.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200346, 31670448]",This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31200346 and 31670448).,,47,2,2,1,21,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1472-6785,,,BMC ECOL,BMC Ecol.,17-Feb,2018,18,,,,,,,,9,10.1186/s12898-018-0166-z,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3RK,WOS:000425989700001,29454355,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Lai, ZR; Zhang, YQ; Liu, JB; Wu, B; Qin, SG; Fa, KY",,,,"Lai, Zongrui; Zhang, Yuqing; Liu, Jiabin; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shugao; Fa, Keyu",,,"Fine-root distribution, production, decomposition, and effect on soil organic carbon of three revegetation shrub species in northwest China (vol 359C, pg 381, 2016)",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Correction,,,,,,,,,"[Lai, Zongrui; Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shugao; Fa, Keyu] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shugao] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiabin] Northwest A&F Univ, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, 35 Qinghua Eastrd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangyqbjfu@gmail.com,,,,,,1,0,0,0,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

To determine if some plant species are more useful for stabilizing soil aggregates and thus reducing erodibility, we examined three species endemic to New Caledonia, and measured how root traits and associated mycorrhizas and fungi influenced Ferralsol aggregate stability (MWD). The three species are hosts to different types of mycorrhizas and were: (i) the sedge Costularia arundinacea (Sol. Ex Vahl) Kuk., an AMF (ar-buscular mycorrhizal fungi) host, (ii) the shrub Tristaniopsis glauca Brongn. &Gris and (iii) the tree Arillastrum gummiferum (Pancher ex Brongn. & Gris) Baill., both of the latter are ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) hosts. Fungal abundance, aggregate stability, soil organic carbon (SOC), iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) sesquioxides were measured in the soil beneath 20 individuals for each species, as well as in 20 control samples of bare soil. Root functional traits including root mass density (RMD), root length density (RLD) and percentage of fine roots were measured on all individuals. Results showed that plant species can significantly influence soil aggregate stability. MWD was greater in soil beneath Costularia characterized by high RMD, RLD, percentage of fine roots and fungal abundance, while MWD in the rhizosphere of Tristaniopsis and Arillastrum was similar to that of bare soil. Fe and Al were very high in all soil samples and are suspected of masking the influence of roots, fungi and SOC on MWD at the scale of isolated ECM-hosts. Therefore, MWD alone would not be a relevant predictor of restoration on such soil and further investigations should be carried out to identify a set of predictors useful for indicating the restoration of degraded soils on ultramafic substrates.","[Demenois, Julien; Carriconde, Fabian] Inst Agronom neoCaledonien IAC, Equipe Sol & Vegetat SolVeg, BP18239, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Demenois, Julien] AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bonaventure, Pauline] INRA, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Maeght, Jean-Luc] IRD UPMC CNRS INRA UDD UPEC, iEES Paris, Soils & Fertilisers Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Stoke, Alexia] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, Amap,Ird,Cirad, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Rey, Freddy] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, UR EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France","Demenois, J (reprint author), AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France.",demenois@iac.nc,"Demenois, Julien/P-1020-2019","Demenois, Julien/0000-0002-2271-8465; Maeght, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-7292-1955",INRAInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA); IAC [DE2013-041]; French Ministry of Agriculture; Societe Le Nickel [DE2013-041],"We gratefully acknowledge the field staff of IAC ('Unite SARA'): A.

In this study, trenching method was used to separate R-H and R-A. Simultaneous measurements of soil respiration and soil microclimate were conducted within two temperate forests (a birch forest and a spruce fir forest). We aimed to analyze the seasonal variations of the Q(10) of R-s and its two components (heterotrophic [R-H] and autotrophic [R-A]) and to find relevant influencing factors. The Q(10) values ranged from 0.3 to 5.4, and exhibited strong seasonal variation. The regression analysis showed a negative relationship between Q(10) and soil temperature in the two forests. Additionally, the Q(10) values of R-H were also negatively correlated with soil microbial biomass carbon. Positive relationships were found between the temperature dependency of R-H and soil organic carbon and C:N only in birch forest, and the seasonal dynamics for Q(10) of R-A was more dependent on fine root biomass compared to soil temperature in this forest. Soil moisture had no effects on the seasonal changes of Q(10) due to its slight fluctuation throughout the growing season. The Q(10) value of long-term was a little higher compared to that of short-term. These results emphasize the importance of independently exploring the short-term Q(10) of R-H and R-A; and a single apparent Q(10) should be used with caution in estimating soil CO2 emission under global warming.","[Han, Mengguang; Jin, Guangze] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Jin, GZ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",taxus@126.com,"Jin, Guangze/F-5271-2017; Jin, Guangze/M-7312-2019; Han, Mengguang/AAC-3194-2019","Jin, Guangze/0000-0002-9852-0965; Jin, Guangze/0000-0002-9852-0965; ",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017EA02]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitiesProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT_15R09],"We are very grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that greatly improved this manuscript.

To estimate biomass in stems, branches and roots takes intensive fieldwork to uproot, cut and weigh the mass of each component. Different models or equations are also required. Our research focussed on the dry tropical Zambezi teak forests and we studied their structure at three sites following a rainfall gradient in Zambia. We sampled 3558 trees at 42 plots covering a combined area of 15ha. Using data from destructive tree samples, we developed mixed-species biomass models to estimate above ground biomass for small (< 5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m above-ground)) and large (>= 5 cm DBH) trees involving 90 and 104 trees respectively, that belonged to 12 species. A below-ground biomass model was developed from seven trees of three species (16-44 cm DBH) whose complete root systems were excavated. Three stump models were also derived from these uprooted trees. Finally, we determined the C fractions from 194 trees that belonged to 12 species. The analysis revealed that DBH was the only predictor that significantly correlated to both above-ground and below ground biomass. We found a mean root-to-shoot ratio of 0.38:0.62. The C fraction in leaves ranged from 39% to 42%, while it varied between 41% and 46% in wood. The C fraction was highest at the Kabompo site that received the highest rainfall, and lowest at the intermediate Namwala site. The C stocks varied between 15 and 36 ton C ha(-1) and these stocks where highest at the wetter Kabompo site and lowest at the drier Sesheke site. Our results indicate that the projected future rainfall decrease for southern Africa, will likely reduce the C storage potential of the Zambezi teak forests, thereby adversely affecting their mitigating role in climate change.","[Ngoma, Justine; Vinya, Royd] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, POB 21692, Kitwe, Zambia; [Ngoma, Justine; Leemans, Rik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Speer, James H.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Syst, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Kruijt, Bart] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Moors, Eddy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Leemans, Rik] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Syst Anal Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Chidumayo, Emmanuel N.] Makeni Savanna Res Project, POB 50323, Lusaka, Zambia; [Moors, Eddy] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands","Ngoma, J (reprint author), Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, POB 21692, Kitwe, Zambia.",justinangoma@yahoo.com,"Vinya, Royd/G-5413-2011; Speer, James H./C-3813-2014; Leemans, Rik/A-1548-2009","Vinya, Royd/0000-0003-0478-2612; Speer, James H./0000-0003-1188-0552; Ngoma, Justine/0000-0003-1264-2249; Leemans, Rik/0000-0002-4001-6301; Kruijt, Bart/0000-0002-6186-1731",Copperbelt University; HEART project of the NUFFIC-NICHE programme; International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science [D/5466-1]; Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future,"This research was funded by The Copperbelt University, the HEART project of the NUFFIC-NICHE programme, the International Foundation for Science (IFS) (Grant number D/5466-1), and the Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future.",,82,1,1,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1146-609X,1873-6238,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

The true magnitude of fungal diversity has only recently been appreciated thanks to next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the development of large-scale DNA sequence datasets. In the last years, a great deal of effort has been dedicated to characterizing the fungal communities in soil. Fungal activity influences the structure of plant communities and provides various ecosystem processes. Mycorrhizal fungi are specialized root symbionts that interact with a great diversity of plants, forming the ""mycorrhizae"". The development of several genome/transcriptome projects on soil fungi with different lifestyles is allowing to identify new functions and to verify how different mycorrhizal fungi interact and communicate with their host plants. In this brief note, attention will focus on some old and new aspects related to these widespread symbioses, highlighting some of their potentialities in agro-forest environments.","[Balestrini, Raffaella; Lumini, Erica] CNR, IPSP, Turin, Italy","Balestrini, R (reprint author), CNR, IPSP, Torino Unit, Viale Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",raffaella.balestrini@ipsp.cnr.it,"LUMINI, Erica/F-8901-2013; Balestrini, Raffaella/D-1975-2010","LUMINI, Erica/0000-0001-5864-8561; Balestrini, Raffaella/0000-0001-7958-7681",,,,104,4,4,6,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Traditionally, and to a large extent, even today research into the topic of soil biology is rooted in agroecosystems. The humus context is neither a Mull nor a Moder but is more closely related to the former. In consequence, advance knowledge is poorly suited to the natural humus profile, notably to the Moder way of life, despite the number of studies concerning biodiversity. In this paper, Mull and Moder are taken as examples of contrasting life-styles. These two humus forms exhibit such dramatic differences that they support two different food webs enclosing high levels of unshared species diversity. A spectrum between Mull and Moder can be interpreted as a juxtaposition of hotspots coming from the two humus forms. Such an additive effect may explain much of the soil diversity enigma irrespectively of any other ecological determinants (soil, climate and vegetation).","[Bernier, Nicolas] Museum Natl Hist Nat, 4 Ave Petit Chateau, F-91800 Brunoy, France","Bernier, N (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, 4 Ave Petit Chateau, F-91800 Brunoy, France.",bernier@mnhn.fr,,,,,,87,1,1,5,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

The underground parts of a plant are rarely seen; indeed the root system is usually hidden from sight. This is also reflected in science where the interaction between leaves and the atmosphere is much more studied than interactions between roots and soil. One reason for such an imbalance involves the difficulties in studying roots in their heterogeneous and opaque environment. Consequently, relatively little is known about the importance of roots in the soil and how soil physico-chemical properties and soil organisms are influenced by the presence of roots and vice versa. Roots are not merely a passive agent that grow in a challenging environment: roots are engaged in a tremendous number of interactions with soil, which change soil properties and enhance its biotic component. This paper reviews the current state of understanding on the factors involved in root-soil interactions, bearing in mind the specific aim of underlining more recent advances to identify significant gaps in this research field. We also promote a tree-oriented view of roots, describing how soil physico-chemical properties, micro-and macro-fauna, symbiosis and pathogens affect tree root growth and how roots can interact and modify these abiotic and biotic factors. We hope our review will provide an impetus for more studies on the intricate soil-root interactions to enhance the importance of this vast, and somewhat hidden topic.","[Centenaro, Giada; Zanella, Augusto; Crivellaro, Alan] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy; [Hudek, Csilla] Univ Torino, DISAFA Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, I-10095 Turin, Italy; [Crivellaro, Alan] CNR IVALSA, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Florence, Italy","Centenaro, G (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.",giada.cent@gmail.com,"Zanella, Augusto/O-4610-2016; Crivellaro, Alan/C-9287-2014","Zanella, Augusto/0000-0001-7066-779X; Crivellaro, Alan/0000-0002-1307-3239",,,,240,2,2,7,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

In this study, we explored how the combination of species and soil conditions affect overyielding in terms of periodic annual volume increment (PAIV) in Dutch forests. We studied Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Nab.) Franco), common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) growing in four two species combinations (Douglas-fir-common beech, Scots pine-pedunculate oak, pedunculate oak-common beech, and pedunculate oak-silver birch) from 398 long-term permanent field plots all over the Netherlands. We found that the Douglas-fir-common beech and Scots pine-pedunculate oak mixtures always showed overyielding. This overyielding was largely attributed to the Douglas-fir in the former mixture and to the pedunculate oak in the latter mixture, respectively. In both cases, overyielding was stronger at poor soils than at rich soils. The pedunculate oak-common beech mixtures overyielded at poor soils and underyielded at rich soils, which was attributed to the response of the common beech. Overyielding was not observed for the pedunculate oak-silver birch mixtures, irrespective of soil conditions. The results do not support our hypothesis since overyielding was not always driven by fast-growing light-demanding species. Overyielding was stronger for evergreen-deciduous species combinations, suggesting that differences in leaf phenology are a major driver of overyielding. Secondly, our results imply that overyielding is much stronger at poor soils than at rich soils, which is in line with the prediction of the stress-gradient hypothesis. We conclude that the growth of one species benefits from the admixture species, particularly in evergreen-deciduous species mixtures and that soils affect the extent of overyielding as studied in the Netherlands.","[Lu, Huicui; Goudiaby, Venceslas; den Ouden, Jan; Mohren, Godefridus M.

Soil microbes are considered the rate-limiting factor in carbon decomposition. However, the effect of land-use change on soil microbial community and the mechanism of soil carbon dynamics remain unclear. In this study, soil samples were collected during four periods (April, June, August, and October) at sites in the Loess Plateau in China with different land-use types: Robinia pseudoacacia L. (RP) and abandoned land (AL); these areas were converted 40 years ago from similar farmlands, while the millet (Setaria italica) farmlands (FL) were selected as a control in our study. Quantitative PCR and Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes were performed to analyze the abundance, diversity, and compositions of the soil microbes (bacteria and fungi). Additionally, soil organic carbon fractions (soil organic carbon: SOC, dissolved organic carbon: DOC, microbial biomass carbon: MBC) and soil respiration components (soil respiration: SR, heterotrophic respiration: HR, autotrophic respiration: AR) were evaluated. The results showed that SOC fractions and soil respiration increased after land-use change, with significant correlation being observed. In particular, DOC was more related to SR and HR than to the other fractions. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of the microbes (bacteria and fungi) were greatly affected by the land-use change; both of them were significantly and positively correlated with soil organic carbon fractions and soil respiration components. For dominant bacterial phyla, both Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were significantly more abundant in the afforested soil than in the FL, while the abundances of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi ranked as FL > AL > RP. For dominant fungal phyla, Ascomycota responded positively to land-use changes, whereas Basidiomycota responded negatively. Such changes in the abundances of microbial phyla were significantly correlated with the linkage of soil organic carbon fractions and respiration components. Altogether, these results suggest that the changes in components of soil respiration may be highly susceptible to soil organic carbon fractions, especially to DOC, and this linkage is largely modulated by microbial community across land-use changes.","[Ren, Chengjie; Han, Xinhui] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Forming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ren, Chengjie; Wang, Tao; Xu, Yadong; Yang, Gaihe; Han, Xinhui; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ren, Chengjie; Wang, Tao; Xu, Yadong; Yang, Gaihe; Han, Xinhui; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Deng, Jian] Yanan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yanan 716000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fazhu] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Yang, GH; Han, XH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",ygh@nwsuaf.edu.cn; hanxinhui@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Xu, Yadong/0000-0002-8863-7094",State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on Loess Plateau [A314021402-1709]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571501],"This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on Loess Plateau (No. A314021402-1709), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571501).",,50,14,15,26,138,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Forty-eight species of EcM fungi were recovered from sporocarps and 15 ITS species-level were detected from root tips. Seventeen species were new reports to Colombia and seven corresponded to undescribed species. These results confirm that this WSF supports a significant EcM fungal diversity. Most of the species found in this study have been previously reported to be associated with other legume and/or dipterocarp species from geographically distant forests.

The rhizosphere soil of wild endophyte-infected (W-EI) DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) higher available phosphorous and potassium, total organic matter, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen than cultivated soil. In addition, the rhizosphere soil of endophyte-infected DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) lower pH and nitrate nitrogen, and higher available phosphorous, than endophyte-free DHG under cultivated conditions. The sequencing provided a total of 54,413 sequences and these were assigned into 190 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Ascomycota was the most dominant phylum in roots of three DHG populations. W-EI DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) higher RAF diversity than cultivated endophyte-infected (C-EI) DHG: The presence of endophyte significantly (P < 0.05) decreased RAF diversity under cultivation. The principal component analysis (PCA) and sample similarity analysis results indicated that both endophyte and soil disturbance could bring changes to RAF community composition. The RDA results demonstrated the RAF of W-EI DHG were positively correlated with soil properties, and the RAF of cultivated DHG roots were negatively correlated with soil properties. This study demonstrated that both endophyte and soil disturbance resulted in changes to the RAF communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

While manual measurements are well suited to capture the spatial variability of F-s, automated measurements are able to capture its temporal variability at fine time scales. The manual method is the most commonly used method to estimate annual carbon budgets. However, such estimates can be biased depending on the measurement frequency, the time at which measurements are made, and the method used to interpolate F-s between two measurements. In this study, we investigated the effects of within-day measurement frequency and of the time of measurement on the estimation of daily F-s. We also investigated the effects on cumulative F-s estimates of weekly and fortnightly sampling frequencies over several months and of the interpolation method used to cumulate F-s. We based our analyses on two complete datasets of automated measurements (one 12-month and one 4-month) recorded in two contrasting ecosystems (a tropical eucalypt plantation and a temperate poplar plantation). Low-frequency time step within a day (every 360 min for the eucalypt and every 180 min for the poplar plantations) was sufficient to capture mean daily F-s accurately. Furthermore, in the tropical site, measurements averaged over any 6h period provided good estimates of the daily flux. By contrast, biases were observed in the temperate site. With one measurement per week, linear interpolation methods provided accurate cumulative fluxes at both sites. However, all interpolation methods failed to produce robust estimates of cumulative F-s in the temperate plantation with one measurement every two weeks. Automated measurements will help to select the best time slot for manual measurements or to correct manual measurements from the apparent deviation between measurements collected during the sampling period and the 24 h-mean CO2 flux. It will also be useful to elaborate empirical equations used to cumulate F-s obtained manually. Combining manual and automated methods will enhance the accuracy of annual soil carbon budgets in forest plantations.","[Gana, Cecilia; Marron, Nicolas; Epron, Daniel] Univ Lorraine, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, Fac Sci & Technol, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Gana, Cecilia; Marron, Nicolas; Epron, Daniel] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, F-54280 Seichamps, France; [Nouvellon, Yann; Epron, Daniel] CIRAD, UMR Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agroecosyst 11, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Nouvellon, Yann] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Stape, Jose Luiz] Suzano Papel & Celulose Brasil, Ave Brigadeiro Faria Lima 1355, BR-01452919 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Epron, D (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, Fac Sci & Technol, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.; Epron, D (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, F-54280 Seichamps, France.; Epron, D (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agroecosyst 11, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",daniel.epron@univ-lorraine.fr,"MARRON, NICOLAS/J-5965-2013",,Intensfix Project [ANR-2010-STRA-004-03]; EUCFLUX project; Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01],"We are particularly grateful to Caroline Plain and Erwin Dalle for their contribution to data acquisition in the poplar plantation.

We assessed soil resilience by examining resistance to, as well as recovery from, pasture use by smallholder farmers in western Mexico. We measured 25 soil and vegetation properties and compared old-growth forest (OGF) sites and pastures to evaluate resistance to pasture use. We assessed whether those properties recovered to OGF reference values after pasture abandonment by analyzing the trajectories of properties along a chronosequence of secondary vegetation. Finally, we assessed whether recovery of soil properties could be inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties. Nine out of 25 properties differed significantly between the OGF sites and pastures. From these nine nonresistant properties, six (i.e., penetration resistance, soil C concentration, soil C/N, basal area, individual density, rarefied species richness of woody vegetation) showed recovery as a significant positive relationship with forest age. In contrast, surface litter C, litter C/N, and soil available P showed no resistance and no recovery within the successional period examined (up to 35 y). The best vegetation indicator for the recovery of some soil properties was woody species richness. This may suggest that functional differences of colonizing plants matter for recovery after pasture use. Our findings indicate that soil was overall resilient to pasture use, but some properties did not recover synchronously with vegetation properties during succession. Thus, more attention should be paid to soil function, because full ecosystem recovery is often inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties.

However, little is known about how grazing affects the fungi living in roots, especially those with septate hyphae. We investigated grazing intensity effects on culturable root-associated fungi (c-RAF) of three dominant plant species; Artemisia capillaris, Lespedeza davurica, and Stipa bungeana, in a semiarid grassland of northwest China. Plant roots were sampled from four grazing intensities at four sampling dates. The total colonization rate of c-RAF was not affected by grazing intensity, but the diversity of c-RAF displayed a hump-shaped trend with grazing intensities. Few c-RAF were present in all plant species, with most of them being confined to only one or two plant species. The 16 most commonly isolated species were selected to investigate their effects on plant growth and health. Three Fusarium species were most pathogenic c-RAF. Three dark-sterile species did not affect growth parameters, regardless of host plants. With A. capillaris, the occurrence of Fusarium spp. was highest in the control plots, while with S. bungeana, the occurrence tended to increase as the grazing intensity increased. Two dark-sterile species, including Darksidea alpha, in L. davurica roots increased with grazing intensities; in contrast, D. alpha decreased for S. bungeana with grazing intensities. Our results strongly suggest that in grasslands, grazing intensity can lead to changes in the colonization of specific root fungal taxa, and these fungal changes would potentially feed back to plant performance depending on the abundance of host plants.

To determine whether the aboveground vegetation and soil physicochemical properties were the main determinant of beta-diversity and biological interaction of soil microbial community, we sampled soils from the temperate coniferous forest and grassland. Clustering of operational taxonomic units was conducted using 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial composition of the rhizospheres, in which root exudates influence the microbial environment, show lower alpha-diversity than that of nonroot soils. The nonsignificant rhizosphere effect suggested other undetermined factors or stochastic processes accounted for microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. More significant microbe-microbe interactions were observed in forest and rhizosphere soils relative to the grassland soils. The elevated number of positive correlations for relative abundances in forest soil implied beneficial associations being common among bacteria, in particular within the rhizosphere environment. The particular soil properties generated by root exudates also alter the physicochemical properties of soil such as K and pH value, and might in turn favor the adoption of teamwork-cooperation strategies for microbe-microbe interactions, represented as large clusters of positive associations among bacterial taxa. Specific biological interactions differentiated the microbiomes within forest soils. Thus, the environmental selection pressure of aboveground vegetation accounts for differences between soil microbiomes while biotic factors are responsible for fine-scale differences of the microbial community in forest soils.","[Wu, Shu-Hong; Li, Gang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bing-Hong; Huang, Chia-Lung; Liao, Pei-Chun] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88 Ting Chow Rd,Sect 4, Taipei, Taiwan","Liao, PC (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88 Ting Chow Rd,Sect 4, Taipei, Taiwan.",pcliao@ntnu.edu.tw,"Li, Gang/AAB-8254-2019","Liao, Pei-Chun/0000-0003-1733-5504","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2628-B-003-001-MY3, MOST 105-2628-B-003-002-MY3]; National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU)","This research was financially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities to SHW and supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 105-2628-B-003-001-MY3 and MOST 105-2628-B-003-002-MY3) to PCL.

Our aim was to address regional distribution patterns of AMF communities in such semiarid environments based on spore morphological techniques. We assessed AMF spores at the bottom and top of inselbergs distributed throughout the tropical dry forest in the Northeast region of Brazil. Across 10 replicate inselbergs and the surrounding area, spanning a range of altitude between 140 and 2000 m, we scored the AMF soil diversity and properties in 52 plots. We fitted parsimonious ordination analyses and variance partitioning models to determine the environmental factors which explained the variation in AMF community, based on morphological spore analysis. The diversity of AMF was similar at the bottom and top of inselbergs; however, we detected high variation in abundance and richness across sites. We formulated a parsimonious richness model that used physical soil factors as predictors. The AMF community structure could be best explained through the variables coarse and total sand, iron, organic matter, potassium, silt, and sodium which together accounted for 17.8% of total variance. Several AMF species were indicators of either deficiency or high values of specific soil properties. We demonstrated that habitat isolation of the inselbergs compared with surrounding areas did not trigger differences in AMF communities in semiarid regions of Brazil. At the regional scale, soil predictors across sites drove the distribution of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi.","[Sousa, Natalia M.

The genetic structure of P. tabacina was examined to understand genetic diversity, population structure and patterns of migration. Two nuclear loci, Igs2 and Ypt1, and one mitochondrial locus, cox2, were amplified, cloned and sequenced from fifty-four isolates of P. tabacina from the United States, Central America-Caribbean-Mexico (CCAM), Europe and the Middle East (EULE). Cloned sequences from the three genes showed high genetic variability across all populations. Nucleotide diversity and the population mean mutation parameter per site (Watterson's theta) were higher in EULE and CCAM and lower in U.S. populations. Neutrality tests were significant and the equilibrium model of neutral evolution was rejected, indicating an excess of recent mutations or rare alleles. Hudson's S-nn tests were performed to examine population subdivision and gene flow among populations. An isolation-with-migration analysis (IM) supported the hypothesis of long-distance migration of P. tabacina from the Caribbean region, Florida and Texas into other states in the United States. Within the European populations, the model documented migration from North Central Europe into western Europe and Lebanon, and migration from western Europe into Lebanon. The migration patterns observed support historical observations about the first disease introductions and movement in Europe. The models developed are applicable to other aerial dispersed emerging pathogens and document that high-evolutionary-risk plant pathogens can move over long distances to cause disease due to their large effective population size, population expansion and dispersal.","[Blanco-Meneses, Monica; Ristaino, Jean B.] NC State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Carbone, Ignazio] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Ctr Integrated Fungal Res, Raleigh, NC USA; [Blanco-Meneses, Monica] Univ Costa Rica, CIPROC, Lab Tecn Mol Aplicadas Fitoprotecc, San Jose, Costa Rica","Ristaino, JB (reprint author), NC State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",Jean_Ristaino@ncsu.edu,,,Tobacco Foundation of North Carolina; Tobacco Commission of North Carolina; National Science Foundation (NSF) Genealogy of Life (GoLife) [DEB-1541418],"Tobacco Foundation of North Carolina; Tobacco Commission of North Carolina; National Science Foundation (NSF) Genealogy of Life (GoLife), Grant/Award Number: DEB-1541418",,84,3,3,8,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The R (r) , mean root diameter, and SRL of fine root segments of two C. obtusa stands were determined every three months over two years. We detected significant positive correlations between R (r) and SRL of fine root segments across the stands over two years. The relationship of R (r) with SRL was stronger than that with the mean diameter of fine roots. The slopes and intercepts for the R (r) and SRL relationships did not differ among stands and measurement times. Further, we proposed a simple approach for estimating CO2 flux from fine roots at the stand level based on SRL and confirmed that the ranges of estimated CO2 values were comparable with those of values reported using the conventional approach.

However, their interactions and related mechanisms are still not well elucidated. To elucidate potential traits contributing to invasiveness and whether ongoing increase in CO2 aggravates invasions, noxious invasive Wedelia trilobata and native Wedelia urticifolia and Wedelia chinensis were compared under ambient and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations in terms of growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and physiology. The invader had consistently higher leaf mass fraction (LMF) and specific leaf area than the natives, contributing to a higher leaf area ratio, and therefore to faster growth and invasiveness. The higher LMF of the invader was due to lower root mass fraction and higher fine root percent. On the other hand, the invader allocated a higher fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) to photosynthetic apparatus, which was associated with its higher photosynthetic rate, and resource use efficiency. All these traits collectively contributed to its invasiveness. CO2 enrichment increased growth of all studied species by increasing actual photosynthesis, although it decreased photosynthetic capacities due to decreased leaf and photosynthetic N contents. Responses of the invasive and native plants to elevated CO2 were not significantly different, indicating that the ongoing increase in CO2 may not aggravate biological invasions, inconsistent with the prevailing results in references. Therefore, more comparative studies of related invasive and native plants are needed to elucidate whether CO2 enrichment facilitates invasions.","[He, Liping; Kong, Jijun; Li, Guixiang; Meng, Guangtao] Yunnan Acad Forestry, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ke] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Peoples R China","Chen, K (reprint author), Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Peoples R China.",chenke@swust.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41361076]; Science and Technology Foundation of Sichuan Province, China [2015JY0015]","This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (41361076) and the Science and Technology Foundation of Sichuan Province, China (2015JY0015).

The so-prepared Mn-II-L@PCox and Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox materials have been evaluated as heterogeneous oxidation catalysts in alkenes' epoxidations with H2O2. PC bears more sra carbon atoms than the PC2 which is more graphitized and these structural features are inherited to the corresponding catalysts, that is, Mn""-L@PCox bears more spa carbons than the more graphitized Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox. Both Mn""-L@PCox and Mn""-L@PC2ox were very rapid and the oxidation reactions catalysed by them were accomplished within only 1 h. Both catalysts presented high reactivity and selectivity towards formation of epoxides, however, Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox provided higher TONs values than the Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox. This is attributable to the higher graphitic character of PC(2)ox. Strikingly, the more graphitized Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox is as rapid as the Mn-II-L@PC2, but it lacks in recyclability. These distinct catalytic features of the Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox vs. Mn-II-L@PC(2)ox are discussed in the context of the carbon-supports' characteristics resulting from their manufacturing pyrolytic process. Moreover, we show that pyrolytic char from used rubber fires can be considered a competent catalytic support vs. existing commercial activated carbons.","[Mavrogiorgou, Alexandra; Simaioforidou, Anastasia; Louloudi, Maria] Univ Ioannina, Dept Chem, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece","Louloudi, M (reprint author), Univ Ioannina, Dept Chem, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",amavro@cc.uoi.gr; asimaiof@cc.uoi.gr; mlouloud@uoi.gr,,"Simaioforidou, Anastasia/0000-0003-2438-1744","SYNERGASIA Program [11SYN_5_682]; ROP Macedonia, Thrace; ROP Crete; Aegean Islands, ROP Thessaly, Mainland Greece, Epirus, ROP Attica","This work was supported by the ""SYNERGASIA Program"" [11SYN_5_682] (O.P.

The effects induced by these root exudates on soil mineralogy and the connections between Fe mobilization and mineral weathering processes have not been completely clarified. In a batch experiment, we tested two different kinds of organic compounds commonly exuded by Fe-deficient plants, i.e., three organic acids (citrate, malate, and oxalate) and three flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, and genistein), alone or in combination, for their ability to mobilize Fe from a calcareous soil and modify its mineralogy. The effect of root exudates on soil mineralogy was assessed in vivo by cultivating Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L.) in a RHIZOtest device. Mineralogical analyses were performed by X-ray powder diffraction. The batch experiment showed that citrate and, particularly, rutin (alone or combined with organic acids or genistein) promoted Fe mobilization from the soil. The combinations of rutin and organic acids modified the soil mineralogy by dissolving the amorphous fractions and promoting the formation of illite. These mineralogical alterations were significantly correlated with the amount of Fe mobilized from the soil. The RHIZOtest experiment revealed a drastic dissolution of amorphous components in the rhizosphere soil of Fe-deficient plants, possibly caused by the intense release of phenolics, amino acids, and organic acids, but without any formation of illite. Both batch and RHIZOtest experiments proved that exudates released by cucumber under Fe deficiency concurred to the rapid modification (on a day-scale) of the mineralogy of a calcareous soil.","[Gattullo, Concetta Eliana; Allegretta, Ignazio; Terzano, Roberto] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Pii, Youry; Cesco, Stefano; Mimmo, Tanja] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Medici, Luca] Natl Res Council Italy IMAACNR, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, I-85050 Tito, Italy","Gattullo, CE (reprint author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",concettaeliana.gattullo@uniba.it,"CESCO, Stefano/F-3088-2011","CESCO, Stefano/0000-0001-5191-0520; Terzano, Roberto/0000-0001-6232-6151","MIUR (FIRB-Programma Futuro in Ricerca) (RHIZOCROP) [RBFR127WJ9]; Free University of Bolzano, Italy [TN5056]","This research was supported by grants from the Italian MIUR (FIRB-Programma Futuro in Ricerca) (No. RBFR127WJ9, RHIZOCROP), and the Free University of Bolzano (No. TN5056), Italy.

Coefficients of conservatism (C values) were developed as indicators of a species' sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, and these values are used in Floristic Quality Assessment as a means of assessing natural areas and ecological restoration. However, assigning of these values is subjective and improved quantitative validation of C values is needed. We tested whether there are consistent differences in life histories between species with high and low C values. To do this, we grew 54 species of tallgrass prairie plants in a greenhouse and measured traits that are associated with trade-offs on the fast-slow continuum of life-history strategies. We also grew plants with and without mycorrhizal fungi as a test of these species' reliance on this mutualism. We compared these traits and mycorrhizal responsiveness to C values. We found that six of the nine traits we measured were correlated with C values, and together, traits predicted up to 50 % of the variation in C values. Traits including fast growth rates and greater investment in reproduction were associated with lower C values, and slow growth rates, long-lived leaves and high root: shoot ratios were associated with higher C values. Additionally, plants with high C values and a slow life history were more responsive to mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi. Overall, our results connect C values with life-history trade-offs, indicating that high C value species tend to share a suite of traits associated with a slow life history.","[Bauer, Jonathan T.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Kansas Biol Survey, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Bauer, JT (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jonathantbauer@gmail.com,,,"Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-67011-25166, 2016-67012-24680]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0919434, 1556664]; SERDP [RC-2330]",This project was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant Nos. 2016-67011-25166 (L.K.) and 2016-67012-24680 (J.T.B.) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

FTC frequency, minimum temperature during freezing and pre-existing local adaptations potentially all influence site-specific plant responses to future climatic changes. Within a chamber experiment, frost sensitivity towards recurrent FTCs was determined in 12 Dactylis glomerata populations from various European sampling sites differing in temperature and precipitation. After winter hardening, plants were frozen at -4 and -8 degrees C at frequencies of one, three and seven FTCs within a 1-week treatment phase. The control was kept at 4.5 degrees C. Plant survival, leaf elongation, chlorophyll content and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) decreased with lower minimum temperatures and higher FTC frequencies, while lower freezing temperatures generally proved more influential than increased freezing frequencies. Plant survival rates correlated with the amount of annual precipitation at seed origin, as individuals from comparably drier sites exhibited higher survival rates. This response, however, was limited in its effect to low freezing temperatures (-8 degrees C) and low and medium freezing frequencies (1 and 3 FTCs). In the set of surviving plants, water availability at seed origin best explained the plants' growth responses to FTC treatment. The observed intraspecific variation emphasizes the ecological importance of potential local adaptations within a more variable future winter climate.","[Dietrich, Charlotte C.; Kreyling, Juergen; Malyshev, Andrey V.] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Kreyling, Juergen; Jentsch, Anke] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Disturbance Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Kreyling, Juergen; Malyshev, Andrey V.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Expt Plant Ecol, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Dietrich, CC (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",dietrich.cc@googlemail.com,"Kreyling, Juergen/G-4697-2018","Kreyling, Juergen/0000-0001-8489-7289",ERA-Net BiodivERsA [01LC1201],This work is part of the project SIGNAL which is funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA (http://www.biodiversa.org; funding ID 01LC1201).,,48,0,0,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,FEB,2018,10,1,,,,,,,plx068,10.1093/aobpla/plx068,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FY9ZV,WOS:000427226900007,29308126,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"de Schaetzen, F; van Langevelde, F; WallisDeVries, MF",,,,"de Schaetzen, Frederic; van Langevelde, Frank; WallisDeVries, Michiel F.",,,The influence of wild boar (Sus scrofa) on microhabitat quality for the endangered butterfly Pyrgus malvae in the Netherlands,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Conservation ecology; Ecosystem engineering; Herbivore impact; Heathland; Habitat quality; Butterflies,ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; GRASSLAND; IMPACT; AVAILABILITY; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; INTENSITY,"The decline of open habitats in Europe, such as semi-natural grasslands and heathlands, has caused a general decline in biodiversity, which has been well documented for butterflies.

To date, oviposition site selection of this species has concentrated on calcareous grasslands, whereas we also include heathlands. Overall, larval occupancy was higher in warm, open and sparsely vegetated microhabitats, which supports earlier findings. In heathland, microhabitat occupancy was positively affected by bryophyte and litter cover. In heath-grassland mosaic, microhabitat occupancy was also influenced by bryophyte and litter cover, but in addition low grass cover increased occupancy by favouring host plants. In grassland, only low grass cover and host plant cover determined microhabitat quality. Across all habitats, occupied microhabitats were characterized by lower vegetation as well as higher average daytime temperatures than unoccupied microhabitats. We discovered that wild boar play an important role in reducing grass cover by shallow rooting in grass patches, thereby increasing host plant availability. Hence, wild boar may have an added value in maintaining and restoring P. malvae microhabitats in grassland habitats in addition to grazing by domestic livestock.","[de Schaetzen, Frederic; van Langevelde, Frank] Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [WallisDeVries, Michiel F.] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [WallisDeVries, Michiel F.] De Vlinderstichting Dutch Butterfly Conservat, POB 506, NL-6700 Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Schaetzen, Frederic] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Environm Engn, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","WallisDeVries, MF (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.; WallisDeVries, MF (reprint author), De Vlinderstichting Dutch Butterfly Conservat, POB 506, NL-6700 Wageningen, Netherlands.",michiel.wallisdevries@devlinderstichting.nl,,"Van Langevelde, Frank/0000-0001-8870-0797; WallisDeVries, Michiel/0000-0003-3808-2999",National Park De Hoge Veluwe,We want to thank National Park De Hoge Veluwe for permission to carry out this study and supporting scientific research.,,48,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1366-638X,1572-9753,,J INSECT CONSERV,J.

We performed the first metabolomic investigation into the impact of AMF colonisation by Rhizophagus irregularis on the chemical defences, spanning above- and below-ground tissues, in its host-plant ragwort (Senecio jacobaea). We used a non-targeted metabolomics approach to profile, and where possible identify, compounds induced by AMF colonisation in both roots and shoots. Metabolomics analyses revealed that 33 compounds were significantly increased in the root tissue of AMF colonised plants, including seven blumenols, plant-derived compounds known to be associated with AMF colonisation. One of these was a novel structure conjugated with a malonyl-sugar and uronic acid moiety, hitherto an unreported combination. Such structural modifications of blumenols could be significant for their previously reported functional roles associated with the establishment and maintenance of AM colonisation. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), key anti-herbivore defence compounds in ragwort, dominated the metabolomic profiles of root and shoot extracts. Analyses of the metabolomic profiles revealed an increase in four PAs in roots (but not shoots) of AMF colonised plants, with the potential to protect colonised plants from below-ground organisms.","[Hill, Elizabeth M.; Robinson, Lynne A.; Abdul-Sada, Ali] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; [Robinson, Lynne A.; Vanbergen, Adam J.] CEH, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hodge, Angela; Hartley, Sue E.] Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Hartley, Sue E.] Univ York, York Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Hartley, SE (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.; Hartley, SE (reprint author), Univ York, York Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",sue.hartley@york.ac.uk,"Vanbergen, Adam J./I-6863-2012","Vanbergen, Adam J./0000-0001-8320-5535; Hartley, Sue/0000-0002-5117-687X",University of Sussex; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology [NEC03605],For advice and practical assistance with the metabolomic analysis we would like to thank Dr. Raghad Al-Salhi and Ms. Julia Horwood.

A greenhouse experiment was carried out with trap plants using seeds of six species of Mimosa and soils from three different locations in central Brazil: Posse, Brasilia and Cavalcante. Plant dry biomass and number of nodules were measured after four months. Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from nodules and their molecular identification was performed. Three housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, recA and gyrB) plus the nodC and nifH symbiotic genes were used to determine the identity of the symbionts and to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the isolated nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Rhizobia from the Betaproteobacterial genus Paraburkholderia (former Burkholderia) and the Alphaproteobacterial genus Rhizobium were isolated from different species of Mimosa. As in previous studies, the phylogenies of their symbiosis-essential genes, nodC and nifH, were broadly congruent with their core housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, recA and gyrB), which suggests limited or no horizontal gene transfer. Edaphic factors such as pH and fertility influenced the occurrence of these unrelated rhizobial types in the nodules on these Mimosa spp. Mimosa species have the ability to associate with different types of rhizobia (alpha- and beta-proteobacteria), suggesting low specificity between host and bacterium in experimental conditions. Soil factors such as pH, nitrogen and fertility seem to favour the predominance of certain types of rhizobia, thus influencing the establishment of symbiotic relationships.","[de Castro Pires, Raquel] Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, Inst Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ Darcy Ribeiro, BR-70910970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [dos Reis Junior, Fabio Bueno] Embrapa Cerrados, Cx Postal 08223, BR-73310970 Planaltina, DF, Brazil; [Zilli, Jerri Edson; Fischer, Doreen; Hofmann, Andreas] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23891000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [James, Euan Kevin] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Simon, Marcelo Fragomeni] Embrapa Recursos Genet & Biotecnol, Cx Postal 02372, BR-70770917 Brasilia, DF, Brazil","dos Reis, FB (reprint author), Embrapa Cerrados, Cx Postal 08223, BR-73310970 Planaltina, DF, Brazil.; Simon, MF (reprint author), Embrapa Recursos Genet & Biotecnol, Cx Postal 02372, BR-70770917 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",raquel.castropires@gmail.com; fabio.reis@embrapa.br; jerri.zilli@embrapa.br; doreen.fischer@outlook.com; hofmann_andreas@outlook.de; EuanKevin.James@hutton.ac.uk; marcelo.simon@embrapa.br,"Fischer, Doreen/H-8980-2013; Simon, Marcelo F./AAA-7161-2019; James, Euan/K-1135-2012","Simon, Marcelo F./0000-0002-5732-1716; James, Euan/0000-0001-7969-6570",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPES/CNPq Ciencia sem Fronteiras program; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Embrapa [02.13.08.001.00.00]; INCT - Plant-Growth Promoting Microorganisms for Agricultural Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility [CNPq 465133/2014-4],"We thank managers and authorities for permission to collect in areas under their care, and Aecio Amaral, Alessandra Fidelis, Lucas Rolim, Clodoaldo Alves de Souza, for field and laboratory assistance.

Macroscopic models are usually used to predict root water uptake at the field scale. However, they miss proper representation of stress processes at the plant scale. A fully mechanistic three-dimensional model was used to investigate the effect of root length density (RLD), transpiration rate and dynamics, potential leaching fraction (LF), and irrigation frequency and salinity on osmotic stress and gradients developed between the soil-root interface and the bulk soil. For the same LF and salinity level of the irrigation water, osmotic stress was larger at lower RLDs and higher transpiration rates. Roots were also more stressed when a sinusoidal transpiration boundary condition was considered. The variability of macroscopic parameters calculated for the simulated data show that macroscopic functions need to take into account RLD and transpiration rate to adequately predict osmotic stress. Finally, small salt concentration gradients were observed in this single-root study where root density was assumed constant with depth. However, future work requires checking salt concentration gradients at the scale of a whole plant, where this assumption does not apply.","[Jorda, Helena; Vanderborght, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fac Biosci Engn, Leuven, Belgium; [Perelman, Adi; Lazarovitch, Naftali] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, French Associates Inst Agr & Biotechnol Drylands, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Vanderborght, Jan] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci, Agrosphere Inst, IBG 3, Julich, Germany","Jorda, H (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fac Biosci Engn, Leuven, Belgium.",helena.jordaguerra@kuleuven.be,"Lazarovitch, Naftali/F-4627-2010","Vanderborght, Jan/0000-0001-7381-3211",IWT-VlaanderenInstitute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) [IWT 141353]; German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and DevelopmentGerman-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [I-1231-204.12/2014],"This work has been funded by IWT-Vlaanderen (Project IWT 141353).

To elucidate the root-system characteristics of P. tomentosa adapting to seasonal fluctuation in the groundwater table, coarse-root architecture and fine-root morphology were investigated in a P. tomentosa plantation under groundwater table fluctuation with an average annual amplitude of 363 cm. Three stands of different ages and planting densities were selected for root sampling, comprising 34 structural roots for assessment of root architecture, ten stumps for measurement of rooting depth and spread distance, and 2106 soil blocks (to 150 cm depth) for analysis of fine-root distribution. The average rooting depth of these stands was 200 cm (maximum root depth 270 cm), indicating that P. tomentosa can be phreatophytic. In 4- and 7-year-old stands, the average lateral root spread distances were 437 and 535 cm, respectively. About 23% of the root area density was distributed in the top-most 20 cm soil, which might help P. tomentosa to intercept rainwater efficiently and absorb shallow soil water resources when the uptake function of deep roots was inhibited by flooding. Some horizontal, inclined, and vertical structural roots were capable of exploring both deep and shallow soil layers. In conclusion, a deep root system, wide-spreading and dense lateral roots in shallow soil layers, and development of some structural roots exploring both deep and shallow soil resources may be the three coordinate rooting adaption strategies that permit P. tomentosa to thrive in sites subject to large fluctuation in the groundwater table.","[Di, Nan; Liu, Yang; Xie, Yuqi; Jia, Liming; Xi, Benye] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Jia, LM (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",jlm@bjfu.edu.cn,,"xi, benye/0000-0003-4730-6384","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600403]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400532, 31670625]; Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAD09B02]","This study was jointly funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0600403), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400532, 31670625), and the Key Technologies R&D Program of China (2015BAD09B02).

Two-phase experiments, i.e., conditioning and feedback, represent a common methodology to study PSF. The duration of the conditioning phase varies among studies and the PSF observed is often explained by its biotic component. Little is known about the temporal variation of PSF and its abiotic component. As early life stages are crucial for plant establishment, we grew Rorippa austriaca in soil conditioned over 2, 4, 6 or 8 weeks by a conspecific or a co-occurring species, Agrostis capillaris. For each conditioning duration, we analysed the soil chemical properties and the direction and intensity of intra- or inter-specific feedbacks. With increasing duration, the negative intra- and inter-specific feedbacks became stronger and weaker, respectively. The inter-specific feedback was more negative than the intra-specific feedback at 2 weeks and this reversed thereafter. The Mg content decreased with conditioning duration whatever the conditioning species was. With increasing duration, conditioning by R. austriaca strongly decreased pH, while A. capillaris did not affect pH. The K and P contents were not affected by the conditioning duration and were higher in R. austriaca soil than in A. capillaris soil. Our results suggest that not only conditioning species but also duration of conditioning phase may affect the magnitude of PSF. The changes in soil chemical properties linked to the conditioning species or the conditioning phase duration may drive the feedbacks by affecting plant growth directly or via the interacting microbial communities.","[Lepinay, Clementine; Dostalek, Tomas; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Vondrakova, Zuzana; Dostalek, Tomas; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic","Lepinay, C (reprint author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",clementine.lepinay@gmail.com,"Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Dostalek, Tomas/A-1260-2011","Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Dostalek, Tomas/0000-0002-3681-5223; Lepinay, Clementine/0000-0003-1330-1550","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR 16-09659S]; RVO [67985939]; Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MSMT)Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic","The study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project GACR 16-09659S).

Because shared mycorrhizal fungi mediate plant community interactions, host preference has implications for plant succession and competition. We studied the EMF of oaks (Quercus spp.) and pines (Pinus spp.) in a forest in northern Florida, USA, focusing on symbionts shared with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.). Longleaf pine is an important species in the southeastern USA, both for timber plantations and for restoring savanna and woodland habitat. However, we found no research on the composition of naturally occurring EMF on longleaf pine roots. A lower proportion of EMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found colonizing both oaks and pines than expected, providing evidence of host preference within the community. Although most EMF were detected only on either oaks or pines, the OTUs found on both tended to be frequently occurring and abundant. Cenococcum OTUs were found to be significantly associated with oaks, an unexpected finding as this genus is widespread, with a broad host range. These results suggest that host preference of EMF may structure EMF communities and therefore influence ecosystem effects of mycorrhizal networks.","[Rasmussen, Ann L.; Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Busby, Ryan R.] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Champaign, IL 61826 USA; [Rasmussen, Ann L.] Oregon State Univ, Southern Oregon Res & Extens Ctr, Central Point, OR 97502 USA","Rasmussen, AL (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.; Rasmussen, AL (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Southern Oregon Res & Extens Ctr, Central Point, OR 97502 USA.",ann.rasmussen@oregonstate.edu,"Rasmussen, Ann/W-3195-2019","Rasmussen, Ann/0000-0002-4721-938X",USDA National Needs FellowshipUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); US ArmyUnited States Department of Defense; University of Mississippi Graduate Student Research Program; Sigma Xi Grants-in-Aid of Research Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119865]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Fellowship [2011-38420-30988],"Ashley Parker, Adam Trautwig, and Dick Gebhart assisted in sampling.

Prior to these findings, little attention was paid to developing planting plans that included plant species with specific functional traits, such as specific root length (SRL), percent fine roots (PFR), and relative growth rate (RGR); rather, biofilter planting plans often suggest planting a relatively large number of plant species with the expectation that some species will not survive due to competition and environmental factors. As these unsuited species are lost, species diversity might be expected to be lower in older biofilters. However, it is unknown whether biodiversity or functional diversity (i.e., the diversity of functional traits) actually decreases as biofilters age. To investigate this question, we surveyed plant communities in 32 biofilters along a chron-sequence in Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. From these data, we calculated biodiversity and functional diversity indices from trait (i.e., SRL, PFR, and RGR) data available in the literature for dominant plant species. We found that, although plant species diversity is lower in older biofilters, functional diversity is unaffected by age. These trends suggest biofilter plant communities maintain functional diversity despite losing biodiversity over time. A better understanding of how plant functional traits relate to ecosystem functions would let us design biofilters with better performance and value.","[Winfrey, Brandon K.; Ambrose, Richard F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Box 951772,Rm 46-078 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hatt, Belinda E.] Jacobs Engn Grp Inc, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hatt, Belinda E.] Monash Univ, Monash Water Liveabil, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ambrose, Richard F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Hatt, Belinda E.] Jacobs, 11-452 Flinders St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Winfrey, BK (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Box 951772,Rm 46-078 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",winfrey@gmail.com; belinda.hatt@jacobs.com; rambrose@ucla.edu,"Winfrey, Brandon/D-7487-2018","Winfrey, Brandon/0000-0001-6663-6405",U.S. National Science Foundation Partnerships in International Research and Education [OISE-1243543],"This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation Partnerships in International Research and Education grant OISE-1243543 to the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

In this study, clone pairs (endophyte-infected, endophyte-free) of two tall fescue genotypes received factorial combinations of increased temperature (+3 degrees C) and precipitation (+30% long-term annual mean) for 2 yr. We measured root arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization, and soil AMF extraradical hyphae (ERH) length. We hypothesized that genetically distinct grass-E. coenophiala associations would differentially affect belowground fungi, and that these relationships would be climate-sensitive. Tall fescue genotype, endophyte presence, and climate treatment interactions affected AMF arbuscules, vesicles, and ERH. DSE decreased with E. coenophiala presence but increased with warming. Genetically distinct tall fescue-E. coenophiala associations may have divergent long-term impacts on other host-symbiont interactions, potentially impacting ecosystem function and response to climate change.

While recent studies have investigated the relationship between plant genotype and the composition of soil microbial communities, the effect of genotype-by-environment interactions on the plant microbiome remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of tree genetics (G), nitrogen (N) form and genotype-by-environment interaction (G x N) on the composition of the root microbiome. Rhizosphere communities (bacteria and fungi) and root-associated fungi (including ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic guilds) were characterised in two genotypes of Pinus radiata with contrasting physiological responses to exogenous organic or inorganic N supply. Genotype-specific responses to N form influenced the composition of the root microbiome. Specifically, (1) diversity and composition of rhizosphere bacterial and root-associated fungal communities differed between genotypes that had distinct responses to N form, (2) shifts in the relative abundance of individual taxa were driven by the main effects of N form or host genotype and (3) the root microbiome of the P. radiata genotype with the most divergent growth responses to organic and inorganic N was most sensitive to differences in N form. Our results show that intraspecific variation in tree response to N form has significant consequences for the root microbiome of P. radiata, demonstrating the importance of genotype-by-environment interactions in shaping host-associated communities.","[Gallart, Marta; Adair, Karen L.; Love, Jonathan; Turnbull, Matthew H.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Meason, Dean F.] Scion, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Clinton, Peter W.; Xue, Jianming] Scion, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Adair, Karen L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Love, Jonathan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden","Gallart, M (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Christchurch, New Zealand.",marta.gallart.diumenge@gmail.com,"Meason, Dean/E-7865-2019","Meason, Dean/0000-0002-7592-0827; Gallart, Marta/0000-0001-5096-6354","Growing Confidence in Forestry's Future programme - New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [C04X1306]; Growing Confidence in Forestry's Future programme - Forest Growers Levy Trust; New Zealand Forest Research Institute (SCION); University of Canterbury","This research was supported by the Growing Confidence in Forestry's Future programme, which is jointly funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (contract No C04X1306) and the Forest Growers Levy Trust.

The south slope of a given mountain could significantly differ from north slope in environment. Thus, N cycling should also be different between the two slopes. Since leaf delta N-15, soil delta N-15 and Delta delta N-15(leaf-soil) (Delta delta N-15(leaf-soil) D leaf delta N-15 soil delta N-15) could reflect the N cycling characteristics, we put forward a hypothesis that leaf delta N-15, soil delta N-15 and Delta delta N-15(leaf-soil) should differ between the two slopes. However, such a comparative study between two slopes has never been conducted. In addition, environmental effects on leaf and soil delta N-15 derived from studies at global scale were often found to be different from those on a regional scale. This led to our argument that environmental effects on leaf and soil delta N-15 could depend on local environment. To confirm our hypothesis and argument, we measured leaf and soil delta N-15 on the south and north slopes of Tian Shan. Remarkable environmental differences between the two slopes provided an ideal opportunity for our test. The study showed that leaf delta N-15, soil delta N-15 and delta N-15(leaf-soil) on the south slope were greater than those on the north slope, although the difference in soil delta N-15 was not significant. The result confirmed our hypothesis and suggested that the south slope has higher soil N transformation rates and soil N availability than the north slope. In addition, in this study it was observed that the significant influential factors of leaf delta N-15 were temperature, precipitation, leaf N, leaf C = N, soil moisture and silt = clay ratio on the north slope, whereas on the south slope only leaf C = N was related to leaf delta N-15. The significant influential factors of soil delta N-15 were temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and silt = clay ratio on the north slope, whereas on the south slope, mean annual precipitation and soil moisture exerted significant effects. Precipitation exerted contrary effects on soil delta N-15 between the two slopes. Thus, this study supported our argument that the relationships between leaf and soil delta N-15 and environmental factors are localized.","[Chen, Chongjuan; Jia, Yufu; Chen, Yuzhen; Wang, Guoan] China Agr Univ, Beijing Key Lab Farmland Soil Pollut Prevent Cont, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Mehmood, Imran] China Agr Univ, Dept Plant Nutr, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Plant Soil Interact,MOE, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yunting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China","Wang, GA (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Beijing Key Lab Farmland Soil Pollut Prevent Cont, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",gawang@cau.edu.cn,"Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012; Chen, Chongjuan/AAC-7534-2019","Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X; Chen, Chongjuan/0000-0002-0914-9798",Chinese National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954202]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41272193],"This research was supported by the Chinese National Basic Research Program (no. 2014CB954202) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41272193).

Nevertheless, little is known about organic matter (OM) dynamics in these soils, though OM is crucial for soil fertility and represents an important carbon sink. We aimed at investigating OM dynamics along a salinity and sodicity gradient in the soils of the southwestern Siberian Kulunda steppe (Kastanozem, non-sodic Solonchak, Sodic Solonchak) by assessing the organic carbon (OC) stocks, the quantity and quality of particulate and mineral-associated OM in terms of non-cellulosic neutral sugar contents and carbon isotopes (delta C-13, C-14 activity), and the microbial community composition based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns. Aboveground biomass was measured as a proxy for plant growth and soil OC inputs. Our hypotheses were that (i) soil OC stocks decrease along the salinity gradient, (ii) the proportion and stability of particulate OM is larger in salt-affected Solonchaks compared to non-salt-affected Kastanozems, (iii) sodicity reduces the proportion and stability of mineral-associated OM, and (iv) the fungi : bacteria ratio is negatively correlated with salinity. Against our first hypothesis, OC stocks increased along the salinity gradient with the most pronounced differences between topsoils. In contrast to our second hypothesis, the proportion of particulate OM was unaffected by salinity, thereby accounting for only < 10% in all three soil types, while mineral-associated OM contributed > 90 %. Isotopic data (delta C-13, C-14 activity) and neutral sugars in the OM fractions indicated a comparable degree of OM transformation along the salinity gradient and that particulate OM was not more persistent under saline conditions. Our third hypothesis was also rejected, as Sodic Solonchaks contained more than twice as much mineral-bound OC than the Kastanozems, which we ascribe to the flocculation of OM and mineral components under higher ionic strength conditions. Contrary to the fourth hypothesis, the fungi : bacteria ratio in the topsoils remained fairly constant along the salinity gradient. A possible explanation for why our hypotheses were not affirmed is that soil moisture covaried with salinity along the transect, i.e., the Solonchaks were generally wetter than the Kastanozems. This might cause comparable water stress conditions for plants and microorganisms, either due to a low osmotic or a low matric potential and resulting in (i) similar plant growth and hence soil OC inputs along the transect, (ii) a comparable persistence of particulate OM, and (iii) unaffected fungi : bacteria ratios. We conclude that salt-affected soils contribute significantly to the OC storage in the semiarid soils of the Kulunda steppe, while most of the OC is associated with minerals and is therefore effectively sequestered in the long term.","[Bischoff, Norbert; Shibistova, Olga; Herdtle, Daniel; Gerhard, Lukas; Fritzsche, Franziska; Guggenberger, Georg] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Soil Sci, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Mikutta, Robert] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Von Seckendorff Pl 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Shibistova, Olga] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, VN Sukachev Inst Forest, Akademgorodok 50, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia; [Dohrmann, Reiner] Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, Stilleweg 2, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Puzanov, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Water & Environm Problems, Molodezhnaya St 1, Barnaul 656038, Russia; [Silanteva, Marina; Grebennikova, Anna] Altai State Univ, Fac Biol, Prospekt Lenina 61a, Barnaul 656049, Russia","Bischoff, N (reprint author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Soil Sci, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany.",bischoff@ifbk.uni-hannover.de,"Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013","Guggenberger, Georg/0000-0002-6962-8264; Dohrmann, Reiner/0000-0002-5416-9798","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LL0905]; Russian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Russian Federation [14.B25.31.0031]","This study was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany) in the framework of the Kulunda project (01LL0905).

The growth of the fischerella was limited by the streptomycete culture to a greater degree than by the fungus. In ground biofilms formed on the basis of cyanobacteria Fis. muscicola, the phytopathogenic fungus F. avenaceum, in the saprotrophic phase of development, is able to unite into single structured complexes with other participants in the multi-species consortium of microorganisms, including their antagonists. Aggregation of cells in biofilms is associated not only with the isolation of polysaccharide mucus cyanobacteria, but also with the creation of a net-thread structure of growth due to threads of cyanobacteria and mycelium of heterotrophic partners, the total length of which can reach values exceeding 400 m/cm(2). The development of such biofilms on the soil surface significantly increases its ability to retain moisture and prevent erosion. The two-component association of cyanobacteria and streptomycete can be considered as promising for biocontrol of fusarium infection. At the same time, under specific conditions of the rhizosphere, the nature of the interaction of the cultures of microorganisms under investigation may differ from that described for sterile soil lacking root exudates. Nevertheless, in experiments with the inoculation of Triticum aestivum L. seeds, it has been established that the two-component association of Fischerella muscicola + Streptomyces wedmorensis in perspective can be used as a biological agent to limit the development of fusarium infection in the higher plant rhizosphere.","[Domracheva, L., I; Tovstik, E., V; Skugoreva, S.

Fungal and bacterial endophytes are primarily acquired via contagious spread from the surrounding environment. The soil is an important reservoir for both fungal and bacterial endophytes; we term this a soil microbial bank and suggest that it functions similarly to a soil seed bank. Because most (similar to 75%) studies have found a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial diversity, we predict that as plant diversity increases so will endophyte taxonomic and functional diversity. Once inside plant host tissues, endophytes can act as mutualists and increase plant performance directly by producing plant hormones, or indirectly by decreasing fungal or insect damage by up to 80%. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that there are costs associated with hosting ""beneficial"" endophytes for tropical trees. This is important because it challenges more traditional dichotomies (e.g., beneficial or deleterious) about endophytes and suggests that there are highly complex and context-dependent trade-offs and costs involved in plant-endophyte interactions. Though they comprise a cryptic component of tropical forests, plant-microbe interactions may typically regulate tree diversity, composition, and forest function at neighborhood and even regional scales. For example, pathogens may maintain tree diversity by reducing the fitness of common species in areas where plant host density is high or where hosts are close to reproductive conspecific adults. Moreover, plant-endophyte interactions, whether pathogenic or mutualistic, may comprise an entirely novel dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species. Overall, tree endophytes in tropical forests are complex, yet critical drivers of forest dynamics and function.","[Griffin, Eric A.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Carson, Walter P.] Univ Pittsburgh, 212A Clapp Hall,4249 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Griffin, EA (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, 647 Contees Wharf Rd, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",Griffine@si.edu,,,,,,338,1,1,3,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0924-5480,1875-1334,978-3-319-89833-9; 978-3-319-89832-2,FOR SCI,,,2018,86,,,,,,63,103,,10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9_4,10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9,,41,Plant Sciences; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Forestry,BM1FW,WOS:000459755500005,,,,,10/31/19S,"Singh, PC; Srivastava, S; Shukla, D; Bist, V; Tripathi, P; Anand, V; Arkvanshi, SK; Kaur, J; Srivastava, S",,"Prasad, R",,"Singh, Poonam C.; Srivastava, Sonal; Shukla, Deepali; Bist, Vidisha; Tripathi, Pratibha; Anand, Vandana; Arkvanshi, Salil Kumar; Kaur, Jasvinder; Srivastava, Suchi",,,Mycoremediation Mechanisms for Heavy Metal Resistance/Tolerance in Plants,"MYCOREMEDIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, VOL 2",Fungal Biology-US,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; ARSENIC SPECIATION; PHANEROCHAETE-CHRYSOSPORIUM; TRICHODERMA-HARZIANUM; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; METALLOTHIONEIN GENE; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; CONTAMINATED SOIL,,"[Singh, Poonam C.; Srivastava, Sonal; Shukla, Deepali; Bist, Vidisha; Tripathi, Pratibha; Anand, Vandana; Arkvanshi, Salil Kumar; Kaur, Jasvinder; Srivastava, Suchi] CSIR Natl Bot Res Inst, Div Plant Microbe Interact, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India","Srivastava, S (reprint author), CSIR Natl Bot Res Inst, Div Plant Microbe Interact, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",s.srivastava@nbri.res.in,,,,,,211,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7777,,978-3-319-77386-5; 978-3-319-77385-8,FUNG BIOL-US,,,2018,,,,,,,351,381,,10.1007/978-3-319-77386-5_14,10.1007/978-3-319-77386-5,,31,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Environmental; Mycology",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering; Mycology,BM1AX,WOS:000459445700016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lorenc, F; Peskova, V; Modlinger, R; Mrnka, L; Tomaskova, I; Senfeld, P; Turcani, M",,,,"Lorenc, Frantisek; Peskova, Vitezslava; Modlinger, Roman; Mrnka, Libor; Tomaskova, Ivana; Senfeld, Petr; Turcani, Marek",,,Fine roots of Picea abies compensate for drought stress in the rainfall reduction experiment,DENDROBIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; community; ectomycorrhiza; Norway spruce; WinRhizo,ECTOMYCORRHIZAL COMMUNITY; FOREST; RESPONSES; GROWTH; SOIL; DIVERSITY; SEEDLINGS; STANDS; L.; ACCUMULATION,"This study evaluates the influence of repeated artificial drought stress on the fine root characteristics - including ectomycorrhizae - of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst]. The experimental site consisted of two plots in a mature spruce monoculture stand. The water regime at parts of both plots was regulated by shelters and an isolation trench during vegetation season (spring to autumn) since 2010. Root samples were collected during autumn in 2010, 2012, and 2013. Root analyses revealed the effect of drought stress on mycorrhizal root tips changed over time. While a density of active mycorrhizae was about 34% lower in drought-stressed areas compared to nonstressed (control) areas in 2010, it increased by 15% in 2012 and by 22% in 2013 over both plots. We observed the less pronounced effect of drought on a proportion of active mycorrhizae, but it generally followed the pattern of active mycorrhizae density. The density of nonactive mycorrhizae was not influenced by drought but significantly fluctuated during the course of the experiment. Other root characteristics such as the dry mass of fine roots (< 1 mm), the specific length of fine roots (< 1 mm) and the composition of the ectomycorrhizal community (primarily dominated by Amphinema byssoides, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tylopilus felleus, and Cenococcum geophillun) were also not significantly influenced by drought. Our results indicate the ability of Norway spruce fine roots to compensate for repeated drought stress of the intermediate intensity.","[Lorenc, Frantisek; Peskova, Vitezslava; Modlinger, Roman; Tomaskova, Ivana; Senfeld, Petr; Turcani, Marek] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Lorenc, Frantisek] Forestry & Game Management Res Inst, Strnady 136, Jiloviste Strnady 25202, Czech Republic; [Mrnka, Libor] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic","Lorenc, F (reprint author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.; Lorenc, F (reprint author), Forestry & Game Management Res Inst, Strnady 136, Jiloviste Strnady 25202, Czech Republic.",lorenc@vulhm.cz,,,"National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (NAZV) [QH 81136]; Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [GA FLD CZU 20134335, GA FLD CZU 20134339, GA FLD CZU A19/14, GA FLD CZU B10/17]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [6779/2017-MZE-14151]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Operational Programme Research, Development and Education (OP VVV) of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic - project EX-TEMIT-K [CZ.02.1.01./0.0/0.0/15_003/0000433]; Operational Programme Research, Development and Education (OP RDE) - project ""EVA4.0"" [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803]","This research was carried out under a grant from the National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (NAZV) - project QH 81136.

Currently, the best alternative option to manage solid waste is by using landfilling method because it has low costing advantages. The disadvantage of landfill method, it might cause a pollution by producing leachate that will give an effect to the ground and surface water resources. This study focuses on analysing the leachate composition at Simpang Renggam Landfill(SRL) site for seven parameters such as COD, BOD, SS, turbidity, pH, BOD5/COD, and ammonia (NH3-N). All the data obtained were compared with previous researcher and Malaysia Environmental Quality Act 1974. From the result, SRL site was categorized as partially stabilized leachate with the parameter of BOD5/COD > 0.1. The SRL site is recommended to use a physical-chemical method for a better treatment because the leachate composition is classified as old leachate and aerated lagoon method are not satisfied to be used in treating the aging leachate at SRL site.","[Zailani, L.

Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, total PLFA, and PLFA contents of bacterial, fungal, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were significantly lower in PYI than PYII or PYIII, and there were significant differences in the monounsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio among the tested forests. Principal component analysis indicated that the soil microbial community structure of the tested forests differed significantly. The changes in soil microbial biomass and community composition were positively correlated with soil water content, pH, organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus. Season did not significantly affect the soil microbial community structure, but significantly affected soil microbial biomass, SOM, and TN, which were higher in the dry season than in the wet season.","[Yu, Sufang; She, Guanghui] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Sufang; Ye, Shaoming; Zhou, Xiaoguo; Yao, Xianyu; Li, Yuanfa] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Ye, Shaoming; Zhou, Xiaoguo; Li, Yuanfa] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Li, YF (reprint author), Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",xianggelilalyf@sina.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31460196]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province [2016GXNSFBA380233]; Department of Forestry of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31460196];Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province [2016GXNSFBA380233];Department of Forestry of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [2016-2019];,,65,1,1,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1054-9811,1540-756X,,J SUSTAIN FOREST,J.

ES are grouped according to four ecosystemic functions: regulation, provisioning, habitat and cultural. Our study aimed at identifying ES provided by beaches and coastal dunes in the Baja California Peninsula. ES were identified in a literature search in the international and local scientific bibliography databases. We used key words like: ES in Baja California, ES in beaches and ES in coastal dunes. We analyzed 350 selected papers. Explicit and implicit mentions to ES or to their elements were extracted from the reviewed documents; the assigned value represents the degree of importance of each ES: 0 (unimportant), 1 (low importance), 2 (medium importance) and 3 (high importance). The ES cultural function was the best documented, being mentioned in 40 publications. The habitat function was the most reported for the Pacific Ocean coast mainly refuge for flora and fauna. The functions of regulation of air quality and climate are equally analyzed in ten publications. The ES of erosion regulation, pollination, and water flow are only documented in the Gulf of California coastline. We concluded it is highly relevant to know the ES provided by beaches and coastal dunes in order to design and implement adequate management practices that conserve the ecosystem in order for it to continue providing ES to humans.","[Rodriguez-Revelo, Natalia; Espejel, Ileana] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Carretera Tijuana Ensenada,Km103, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Arredondo Garcia, Concepcion] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Carretera Tijuana Ensenada,Km103, Ensenada 22860, BC, Mexico; [Ojeda-Revah, Lina] El Colegio Frontera Norte, AC Dept Estudios Urbanos & Medio Ambiente, Km 18-5 Carretera Escen Tijuana Ensenada, Ensenada 22560, Baja California, Mexico; [Sanchez Vazquez, Maria Alejandra] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias Adm & Sociales, Blvd Zertuche & Blvd Lagos S-N, Ensenada 22890, Baja California, Mexico","Espejel, I (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Carretera Tijuana Ensenada,Km103, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico.",ileana.espejel@uabc.edu.mx,,,,,,179,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2211-0577,2211-0585,978-3-319-58304-4; 978-3-319-58303-7,COAST RES LIBR,,,2018,24,,,,,,75,100,,10.1007/978-3-319-58304-4_5,10.1007/978-3-319-58304-4,,26,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,BL2HK,WOS:000448964600007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cig, A; Durak, ED; Isler, S",,,,"Cig, A.; Durak, Demirer E.; Isler, S.",,,"IN VITRO SYMBIOTIC GERMINATION POTENTIALS OF SOME ANACAMPTIS, DACTYLORHIZA, ORCHIS AND OPHRYS TERRESTRIAL ORCHID SPECIES",APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,fungal isolates; in vitro; mycorrhiza effect; symbiotic germination; terrestrial orchid,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SEED-GERMINATION; SPECIFICITY,"Germination and propagation of terrestrial orchids is highly challenging due to their small size seeds and absence of endosperms. Some orchid species are extremely dependent on fungi for germination of their seeds. Although germination occurs symbiotically between the seed and the fungus, it is not coincidental that fungus species are specific to orchid species. Aim of this study is to show the impact of the fungi, isolated from the tubers of ten naturally grown species of orchids, collected from mountainous area of Van province, Turkey, on in vitro symbiotic germination of the seeds. The collected orchids species were Dactylorhiza romana (Seb.) Soo subsp. georgica (Klinge) Soo ex Renz & Taub., Orchis pinetorum Boissier & Kotschy, Orchis spitzelii Saut. ex W.D.J.

In the study from orchid tubers, Rhizoctonia sp., Aspergillus sp., Alternaria sp., Penicillium sp., Trichoderma sp. and Fusarium sp. fungi species are isolated. Firstly, orchid seeds and fungal isolates placed in oat culture medium were transferred to Van Waes & Debergh culture medium in subculture. The highest germination rates obtained in the seeds are 71.19% in Dactylorhiza romana subsp. georgica species with Rhizoctonia sp.; 78.26% in Orchis pinetorum species with Penicillium sp.; 27.77% in Orchis spitzelii species with Fusarium sp.; 83.07% in Orchis coriophora species with Rhizoctonia sp.; 75.00% in Orchis collina species with Fusarium sp.; 38.88% in Orchis anatolica species with Alternaria sp.; 73.91% in Orchis simia species with Fusarium sp.; 91.60% in Ophrys straussii species with Fusarium sp.; 93.75% in Dactylorhiza umbrosa species with Fusarium sp. and 56.00% in Anacamptis pyramidalis species with Rhizoctonia sp.

In this study, soil samples from both N fertilization and control plots were collected at two depths in a Larix gmelinii plantation to determine if N addition elicits consistent responses in microbial respiration in bulk and rhizosphere soil, and to determine the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil organic carbon decomposition. Soil bulk and rhizosphere microbial respiration were determined using the NaOH solution absorption method. Soil microbial biomass was determined by a modified CHCL3 fumigation-extraction method. The greatest soil bulk and rhizosphere microbial respiration occurred in July. Soil rhizosphere microbial respiration was higher than bulk respiration at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm. The biggest reductions in soil microbial respiration induced by fertilization were 15.0% (bulk) and 19.6% (rhizosphere) at 0-10 cm in July, and 6.4% (bulk) and 7.9% (rhizosphere) at 10-20 cm in September. Fertilization did not influence the rhizosphere priming effect except for at 10-20 cm in May. Structural equation modeling revealed that soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) contributed directly to soil microbial respiration. Moreover, soil total N and organic carbon content were associated with soil microbial respiration through MBC and MBN. These results suggest that N fertilization suppresses soil organic carbon decomposition by decreasing soil microbial biomass, while C input induced by root exudates determined the rhizosphere priming effect, not soil microbes in the rhizosphere.","[Jia, S.

After four months, EE-GRSP-treated seedlings exhibited significantly higher plant growth (plant height, leaf number and fresh weight) and root growth-related parameters (lateral root numbers and root morphology) than non-EE-GRSP-treated seedlings under both WW and DS conditions. Exogenous EE-GRSP generally significantly increased leaf water potential, net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration, while dramatically decreased leaf temperature, regardless of soil water status. The seedlings treated with exogenous EE-GRSP observed significantly higher activities of leaf Fe-SOD and root Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Fe-SOD than untreated control under DS. Leaf abscisic acid, indole-acetic acid and methyl jasmonate concentrations were significantly higher in EE-GRSP-treated seedlings than untreated control under DS.

Inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi can improve their survival. Plant growth is partly dependent on the strain used, but little attention has been paid to the selection of mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this study was to determine whether the growth of Casuarina equisetifolia L. (Johnson) is affected by two different mycorrhizal inocula generated using fungal spores retrieved from an Australian site (allochthonous soil) and a Senegalese site (native soil) under C. equisetifolia trees. Comparative experiments were conducted with plants in a Senegalese soil, previously sterilized or not, and grown in a greenhouse. At harvest, parameters related to plant growth and mycorrhization were evaluated and soil bacterial communities were compared. Tree growth was significantly influenced by both types of inoculants. In unsterilized soil, plants inoculated with the native inoculant were taller than plants inoculated with the allochthonous inoculant and control plants. The frequency of mycorrhization with both inoculants was higher in unsterilized soil. The strongest effects of the mycorhizosphere on the soil microbiome were obtained with the allochthonous inoculum, and analysis of the taxonomic composition revealed mycorrhizal communities specific to each inoculum. These results suggest that the development of C. equisetifolia and its root bacterial community are dependent on the composition of the mycorrhizal inoculum. The functional consequences of this rhizosphere effect in terms of soil fertility should be further studied to better guide reforestation operations.","[Diagne, Nathalie] Senegalese Inst Agr Res CNRA ISRA, Natl Ctr Agron Res, BP 53, Bambey, Senegal; [Diagne, Nathalie; Svistoonoff, Sergio; Ouattara, Christine; Diouf, Diegane; Kane, Aboubacry; Ndiaye, Cheikh] Res Ctr Bel Air, Joint Int Lab Adaptat Plants & Associated Microor, Dakar, Senegal; [Baudoin, Ezekiel; Svistoonoff, Sergio; Duponnois, Robin] French Natl Res Inst Sustainable Dev, Trop & Mediterranean Symbioses Lab LSTM, IRD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Ouattara, Christine; Diouf, Diegane; Kane, Aboubacry; Noba, Kandioura] Cheikh Anta Diop Univ UCAD, Dept Plant Biol, Dakar, Senegal; [Bogusz, Didier; Franche, Claudine] French Natl Res Inst Sustainable Dev, IRD, UMR, F-34394 Montpellier 5, France","Diagne, N (reprint author), Senegalese Inst Agr Res CNRA ISRA, Natl Ctr Agron Res, BP 53, Bambey, Senegal.",nathaliediagne@gmail.com,,,Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); le Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche du Senegal,This work was supported in part by the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD) through a PhD grant and le Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche du Senegal through a national PhD grant for Nathalie DIAGNE.,,52,1,1,5,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,1532-4990,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the biomass amounts of common R. ponticum populations and how that biomass differs according to certain vegetation and habitat characteristics. Data were obtained from 36 plot areas in the Black Sea region of Turkey: 18 from Giresun and 18 from Bartin. The data were afterwards grouped in terms of altitude, dominant exposure and vegetation height factors, to reveal the change of R. ponticum biomass accordingly. The data obtained showed significant variation; therefore, mass values are expressed as mean values. The potential relationship between the afore- mentioned factors and the amounts of biomass was examined by using the analysis of variance. Results showed that the highest biomass amount occurs at 0- 500 m in altitude, with a mean biomass of 40,035 kg ha(-1). Regarding dominant exposure and biomass amounts, the mean biomass of the R. ponticum population was found to be 38,185.6 kg ha(-1) in sunny exposure and 35,185 kg ha(-1) in shady exposure. Regarding vegetation height and biomass amounts, 38,820.7 kg ha(-1) was the highest biomass when the vegetation height was 2- 2.5 m. Overall however, the analysis of variance for exposure, altitude and mean height of vegetation revealed no significant differences among the groups. It can be concluded that using average values to estimate biomass storage capacities of R. ponticum populations is the most reasonable way to proceed at this time.","[Durkaya, Birsen; Durkaya, Ali; Kaptan, Sinan] Bartin Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Forest Engn, TR-74100 Agdaci Country, Bartin, Turkey; [Onal, Gokhan] Gen Directorate Forestry, Ankara, Turkey","Durkaya, A (reprint author), Bartin Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Forest Engn, TR-74100 Agdaci Country, Bartin, Turkey.",adurkaya@bartin.edu.tr,"Kaptan, Sinan/O-8436-2019","Kaptan, Sinan/0000-0001-6059-5163",University of Bartin [BAP-2012-1-39],"We would like to thank the University of Bartin for their support with this study, under research project number BAP-2012-1-39.",,34,0,0,0,3,"UNIV AUSTRAL CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS FORESTALES",VALDIVIA,"CASILLA 567, VALDIVIA, 00000, CHILE",0717-9200,,,BOSQUE,Bosque,,2018,39,1,,,,,95,106,,10.4067/S0717-92002018000100009,,,12,Ecology; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GC5HB,WOS:000429816700009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Liu, M; Zhou, F; Pan, XY; Zhang, ZJ; Traw, MB; Li, B",,,,"Liu, Mu; Zhou, Fang; Pan, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Zhijie; Traw, Milton B.; Li, Bo",,,"Specificity of herbivore-induced responses in an invasive species, Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed)",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,biotic stimuli; coevolution; diet breath; plant invasion; plant-herbivore interactions,MILKWEED ASCLEPIAS-SYRIACA; LINDERA-BENZOIN LAURACEAE; PLANT DEFENSE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SPECIALIST HERBIVORES; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; SECONDARY COMPOUNDS; INDUCED RESISTANCE; NATURAL ENEMIES; TOLERANCE,"Herbivory-induced responses in plants can both negatively affect subsequently colonizing herbivores and mitigate the effect of herbivory on the host. However, it is still less known whether plants exhibit specific responses to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits and how specificity to specialists and generalists differs between invasive and native plant populations. We exposed an invasive plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides, to Agasicles hygrophila (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae; specialist), Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae; generalist), manual clipping, or application of exogenous jasmonic acid and examined both the specificity of elicitation in traits of fitness (e.g., aboveground biomass), morphology (e.g., root:shoot ratio), and chemistry (e.g., C/N ratio and lignin), and specificity of effect on the subsequent performance of A.hygrophila and S.litura. Then, we assessed variation of the specificity between invasive and native populations (USA and Argentina, respectively). The results showed S.litura induced higher branching intensity and specific leaf area but lower C/N ratio than A.hygrophila, whereas A.hygrophila induced higher trichome density than S.litura. The negative effect of induction on subsequent larval growth was greater for S.litura than for A.hygrophila. Invasive populations had a weaker response to S.litura than to A.hygrophila in triterpenoid saponins and C/N ratio, while native populations responded similarly to these two herbivores. The specific effect on the two herbivores feeding on induced plants did not vary between invasive and native populations. Overall, we demonstrate specificity of elicitation to specialist and generalist herbivores in non-secondary metabolite traits, and that the generalist is more susceptible to induction than the specialist. Furthermore, chemical responses specific to specialist and generalist herbivores only exist in the invasive populations, consistent with an evolutionary change in specificity in the invasive populations.","[Liu, Mu; Zhou, Fang; Pan, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Zhijie; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Traw, Milton B.] Berea Coll, Dept Biol, Berea, KY USA","Pan, XY (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",xypan@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666; Traw, Milton/0000-0002-3148-2108","National Key Research and Development program of China [2016YFC1200600]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31070369, 31300467]","National Key Research and Development program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC1200600; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31070369 and 31300467",,55,4,4,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Although large herbivores play a key part in shaping subarctic plant communities, their impact on mycorrhizal dynamics is largely unknown. We measured extramatrical mycelial (EMM) biomass during one growing season in 16-year-old herbivore exclosures and unenclosed control plots (ambient), at three mountain birch forests and two shrub heath sites, in the Scandes forest-tundra ecotone. We also used high-throughput amplicon sequencing for taxonomic identification to investigate differences in fungal species composition. At the birch forest sites, EMM biomass was significantly higher in exclosures (1.36 +/- 0.43g C/m(2)) than in ambient conditions (0.66 +/- 0.17g C/m(2)) and was positively influenced by soil thawing degree-days. At the shrub heath sites, there was no significant effect on EMM biomass (exclosures: 0.72 +/- 0.09g C/m(2); ambient plots: 1.43 +/- 0.94). However, EMM biomass was negatively related to Betula nana abundance, which was greater in exclosures, suggesting that grazing affected EMM biomass positively. We found no significant treatment effects on fungal diversity but the most abundant ectomycorrhizal lineage/cortinarius, showed a near-significant positive effect of herbivore exclusion (p=.08), indicating that herbivory also affects fungal community composition. These results suggest that herbivory can influence fungal biomass in highly context-dependent ways in subarctic ecosystems. Considering the importance of root-associated fungi for ecosystem carbon balance, these findings could have far-reaching implications.","[Vowles, Tage; Bjork, Robert G.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Vowles, Tage] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lindwall, Frida] Univ Copenhagen, Terr Ecol, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lindwall, Frida] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ekblad, Alf] Orebro Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Orebro, Sweden; [Bahram, Mohammad; Furneaux, Brendan R.; Ryberg, Martin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Organismal Biol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bahram, Mohammad] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Bjork, Robert G.] Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Gothenburg, Sweden","Bjork, RG (reprint author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",robert.bjork@gu.se,"Bjork, Robert G./I-9772-2019","Bjork, Robert G./0000-0001-7346-666X; lindstein, frida/0000-0002-3981-5966","Eesti Teadusfondi [PUT1317]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas [214-2010-1411]","Eesti Teadusfondi, Grant/Award Number: PUT1317; The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, Grant/Award Number: 214-2010-1411",,78,3,3,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Slower organic matter decomposition and greater soil carbon accumulation could contribute to this increase in carbon sequestration. We investigated the effects of chronic simulated nitrogen deposition on leaf litter and fine root decomposition at four sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated northern hardwood forests. At these sites, we previously observed that nitrogen additions increased soil organic carbon and altered litter chemistry. We conducted a 3-year decomposition study with litter bags. Litter production of leaves and fine roots were combined with decomposition dynamics to estimate how fine roots and leaf litter contribute to soil organic carbon. We found that nitrogen additions marginally stimulated early-stage decomposition of leaf litter, an effect associated with previously documented changes in litter chemistry. In contrast, nitrogen additions inhibited the later stages of fine root decomposition, which is consistent with observed decreases in lignin-degrading enzyme activities with nitrogen additions at these sites. At the ecosystem scale, slower fine root decomposition led to additional root mass retention (g m(-2)), and this greater retention of root residues was estimated to explain 5-51% of previously documented carbon accumulation in the surface soil due to nitrogen additions. Our results demonstrated that simulated nitrogen deposition created contrasting effects on the decomposition of leaf litter and fine roots. Although previous nitrogen deposition studies have focused on leaf litter, this work suggests that slower fine root decomposition is a major driver of soil organic carbon accumulation under elevated nitrogen deposition.","[Xia, Mengxue; Talhelm, Alan F.; Pregitzer, Kurt S.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Talhelm, Alan F.] US FDA, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Oak Ridge Inst Sci & Educ, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Pregitzer, KS (reprint author), Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",kpregitzer@uidaho.edu,"Talhelm, Alan F/F-9365-2013; Talhelm, Alan/K-6631-2018","Talhelm, Alan/0000-0002-5542-8237","National Science Foundation's LTREB program; Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis Project [1004624]","This research has been supported by National Science Foundation's LTREB program, the Department of Energy, and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis Project 1004624.

In addition, responses of plant roots to climate change have mostly been studied in single-factor experiments. In a Danish heathland ecosystem, we investigated both individual and combined effects of elevated CO2, warming and drought on fine root length, net production and standing biomass by the use of minirhizotrons, ingrowth cores and soil coring. Warming increased the net root production from ingrowth cores, but decreased fine root number and length in minirhizotrons, whereas there were no significant main effects of drought. Across all treatments and soil depths, CO2 stimulated both the total fine root length (+44%) and the number of roots observed (+39%), with highest relative increase in root length in the deeper soil layers. Our results suggest that under future climate, plants may allocate considerable resources into roots compared to aboveground biomass. Increased carbon (C) allocation to roots may have a great impact on the overall ecosystem C balance and must be considered in modelling of future ecosystem responses to climate change. To provide models with necessary validation data, more studies are needed to investigate if higher C allocation to roots will lead to long-term C storage in more recalcitrant soil C pools or if this potential increase in soil carbon storage may be offset by increased priming activity and turnover rates for soil organic matter.","[Arndal, M.

Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aqua culture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78 +/- 3.87 Mg OC ha(-1) and 12.67 +/- 0.14 Mg OC ha(-1), respectively. The value was 87.59 +/- 1.08 Mg OC ha(-1) for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6.94 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1), which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the below ground carbon stocks.

We hypothesized that warming and altered precipitation would affect the growth, death, and biomass of fine roots by changing soil temperature and soil water availability. Mean annual FRP and total root biomass were significantly altered by only precipitation manipulation: they were 29.3% (during the two-year period) and 69.0% (after the entire two years) higher, respectively, in PD plots than in PC plots, respectively. In contrast, only warming had a significant effect on mean annual FRM, being 13.2% lower in TW plots than TC plots during the two-year period. Meanwhile, fine root biomass was affected negatively and simultaneously by both soil temperature and soil moisture. It seemed that fine root dynamics have changed so that they maintain their systems in response to the altered soil temperature and moisture. The current study adds significant knowledge for understanding the fine root dynamics of P. densiflora seedlings under altered temperature and precipitation regimes.","[Han, Seung Hyun; Kim, Seongjun; Li, Guanlin; Chang, Hanna; Yun, Soon Jin; An, Jiae; Son, Yowhan] Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea","Son, Y (reprint author), Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",aryian@naver.com; dao1129@hanmail.net; guanlin.li1207@gmail.com; wkdgkssk59@naver.com; lucksal7@naver.com; monpti1012@gmail.com; yson@korea.ac.kr,,"Kim, Seongjun/0000-0003-1938-4406; Han, Seung Hyun/0000-0002-8180-2915",National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013R1A1A2012242]; Korea Forest Service [2017058A00-1719-AB01],This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2013R1A1A2012242) and Korea Forest Service (2017058A00-1719-AB01).,,46,3,4,3,13,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2018,9,1,,,,,,,14,10.3390/f9010014,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,FU8PD,WOS:000424115000014,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Abalos, D; van Groenigen, JW; De Deyn, GB",,,,"Abalos, Diego; van Groenigen, Jan Willem; De Deyn, Gerlinde B.",,,What plant functional traits can reduce nitrous oxide emissions from intensively managed grasslands?,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,functional traits; grassland; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; plant traits; plant-microbe interactions,N2O EMISSIONS; ROOT TRAITS; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; SOIL MICROBES; NEW-ZEALAND; ECOSYSTEM; DIVERSITY; WORLDWIDE; CYCLE; LEAF,"Plant species exert a dominant control over the nitrogen (N) cycle of natural and managed grasslands. Although in intensively managed systems that receive large external N inputs the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is a crucial component of this cycle, a mechanistic relationship between plant species and N2O emissions has not yet been established. Here we use a plant functional trait approach to study the relation between plant species strategies and N2O emissions from soils. Compared to species with conservative strategies, species with acquisitive strategies have higher N uptake when there is ample N in the soil, but also trigger N mineralization when soil N is limiting. Therefore, we hypothesized that (1) compared to conservative species, species with acquisitive traits reduce N2O emissions after a high N addition; and (2) species with conservative traits have lower N2O emissions than acquisitive plants if there is no high N addition. This was tested in a greenhouse experiment using monocultures of six grass species with differing above-and below-ground traits, growing across a gradient of soil N availability. We found that acquisitive species reduced N2O emissions at all levels of N availability, produced higher biomass and showed larger N uptake. As such, acquisitive species had 87% lower N2O emissions per unit of N uptake than conservative species (p<.05). Structural equation modelling revealed that specific leaf area and root length density were key traits regulating the effects of plants on N2O emission and biomass productivity. These results provide the first framework to understand the mechanisms through which plants modulate N2O emissions, pointing the way to develop productive grasslands that contribute optimally to climate change mitigation.","[Abalos, Diego; van Groenigen, Jan Willem; De Deyn, Gerlinde B.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands","Abalos, D (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands.",diego.abalosrodriguez@wur.nl,"Van Groenigen, Jan Willem/H-3037-2012; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009","Van Groenigen, Jan Willem/0000-0001-9637-0601; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; Abalos, Diego/0000-0002-4189-5563",Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship under Horizon 2020 [656632]; NWO-ALW VIDI [864.11.003],"Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship under Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 656632; NWO-ALW VIDI, Grant/Award Number: 864.11.003",,68,8,8,16,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, this has so far not been explicitly tested. To address the effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis on plants' realized niches, we addressed how mycorrhizal status (i.e. the frequency of occurrence of mycorrhizal symbiosis), flexibility (i.e. the ability to grow both with and without mycorrhizal symbiosis) and type of a plant species affect the realized niche optima, widths and volumes. For this, we used co-occurrence data from the flora of the Netherlands along soil fertility, moisture, pH, salinity, light and temperature gradients. Phylogenetic dependency of the species was taken into account using phylogenetic generalized least squares models. We show that facultatively and flexibly mycorrhizal plants have the widest niches compared to non-mycorrhizal and obligately mycorrhizal, and inflexible plants respectively. Among obligate plant symbionts, ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal plants exhibited the widest niches compared to plants with other mycorrhizal types. Also, plants with different mycorrhizal statuses and types differed in their realized niche optima. Synthesis. Our results indicate that mycorrhizal symbiosis mediates plant niche differentiation and expansion, facilitating the understanding of current distribution patterns of plant species, as well as predicting shifts in plant distribution and dominance due to environmental changes.","[Gerz, Maret; Bueno, C.

For example, if species have different root distributions, a mixture of plant species may be able to use the available resources more completely than the individual species in a monoculture. However, there is little experimental evidence for differentiation in vertical root distributions among species and its contribution to biodiversity effects. We determined species-specific root standing biomass over depth using molecular techniques (real-time qPCR) in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (one to eight plant species mixtures), in 2years. Species-specific root biomass data were used to disentangle the effects of positive interactions between species (complementarity effects) and effects due to dominance of productive species (selection effects) on root biomass in mixtures. In a next step, these biodiversity effects were linked to the diversity of rooting depths and the averaged rooting depth of the community. Root biomass increased with species richness. This was mainly due to positive interactions (the complementarity effect), which increased with species richness below-ground. In contrast, the selection effect decreased with species richness. Although there was considerable variation in vertical root distribution between species in monocultures, the diversity of rooting strategies did not explain the complementarity effect. Rather, the abundance of deep-rooting species in mixtures (i.e. high community-weighted mean) was significantly related to the complementarity effect. Comparing the predicted root distribution (based on monocultures) to the actual distribution in mixtures, we found that mixtures rooted deeper than expected, but this did not better explain the complementarity effect.Synthesis. This study demonstrates that vertical root distributions of species provide only subtle evidence for resource partitioning. We found no evidence that functional diversity in vertical rooting patterns was important for the complementarity effect, in contrast to our expectation that the enhancement of productivity was due to resource partitioning. Alternatively, we found significant but weak relationships between the complementarity effect and deep-rooting communities, based on the community-weighted mean root distribution. This suggests that factors other than below-ground resource partitioning alone may drive the biodiversity-productivity relationship.","[Oram, Natalie J.; van der Paauw, Jan Willem; van Ruijven, Jasper; Mommer, Liesje] Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ravenek, Janneke M.; de Kroon, Hans; Smit-Tiekstra, Annemiek] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Expt Plant Ecol, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Barry, Kathryn E.; Weigelt, Alexandra; Chen, Hongmei] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Gockele, Annette; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol Geobot, Freiburg, Germany","Mommer, L (reprint author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",liesje.mommer@wur.nl,"de Kroon, Hans/B-3359-2009; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008","de Kroon, Hans/0000-0001-6151-3561; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Oram, Natalie Justine/0000-0002-3529-5166; Chen, Hongmei/0000-0001-8472-6113",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk OnderzoekNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.14.006]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG FOR 1451],"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: 864.14.006; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: DFG FOR 1451",,69,5,5,6,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

As environmental assessment and monitoring programmes may require biodiversity information at multiple levels, we pay particular attention to the DNA metabarcoding method and discuss a number of bioinformatic tools and considerations for producing DNA-based indicators using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), taxa at a variety of ranks and community composition. By developing the capacity to harness the advantages provided by the newest technologies, investigators can scale up by increasing the number of samples and replicates processed, the frequency of sampling over time and space, and even the depth of sampling such as by sequencing more reads per sample or more markers per sample. The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact. As genomic approaches are continually evolving, we provide this guide to methods used in biodiversity genomics.","[Porter, Teresita M.; Hajibabaei, Mehrdad] Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Biodivers Inst Ontario, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Porter, Teresita M.; Hajibabaei, Mehrdad] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Porter, Teresita M.] Nat Resources Canada, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada","Hajibabaei, M (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada.; Hajibabaei, M (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Guelph, ON, Canada.",mhajibab@uoguelph.ca,"Porter, Teresita/H-4072-2011","Porter, Teresita/0000-0002-0227-6874",,,,205,33,34,16,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

In this study, controlled reciprocal crossings and seed germination experiments were combined with genetic and morphometric analyses to test the hypothesis that previously described differences in mycorrhizal communities between forest and dune ecotypes of Epipactis helleborine were sufficiently strong to create complete reproductive isolation between the two ecotypes. Molecular analyses using 770 SNP markers showed that the two ecotypes were genetically distinct and that populations of the dune ecotype were genetically impoverished compared to populations of the forest ecotype. Morphologically, the two ecotypes were also significantly different, with plants of the dune ecotype generally being smaller than plants of the forest ecotype. The results further showed that immigrant seeds had a significantly lower probability of protocorm formation than native seeds, indicating strong immigrant inviability. Although both ecotypes were able to cross easily and to produce a large number of viable seeds, hybrid seeds showed significantly lower protocorm formation than pure seeds, further contributing to reproductive isolation. Overall, these results indicate that interfertile populations of a widespread orchid adapting to contrasting environments diverge as a consequence of concurrent selection acting against immigrants and hybrids and suggest that mycorrhizal fungi can play a role in the early stages of plant speciation.","[Jacquemyn, Hans; De Kort, Hanne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, BE-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [De Kort, Hanne] CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, Moulis, France; [Vanden Broeck, An; Brys, Rein] Res Inst Forest & Nat, Geraardsbergen, Belgium","Jacquemyn, H (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, BE-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",hans.jacquemyn@bio.kuleuven.be,"Broeck, An Vanden/N-9555-2019; Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Broeck, An Vanden/A-5734-2008","Broeck, An Vanden/0000-0001-8773-7280; Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Broeck, An Vanden/0000-0001-8773-7280; , Rein/0000-0002-0688-3268","Onderzoeksraad, KU LeuvenKU Leuven","Funding was provide by Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven.",,61,6,6,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2018,127,1,,,,,73,84,,10.1111/oik.04329,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR5JF,WOS:000419102100008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Arterburn, JR; Twidwell, D; Schacht, WH; Wonkka, CL; Wedin, DA",,,,"Arterburn, Jack R.; Twidwell, Dirac; Schacht, Walter H.; Wonkka, Carissa L.; Wedin, David A.",,,Resilience of Sandhills Grassland to Wildfire During Drought,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,drought; LANDFIRE; resilience; state-and-transition model; sandy soil ecosystem; USDA Ecological Site Description Database; wildfire,HOLOCENE DUNE ACTIVITY; NEBRASKA SAND HILLS; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; GREAT-PLAINS; FIRE; PRAIRIE; VEGETATION; MANAGEMENT; RANGELAND; PATTERNS,"In the Nebraska Sandhills, one of the largest contiguous grassland ecoregions remaining in North America, sandy textured soils are stabilized by fine root biomass from predominantly warm-season grasses. Concerns over destabilization have led to management that aims to avoid an undesirable state change toward mobile sand dunes. In 2012, the Sandhills experienced extreme drought conditions that coincided with the worst wildfire year on state record. According to state-and-transition models and ecosystem managers, the combination of wildfire and drought conditions should cause a state transition due to a lack of recovery of grassland vegetation and a loss of sand dune stability. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a time-since-fire study to track biomass recovery of Sandhills grassland vegetation following a wildfire on The Nature Conservancy's Niobrara Valley Preserve in burned and unburned areas. Two yr following the wildfire, aboveground herbaceous biomass in burned areas had recovered to levels that did not differ from unburned areas, maintaining the stability of the sand dunes. This provides evidence that counters current land management frameworks that portray Sandhills grassland as highly vulnerable to destabilization when wildfires occur during severe drought conditions.

AMF communities have the potential to affect plant community structure and vice versa. We examined AMF sporulation in a 4.5-ha reconstructed prairie in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin. In fall 2003, the site was planted with varied numbers and combinations of native prairie species from four functional guilds: C-3 grasses/sedges, C-4 grasses, legume, and nonleguminous forbs. We hypothesized that more diverse plant seeding mixtures would promote AMF diversity. To examine the interaction between plant and fungal communities, plots were divided and subplots treated with the fungicide chlorothalonil to suppress AMF, enriched with ammonium nitrate fertilizer, treated with both fungicide and nitrogen, or remained untreated (control). Soil samples were collected during the summers of 2004, 2006, and 2007 from each subplot. Spores of AMF were extracted, identified to species, and enumerated. Initial plant seeding diversity did not significantly influence spore abundance, fungal diversity, plant productivity, or plant richness 4 years after establishment. Fungal species richness was positively, but weakly, correlated with plant productivity (r(2) = 0.11) and plant richness (r(2) = 0.09). Fungal community composition changed significantly over time; nitrogen addition, fungicide application, and site characteristics also shaped community composition. After 4 years of treatment, nitrogen and fungicide reduced AMF richness, changed sporulation patterns among AMF taxa, and reduced diversity and productivity in plant communities. Divergence in AMF community is being mirrored by changes in the plant community independent of initial seeding treatments, though causation could not be determined.","[Henning, Jeremiah A.; Bentivenga, Stephen P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Freund, Deborah] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Eau Claire, WI 54702 USA; [Weiher, Evan; Lee, Tali D.; Stefanski, Artur] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Henning, Jeremiah A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Bentivenga, SP (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",bentiven@uwosh.edu,"Henning, Jeremiah/Y-7466-2018","Henning, Jeremiah/0000-0002-2214-4895",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0415479]; U.W.

However, the response of soil microbial community and their interactions with ecosystem processes remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the response of soil total microbial biomass and community composition to experimental rainfall reductions and the implications for soil carbon dynamics. The results showed that rainfall reductions significantly decreased soil total microbial biomass and bacterial abundance, but no significant effects on fungal abundance were observed. While, within bacterial and fungal groups, rainfall reductions only significantly influenced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, but did not affect Gram-positive bacteria (GP), Gram-negative bacteria (GN), Actinomycetes, Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and other sequenced bacterial phyla. These contrasting responses suggested that rainfall reductions had major effects on total microbial biomass but minor effects on community compositions. Further analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of total microbial biomass responses were mainly explained by the size of rainfall reductions rather than the duration. Particularly, higher decreases in total microbial biomass were observed in sites where more rainfall was excluded. Reductions in total microbial biomass were larger in forests with higher aridity index (AI) than in grass/shrublands with lower AI, and stronger reductions in microbial biomass were observed at higher mean annual precipitation (MAP)/sites with higher AI. Moreover, both soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil respiration (SR) significantly declined under reduced rainfall experiments arid had positive relationships with changes in total microbial biomass, especially in humid lands (AI >= 0.65). The microbial responses to aridity levels indicated that soil carbon in humid lands may be highly susceptible to future drought scenarios. This meta-analysis highlighted the importance of considering the size of rainfall reductions and aridity levels when modeling and projecting soil carbon dynamics.","[Ren, Chengjie; Zhong, Zekun; Han, Xinhui; Yang, Gaihe; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ren, Chengjie; Zhong, Zekun; Han, Xinhui; Yang, Gaihe; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ji] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Key Lab Space Biosci & Biotechnol, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xingjie; Doughty, Russell] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhao, Fazhu] Northwest Univ Xian, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Han, XH; Yang, GH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",hanxinhui@nwsuaf.edu.cn; ygh@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018; Doughty, Russell/M-2499-2018","Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312; Doughty, Russell/0000-0001-5191-2155",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41301601]; State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on Loess Plateau [A314021402-1709],"The authors especially thank Shuyue Fu (Northwest A & F University, China) and Chang Gyo Jung (Northern Arizona University, USA) for their help and this work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41301601), and the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on Loess Plateau (No. A314021402-1709).",,49,17,20,29,193,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Robust quantitative approaches for 2D assays, which use 4-methylubelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP), are needed to advance a mechanistic understanding of enzyme behaviour and distribution in soils. We present improvements to the method for phosphatase zymography in rhizobox studies, involving (1) a systematic evaluation of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) based calibration functions in relation to image exposure time and (2) the development of advanced image analysis tools for lateral and longitudinal distributions of phosphatase activity along barley roots (Hordeum vulgare L., cv Optic). Exposure time (<1-32 s) affected the slope and intercept of 4-MU calibration equations by 4.4- and 5.8-fold, respectively. In lateral root profiles, a linear relationship was found between phosphatase activity and root hair length at 0 cm (7 nKat mm(-2)), 0.2 cm (48 nKat mm(-2)), and 2 cm (234 nKat mm(-2)) distance from the root tips (r = 0.9795, p < 0.0001); an algorithm designed to optimise estimates of phosphatase activity longitudinally confirmed this relationship (r = 0.9462, p < 0.0001). To improve the precision and accuracy of fluorescence-based soil zymography, careful control of calibration and imaging conditions and further development of advanced image analysis techniques are recommended.

We hypothesized that earthworms, plants and the associated AMF exhibit different preferences for different forms of inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-), which could regulate the effect of earthworms and AMF interaction on plant N acquisition. We outlined three independent but complementary experiments to test this hypothesis in the context of exotic earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus. The earthworm is dominating the plantation forests in subtropical and tropical regions of China, which have their understory dominated by the fern Dicranopteris dichotoma. By employing an excised root N-15 incubation experiment and a field in situ 15N experiment, we found that the fern prefers to use NH4+ rather than NO3-. Then we did a 2 x 2 factorial microcosm experiment using AMF (Rhizophagus intraradices) and earthworms (P. corethrunis). The exotic earthworm increased soil NH4+ concentration but did not affect soil NO3- concentration, while the AMF decreased soil NH4+ concentration but had no effect on soil NO3- concentration. The increase in soil NH4+ induced by the earthworms was efficiently utilized by the AMF, and significantly increased the total N uptake by the fern. In contrast, the AMF alone increased the N concentration of leaves and coarse roots, but not the total plant N uptake, primarily due to the lower levels of available NH4+ compared with the earthworm treatments. The uninoculated fern did not benefit from the earthworm-induced increase in soil NH4+, suggesting that the root of the fern cannot access the 'NH4+ hotspots' created by the earthworms. Our work suggests that successful cooperation of earthworms and AMF on plant N uptake depends on the correct match in N-form.","[He, Xinxing; Wang, Xiaoli] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Xinxing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shao, Yuanhu; Shi, Leilei; Zhang, Weixin; Fu, Shenglei] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Schimel, Joshua P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Liu, Shengjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Gunina, Anna] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Chen, Weili; Yao, Qing] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Engn Res Ctr Litchi, Coll Hort, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Microbial Signals & Dis Co, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianxiong] Guangdong Acad Sci, Guangdong Entomol Inst, 105 Xingang West Rd, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zou, Xiaoming] Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Trop Ecosyst Studies, San Juan, PR 00931 USA; [Chen, Yuanqi] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Hunan Prov Key Lab Coal Resources Clean Utilizat, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China","Zhang, WX; Fu, SL (reprint author), Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",weixinzhang@139.com; sfu@scbg.ac.cn,"YAO, Qing/B-3206-2009; Zhang, Weixin/D-3540-2017","YAO, Qing/0000-0003-3449-6166; Zhang, Weixin/0000-0001-9656-9522; Schimel, Joshua/0000-0002-1022-6623; Zou, Xiaoming/0000-0001-9023-3067","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570516, 41171219, 41501268]; NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund [U1131001]; CAS/SAFEAChinese Academy of Sciences","We thank Yanju Zhang, Jinghua Huang, Jianbo Cao, Lingfeng He, Tao Liu, Feng Li, Qingqiu Zhou, Yanni Qu and Shiqin Yu for the help in experiment sampling and Dr. Xi'an Cai for technical support.

Total litter input increased during vegetation succession (759, 1089 and 1284 g m(-2) year(-1) in RF-5, RF-15 and NF respectively), whereas the contribution of soft litter decreased sharply. Decomposition over 450 days indicated significant seasonal (P < 0.001) patterns in mass loss of litter components, with greater rates during the wet period. Soil CO2 efflux was strongly seasonal. C stock loss followed patterns similar to those of mass loss, whereas N increased initially, followed by its gradual release. Rainfall explained 74-90% of the variability in mass loss rates. Concentrations of cellulose and N were significantly positively correlated with mass loss at an early stage of decomposition (r = 0.54-0.65, P < 0.05), whereas lignin : N and C: N ratios were negatively correlated with mass loss at later stages. Regenerating forests adapted ecosystem-level strategies that induced early leaf fall to reduce soil water loss, increase organic matter return to the soil and conserve N through immobilisation during the process of decomposition to speed up vegetation succession in the regenerating forest.","[Lalnunzira, C.; Tripathi, S.

Therefore, this experiment was conducted to select the most effective type A and type B strains for specific Rj-gene harboring soybean varieties and to test the symbiotic effectiveness of selected strains on different Rj-gene harboring soybean varieties. Screening experiments using the specific soybean varieties were done with a completely randomized design and three replications in this study. Evaluation of the effective Myanmar Bradyrhizobium strains for plant growth, nodulation and N-2 fixation were studied in pot experiments using sterilized vermiculite in the Phytotron (controlled-environmental condition). Then, a pot experiment was conducted using Futsukaichi soil in the screen house (natural environmental condition). The N-2 fixation ability of soybean was evaluated by acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and the relative ureide index method. In the first screening experiment, type A and type B strains with higher nitrogen fixation and proper nodulation on their respective soybean cultivars were selected for the next screening. In the second screening, Bradyrhizobium elkanii AHY3-1 (type A), Bradyrhizobium japonicum SAY3-7 (type A), B. elkanii BLY3-8 (type B) and B. japonicum SAY3-10 (type B) isolates, which showed higher nitrogen fixation and nodulation in Yezin-3 (Rj(4)) and Yezin-6 (non-Rj), were selected for the next experiment. In the third screening experiment, SAY3-7 and BLY3-8, which had higher nitrogen fixing potential and proper nodulation, were selected as effective isolates. These two isolates were compatible with non-Rj and Rj(4) soybean varieties for nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Based on the results of the screening experiment, these two strains were tested for their symbiotic efficacy in Futsukaichi soil. This study shows that inoculation treatment of SAY3-7 and BLY3-8 significantly increased plant growth, nodulation, and N-2 fixation at the V6, R3.5 and R8 stages in Yezin-3 (Rj(4)) and/or Yezin-6 (non-Rj), and the seed yield at R8 stage, in Yezin-3 (Rj(4)) and Yezin-6 (non-Rj) soybean varieties compared with the control treatment. It can be concluded that SAY3-7 and BLY3-8 are suitable for inoculant production because of their higher nitrogen fixation ability, proper nodulation and better productivity of Myanmar soybean cultivars.","[Htwe, Aung Zaw] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Lab Plant Nutr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yamakawa, Takeo] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Div Mol Biosci,Lab Plant Nutr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan","Htwe, AZ (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Lab Plant Nutr,Higashi ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",aungzawhtwe333@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [130287]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [130287].",,41,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Currently, the mechanism that regulates adventitious root (AR) development in woody plants is poorly understood. This work demonstrates that Populus tomentosa WUSCHEL-related homeobox 5a (PtoWOX5a) transcription factor is involved in AR development in poplar. PtoWOX5a was specifically expressed in the AR tip and lateral root tip during AR and lateral root regeneration from the stem segment. Phenotypic complementation experiments indicated that the PtoWOX5a can functionally complement AtWOX5 in quiescent center ( QC) cells. Overexpression of PtoWOX5a introduces significant developmental phenotypes in roots and leaves, such as increased AR number, decreased AR length, swollen AR tip and lateral root tip, and decreased leaf number and area. The conserved mechanism of D-type cyclins (CYCD) repression mediated by WOX5 was confirmed in poplar. The co-expression network of PtWOX5a was constructed, which provided clues to reveal the molecular mechanism of PtoWOX5a in AR development in poplar. Taken together, our results suggest that the PtoWOX5a is involved in AR development though cooperating with a series of functional genes.","[Li, Jianbo; Zhang, Jin; Jia, Huixia; Sun, Pei; Hu, Jianjun; Wang, Lijuan; Lu, Mengzhu] Chinese Acad Forestry, State Key Lab Tree Genet & Breeding, Key Lab Tree Breeding & Cultivat, State Forestry Adm,Res Inst Forestry, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianbo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Forestry North China, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bobin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Haixia Inst Sci & Technol, Basic Forestry & Prote Ctr, Fuzhou 350000, Fujian, Peoples R China","Wang, LJ; Lu, MZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, State Key Lab Tree Genet & Breeding, Key Lab Tree Breeding & Cultivat, State Forestry Adm,Res Inst Forestry, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",wlj307@caf.ac.cn; lumz@caf.ac.cn,"Zhang, Jin/J-9618-2019","Zhang, Jin/0000-0002-8397-5078","Fundamental Research Funds of Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2014ZX001-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270699]; Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao Young Scholars [31,428,002]","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds of Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAFYBB2014ZX001-1), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31270699) and the Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao Young Scholars (No. 31,428,002).",,82,4,5,4,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2018,38,1,,,,,139,153,,10.1093/treephys/tpx118,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,FT0TA,WOS:000422839600012,29036435,,,,10/31/19J,"Oh, S; Hammes, F; Liu, WT",,,,"Oh, Seungdae; Hammes, Frederik; Liu, Wen-Tso",,,Metagenomic characterization of biofilter microbial communities in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant,WATER RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biofiltration; Drinking water treatment; Microbial community; Metagenomics,ASSESSING BIOLOGICAL STABILITY; SINGLE-CELL; GENOME SIZE; DEGRADATION; EVOLUTION; RHIZOBIA,"Microorganisms inhabiting filtration media of a drinking water treatment plant can be beneficial, because they metabolize biodegradable organic matter from source waters and those formed during disinfection processes, leading to the production of biologically stable drinking water. However, which microbial consortia colonize filters and what metabolic capacity they possess remain to be investigated. To gain insights into these issues, we performed metagenome sequencing and analysis of microbial communities in three different filters of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Filter communities were sampled from a rapid sand filter (RSF), granular activated carbon filter (GAC), and slow sand filter (SSF), and from the Schmutzdecke (SCM, a biologically active scum layer accumulated on top of SSF), respectively. Analysis of community phylogenetic structure revealed that the filter bacterial communities significantly differed from those in the source water and final effluent communities, respectively. Network analysis identified a filter-specific colonization pattern of bacterial groups. Bradyrhizobiaceae were abundant in GAC, whereas Nitrospira were enriched in the sand-associated filters (RSF, SCM, and SSF). The GAC community was enriched with functions associated with aromatics degradation, many of which were encoded by Rhizobiales (similar to 30% of the total GAC community). Predicting minimum generation time (MGT) of prokaryotic communities suggested that the GAC community potentially select fast-growers (<15 h of MGT) among the four filter communities, consistent with the highest dissolved organic matter removal rate by GAC. Our findings provide new insights into the community phylogenetic structure, colonization pattern, and metabolic capacity that potentially contributes to organic matter removal achieved in the biofiltration stages of the full-scale DWTP.

We parameterized species distribution models (SDMs) for 135 plant species from the Algerian steppes. We interpreted low false-positive rates as reflecting a high capacity to follow optimal environmental conditions and high false-negative rates as a high capacity to persist under suboptimal environmental conditions. We also measured functional traits in the field and built a unique plant trait database for the North-African steppe. For both perennial and annual species, we explored how these two capacities can be explained by species traits and whether relevant trait values reflect species strategies or biases in SDMs. We found low false-positive rates in species with small seeds, flowers attracting specialist pollinators, and specialized distributions (among annuals and perennials), low root:shoot ratios, wide root-systems, and large leaves (perennials only) (R-2 = .52-58). We found high false-negative rates in species with marginal environmental distribution (among annuals and perennials), small seeds, relatively deep roots, and specialized distributions (annuals) or large leaves, wide root-systems, and monocarpic life cycle (perennials) (R-2 = .38 for annuals and 0.65 for perennials). Overall, relevant traits are rarely indicative of the possible biases of SDMs, but rather reflect the species' reproductive strategy, dispersal ability, stress tolerance, and pollination strategies. Our results suggest that wide undirected dispersal in annual species and efficient resource acquisition in perennial species favor both capacities, whereas short life spans in perennial species favor persistence in suboptimal environmental conditions and flowers attracting specialist pollinators in perennial and annual species favor following optimal environmental conditions. Species that neither follow nor persist will be at risk under future environmental change.","[Mouheb, Hocine Ait; Kadik, Leila; Berrached, Rachda] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene, Fac Biol Sci, Lab Ecol & Environm, Algiers, Algeria; [Albert, Cecile Helene] Univ Avignon, Aix Marseille Univ, Europole Mediterraneen Arbois, CNRS,IRD,IMBE, Aix En Provence 04, France; [Prinzing, Andreas] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Res Unit Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, Rennes, France","Mouheb, HA (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene, Fac Biol Sci, Lab Ecol & Environm, Algiers, Algeria.",hocinecpcm@yahoo.fr,"albert, cecile/AAA-5490-2019",,Universite Rennes 1 [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; Labex OT-Med [ANR-11-LABX-0061]; French government through the A*MIDEX projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02],"Universite Rennes 1, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02; Labex OT-Med, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-LABX-0061; French government through the A*MIDEX project, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02",,73,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We evaluated the effects of cutting the fine roots of two tree species on BVOC emissions during sampling and compared the BVOC and CO2 emission rates in the roots of 15 tree species in forests in Japan and Taiwan. The BVOC emission rate in Pinus densiflora roots increased as the number of cross-sections increased. When the cross-section of a P. densiflora root was outside the sample bag, the BVOC emission rate was not affected by application of a cutting treatment. The mean BVOC emission rates in the fine roots of each of 15 tree species ranged from 0 to 0.38 nmol g(-1)s(-1) for monoterpenes and 0 to 0.10 nmol g(-1)s(-1) for a sesquiterpene (longifolene). The monoterpene emission rates in fine roots were very high for some gymnosperm and ectomycorrhizal species (Pinus densiflora 0.38 +/- 0.31 nmol g(-1)s(-1) and Abies firma 0.19 +/- 0.08 nmol g(-1)s(-1)). The longifolene emission rates in fine roots were highest for one gymnosperm and arbuscular mycorrhizal species (Chamaecyparis pisifera 0.10 +/- 0.10 nmol g(-1)s(-1)). The proportional carbon ratio of BVOCs to CO2 in emissions from fine roots ranged from 0 to 67% among the 15 tree species. Distinct patterns in the exact BVOC compounds and their emission rates indicated species-specific carbon availability in fine roots.","[Tsuruta, Jun; Kosugi, Yoshiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, Japan; [Okumura, Motonori] Res Inst Environm Agr & Fisheries, Habikino, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Miyama, Takafumi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kume, Tomonori] Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tohno, Susumu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Energy Sci, Kyoto, Japan","Tsuruta, J (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Environm Sci & Technol, Forest Hydrol Labo, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",tsuruta.jun.42z@kyoto-u.jp,,"Tohno, Susumu/0000-0002-3936-5600","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K00523]; Coca-Cola Foundation; Summer Program of Interchange Association, Japan","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K00523]: the Coca-Cola Foundation: the Summer Program of Interchange Association, Japan.",,54,0,0,4,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

The influence of ecosystem was reflected in the proportion of those fractions of DSA and WSA on which the effect of soil type and HS was not shown, and vice versa.","[Tobiasova, Erika] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Nitra, Slovakia; [Barancikova, Gabriela; Koco, Stefan; Halas, Jan] Natl Agr & Food Ctr, Soil Sci & Conservat Res Inst, Presov, Slovakia; [Gomoryova, Erika] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Koco, Stefan] Univ Presov, Dept Geog & Appl Geoinformat, Presov, Slovakia; [Debska, Bozena; Banach-Szott, Magdalena] Univ Technol & Life Sci, Bydgoszcz, Poland","Tobiasova, E (reprint author), Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Nitra, Slovakia.",Erika.Tobiasova@uniag.sk,"Koco, Stefan/G-9117-2019","Koco, Stefan/0000-0003-4352-0295",Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0087],This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-14-0087.,,42,0,0,1,1,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",1801-5395,1805-9384,,SOIL WATER RES,Soil Water Res.,,2018,13,4,,,,,193,199,,10.17221/207/2017-SWR,,,7,Soil Science; Water Resources,Agriculture; Water Resources,GX4CC,WOS:000447673500002,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Guo, YF; Qi, W",,,,"Guo, Yuefeng; Qi, Wei",,,Correlations between Roots of Caragana Korshinskii and Soil Moisture after Stumping,EKOLOJI,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agro-pasture zigzag zone; Caragana korshinskii; total root length; root volume; specific root length; soil water content,GROWTH; CHINA,"Targeting at the artificial forests of Caragana korshinskii Kom. at the agro-pasture zigzag zone of Inner Mongolia, China, we applied four stump treatments before thawing in the spring of early March, 2016, including stumping at 0, 10 or 20 cm, and no stumping. In August the same year, the roots and soil moistures were hierarchically sampled using a quarter circle method. Then the spatial distributions of root morphology indices and soil water content at different root diameter levels of C. korshinskii were studied. It was found (1) the roots at three diameter levels after different treatments tended to be distributed at shallow layers, and mainly at the 0-40 cm layer, but rarely at the 180-200 cm layer. The root morphological indices shared basically consistent space distributive laws as the soil water contents, as both decreased with the increase of soil depth or horizontal distance from the trunk. (2) After different stumping treatments, the root distributions were positively correlated with the soil water contents, and the correlation coefficients of total root length, root volume, and specific root length with soil water contents were 0.725, 0.740 and 0.570, respectively.

Soil organic carbon, available P, number of AMF spores, species richness, diversity index, and dominance index were the main parameters differing among the three studied environments. In particular, the most prevalent ""order"" in these soils was Glomerales. The most frequent AMF genus in the soils of all these fields was Glomus. Varieties in AMF diversity were due to the: (1) changes in soil characteristics (e.g. soil available P and organic carbon); and (2) plant communities in the study fields.

Stress-tolerant plants such as Atriplex halimus L. have been used to rehabilitate such degraded areas. Seeds of A. halimus were sown in plastic bags in mid-March, mid-August and mid-September of 2012 and placed on the ground in a nursery at Khaldiah Station. Seedlings that were 4, 5 and 10 months old were transplanted on 20 January 2013 to the Khanasri Range Reserve and monitored for their survival over the growing seasons of 2013, 2014 and 2015. At the time of transplanting, the height, weight, stem thickness and root length density of 10-month-old seedlings were greater than of 4- and 5-month-old seedlings. Analyses of leaf tissues indicated high crude protein content in seedlings of different ages (22-26%). The 10-month-old plants showed 15-40-fold higher stem dry weight and more convoluted roots than the 4- and 5-month-old seedlings. The average rate of survival of transplanted seedlings over the three growing seasons was 77.0%, 92.3% and 94.3% for 10-, 5- and 4-month-old seedlings, respectively. Thus, higher growth of the 10-month-old seedlings than of 4- and 5-month-old seedlings at transplanting was compromised by their lower survival percentage throughout the 2013, 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The dry yield of fodder shrubs was comparable across different-aged seedlings after 2 years of growth in permanent pastures (380, 364 and 354kg dry yield ha(-1) for 10-, 5- and 4-month-old seedlings, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that 4-5-month-old seedlings of A. halimus are more appropriate for transplanting than 10-month-old seedlings because of cost-effective establishment of seedlings in the nursery, because no significant differences in shrub productivity were observed among plants derived from seedlings of different ages in the permanent rangeland. The impact of the introduced shrubs on different native plants in the range can be addressed in future studies.","[Al-Satari, Yahya; Khreisat, Zein] Natl Ctr Agr Res & Extens, Rangeland & Forestry Res Directorate, Al Baqah 19381, Jordan; [Al-Ramamneh, Ezz Al-Dein] Al Balqa Appl Univ, Al Shouhack Univ Coll, Dept Agr Sci, Maan, Jordan; [Ayad, Jamal] Univ Jordan, Sch Agr, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Amman, Jordan; [Abu Dalbouh, Mohamad; Amayreh, Ibrahim] Natl Ctr Agr Res & Extens, Water & Ecol Res Directorate, Al Baqah, Jordan","Al-Satari, Y (reprint author), Natl Ctr Agr Res & Extens, Rangeland & Forestry Res Directorate, Al Baqah 19381, Jordan.",yalsatari@yahoo.com,"Al-ramamneh, ezz al-dein/F-1277-2017","Al-ramamneh, ezz al-dein/0000-0001-9334-5590",,,,65,1,1,0,1,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2018,40,3,,,,,287,296,,10.1071/RJ17102,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK2KH,WOS:000435958100008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mosbah, M; Philippe, D; Mohamed, M",,,,"Mosbah, Mahdhi; Philippe, De Lajudie; Mohamed, Mars",,,Molecular identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores associated to the rhizosphere of Retama raetam in Tunisia,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Glomus; Retama raetam; spores,DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; ROOT; SOIL; COLONIZATION; CHINA; ECOSYSTEMS; BACTERIA; AFRICA; GROWTH,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are found in the soil of most ecosystems where they form mutualistic associations that affect plants growth.

Bare-rooted plants of European beech were analysed in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The plants were exposed to desiccation for 0-6 hours and the loss of fine roots weight induced by intentional heat attack was measured before their planting out. Results showed that plants unstressed by desiccation reached the lowest mortality after the first growing season, especially in cases when a drought spell followed their planting out. Poor growth was observed only in surviving plants stressed by desiccation longer than ca 4.5 hours. The shorter was the period of plant desiccation, the faster was the decrease of the weight of fine roots due to the constant heat attack. Limit values are specific for individual species and are influenced by weather after planting out and during the growing season.","[Houskova, Katerina; Mauer, Oldrich] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Silviculture, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Houskova, K (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Silviculture, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",keterina.houskova@mendelu.cz,,,National Agency for Agricultural Research [QJ1520080],The study was financially supported by the National Agency for Agricultural Research within the project QJ1520080.,,10,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6311,2336-632X,978-80-7509-550-3,PUB RECREAT LANDSC,,,2018,,,,,,,11,17,,,,,7,"Environmental Studies; Geography; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BK2YC,WOS:000434239900001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Deligoz, A; Bayar, E",,,,"Deligoz, Ayse; Bayar, Esra",,,Drought stress responses of seedlings of two oak species (Quercus cerris and Quercus robur),TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Growth; osmotic adjustment; proline; Quercus; stomatal conductance; water potential,WATER-STRESS; PLANT-RESPONSES; GROWTH; PROLINE; ENVIRONMENTS; METABOLISM; MECHANISMS; PROVENANCE; TRAITS,"Effects of drought stress on growth, predawn xylem water potential (psi(pd)), osmotic solutes (soluble sugar and proline), and stomatal conductance were assessed in two oak (Quercus cerris L and Quercus robur L.) seedlings. Seedlings of both species were subjected to three drought treatments with the following irrigation intervals: well-watered (control: irrigation every 2-3 days), moderate drought stress (irrigation every 15 days), and severe drought stress (irrigation every 30 days). Drought-stressed seedlings of Q. cerris and Q. robur had more negative predawn xylem water potential than their well-watered seedlings. In Q. cerris, root collar diameter and root dry weights were negatively influenced by drought, while height, shoot dry weight, and root:shoot ratios were unaffected. Height and shoot dry weight of drought-stressed Q. robur were decreased, while root:shoot ratio increased. Drought caused significant decreases in stomatal conductance of both species. Q. cerris seedlings sustained higher stomata' conductance compared with Q. robur. Proline and soluble sugar increased in response to drought stress. Q. robur had a higher proline accumulation than Q. cerris. These findings suggested that the Q. cerris and Q. robur seedlings showed a drought stress adaptive mechanism either by restricting their growth or increasing root:shoot ratio or by decreasing water loss (reduced stomatal conductance) and accumulating of osmotic solutes.","[Deligoz, Ayse; Bayar, Esra] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Forestry, Isparta, Turkey","Deligoz, A (reprint author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Forestry, Isparta, Turkey.",aysedeligoz@sdu.edu.tr,,,,,,46,0,0,0,3,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

We measured a competition index (CI), stem, branch, foliage, and root biomass as well as element content (Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)). Stem-foliage ratio (S/F), aboveground-belowground biomass ratio (T/R), average annual increment of biomass (AAB), height (AAH), and DBH (AAD) were calculated. The study found that the competition intensity of neighboring trees was closely related to the partitioning of biomass. Our results demonstrated that competition pressure of neighboring trees was a crucial factor to drive and regulate the distribution of biomass.

We coupled fire disturbance and biogeochemical models to assess the relative effects of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), climate, logging and fire regimes on the historical and future C balance of upland ecosystems for the four main Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) of Alaska. At the end of the historical period (1950-2009) of our analysis, we estimate that upland ecosystems of Alaska store similar to 50 Pg C (with similar to 90% of the C in soils), and gained 3.26 Tg C/yr. Three of the LCCs had gains in total ecosystem C storage, while the Northwest Boreal LCC lost C (-6.01 Tg C/yr) because of increases in fire activity. Carbon exports from logging affected only the North Pacific LCC and represented less than 1% of the state's net primary production (NPP). The analysis for the future time period (2010-2099) consisted of six simulations driven by climate outputs from two climate models for three emission scenarios. Across the climate scenarios, total ecosystem C storage increased between 19.5 and 66.3 Tg C/yr, which represents 3.4% to 11.7% increase in Alaska upland's storage. We conducted additional simulations to attribute these responses to environmental changes. This analysis showed that atmospheric CO2 fertilization was the main driver of ecosystem C balance. By comparing future simulations with constant and with increasing atmospheric CO2, we estimated that the sensitivity of NPP was 4.8% per 100 ppmv, but NPP becomes less sensitive to CO2 increase throughout the 21st century. Overall, our analyses suggest that the decreasing CO2 sensitivity of NPP and the increasing sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to air temperature, in addition to the increase in C loss from wildfires weakens the C sink from upland ecosystems of Alaska and will ultimately lead to a source of CO2 to the atmosphere beyond 2100. Therefore, we conclude that the increasing regional C sink we estimate for the 21st century will most likely be transitional.","[Genet, Helene; Clein, Joy; Euskirchen, Eugenie S.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [He, Yujie; Lyu, Zhou; Zhuang, Qianlai] Purdue Univ, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McGuire, A.

We investigated how shade tree cover and species diversity affect the root system and its dynamics. In a replicated study in Sulawesi (Indonesia), we studied the fine and coarse root system down to 3 m soil depth in three modern and more traditional cacao cultivation systems: unshaded cacao monoculture (Cacao-mono), cacao under either the legume Gliricidia sepium (Cacao-Gliricidia), or a diverse (> 6 species) shade tree cover (Cacao-multi). We analysed the vertical distribution of fine, large and coarse roots as well as fine root production, turnover and morphology on the species level. Stand-level fine root biomass showed a doubling with increasing shade tree cover (from 206 to 432 g m(-2)), but a tendency for a decrease in cacao fine root biomass. The presence of Gliricidia roots seemed to shift the cacao fine roots to a more shallow distribution, while the presence of shade tree roots in the Cacao-multi systems caused a biomass reduction and relative downward shift of the cacao roots. The turnover of cacao fine roots was much higher in the Cacao-multi stands than in the other two cultivation systems, although stand-level root production remained unchanged across the three systems. According to the stable isotope signature, Gliricidia extracted water from deeper soil layers than cacao, while no soil water partitioning was observed in the Cacao-multi stands. Our data suggest that the cacao trees altered their fine root distribution patterns in response to root competition. Both interspecific competition and root system segregation seem to play an important role in cacao agroforests with different shade tree cover.","[Rajab, Yasmin Abou; Leuschner, Christoph; Hertel, Dietrich] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hoelscher, Dirk] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Trop Silviculture & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Barus, Henry; Tjoa, Aiyen] Tadulako Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Agrotechnol, Palu 94118, Sulawesi Tengah, Indonesia","Hertel, D (reprint author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",dhertel@gwdg.de,,"Barus, Henry/0000-0003-2351-2132",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); collaborative research center [CRC990],"This study received financial support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of the interdisciplinary German-Indonesian research project ELUC ('Environmental and land-use change in Sulawesi, Indonesia') and the collaborative research center CRC990 'Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (Sumatra, Indonesia)'.

To examine this question, a greenhouse experiment was conducted at the University of Missouri, USA. Twenty 3-mo-old seedlings each of two African savanna tree species (Acacia nigrescens and Colophospermum mopane) were grown for 8 mo with two crossed factors: grass competition and irrigation depth. Strong negative effects of grass competition on final seedling biomass and leaf photosynthetic and stomatal conductance occurred in both tree species, but no effects of irrigation depth were detected. There was a clear tree species by grass competition interaction, suggesting interspecific variation in competitive response. The results emphasize the importance of below-ground competition with grasses for physiological and morphological responses of tree seedlings, while minimizing the importance of tree-grass rooting depth differences as a factor in modulating the competitive response of trees to grasses at the seedling stage.","[Ketter, Benjamin L.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Holdo, Ricardo M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Holdo, RM (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",rholdo@uga.edu,,,NSF through EPSCoR award [IIA-355406],We thank Barbara Sondermann for assistance in the greenhouse and Keala Cummings for help with seed acquisition and setting up the experiment.

However, the structure of ECM communities varies across soil (edaphic) and environmental conditions, and thus affects the potential range of symbiotic associations. To improve our understanding of these factors, we characterised the range of ECM fungi present across six sites varying in edaphic properties. We also assessed ECM fungi in root tips of P. radiata planted two years earlier at these sites to assess the extent in overlap between root and soil ECM communities. The structure of the ECM community varied substantially with site. Across all sites, correlations were identified between soil pH and metrics describing ECM community structure in both soil and root samples, indicating soil pH was contributing to the differences in the fungal communities between sites. Mineralisable nitrogen, soil carbon, and phosphorus content also varied with site, but were not significantly related to descriptors of the ECM communities. Root tips and surrounding soils shared some taxa but were inhabited by diverse communities of fungi, and a number of ECM P. radiata associations unique to New Zealand were identified. It is possible that the establishment of linkages between metrics could provide an opportunity to begin predicting the response of ECM populations to site modification, and potentially increase the growth of radiata pine and improve forest health through enhanced resilience to disturbance.","[Addison, Sarah L.; Walbert, Katrin] Scion, Private Bag 3020, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Smaill, Simeon J.] Scion, POB 29237, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Menkis, Audrius] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, POB 7026, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Addison, SL (reprint author), Scion, Private Bag 3020, Rotorua, New Zealand.",sarah.addison@scionresearch.com,,"Smaill, Simeon/0000-0001-6242-4931",,,,63,1,1,2,13,"ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",JENA,"OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY",0031-4056,,,PEDOBIOLOGIA,Pedobiologia,JAN,2018,66,,,,,,43,51,,10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.12.002,,,9,Ecology; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,FX6OD,WOS:000426204100006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Liepins, J; Lazdins, A; Liepins, K",,,,"Liepins, Janis; Lazdins, Andis; Liepins, Kaspars",,,"Equations for estimating above- and belowground biomass of Norway spruce, Scots pine, birch spp. and European aspen in Latvia",SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Allometric equations; tree biomass; small root biomass; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Betula pendula; Populus tremula,TREE BIOMASS; FOREST BIOMASS; PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; NATIONAL-SCALE; CARBON; MODELS; STANDS; SYLVESTRIS; FRACTIONS,"This study aims to derive allometric functions to estimate the above- and belowground biomass components of the most important tree species in Latvia.

Initial rooting by nine poplar clones was tested in moist and saturated soil conditions during an 18-day greenhouse experiment. Clones responded differently to soil moisture, particularly in number of roots, root distribution, and root dry mass accumulation. About 73% of cuttings planted in moist soil produced roots from callus tissue, whereas only 1% of cuttings planted in saturated soil developed such roots. This drove root distribution towards the basal section of cuttings in moist soil, while in saturated soil roots were more evenly distributed among all three below-ground sections of cuttings. Roots originating from the basal section of cuttings planted in moist soil were longer than roots originating from apical and middle sections. Conversely, roots from the apical and middle sections of cuttings planted in saturated soil were longer than those originating from the basal section.

Although, HGT has been reported in Eukaryotes, its accumulative effect and its frequency has been questioned. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are an early diverged fungal lineage belonging to phylum Glomeromycota, whose phylogenetic position is still under debate. The history of AMF and land plant symbiosis dates back to at least 460 Ma. However, Glomeromycota are estimated to have emerged much earlier than land plants. In this study, we surveyed genomic and transcriptomic data of the model arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare (synonym Rhizophagus irregularis) and its relatives to search for evidence of HGT that occurred during AMF evolution. Surprisingly, we found a signature of putative HGT of class I ribonuclease III protein-coding genes that occurred from autotrophic cyanobacteria genomes to R. irregulare. At least one of two HGTs was conserved among AMF species with high levels of sequence similarity. Previously, an example of intimate symbiosis between AM fungus and cyanobacteria was reported in the literature. Ribonuclease III family enzymes are important in small RNA regulation in Fungi together with two additional core proteins (Argonaute/piwi and RdRP). The eukaryotic RNA interference system found in AMF was conserved and showed homology with high sequence similarity in Mucoromycotina, a group of fungi closely related to Glomeromycota. Prior to this analysis, class I ribonuclease III has not been identified in any eukaryotes. Our results indicate that a unique acquisition of class I ribonuclease III in AMF is due to a HGT event that occurred from cyanobacteria to Glomeromycota, at the latest before the divergence of the two Glomeromycota orders Diversisporales and Glomerales.","[Lee, Soon-Jae; Kong, Mengxuan; Hijri, Mohamed] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Harrison, Paul] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Hijri, M (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",mohamed.hijri@umontreal.ca,,"Lee, Soon-Jae/0000-0002-7216-0236",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2017-05067],This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) discovery grant to M.H.

Here we report an improved method for describing the relationships between NPP and stand age at various SCI values for the main forest types and groups in Heilongjiang Province, China, using existing yield tables, biomass equations, and forest inventory data. We calculated NPP as the sum of four components: Annual accumulation of live biomass, annual mortality of biomass, foliage turnover, and fine root turnover in soil. We also consider the NPP of understory vegetation or moss. These NPP-age relationships under different site conditions indicate that the NPP values of broadleaved and coniferous, as well as broadleaved mixed forests increase rapidly and reach a maximum when in young forests. However, for coniferous forest types, the maximum NPP generally occurs in mature forests. In addition, a higher SCI leads to a higher NPP value. Finally, we input these NPP-age relationships at various SCI values into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon (InTEC) model to modify NPP modeling to estimate NPP in Heilongjiang Province in China from 2001 to 2010. All of the results showed that the methods reported in this study provide a reliable approach for estimating regional forest carbon budgets.","[Wang, Bin; Li, Mingze; Fan, Wenyi; Yu, Ying] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jing M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada","Li, MZ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",m15104546353@163.com; mingzelee@163.com; fanwy@163.com; yuying4458@163.com; jing.chen@utoronto.ca,,"wang, bin/0000-0002-4606-7900","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470640, 31500518, 31500519, 31300420]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572016AA30]","Research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470640, 31500518, 31500519, and 31300420), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572016AA30) supported this research.

We hypothesized that seeds of Phragmites carry microbes that improve seedling growth, defend against pathogens and maximize capacity of seedlings to compete with other plants. We isolated bacteria from seeds of Phragmites, then evaluated representatives for their capacities to become intracellular in root cells, and their effects on: 1.) germination rates and seedling growth, 2.) susceptibility to damping-off disease, and 3.) mortality and growth of competitor plant seedlings (dandelion (Taraxacum officionale F. H. Wigg) and curly dock (Rumex crispus L.)). Ten strains (of 23 total) were identified and characterized; seven were identified as Pseudomonas spp. Strains Sandy LB4 (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and West 9 (Pseudomonas sp.) entered root meristems and became intracellular. These bacteria improved seed germination in Phragmites and increased seedling root branching in Poa annua. They increased plant growth and protected plants from damping off disease. Sandy LB4 increased mortality and reduced growth rates in seedlings of dandelion and curly dock. Phragmites plants associate with endophytes to increase growth and disease resistance, and release bacteria into the soil to create an environment that is favorable to their seedlings and less favorable to competitor plants.","[White, James F.; Kingsley, Kathryn I.; Irizarry, Ivelisse; Micci, April; Bergen, Marshall S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 59 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Kowalski, Kurt P.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Soares, Marcos A.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Dept Bot & Ecol, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, MG, Brazil","White, JF (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 59 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",jwhite3728@gmail.com,"Soares, Marcos/Y-7844-2019; Soares, Marcos A/B-7683-2013","Soares, Marcos/0000-0002-8938-3188; Soares, Marcos A/0000-0002-8938-3188; White, James/0000-0002-6780-7066",John E. and Christina C.

We investigated the response to limited water availability of seedlings from nine improved full-sibling families of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) plus an unimproved seed lot ('Washington control'). Seedlings were 1-year old at the start of the imposition of two water availability treatments, which were maintained for 2.5 years: full irrigation, in which all water transpired was replaced, and water limitation, in which irrigation was provided to match only 30% of the transpiration of the Washington control under full irrigation. Both family and water availability affected leader extension rate, height, root collar diameter and total dry mass at the end of the following 2 years. Water limitation reduced leaf area and fresh mass per unit stem length and delayed bud flush. Specific leaf area was affected by water limitation earlier but not later in the experiment; the reverse was true of root to shoot ratio and numbers of primordia. Under full irrigation, five improved families maintained superiority over the Washington control in terms of height, root collar diameter and total biomass at the end of the experiment. Under water limitation, however, by the end of the experiment, seedlings from the improved families had no greater total biomass than those of the Washington control, reflecting the homogenizing impact of water limitation on production of leader biomass. Thus, for Sitka spruce, planting the most vigorous material will maximize gains under optimal conditions, but have little benefit in stress conditions.","[Grant, Olga M.; Ribeiro, Ana Flor Montero; Glombik, Phillip; O'Reilly, Conor] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland","Grant, OM (reprint author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Agr & Food Sci, UCD Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland.",olgamgrant@yahoo.com,,,"Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine [10/RD/FORGEN/UCD/717]; Brazilian Science Without Borders grant","The project FORGEN (Forest Genetic Resources), funded by the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (grant no. 10/RD/FORGEN/UCD/717); and a Brazilian Science Without Borders grant to AFMR.",,32,0,0,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,JAN,2018,91,1,,,,,83,97,,10.1093/forestry/cpx034,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,FT2LP,WOS:000422974200008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mummey, DL; Stoffel, L; Ramsey, PW",,,,"Mummey, Daniel L.; Stoffel, Lauren; Ramsey, Philip W.",,,Preestablished Plant Influences on Antelope Bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata Pursh) Seedling Recruitment and Growth: Analysis of Species and Positional Effects,NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,competition; facilitation; forage; mule deer; soil inoculation; spatial relationships,MULE DEER; INVASION RESISTANCE; BROMUS-TECTORUM; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; GRASSLAND; ESTABLISHMENT; DISTURBANCE; VIEWPOINT; DIVERSITY,"We evaluated the influence of preestablished plant species distance, direction, and identity on antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata Pursh) seedling establishment and biomass production. Antelope bitterbrush seeds were planted 10- and 20-cm away from the base of three preestablished plant species. We monitored seedling establishment and growth during and after two growing seasons. Sowing antelope bitterbrush seeds 20-cm away from preestablished plant bases yielded 1.59 times greater seedling establishment than seeds sown 10-cm away, suggesting that established plants interfere with bitterbrush recruitment. Antelope bitterbrush seedling survival after 2 y of growth was greater than 96% for all treatments, suggesting that early growth phases were the primary bottlenecks to establishment. Antelope bitterbrush forage production decreased with proximity to preestablished plants. After 2 y of growth, antelope bitterbrush biomass was almost 3 times greater for plants grown without preestablished plant neighbors or with a preestablished grass (Elymus elymoides Raf.) than with preestablished forb species (Dalea candida Michx. ex Willd. or Gaillardia aristata Pursh). Inoculating preestablished plants with soil from native sites or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi did not influence antelope bitterbrush establishment or growth. We suggest that plant trait complementarity and spatial relationships can be used to design seeding strategies to increase antelope bitterbrush establishment and forage production.","[Mummey, Daniel L.; Stoffel, Lauren; Ramsey, Philip W.] MPG Operat, 19400 Lower Woodchuck Rd, Florence, MT 59833 USA","Mummey, DL (reprint author), MPG Operat, 19400 Lower Woodchuck Rd, Florence, MT 59833 USA.",dmummey@MPGranch.com,,,MPG Ranch,"Jeff Clarke, Mike McTee, Prairie Wolfe, Ben Garret, and Kelley Laflamme are acknowledged for field assistance.

The fine roots in these forests substantially contribute to soil carbon accumulation. Charcoal is a fire by-product that influences ecosystem processes including soil organic matter decomposition. However, the extent to which charcoal affects fine root decomposition is unclear. We performed field litterbag experiments over 515 days involving the incubation of fine larch roots with varying concentrations of charcoal in soil. At the end of experiment the loss of root mass in samples incubated with higher concentrations of charcoal was greater (42% and 40%) than that in the control (30%) and a treatment containing the average measured soil charcoal content (27%). The degree of mass loss generally increased with increasing charcoal content. Our result provides the first field evidence that fire-derived charcoal may enhance the decomposition of fine larch roots, and consequently CO2 release from boreal forests.","[Bryanin, Semyon; Abramova, Evgeniya] Russian Acad Sci, Far East Branch, Inst Geol & Nat Management, Blagoveshchensk 675000, Russia; [Makoto, Kobayashi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe 0982943, Japan","Bryanin, S (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Far East Branch, Inst Geol & Nat Management, Blagoveshchensk 675000, Russia.",bruanin@gmail.com,"Bryanin, Semyon/G-2303-2012","Bryanin, Semyon/0000-0002-2227-5254",,,,21,1,1,6,35,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

However, research on the complementary use of resources in mixed plant communities, and especially the impact of plant species richness on root water uptake, is limited. So far, these investigations have been hindered by a lack of methods allowing for the estimation of root water uptake profiles. The overarching aim of our study was to determine whether diverse grassland plant communities in general exploit soil water more deeply and whether this shift occurs all the time or only during times of enhanced water demand. Root water uptake was derived by analysing the diurnal decrease in soil water content separately at each measurement depth, thus yielding root water uptake profiles for 12 experimental grasslands communities with two different levels of species richness (4 and 16 sown species). Additional measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and root traits were used to identify differences in water relations between plant functional groups. Although the vertical root distribution did not differ between diversity levels, root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit. Our results indicate that the more diverse communities were able to adjust their root water uptake, resulting in increased water uptake per root area compared to less diverse communities (52% at 20cm, 118% at 30cm, and 570% at 60cm depth) and a more even distribution of water uptake over depth. Tall herbs, which had lower leaf water potential and higher stomatal conductance in more diverse mixtures, contributed disproportionately to dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake. This study underpins the role of diversity in stabilizing ecosystem function and mitigating drought stress effects during future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that root water uptake is not solely controlled by root length density distribution in communities with high plant diversity but also by spatial shifts in water acquisition.

Because of potential interactions between mutualists, only studying a single type of mutualism could lead to a biased perspective of mutualism benefit and how mutualisms may scale-up to affect communities. The legume Chamaecrista fasciculata engages in a resource mutualism with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and also forms symbiotic interactions with ants by providing nectar in exchange for defense against herbivores. Although they provide very different benefits to the plant, both mutualists receive carbon resources from the plant. As a result, these two mutualists are likely to interact, potentially competing for carbon resources or mutually benefitting each other via their positive effects on plant hosts. In a full-factorial field experiment, we explored how rhizobia and ants influence one another, C. fasciculata fitness, and the associated arthropod community. Ants reduced plant allocation to rhizobia, but ants also increased rhizobia contamination of uninoculated plants, suggesting that ants may disperse rhizobia. In turn, rhizobia increased ant abundances, with ants preferentially tending plants with rhizobia. Chamaecrista fasciculata received substantial fitness benefits from rhizobia; in contrast, associating with ants reduced fitness. Additionally, the mutualists interacted to influence the abundance of other arthropods found on the plants. Rhizobia increased arthropod abundances, likely because more nitrogen-rich leaf tissue was more attractive to arthropod herbivores, but ants negated these increases. As these results illustrate, multiple mutualists may interact, influencing each other's abundance and the abundance of other community members.","[Keller, Kane R.; Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 49060 USA; [Keller, Kane R.; Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 49060 USA; [Keller, Kane R.] Calif State Univ, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA; [Carabajal, Sara] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Biol, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Navarro, Felipe] Michigan State Univ, Forestry Dept, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Keller, KR (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 49060 USA.; Keller, KR (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 49060 USA.; Keller, KR (reprint author), Calif State Univ, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",kane.r.keller@gmail.com,,,"Michigan State University Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship program at the W.K.

Additionally, orchid fungal associations can exhibit high specificity in nature. Yet, an important ecological question remains unanswered: 'With which orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) do un-inoculated orchid seedlings form symbiosis when cultured ex situ?' Simultaneously, it is asserted that orchid conservation efforts involving ex situ plant culture should exclusively utilize natural symbionts of the respective orchid taxa. We present a first comparison of OMF communities within the roots of asymbiotically cultured plants of the rare orchid Platanthera chapmanii grown ex situ (ES), and those occurring naturally in situ (IS). Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) barcoding region was used to identify peloton forming OMF from roots collected between 2012 and 2014 from both growing environments. Our 114 sequences clustered into 11 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to four closely related clades of the fungal family Tulasnellaceae. Shannon-Wiener (H) and Simpson diversity (D) indices were similar (p = 0.81 for both) for ES and IS OMF communities. Beta diversity comparisons also showed similarity between ES and IS treatments based on weighted (p = 0.10) and unweighted (p = 0.20) Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylograms clustered ES and IS derived fungal OTUs into the same clades. Our data suggest that P. chapmanii: (1) forms symbiosis with taxonomically similar fungi in ex situ culture and in its native soil, and (2) exhibits a narrow phylogenetic breadth of mycorrhizal fungal OTUs within the Tulasnellaceae.","[Kaur, Jaspreet; Poff, Kirsten E.; Sharma, Jyotsna] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Sharma, J (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",jyotsna.sharma@ttu.edu,,,Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,Funding from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is gratefully acknowledged for supporting portions of this study.

To address this, we conducted two experiments: a No Defoliation (ND) experiment (n= 48), in which seedlings from three perennial grasses (crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum {(L.} Gaertn.], bluebunch wheatgrass [Psuedoroegnaria spicata {Pursh} A. Love], Sandberg bluegrass [Poa secunda J Presl]) were subjected to wet and dry water regimes for 4 mo, and a concurrent Defoliation (D) experiment (n = 95), in which seedlings were factorially assigned to two defoliation treatments-frequency (LOW, HIGH) and intensity (30% vegetation removal, 70% vegetation removal). Indicators of seedling performance were aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB), root: shoot ratio, tillering, and mortality. The effect size statistic, Hedge's g, allowed for comparisons between performance measures. Water stress induced reductions inmost performance measures: BGB (g=ND: -1.3; D: -1.6), root: shoot ratio (g=ND: n. s.; D: -0.2), and tillering (g=ND: -1.7; D: -1.2), though not significantly for all species. For ABG, water stress interacted with defoliation, reducing performance less at an intensity of 70% (g = -2.0) as opposed to 30% (g = -3.0), but not always significantly in the former. Water stress also caused less reduction in AGB when no defoliation occurred (ND: -0.8; g=D: -2.5). Intensity and frequency of defoliation interacted; seedlings were generally resistant to reductions in performance except at high frequency, 70% defoliation. Agropyron cristatum and P. spicata displayed similar sensitivity to treatments, mostly in terms of changes in AGB and BGB, while P. secunda also experienced increased mortality and reduced tillering. If these differences in sensitivity result in differential survival, herbivory could impact species postrestoration population demographics.

Previous studies have reported apparent lower N2O emissions from dairy cow urine from fodder beet plants than from kale plants, although the underpinning mechanisms were poorly understood. Here, we report a laboratory incubation study to improve understanding of possible mechanisms underpinning different N2O emissions from two different forage plants, fodder beet (FB) and kale. The treatments included two urine sources from cows grazing FB or kale and two soils (FB soil and kale soil): FB soil control, FB soil + FB urine, FB soil + kale urine, kale soil control, kale soil + FB urine and kale soil + kale urine. The incubation temperature was 10 A degrees C to simulate New Zealand autumn/winter soil temperatures. Results showed that the total N2O emissions from FB urine treatment and from urine treatments in the FB soil were lower than those from kale urine in the kale soil (P < 0.05). There was a delay in the ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) growth in the FB soil + urine compared with that in kale soil with urine and this led to slower ammonia oxidation in the FB soil. Denitrifier communities were not significantly affected by the urine or soil treatments. These results suggest that there are plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) in the FB urine or root exudates in the FB soil, which might have inhibited the AOB growth and the nitrification process which led to lower N2O emissions in the FB soil or urine. Further research is needed to determine the chemical composition of urine from different forage plants and to identify potential PSMs or root exudates in the urine or soil from different forage plants.","[Yao, Bin] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Di, Hong Jie; Cameron, Keith C.; Podolyan, Andriy] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Soil & Environm Res, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand; [Shen, Jupei; He, Jizheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Di, HJ (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Ctr Soil & Environm Res, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand.",hong.di@lincoln.ac.nz,"Di, Hong J/G-5583-2010; Podolyan, Andriy/I-3530-2019; Podolyan, Andriy/W-6427-2018; Cameron, Keith C/C-3301-2018; He, Ji-Zheng/A-4488-2009","Podolyan, Andriy/0000-0002-5794-8623; Podolyan, Andriy/0000-0002-5794-8623; Cameron, Keith C/0000-0002-7631-1636; He, Ji-Zheng/0000-0002-9169-8058",New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre (NZAGRC); Catalyst Fund (Seeding); CSC [201503270015],"We would like to thank the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre (NZAGRC), The Catalyst Fund (Seeding) and CSC (CSC No. 201503270015) for funding and Steve Moore, Carole Barlow, Jie Lei, Qian Liang and Barry Anderson of Lincoln University for the technical support.",,37,0,0,4,36,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

Such variation could arise if enemy release is a transient phenomenon, whereby alien plant species initially escape but subsequently accumulate enemies in their new regions. To evaluate this hypothesis in terms of soil biota, we used 11 Trifolium (clover) species introduced to New Zealand from Europe to test whether species resident for longer or with a larger geographic extent in New Zealand were more adversely affected by soil communities in the introduced range, as expected if species have accumulated inhibitory soil biota over time. We used plant-soil feedback (PSF) experiments to compare the effect of soil biota on the growth of the Trifolium species in soil from their introduced (New Zealand) and native (Spain and the United Kingdom) ranges. We applied a novel statistical approach aimed at isolating the impact of antagonistic soil biota by accounting for variation in plant growth due to mutualistic rhizobia bacteria. The between-range differences in PSF varied considerably among the Trifolium species: some species were released from inhibitory PSF in the introduced range, but the majority experienced similar PSF in both ranges. Averaged over all 11 Trifolium species, PSF was less inhibitory in the introduced than in the native range, implying some release from soil-borne enemies. However, neither residence time nor geographic extent in the introduced range was significantly correlated with the strength of release from inhibitory PSF.Synthesis. Our multispecies study provides some evidence that alien plants can escape antagonistic soil biota in their introduced range, but highlights how plant-soil feedback responses can be highly variable among congeneric plant species in the same region. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the release from inhibitory plant-soil feedback is transient, questioning the generality of this phenomenon.","[McGinn, Kevin J.; Hulme, Philip E.; Shelby, Natasha; Weser, Carolin; Duncan, Richard P.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln, New Zealand; [McGinn, Kevin J.] Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Richmond, Surrey, England; [van der Putten, Wim H.; Weser, Carolin] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Duncan, Richard P.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT, Australia","McGinn, KJ (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln, New Zealand.; McGinn, KJ (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens Kew, Richmond, Surrey, England.",kevinmcginn@outlook.com,"Shelby, Natasha/I-5818-2019; Duncan, Richard P/E-7899-2013; Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Shelby, Natasha/0000-0001-9097-3663; Duncan, Richard P/0000-0003-2295-449X; Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New Zealand,Royal Society of New Zealand,,71,3,3,5,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Although such plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are considered as important drivers of plant community assembly, past PSF studies have mainly addressed plant biomass production. However, plant performance is not only the production of biomass but comprises a sequence of different life stages: from seed germination over vegetative growth up to the production of a viable progeny. Here, we assessed the effects of soil biotic communities that were previously conditioned for 3years by a focal plant species monoculture or species mixtures on key plant life stages from germination and vegetative growth to flowering and the production of viable seeds. We used three common grassland herb species that were grown in a sterile substrate and inoculated with a sterile control soil or with living soils. Living soils were conditioned either by the focal species in monoculture or a four- or eight-species mixture that included the focal species to represent a decrease in the target plants' conspecific influence on the soil communities. We show that the effect of soil biota changed from positive at the plants' juvenile life stages to neutral or negative at the plants' adult life stages and ultimately decreased plant fitness. A higher conspecific influence on the soil communities pronounced the positive effects at the juvenile life stage but also the negative effects at adult life stages. Further, we observed direct soil biotic effects on flower production and plant fitness that were not mediated by adult biomass production. This suggests that soil biotic effects may alter plant resource allocation and even may have transgenerational effects on plant fitness.Synthesis. We conclude that there is no overarching effect of soil biota that remains consistent at all the life stages of a plant. Thus, our results highlight the importance to consider plant life stage and ultimately plant fitness especially when plant-soil interactions are used to explain plant community dynamics.","[Dudenhoeffer, Jan-Hendrik; Klein, Alexandra-Maria] Univ Freiburg, Chair Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Freiburg, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne; Wagg, Cameron] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Wagg, Cameron] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Dudenhoeffer, Jan-Hendrik] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England","Dudenhoffer, JH (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Freiburg, Germany.; Dudenhoffer, JH (reprint author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.",jhdudenhoeffer@gmail.com,"Klein, Alexandra-Maria/J-5871-2016; Wagg, Cameron/O-4318-2019","Klein, Alexandra-Maria/0000-0003-2139-8575; Wagg, Cameron/0000-0002-9738-6901; Dudenhoffer, Jan-Hendrik/0000-0003-1548-1436","German Research foundation DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1451, KL 1849/5-2]","German Research foundation DFG, Grant/Award Number: FOR 1451 and KL 1849/5-2",,73,10,10,7,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Gannong No. 5) tissues, and also to determine the effect of the combination treatments on alfalfa seedlings' growth.Materials and methods: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg L-1 matrine levels were added into two cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged rhizobia; Ensifer meliloti LZgn5f (gn5f) and Ensifer meliloti 12531f (12531f), respectively; and drenched the alfalfa root with the inoculants. Then the migration and colonization of the two rhizobia in alfalfa on D7, D14, D21 and D28, and subsequently seedling growth were investigated.Results: The results showed that the optimum matrine level enhanced the colonization of both fluorescent-tagged rhizobia in alfalfa roots and the highest colonization densities of log 6.31 cfu g(-1) and log 5.87 cfu g(-1) were achieved by adding 300 mg L-1 matrine into 12531f and adding 100 mg L-1 matrine into gn5f, respectively. They could migrate to the aerial tissues and most colonize stems through the application of adding 300 mg L-1 matrine into 12531f and 100 mg L-1 matrine into gn5f, respectively. No fluorescent-tagged rhizobia were detected in the control treatment. Alfalfa seedling growth parameters like leaf chlorophyll content, seedling growth rate, root length, seedling biomass and total N percentage also increased the most when 300 mg L-1 matrine was added into 12531f and 100 mg L-1 matrine added into gn5f treatments.Conclusions: Our results suggest that 300 mg L-1 matrine added into 12531f and 100 mg L-1 matrine added into gn5f might be exploited to promote the colonization of rhizobia in alfalfa tissue and positively impact growth and yield, indicating possible benefits for plant cultivation.","[Miao, Yang-yang; Shi, Shang-li] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci, Key Lab Grassland Ecosyst,Minist Educ, Pratacultural Engn Lab Gansu Prov,Sino US Ctr Gra, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jian-guo] South China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mohamad, Osama Abdalla] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi, Peoples R China","Shi, SL (reprint author), Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci, Key Lab Grassland Ecosyst,Minist Educ, Pratacultural Engn Lab Gansu Prov,Sino US Ctr Gra, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China.",2470398455@qq.com,,"ABDELSHAFY MOHAMED, OSAMA ABDALLA/0000-0002-2234-8273",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560666],The experiment was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant number 31560666].,,38,2,4,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

However, how physical and biogeochemical factors control seasonal variation and annual rates of soil respiration remains poorly understood. A topographical gradient in a semiarid forest was chosen as the study site to assess how both biogeochemical and physical factors control respiration rates. Parameters measured include soil respiration, litterfall, fine root biomass, soil physical and chemical properties, soil bacteria and archaea gene abundance, ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance and richness, and soil carbon isotope signatures. The results showed that increases in soil temperature and moisture exponentially and linearly promoted root activity, driving seasonal variation of total soil respiration. Seasonal variation of heterotrophic respiration was driven by soil moisture in a second-order polynomial pattern. Autotrophic respiration only contributed to 20% of the total soil respiration, and seasonal variation in the soil respiration rate was driven by heterotrophic respiration. Utilizing soil moisture as a scalar, the values of Q(10) and R-10 in different poisons on the slope indicated soil respiration was controlled by interaction of soil temperature and moisture, and a new transformation of the R-10 function inducing soil moisture was proposed. Along the topographical gradient, the long-term average soil temperature and moisture significantly varied from the top to the bottom of a slope. This variation in physical processes induced differences in plant productivity and biomass accumulation, leading to varying organic matter accumulation across the gradient. The topographical position also induced differences in the size of the soil organic matter aggregates, archaea and bacteria gene abundances, and ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance and richness. The aforementioned parameters are interrelated due to their association with the long-term average soil temperature and moisture, and the interrelation of these parameters ultimately affects annual rates of soil respiration.","[Shi, Wei-Yu; Ma, Ming-Guo] Southwest Univ, Chongqing Key Lab Karst Environm, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei-Yu; Du, Sheng; Guan, Jin-Hong; Wang, Kai-Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei-Yu; Du, Sheng; Guan, Jin-Hong; Wang, Kai-Bo] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tateno, Ryunosuke] Kyoto Univ, Filed Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yamanaka, Norikazu] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Morina, Joseph C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Shi, WY (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Chongqing Key Lab Karst Environm, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",shiweiyu@swu.edu.cn,"DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008","DU, SHENG/0000-0002-5580-399X; Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41201258, 41411140035, 41671511]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU116087, XDJK20178013, SWU114108, XDJK20158021]; New Star Foundation on Shaanxi Province Youth Science and Technology [2016 KJXX-89]; FYJSPS Invitation Fellowship [L-15558]; JSPS-KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H05113]; JSPS-NSFC; Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University","We thank Prof. Iain Colin Prentice (Imperial College London) for his valuable comments which greatly improved the manuscript.

We synthesized a novel global dataset of forest CO2-fluxes to evaluate the consistency between EC and biometric or chamber methods for quantifying the CO2 budget in forest ecosystems. The EC approach, compared with the other two methods, overestimated net ecosystem production (NEP) by 25% (0.52 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), and underestimated ecosystem respiration (Re) by 10% (1.39 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and gross primary production by 3% (0.48 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The differences between EC and the other methods were greater at the sites with complex topography and dense canopy than at the sites with flat topography and open canopy. Forest age also influenced the differences mainly through changes in leaf area index. Open-path EC system induced large positive bias in the NEP estimated by EC, presumably due to its surface-heating effect. These results suggest that EC method likely produce biased estimates of NEP and Re in forest ecosystems. A global extrapolation suggests that the differences in the forest CO2-fluxes measured with different methods be consistent with the global overestimation of NEP and underestimation of Re by EC method. Accounting for these differences would substantially improve our estimates of the forest carbon budget. The uncertainties involved in each method were also discussed. To reduce uncertainty in quantifying both local and global carbon budgets, we recommend cross validation of forest CO2-fluxes measured by different methods with more accurate measurements and careful data processing strategies.","[Wang, Xingchang; Wang, Chuankuan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Bond-Lamberty, Ben] Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20740 USA","Wang, CK (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",wangck-cf@nefu.edu.cn,"Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41503071, 30625010]; NEFU [140-602057]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitySichuan UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT_15R09]","We thank all investigators whose data were applied in this synthesis, Dr. Qi Wang for helping on the random forest modeling, and Dr. Eva Falge and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

To better understand how soil respiration responds to warming, we conducted a three-year soil warming experiment M a subtropical Castanopsis hystrix plantation. Soil respiration (Rs) is considered the sum of root-dependent respiration (Rrd) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). We estimated root-dependent respiration using the difference in soil respiration between trenched (100 cm deep) and non-trenched plots. Our results showed that soil moisture was significantly higher in the trenched than non trenched subplots in the second year, but not in the third year. Soil warming increased Rh, and suppressed Rrd. The responses of Rh and Rrd to soil warming varied with the seasons, being greater in the dry cool than in the wet warm season. The elevated Rh levels may have resulted from the increased soil temperature and decreased soil moisture due to warming. The decline in soil total nitrogen (STN) content attributed to soil warming decreased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) biomass, which led to the reduced Rrd. The decreased Rrd and increased Rh appear to have offset each other, resulting in unaltered Rs levels under the warming treatment. Our study shows that mycorrhizal colonization can have similar effects on soil carbon as it does abiotic environmental factors such as temperature and moisture, and affects Rs dynamics.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Shi, Zuomin; Xu, Jia; Hong, Pizheng] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingxin] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 6215, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Li, Dejun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanchun] Henan Univ, Key Lab Plant Stress Biol, Coll Life Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Haolong; Zhao, Zhang; Ming, Angang; Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong] Chinese Acad Forestay, Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",liusr@caf.ac.cn,"Liu, Yanchun/C-7803-2019","Liu, Yanchun/0000-0002-3386-664X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31290223, 31470627]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2015DFA31440]; CAF [CAFYBB2017QB004]; Ministry of Finance [201404201]; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS","We would like to thank the Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosystem Research Station for experimental and logistical support, and also RM He, H Chen, YM You, YJ Yang, Y Wang, HB Lu, D Luo, L Chen, X Tang, X Zhang, L Zheng, and CY Li for assistance in field work and laboratory analyses.

To examine the different responses of soil respiration (R-s) components, i.e., autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) respirations, in a mountainous temperate forest,to elevated temperature, we conducted an open-field soil warming experiment combined with trenching treatments in a 60-year-old cool temperate deciduous broadleaved forest in central Japan. Here we particularly focused on the temporal variations of respirations under remarkable seasonal change of air and soil temperatures in the region. Rs was divided into R-A and R-H by trenching method in both warmed and control plots (three subplots for each treatment). We installed heating cables at 5 cm below the soil surface to increase soil temperature by 3.0 degrees C during snow-free seasons in the four experimental years from 2012 to 2015. The soil warming significantly increased R-s, however, the soil warming did not alter fine root biomass, carbon concentrations nor nitrogen availability in the soils, which were positively related to R-s. The magnitude of the warming effects on R-H was negatively correlated to both soil temperature and soil moisture content. In this cool-temperate forest characterized by monsoon climate in summer, the high soil moisture level may not be a limiting factor for the soil warming effect on R-H. The effect of soil warming on R-s did not vary throughout the daytime, but the effect on R-s varied seasonally because R-H showed more sensitive response to soil warming in the late-growing season when compared to other seasons. We demonstrated that the season-specific Q(10) model is able to quantify the warming impacts on annual respiration rates more accurately than apparent annual Q(10) model. The soil warming increased annual R-s, R-H, and R-A for the second year by 18.1%, 25.6%, and 5.3%, respectively, but the magnitude of those increments declined in the fourth year to 9.9%, 19.5%, and -2.8%, respectively. Our results suggest that soil warming, did not alter the temperature sensitivity of R-H in this forest soil, but might have induced thermal acclimation of R-A. This 4-year soil warming study in a mountainous forest contributes to the better understanding of the different responses of R-H and R-A to changing soil temperature conditions, and we highlight that the seasonal variations in the warming effects on R-H and R-A to future climate conditions should be taken into consideration in projecting the future soil carbon cycle.","[Noh, Nam Jin; Kuribayashi, Masatoshi; Saitoh, Taku M.; Muraoka, Hiroyuki] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Noh, Nam Jin] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, UJ Noblet Forestry Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Kuribayashi, Masatoshi] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, 2054-120 Kitago, Nagano 3810075, Japan","Noh, NJ (reprint author), Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan.; Noh, NJ (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, UJ Noblet Forestry Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",nnoh@mtu.edu,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program) [GR048]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26241005, PU13007]; Japanese Alps Inter-University Cooperative Project (JALPS) Fund of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)","We appreciate T.

Tree growth response may depend on its water status and on the competition or facilitation of the neighbouring trees. We analysed inter- and intra-annual diameter increments of European beech and Norway spruce trees within a mixed forest stand for two treatments, i.e., with and without rainfall exclusion and for two neighbourhood competition situations of the two climatically contrasting years 2014 and 2015. Rainfall exclusion by roofs at about 3 m height induced soil drought under 116 trees, particularly supported in the year 2015 by hot and dry weather conditions. The effects of extreme drought was examined at three levels, i.e. at two stem heights and at the main coarse root of 48 trees with inter- and intraspecific neighbourhood. We found species specific diameter growth performances during the year at all three levels. Compared to beech trees annual diameter increments of spruce trees were in most cases significantly higher in the year 2014, while in the drought year 2015 no significant differences between the two species were obvious. Under the heavy drought by the rainfall exclusion experiment and by the hot year 2015 diameter increments were significantly smaller for spruce trees at all three levels whereas for beech trees at all levels no significant differences were obvious. The diameter growth differences between inter- and intraspecific neighbourhood were in most cases small and not significant. In the drought year 2015 beech trees in intraspecific neighbourhood grew better at all levels compared to interspecific neighbourhood, with a significantly higher growth rate at the upper stem level. Reasons for the species specific reactions patterns on drought were discussed (phenology, water balance, species specific physiological reactions).","[Roetzer, T.; Biber, P.; Moser, A.; Schaefer, C.; Pretzsch, H.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Rotzer, T (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Thomas.Roetzer@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Schafer, Cynthia Margaretha/0000-0002-7583-2552","German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG) [PR 292/12-1, MA 1763/7-1, MU 831/23-1]; Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry; Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection","We thank the German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for providing the funds for the projects PR 292/12-1, MA 1763/7-1 and MU 831/23-1 ""Tree and stand-level growth reactions on drought in mixed versus pure forests of Norway spruce and European beech"".

We conducted a study to assess the relationships between tree and ground vegetation fine root biomass and tree species diversity (monocultures compared to 2-5 species mixtures), conifer proportion and other site factors (stand basal area, soil carbon stocks and C:N ratio) in the six major European forest types, boreal forest in Finland, temperate foregts in Poland, Germany and Romania, thermophilous deciduous forests in Italy, and Mediterranean forests in Spain. We sampled the fine roots of trees and ground vegetation to the depth of 20 cm in the mineral soil and allocated the fine root biomass to individual tree species using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIBS). We did not find any general positive effects of tree species diversity on the fine root biomass of trees or ground vegetation across the forest types and tree species combinations. However, our results suggest that tree fine root biomass increases with tree species diversity in pure broadleaf forests, but not in pure conifer forests. Species diversity explained 7% of the variation in tree fine root biomass in the broadleaf stands. The narrow tree species diversity gradient (1-2 species) in the conifer forests compared to the broadleaf forests (1-4) may have decreased the probability of conifer species combinations with below-ground functional traits conducive to over-yielding. Some evidence of diversity-mediated changes in the vertical rooting patterns of broadleaf trees and ground vegetation were found within the entire organic and 0-20 cm mineral soil layer although the weighted mean depth of fine root biomass was not affected. Negative diversity effects were found in the organic layer and positive diversity effects in the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer for broadleaf tree fine root biomass. Diversity effects were negative for ground vegetation fine root biomass in the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer. There was a general positive effect of conifer proportion on total fine root biomass in the organic layer, but not in the mineral soil layers. In general conifer proportion and site factors explained more of the variation in tree fine root biomass than tree species diversity. More research covering the annual variation in fine root biomass and deeper soil layers is needed before recommending managing species-rich forest for increasing below-ground biomass and carbon pools.","[Finer, Leena; Domisch, Timo] Nat Resources Inst, Yliopistokatu 6, FI-80100 Joensuu, Finland; [Dawud, Seid Muhie; Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten; Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Fac Forestry, Suceava, Romania; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Jaroszewicz, Bogdan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Bialowieza Geobot Stn, Sportowa 19, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Selvi, Federico] Univ Florence, Lab Appl & Environm Bot, Dept Agrifood Prod & Environm Sci DISPAA, Florence, Italy; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, MNCN, Serrano 115 Bis, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, ESCET, Dept Biol & Geol, C Tulipan Sn, Mostoles 28933, Spain","Finer, L (reprint author), Nat Resources Inst, Yliopistokatu 6, FI-80100 Joensuu, Finland.",leena.finer@luke.fi,"Dawud, Seid Muhie/E-3770-2015; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011; Chen, Han Y.H./A-1359-2008; Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten/E-8424-2015; Domisch, Timo/Q-4458-2018; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011","Dawud, Seid Muhie/0000-0002-5587-945X; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X; Chen, Han Y.H./0000-0001-9477-5541; Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten/0000-0003-1573-1167; Domisch, Timo/0000-0001-7026-1087; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/0000-0002-2042-8245; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Finer, Leena/0000-0001-7623-9374",European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7) [265171],"We would like to thank the Hainich National Park administration in Germany for support in establishing the study sites and for logistical help during fieldwork at the German site.

To quantify the effects of short-term N addition on soil C sequestration in an alpine scrub ecosystem, we conducted a field experiment for Sibiraea angustata scrub on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China. We quantified the soil C pool (030 cm) and C fluxes in litterfall, fine root (<2 mm diameter) production (FRP), and soil CO2 emission (heterotrophic respiration, R-h) over four years with four levels of N addition (N-0; control, N-20; 20, N-50; 50, and N-100, 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed that at control plots the total C-input (433 +/- 33 g C m(-2) year(-1)) via FRP (360 +/- 34 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and litterfall (73 +/- 1 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was close to the C-output via Rh (466 +/- 5 g C m(-2) year(-1)), which demonstrates that the S. angustata scrub soil C is at equilibrium status. However, adding N, particularly the N100 treatment, significantly affected the soil C balance; the soil became a C sink (163 +/- 46 g C m(-2) year(-1)) by increasing FRP (+63%) rather than by increasing litterfall (P > 0.05) or reducing R-h (P > 0.05). As a result, the soil C pool (030 cm) increased significantly. In conclusion, these results suggest that fine roots play a dominant role in the C balance of an alpine scrub ecosystem due to large C-inputs to the soil. Moreover, short-term high N enrichment causes sequestration of additional atmospheric CO2, largely because of the stimulation of fine root growth rather than increased inputs of aboveground plant litterfall or reductions in soil CO2 emission.","[Wang, Dong; He, Heliang; Gao, Qiao; He, Wei; Zhao, Chunzhang; Yin, Huajun; Liu, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong; He, Heliang; Gao, Qiao; He, Wei; Zhao, Chunzhang; Yin, Huajun; Liu, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] China West Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 10049, Peoples R China; [He, Heliang] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Mat & Chem & Chem Engn, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Yin, HJ; Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Yin, HJ; Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yinhj@cib.ac.cn; liuqing@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFC0505000]; National Science and Technology Basic Work Project [2015FY110300]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570476, 31570477]; CASDefence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-SMC023]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2013242]","This study was financially supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0505000), National Science and Technology Basic Work Project (2015FY110300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31570476 and 31570477), the Frontier Science Key Research Programs of CAS (QYZDB-SSW-SMC023), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS (No. 2013242).

Plant traits are key determinants of the interactions between herbivores and their natural enemies aboveground, which in turn are affected by soil organisms. Recent years have seen a surge in studies of the interactions between below- and aboveground biota, including descriptions of how microbial root mutualists influence plant traits and herbivore performance. However, concomitant effects on the natural enemies of herbivores remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we review the currently available literature to assess how and when mutualistic root microbes impose significant indirect effects on the performance of predators and pathogens of insect herbivores. We focus on how root microbes influence predator attraction, on-plant foraging efficiency, and the quality of prey tissues. We also consider the underappreciated effects of microbial root mutualists on the growth, transmission, and virulence of insect pathogens. We end by discussing missing links and important directions for future research.","[Tao, Leiling; de Roode, Jacobus C.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hunter, Mark D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Hunter, MD (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",mdhunter@umich.edu,,"Hunter, Mark/0000-0003-3761-8237","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1257160, DEB-1256115]","The work was supported by National Science Foundation grants DEB-1257160 and DEB-1256115 to JdR and MH, respectively.

We assessed changes in fine root biomass, production and turnover in different ages of secondary forests (3, 5, 15 and 40 yr old) following shifting cultivation and an old growth forest in Mizoram. The results of this study showed that the fine root biomass, production and turnover varied significantly (P < 0.01) during the course of stand development. Fine root biomass and necromass, respectively, ranged between 314 and 111 g m(-2) in 3yr old stand to 834 and 255 gm(-2) in old growth forest. Proportions of very fine root (< 0.5 mm) to total fine root biomass was significantly high (22%) in the 3yr stand which decreased during the course of ecosystem development (13-16%). Higher root categories showed reverse trend with stand development. Maximum fine root biomass (42-53%) recorded in 0-10cm depth, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increase in depth in all stands. Enhanced ratio of live root biomass to necromass during the course of stand development indicates increasing root vitality. Turnover of very fine root decreased during stand development while turnover of total fine root increased. We conclude that forest conversion have significant negative impact on fine root dynamics but the increased proportions of fine roots during early stages of stand development speedup the processes of recovery.","[Singha, Dipendra; Tripathi, S.

So far, most research on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots was conducted on loamy soils. However susceptible to incisive erosion processes, at present, no research exists on the effectiveness of plant roots in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils. Therefore, the prime objective of this study was to assess the erosion-reducing potential of both fibrous and tap roots in sandy soils. Furthermore, we investigated potential effects of root diameter, soil texture and dry soil bulk density on the erosion-reducing potential of plant roots. Therefore, flume experiments conducted on sandy soils (this study) were compared with those on sandy loam and silt loam soils (using the same experimental set up). Results showed that plant roots were very efficient in reducing concentrated flow erosion rates in sandy soils compared to root-free bare soils. Furthermore, our results confirmed that fibrous roots were more effective compared to (thick) tap roots. Dry soil bulk density and soil texture also played a significant role. As they were both related to soil cohesion, the results of this study suggested that the effectiveness of plant roots in controlling concentrated flow erosion rates depended on the apparent soil cohesion. The nature of this soil type effect depended on the root-system type: fine root systems were most effective in non-cohesive soils while tap root systems were most effective in cohesive soils. For soils permeated with a given amount of fibrous roots, an increase of soil bulk density seemed to hamper the effectiveness of roots to further increase soil cohesion and reduce erosion rates. In soils reinforced by tap root systems, the erosion-reducing power of the roots depended on sand content: the higher the percentage of sand, the smaller the erosion-reducing effect for a given amount of roots. This was attributed to more pronounced vortex erosion around the thicker tap roots in non-cohesive soils, increasing soil erosion rates. The results presented in this study could support practitioners to assess the likely erosion-reducing effects of plant root systems based on both root and soil characteristics.","[Vannoppen, W.; Keeble, J.; Poesen, J.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [De Baets, S.] Univ Cranfield, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Bldg B 52A, Cranfield, Beds, England; [Dong, Y.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, 9,Block 4,Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Vannoppen, W (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",wouter.vannoppen@kuleuven.be,,"De Baets, Sarah/0000-0001-8245-8960",KU LeuvenKU Leuven; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41671288]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council,"Financial support by KU Leuven for this research is acknowledged.

Root system contribution to soil stabilization is a well-known phenomenon. Identifying the functional traits and root morphology of pioneer vegetation that establish on forefields can provide information useful in the practical application of plants in land restoration of high altitude mountain sites. This study aims to gather information on the root morphology and biomechanical characteristics of the 10 most dominant pioneer plant species of the forefield of Lys Glacier (NW Italian Alps). X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) was used to visualize and quantify non-destructively the root architecture of the studied species. Samples were cored directly from the forefield. Data on root traits such as total root length, rooting depth, root diameter, root length density and number of roots in relation to diameter classes as well as plant height were determined and compared between species. Roots were also tested for their tensile strength resistance. X-ray CT technology allowed us to visualize the 3D root architecture of species intact in their natural soil system. X-ray CT technology provided a visual representation of root-soil interface and information on the exact position, orientation and elongation of the root system in the soil core. Root architecture showed high variability among the studied species. For all species the majority of roots consisted of roots smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter. There were also considerable differences found in root diameter and total root length although these were not statistically significant. However, significant differences were found in rooting depth, root length density, plant height and root tensile strength between species and life forms (dwarf shrub, forb, graminoid). In all cases, root tensile strength decreased with increasing root diameter. The highest tensile strength was recorded for graminoids such as Luzula spicata (L.) DC. and Poa laxa Haenke and the lowest for Epilobium fleischeri Hochst. The differences in root properties among the studied species highlight the diverse adaptive and survival strategies plants employ to establish on and thrive in the harsh and unstable soil conditions of a glacier forefield. The data determined in this study could provide a significant contribution to a database that allow those who are working in land restoration and preservation of high altitude mountain sites to employ native species in a more efficient, effective and informed manner.

We focused especially on the relationship between T-GRSP (g kg(-1)), soil organic carbon (SOC), and reactive nitrogen (N-r) availability among different categories of temperate forests and different horizons. Our study included 105 sampling sites divided into 5 categories, which vary in elevation and tree species composition (coniferous, deciduous, mixed). We detected significantly higher T-GRSP and SOC in the F+H horizon under conifers. We assume that this observation might be attributed to suppression of decomposition of T-GRSP and SOC by nature of coniferous litter. The lack of significant differences in T-GRSP/SOC among the categories and the positive correlations between T-GRSP and SOC in most of the categories confirmed the strong relationship of T-GRSP with SOC. We found a significantly higher content of T-GRSP in the F+H horizon for all studied forest categories. However, the contribution of T-GRSP to SOC is significantly higher in the Ahorizon, which might be caused by stabilization of glomalin by mineral fraction, including clay minerals or by the belowground origin of glomalin. We found the increase of SOC with increasing N-r in the Ahorizon for most categories of forest. T-GRSP follows this trend in the case of deciduous forests (decid), mixed forest (mixed), and mountain forests (mount). On the other hand, we detected a decrease of T-GRSP with increasing N-r in the F+H horizon of coniferous forests (conif). Moreover the T-GRSP/SOC decreases with the increase of N-r in the Ahorizon of conif, mixed and mount, which points to the higher sensitivity of forest with prevalence of coniferous trees. Our observations have confirmed an ecosystem-specific relationship between T-GRSP, SOC and N-r. We concluded that T-GRSP in combination with T-GRSP/SOC has the potential to reveal qualitative changes in soil organic matter (SOM) connected with increasing N-r.","[Rotter, Pavel; Sanka, Ondrej; Sanka, Milan; Kalabova, Tereza] Masaryk Univ, RECETOX, Kamenice 5-753, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Rotter, Pavel; Sanka, Ondrej; Sanka, Milan; Kalabova, Tereza] Masaryk Univ, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm, Kamenice 5-753, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Rotter, Pavel] Masaryk Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, Brno, Czech Republic; [Maly, Stanislav; Cizmar, David; Zbiral, Jiri; Cechmankova, Jarmila] UKZUZ, Hroznova 2, Brno 65606, Czech Republic; [Maly, Stanislav; Cizmar, David; Zbiral, Jiri; Cechmankova, Jarmila] Cent Inst Supervising & Testing Agr, Hroznova 2, Brno 65606, Czech Republic; VUMOP, Zabovreska 250, Prague 15627, Czech Republic; Res Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Zabovreska 250, Prague 15627, Czech Republic","Rotter, P (reprint author), Masaryk Univ, RECETOX, Kamenice 5-753, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.; Rotter, P (reprint author), Masaryk Univ, Res Ctr Tox Cpds Environm, Kamenice 5-753, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.; Rotter, P (reprint author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, Brno, Czech Republic.",rotter@recetox.muni.cz,"Rotter, Pavel/I-1892-2018","Rotter, Pavel/0000-0002-8198-1466","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (project NAZV) [QI112A201]; National Sustainability Programme of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [LO1214]; RECETOX research infrastructure [LM2015051]","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments which helped to improve the article.

Accordingly, hosts discriminate against free-riding symbionts in many mutualistic relationships. However, as the selective advantage of discriminators comes from the presence of variability in symbiont quality that they eliminate, discrimination and thus mutualism have been considered to be maintained with exogenous supply of free-riders. In this study, we tried to resolve the paradoxical' co-evolution of discrimination by hosts and cooperation by symbionts, by comparing two different types of discrimination: one-shot' discrimination, where a host does not reacquire new symbionts after evicting free-riders, and resampling' discrimination, where a host does from the environment. Our study shows that this apparently minor difference in discrimination types leads to qualitatively different evolutionary outcomes. First, although it has been usually considered that the benefit of discriminators is derived from the variability of symbiont quality, the benefit of a certain type of discriminators (e.g. one-shot discrimination) is proportional to the frequency of free-riders, which is in stark contrast to the case of resampling discrimination. As a result, one-shot discriminators can invade the free-rider/nondiscriminator population, even if standing variation for symbiont quality is absent. Second, our one-shot discriminators can also be maintained without exogenous supply of free-riders and hence is free from the paradox of discrimination. Therefore, our result indicates that the paradox is not a common feature of evolution of discrimination but is a problem of specific types of discrimination.","[Uchiumi, Y.; Ohtsuki, H.; Sasaki, A.] SOKENDAI, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan; [Sasaki, A.] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, Laxenburg, Austria","Uchiumi, Y (reprint author), SOKENDAI, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan.",uchiumi_yu@soken.ac.jp,"Uchiumi, Yu/R-2979-2019","Uchiumi, Yu/0000-0003-4449-1289","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J10728, 15H04425]",Y.U. thanks members of the mathematical biology laboratory of SOKENDAI for helpful discussions.

Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species. Methods Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Important Findings The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.","[Savolainen, Tiina; Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Savolainen, T (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",tiina.savolainen@jyu.fi,,,Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [127657],Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; The Finnish Cultural Foundation; Academy of Finland (127657).,,97,0,0,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Few studies have addressed whether a single species can exhibit both drought avoidance and drought tolerance strategies along an aridity gradient, and none have evaluated the role of ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in shaping such strategies. In the desert shrub Encelia canescens, distributed along an aridity gradient in the Atacama Desert, we hypothesized that populations located in sites with lower and more variable rainfall (northern populations) would exhibit patterns of trait means and plasticity reflecting a water-conservative strategy, while populations in less arid and less variable environments (southern populations) would exhibit a water-acquisitive strategy. We also tested the hypothesis that functional variation in trait means and plasticity are not alternative mechanisms of adaptation to the environment. In a common garden experiment using plants from seeds collected from six populations spanning the species distribution range we found that plants from the northern populations were smaller, had fewer leaves, lower photosynthetic rates and had higher plasticity for root: shoot ratios and lower plasticity for leaf shedding, suggesting a resource-conservative strategy compared to plants from the southern populations, which showed a resource-acquisitive strategy. We found no association between variation in trait means and plasticity, which indicates that these are not alternative mechanisms of plant adaptation to environmental variation. Results suggest that E. canescens populations have evolved different strategies to cope with drought stress depending on their location along the Atacama Desert's aridity gradient. This gives us a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive phenotypic variation among populations.","[Carvajal, Danny E.; Loayza, Andrea P.; Rios, Rodrigo S.; Gianoli, Ernesto; Squeo, Francisco A.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile; [Carvajal, Danny E.; Loayza, Andrea P.; Squeo, Francisco A.] IEB, Nunoa, Chile; [Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Squeo, Francisco A.] CEAZA, La Serena, Chile","Carvajal, DE (reprint author), Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile.",dcarvajal@userena.cl; aloayza@userena.cl; srrios@userena.cl; egianoli@userena.cl; f_squeo@userena.cl,"; Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015","Carvajal, Danny/0000-0003-3216-8329; Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640; Squeo, Francisco/0000-0003-3559-0250","Chilean Millennium Initiative [ICM P05-002]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PFB-23, 21140050]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3120123, 11140400, 3120121]","We thank all those who assisted with the field and greenhouse data collection, particularly Patricio Garcia-Guzman and Luis Letelier.

The trees in six independent field experiments were grown individually or in combination of a legume tree and cardon cactus and were originally treated with plant growth-promoting bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, or small amounts of cattle compost or a combination of all treatments. Survival and height of trees and cacti and cactus biovolume were measured. When data were combined from all experiments and analyzed together, the best survivor was the cardon cacti and, to a lesser extent, the legume tree mesquite amargo. Over a decade later, a combination of a legume tree with cardon cactus, while detrimental to the legume, significantly increased the chances of the cactus to survive and grow in degraded soil. The biotic and compost treatments, while enhancing the initial establishment of the plants in 2004, had only marginal benefit on the growth of cactus 11 years later. Long-term desert restoration with native trees is possible. Because this cactus is the native, long term soil stabilizer, a combination cactus-legume tree is recommended for long term desert restorations.","[Moreno, Manuel; de-Bashan, Luz E.; Lopez, Blanca R.; Bashan, Yoav] Northwestern Ctr Biol Res CIBNOR, Environm Microbiol Grp, Ave IPN 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico; [de-Bashan, Luz E.; Hernandez, Juan-Pablo; Lopez, Blanca R.; Bashan, Yoav] Bashan Inst Sci, 1730 Post Oak Court, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [de-Bashan, Luz E.; Bashan, Yoav] Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, 301 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hernandez, Juan-Pablo] El Bosque Univ, Biol Program, Environm Microbiol Lab, 131A,Cra 9 131a2, Bogota, Colombia","Bashan, Y (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, 301 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",ybashan@cibnor.mx,,,"Bashan Institute of Science, USA","We thank Bernardo Salazar, Luis Leyva, Claudia Rojas, Rocio Villalpando, Elsa Samano, and Diana Arizmendi at CIBNOR for technical assistance in establishing the initial stages of the field studies and periodic maintenance.

The Co concentration in leaves was higher than those in other tissues, and the maximum Co accumulation in leaves was 2012 mu g g(-1). Accumulation of Co competed with Zn transport and stimulated Cu transport. Our results indicate that C. barbinervis is a Co hyperaccumulator and is more tolerant to Co than to Ni.

We used a critical wind speed for the uprooting of trees as a measure of vulnerability, which together with the probability of such wind speed defined a level of risk. Based on that, we also predicted the stem volume of growing stock at risk and the amount of damage. In this work, medium fertility sites were planted to one of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), or silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) or to the tree species that was dominant before the final clear-felling. The vulnerability to wind damage, the volume of growing stock at risk, and the amount of damage all increased, increasing the most in the south when the proportion of Norway spruce (with shallow rooting) of the growing stock increased. Under a severe climate warming, the proportion of Norway spruce decreased the most in the south, opposite to that of birch. This decreased the risk of damage in autumn (when birch is leafless), unlike in summer. The low risk of damage in the north was due to the large proportion of Scots pine.","[Ikonen, V. -P.; Kilpelainen, A.; Zubizarreta-Gerendiain, A.; Strandman, H.; Kangas, J.; Peltola, H.] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Asikainen, A.] Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 68, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Venalainen, A.; Kaurola, J.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland","Ikonen, VP (reprint author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",veli-pekka.ikonen@uef.fi,,,FORBIO project [14970]; Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland; ADAPT project [14907]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland,"This work was supported especially by the FORBIO project (No. 14970), funded by the Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland and led by Heli Peltola at the University of Eastern Finland.

Changes in F. sinensis plants grown with (E+) and without the endophyte (E-) were evaluated as they were subjected to different water treatments (20%, 35%, 50%, 65% and 80% relative saturation moisture content, RSMC). Growth parameters such as plant height, number of tillers, blade width, stem diameter, root length, total biomass, root-shoot ratio and relative water content were determined. The results showed that drought and waterlogging significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of F. sinensis. The presence of the endophyte significantly (P < 0.05) increased plant growth and root-shoot ratio under drought and waterlogged conditions. In addition, the plant height, number of tillers, blade width, stem diameter and total biomass in seedlings of both ecotypes reached the maximum at 65% RSMC, which suggests the optimal water condition. These findings also show that moderate drought (35% and 50% RSMC) could promote root growth of grass seedlings. Therefore, endophytic infections can result in enhanced host plant resistance to drought and waterlogged conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

The accurate estimation of SOC under various land-use types is fundamental to sustain ecosystem productivity. Thus, the dominant factors of the spatial distribution of SOC in shallow soil layers were determined at hillslope scale. The state-space modeling approach was used to quantify the relationship between SOC stock and land-use type, soil properties, topographic features, and fine root biomass (FRB) at 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers of a hillslope on the Loess Plateau. The best state-space models explained more than 96% of the variations in SOC stocks on the hillslope. The best multivariate state-space models including land-use type, FRB, soil pH, and total nitrogen were optimal for 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers. Land-use type was the dominant factor for identification of localized variation in SOC in the 0-40 cm soil layer. The results underscored the importance of land-use type in SOC variation on the hillslopes of the Loess Plateau.

We combined greenhouse, field, and laboratory experiments involving the invasive forb spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and native bunchgrasses to assess direct and indirect effects of the forb-specific herbicide picloram on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are beneficial soil fungi that colonize most plants. Picloram had no effect on bunchgrass viability and their associated AMF in the greenhouse, but killed spotted knapweed and reduced AMF colonization of a subsequent host grown. Results were similar in the field where AMF abundance in bunchgrass-dominated plots was unaffected by herbicides one year after spraying based on 16:omega 15 phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) concentrations. In spotted-knapweed-dominated plots, however, picloram application shifted dominance from spotted knapweed, a good AMF host, to bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa), a poor AMF host. This coincided with a 63% reduction in soil 16:omega 15 NLFA concentrations but no reduction of 16:omega 15 PLFA. Because 16:omega 15 NLFA quantifies AMF storage lipids and 16:omega 15 PLFA occurs in AMF membrane lipids, we speculate that the herbicide-mediated reduction in host quality reduced fungal carbon storage, but not necessarily fungal abundance after one year in the field. Overall, in greenhouse and field experiments, AMF were only affected when picloram altered host quantity and quality. This apparent lack of direct effect was supported by our in-vitro trial where picloram applied to AMF mycelia did not reduce fungal biomass and viability. We show that the herbicide picloram can have profound, indirect effects on AMF within one year. Depending on herbicide-mediated shifts in host quality, rapid interventions may be necessary post herbicide applications to prevent loss of AMF abundance. Future research should assess consequences of these potential shifts for the restoration of native plants that differ in mycorrhizal dependency.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Rummel, Alexii; McLeod, Morgan; Ramsey, Philip W.] MPG Ranch, 1001 South Higgins Ave,Suite A3, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59802 USA; [Wagner, Viktoria] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic","Lekberg, Y (reprint author), MPG Ranch, 1001 South Higgins Ave,Suite A3, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.; Lekberg, Y (reprint author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59802 USA.",ylekberg@mpgranch.com,,"Wagner, Viktoria/0000-0002-2665-9888",Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; MPG Ranch,"We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments that significantly improved this manuscript.

In this study we investigated the potential to use living plant roots in small scale experiments of slope failure that would use a geotechnical centrifuge to achieve soil stress states comparable to those in the field at homologous points. Three species (Willow, Gorse and Festulolium grass), corresponding to distinct plant groups with different root architecture and Woodiness' were selected and cultivated for short periods (2 months for Willow and Festulolium grass, 3 months for Gorse). The morphologies, tensile strength and Young's modulus of these juvenile root samples and their effects on increasing soil shear strength were then measured (via tensile tests and direct shear tests) and compared with published results of more mature field grown specimens. Our test results show that when all juvenile root samples of the three species are considered, the commonly used negative power law does not fit the data for the relationship between root tensile strength and root diameter well, resulting in very low R-2 values (R2 <0.14). No significant differences in tensile strength were observed between roots with different diameter for Willow and Gorse, and the average root tensile strength for all juvenile root samples was 8.70 + 0.60 MPa (Mean + SE), 9.50 + 0.40 MPa, 21.67 + 1.29 MPa for Willow, Festulolium grass and Gorse, respectively. However, a strong linear relationship was observed between tensile strength and Young's modulus of the roots of the juvenile plants (R-2 = 0.55, 0.69, 0.50 for Willow, Festulolium grass and Gorse, respectively). From a centrifuge modelling perspective, it was shown that using juvenile plants could potentially produce prototype root systems that are highly representative of corresponding mature root systems both in terms of root mechanical properties and root morphology when a suitable growing time (2 months) and scaling factor (N= 15) are selected. However, it remains a challenge to simultaneously simulate the distribution of root biomass with depth of the corresponding mature plant. Therefore, a compromise has to made to resolve the conflicts between the scaling of rooting depth and root reinforcement, and it is suggested that 1:15 scale would represent a suitable compromise for studying slope failure in a geotechnical centrifuge.

We tested the physical landslide model, LAPSUS_LS, which models slope stability at the catchment scale. LAPSUS_LS combines a hydrological model with a Limit Equilibrium Method model, and calculates the factor of safety of individual cells based on their hydrological and geomorphological characteristics. We tested two types of vegetation on slope stability: (i) coffee monoculture (Coffea arabica) and (ii) a mixed plantation of coffee and deep rooting Erythrina (Erythrina poeppigiana) trees. Using soil and root data from Costa Rica, we performed simulations to test the response of LAPSUS_ LS to root reinforcement, soil bulk density, transmissivity, internal friction angle and depth of shear plane. Furthermore, we modified the model to include biomass surcharge effect in the calculations. Results show that LAPSUS_ LS was most sensitive to changes in additional cohesion from roots. When the depth of the shear plane was fixed at 1.0 m, slopes were not unstable. However, when the shear plane was fixed to 1.5 m, the mixed plantation of coffee and trees stabilized slopes, but the coffee monoculture was highly unstable, because root reinforcement was low at a depth of 1.5 m. Soil transmissivity had a limited impact on the results compared to bulk density and internal friction angle. Biomass surcharge did not have any significant effect on the simulations. In conclusion, LAPSUS_ LS responded well to the soil and vegetation input data, and is a suitable candidate for modeling the stability of vegetated slopes at the catchment level.","[Rossi, L. M.

When considered in isolation, we know that beneficial microbes can enhance an exotic plant's invasive ability and that herbivorous insects often decrease an exotic plant's likeliness of success. However, the effect of these partners on plant fitness has not been well characterized when all three species coevolve. We use computational evolutionary modeling of a trait-based system to test how microbes and herbivores simultaneously coevolving with an invading plant affect the invaders' probability of becoming established. Specifically, we designed a model that explores how a beneficial microbe would influence the outcome of an interaction between a plant and herbivore. To model novel interactions, we included a phenotypic trait shared by each species. Making this trait continuous and selectable allows us to explore how trait similarities between coevolving plants, herbivores and microbes affect fitness. Using this model, we answer the following questions: (1) Can a beneficial plant-microbe interaction influence the evolutionary outcome of antagonistic interactions between plants and herbivores? (2) How does the initial trait similarity between interacting organisms affect the likelihood of plant survival in novel locations? (3) Does the effect of tripartite interactions on the invasion success of a plant depend on whether organisms interact through trait similarity [Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)] or dissimilarity (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis)? We found that it was much more difficult for plants to invade under the ERH but that beneficial microbes increase the probability of plant survival in a novel range under both hypotheses. To our knowledge, this model is the first to use tripartite interactions to explore novel species introductions. It represents a step towards gaining a better understanding of the factors influencing establishment of exotic species to prevent future invasions.","[Jack, Chandra N.; Hintze, Arend; Sheneman, Leigh] Michigan State Univ, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hintze, Arend] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hintze, Arend] Michigan State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Jack, CN (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",chandra.jack@gmail.com,,"Jack, Chandra/0000-0003-0167-1271; Sheneman, Leigh/0000-0002-9370-3666",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0939454]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1354878]; Michigan State University,"This material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement No. DBI-0939454.

Intensively managed forests, such as sessile oak stands, may alter their structure and function under a warming scenario. Here we analyse and project the climate-growth relationships of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) from high forests, originated from seed, and coppice forests, originated from vegetative reproduction in the Czech Republic. Dendrochronological data and linear mixed-effects models show similar effects of precipitation for April May (positive) for both seedling- and coppice-origin trees. Previous autumn and current June temperature show significant negative correlations to growth in coppice forests. Nonetheless, trees from high forest stands showed increasing drought sensitivity and tended to show a stronger response to the previous autumn's temperature during the 20th century. The positive effect of wanner autumns, only found on high stands, might be related to the extended growing season, suggesting improved adaptive capacity to cope with impending wanner conditions. In contrast, coppice trees might be able to buffer soil water shortage during spring and summer by higher root/shoot ratio. The obtained models were used to estimate the impact of 21st century-emission scenarios on tree basal area increments and stand basal area dynamics under different stand structures. Our results support that growth responses to climate warming are age and/or structure-dependent in sessile oak, particularly with regards to coppiced stands. Converting coppice forests to high stand structures, as well as thinning high stands, would enhance sessile oak forest adaptive capacity to cope with warming in Central Europe.","[Stojanovic, Marko; Szatniewska, Justyna] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Stojanovic, Marko; Szatniewska, Justyna; Pokorny, Radek] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Silviculture, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sanchez-Salguero, Raul] CSIC, IPE, Avda Montana 1005, E-50080 Zaragoza, Spain; [Sanchez-Salguero, Raul; Linares, Juan C.] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Sistemas Fis Quim & Nat, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Levanic, Tom] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Stojanovic, M (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Czechglobe Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",stojanovic.m@czechglobe.cz; rsanchez@upo.es; tom.levanic@gozdis.si; szatniewska.j@czechglobe.cz; radek.pokorny@mendelu.cz; jclinares@upo.es,"Stojanovic, Marko/B-9312-2014; Stojanovic, Marko/W-9442-2019; Pokorny, Radek/D-8208-2014","Stojanovic, Marko/0000-0003-4918-8668; Stojanovic, Marko/0000-0003-4918-8668; Pokorny, Radek/0000-0001-5121-6694","Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]; IGA Mendelu in Brno [LDF_VP_2015040]; STSM Grant from COST Action FP 1301 EuroCoppice; CoMo-ReAdapt project [CGL2013-48843-C2-1-R]; Fundiver project [CGL2015-69186-C2-1-R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion) [IJCI-2015-25845]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I), grant number LO1415.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of mixed inoculation with native mycorrhizae, two yeasts and one endophytic bacterium, on the growth of two poplar clones commonly used in Patagonia, Argentina. Yeasts and bacteria were selected base on their ability to produce IAA and siderophores, as well as P solubilization in-vitro. A greenhouse trial was performed using hardwood cuttings of Populus nigra 'Italica' and Populus trichocarpa 'SP1456'. Only yeasts modified growth traits, in a host-related response: Tausonia pullulans reduced the root/shoot ratio in P. nigra, and Candida saitoana and increased shoot dry biomass in P. trichocarpa. All plants presented arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization but ectomycorrhizae were absent. Two types of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization were observed, one of them similar to Glomus tenue. We found a tendency for a higher percentage of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization when plants were inoculated with T. pullulans. The used of native yeast along with mycorrhizal inocula appears to be a promising tool to improve poplar forestry.","[Cecilia Mestre, Maria; Fontenla, Sonia B.] Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, UNCO IPATEC, Lab Microbiol Aplicada & Biotecnol,CRUB, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Pastorino, Mario J.; Aparicio, Alejandro G.] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Unidad Genet Ecol & Mejoramiento Forestal, Modesta Victoria 4450 CC 277, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Pastorino, Mario J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Cient Tecnol Patagonia Norte, Av Pioneros 2350, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Mestre, MC (reprint author), Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, UNCO IPATEC, Lab Microbiol Aplicada & Biotecnol,CRUB, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",mariaceciliamestre@gmail.com,,"Pastorino, Mario Juan/0000-0003-0120-7727",,,,35,3,3,0,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0718-9516,,,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,J.

Despite the known effect of plant traits on the microbial community composition, their effects on the microbial functional diversity are only starting to be assessed. In this study, the phylogenetic structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities associated with plant species differing in life cycle and growth form, that is, plant life forms, was determined to unravel the effect of plant traits on the functional diversity of this fungal group. The results of the 454 pyrosequencing showed that the AM fungal community composition differed across plant life forms and this effect was dependent on the soil collection date. Plants with ruderal characteristics tended to associate with phylogenetically clustered AM fungal communities. By contrast, plants with resource-conservative traits associated with phylogenetically overdispersed AM fungal communities. Additionally, the soil collected in different seasons yielded AM fungal communities with different phylogenetic dispersion. In summary, we found that the phylogenetic structure, and hence the functional diversity, of AM fungal communities is dependent on plant traits. This finding adds value to the use of plant traits for the evaluation of belowground ecosystem diversity, functions and processes.","[Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro; Varela-Cervero, Sara; Barea, Jose M.; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion] CSIC, Dept Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst, Estn Expt Zaidin, Granada, Spain; [Vasar, Martti; Opik, Maarja] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Tartu, Estonia; [Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Copenhagen O, Denmark","Lopez-Garcia, A (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biol, Copenhagen O, Denmark.; Lopez-Garcia, A (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Copenhagen O, Denmark.",alvaro.lopez.garcia@bio.ku.dk,"Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/J-9190-2014; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008","Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/0000-0001-8267-3572; Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460","Spanish Plan Nacional de I + D + I [CGL-2009-08825]; Junta de Andalucia, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y CienciaJunta de Andalucia [CVI-7640]; Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Marie Curie Individual Fellowship (European Commission) [708530]; Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [IUT20-28]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange)","Spanish Plan Nacional de I + D + I, Grant/Award Number: CGL-2009-08825; Junta de Andalucia, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia, Grant/Award Number: CVI-7640; Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Marie Curie Individual Fellowship (H2020, European Commission), Grant/Award Number: 708530; Estonian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: IUT20-28; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange)",,67,15,15,8,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Threatened by a rapidly changing world, our soils suffer from degradation and biodiversity loss, making it increasingly important to understand the role of soil biodiversity in soil aggregation-a key parameter for soil sustainability. Here, we provide evidence of the contribution of soil biota to soil aggregation on macro-and microaggregate scales, and evaluate how specific traits, soil biota groups and species interactions contribute to this. We conducted a global meta-analysis comprising 279 soil biota species. Our study shows a clear positive effect of soil biota on soil aggregation, with bacteria and fungi generally appearing to be more important for soil aggregation than soil animals. Bacteria contribute strongly to both macro-and microaggregates while fungi strongly affect macroaggregation. Motility, body size and population density were important traits modulating effect sizes. Investigating species interactions across major taxonomic groups revealed their beneficial impact on soil aggregation. At the broadest level, our results highlight the need to consider biodiversity as a causal factor in soil aggregation. This will require a shift from the current management and physicochemical perspective to an approach that fully embraces the significance of soil organisms, their diversity and interactions.","[Lehmann, Anika; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Plant Ecol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Lehmann, Anika; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Zheng, Weishuang] Shandong Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Wenhuan West Rd 180, C-264209 Weihai, Shandong, Peoples R China","Lehmann, A (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Plant Ecol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Lehmann, A (reprint author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",lehmann.anika@googlemail.com,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RI 1815/16-1]; European Research Council Advanced GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [694368]; Federal Ministry for Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),We thank J.

In this study, we investigated the impacts of seven years of precipitation increment and nitrogen (N) addition on the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of AMF communities in a temperate steppe of northern China. Phylogenetic patterns were also used to elucidate the ecological processes structuring AMF communities. By 454-pyrosequencing, we detected a total of 71 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs), consisting mainly of Glomeraceae. In general, N addition reduced but precipitation increment increased AMF abundance including root colonization and fungal biomass. Nitrogen addition also decreased AMF alpha-diversity, including OTU richness, Chao 1 and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed that AMF community composition shifted in response to both N addition and precipitation increment. AMF communities were phylogenetically clustered across all experimental treatments, suggesting that environmental filtering was the primary driver of AMF community assembly. Taken together, these findings supported that both N and precipitation shaped the AMF communities, but not altered the ecological processes responsible for the assembly of AMF communities in the temperate steppe.

Using oak (Quercus robur) microcuttings (Clone DF159) inoculated with an ectomycorrhizal symbiont partner (Piloderma croceum), the present study investigated the impact of multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere on the carbon flow to the soil food web in a pulse-chase labelling experiment. Changes in plant biomass, microbial communities (soil phospholipid fatty acids - PLFAs) and Collembola lipid pattern (total lipid fatty acids - TLFAs) as well as the C-13 incorporation into fatty acids were assessed at 2, 5 and 20 days post labelling of oak microcuttings. Microcosms were inoculated with Pratylenchus penetrans (root-feeding nematode), Protaphorura armata (fungal-feeding Collembola) or their combination. The interaction of P. penetrans and P. armata synergistically reduced oak biomass. Both soil animals independently impacted growth of microorganisms in the rhizosphere, P. penetrans inhibited whilst P. armata promoted bacterial biomass. Irrespective of treatment and time, Gram-positive bacteria derived most of the recent photoassimilated oak carbon, with amounts ranging between 80 and 92% of the total C-13 allocated in microbial PLFAs. Presence of either P. armata or P. penetrans enhanced the incorporation of plant carbon in bacteria, whereas collective effects of these two functional groups was scarce. Predominantly the impact of the root-feeding nematode on belowground carbon flow diminished with time. In sum, root feeders and detritivores played independent roles in carbon allocation patterns and community structure of microorganisms in the rhizosphere of oaks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is uncertain if grassland soils will continue as C sinks in the future because climate change may affect the dynamic, belowground relationships among crown and root biomass, root chemistry and morphology, and root and soil decomposition, all of which influence C sequestration potential. To better understand future belowground C cycling in semiarid grasslands we analyzed three native species (Bouteloua gracilis, Carex eleocharis, and Pascopyrum smithii) and mixed grass community crown and root biomass, root chemistry, morphology, and decomposability, and soil organic carbon (SOC) priming following seven years of simulated climate change at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in Wyoming, USA. We found that individual species and the community respond uniquely to the climate change field treatments, indicating that species composition is important when analyzing climate change effects on grassland C cycling. Root biomass in the C3 sedge, C eleocharis, increased under elevated CO2, especially when combined with warming. Decomposition rates of roots from warming plots were higher than those from ambient plots for B. gracilis and P. smithii. Across species, root decomposition rates increased with C and N concentrations. Root morphology was altered as well: B. gracilis root diameter increased under warming, and P. smithii specific root length and surface area increased under elevated CO2. P. smthii roots induced short-term, negative SOC priming across all field treatments. Together, our results indicate that grass roots may play a critical role in maintaining soil C stocks in grasslands in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimation of biomass production is an important issue against the background of climate change and carbon storage. Even though many studies investigated the biomass productivity of trees or single compartments, only few considered the belowground biomass. Further, there is a lack of studies focusing on young trees and considering further influencing factors such as the prevailing stand density. In the present study, young Quercus robur trees were sampled on Nelder trials, which comprise different stand densities, on four European sites differing in climatic conditions. Besides the estimation of logarithmically transformed power equations, Dirichlet regressions were applied for deriving biomass functions for the single compartments leaves, branches, stem and roots. Thereby, the dependence of total and compartment biomass allocation on diameter at root collar (d (0)), tree height and stand density is tested. The results show that besides d (0), the local Stand Density Index (SDIl) is an important predictor for biomass. Especially, the belowground biomass shows a significant relation to the SDIl, which is less the case for the aboveground biomass. Not considering the SDIl leads to an overestimation of the biomass productivity, especially when the stand density is high. Furthermore, the results show that the belowground biomass is lower than the aboveground biomass, but with 50-80% of the aboveground biomass still of considerable size. This indicates the importance of including stand characteristics when estimating above- and belowground tree biomass in future studies.","[Dahlhausen, Jens; Uhl, Enno; Heym, Michael; Biber, Peter; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Ventura, Maurizio; Panzacchi, Pietro; Tonon, Giustino] Free Univ Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Univ Pl 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Horvath, Tamas] Univ West Hungary, Fac Forestry, Ady E U 5, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary","Dahlhausen, J (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Jens.Dahlhausen@lrz.tum.de; Enno.Uhl@lrz.tum.de; Michael.Heym@lrz.tum.de; Peter.Biber@lrz.tum.de; maurizio.ventura@unibz.it; Pietro.Panzacchi@unibz.it; giustino.tonon@unibz.it; horvath.tamas@nyme.hu; Hans.Pretzsch@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868","AUDI Stiftung fur Umwelt [5102150]; Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry [7831-23953-2014]","We thank AUDI AG, Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A., and AUDI HUNGARIA MOTOR Kft.

By contrast, vessel lumen area series contain common climatic signal of previous summer temperature. Drought events and the overuse of groundwater for water supply can cause significant declines of groundwater levels in naturally poorly drained forest stands. However, the documented growth reactions of trees to declines in groundwater level vary a lot and range from positive because of increased soil aeration to strongly negative because of drought stress. We analysed changes in tree-ring width and earlywood average vessel lumen area of Quercus robur from sites above an artesian aquifer, whose groundwater level declined in the late 1980s by about 5 m due to water pumping. Because we expected different responses of individual trees due to local microtopography and fine root distribution, we performed both site-level and tree-level analyses. Our results show that the site-level response of tree growth to groundwater-level pumping was not uniform. Individual trees were clustered into groups of drought-limited and water abundance-limited individuals. The response of trees to groundwater pumping differed between clusters-drought-sensitive trees responded negatively, whereas the growth of trees limited by water abundance remained stable or slightly increased. Inter-series correlation of drought-limited trees significantly increased in the period with the lowest groundwater level. In contrast to tree-ring widths, earlywood vessel lumen area series contained common temperature signal, with no imprint of groundwater-level alteration. Our results indicate that poorly drained forest ecosystems are characterized by a significantly individualistic response of radial growth to groundwater-level alteration. These individualistic responses could be, however, overshadowed in stand-level average tree-ring width chronologies.","[Tumajer, Jan; Treml, Vaclav] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Albertov 6, Prague 12843, Czech Republic","Tumajer, J (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Albertov 6, Prague 12843, Czech Republic.",tumajerj@natur.cuni.cz,"Tumajer, Jan/I-2053-2019; Treml, Vaclav/A-7508-2009","Tumajer, Jan/0000-0002-7773-7081; Treml, Vaclav/0000-0001-5067-3308","Grant Agency of Charles University [GAUK 174214]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [SVV 260078/2014]","This study was financially supported by the Grant Agency of Charles University (GAUK 174214: ""Using vessel parameters of broadleaved species in the research of natural processes"") and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (SVV 260078/2014: ""Research of dynamics of physical-geographical processes"").

The objectives of this study were to examine the impacts of glyphosate applications on symbiotic N-2 fixation in glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean and to evaluate the responses of rhizobial isolates and nifH gene abundance in the rhizosphere soil to glyphosate. In two repeated greenhouse experiments, GR soybean received foliar applications of glyphosate once or twice during the study period; the untreated GR and near-isogenic conventional cultivar served as controls. Plants were harvested twice, two days after each glyphosate application. In addition to plant growth parameters, the nitrogenase activity of root nodules and the abundance of the nifH gene in the rhizosphere were determined using the acetylene reduction assay and quantitative PCR, respectively. Glyphosate-treated GR soybean had lower chlorophyll content, root mass, nodule mass, total plant N, and nitrogenase activity than the untreated conventional cultivar, especially for the second harvest. Without glyphosate application, few differences were observed between the two cultivars. Glyphosate inhibited the growth of rhizobia isolated from root nodules; however, the nifH gene abundance in the rhizosphere was not different among the treatments. Glyphosate appeared to exert stress to the GR soybean cultivar used in this study. Further research is needed to verify the greenhouse experiment findings and possible yield effects under field conditions.","[Fan, Lu; Feng, Yucheng; Weaver, David B.; Delaney, Dennis P.; Wehtje, Glenn R.] Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Wang, Guoying] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Feng, YC (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",yfeng@auburn.edu,,,Alabama Soybean Producers [G00006769]; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station,"The authors wish to thank Roger Boerma and the University of Georgia Research Foundation for providing soybean seeds, Krishans Raghuveer for assistance with GC analysis, Michele Owsley and Rachel Sharpe for technical assistance, and Edzard van Santen for assistance with statistical analysis.

However, little is known about how AMF communities respond to gradient warming and grazing, especially winter grazing. In the present study, we conducted an experiment to examine the interaction between warming and winter grazing, simulated by clipping before the growing season, to measure changes in the AMF community across a warming gradient with and without winter clipping in an alpine meadow ecosystem. A total of 63 phylotypes of AMF were identified using 454 pyrosequencing. Both warming and clipping reduced AMF species richness, but had no additive negative effects. The clipping alone and the interaction between warming and clipping changed the AMF species composition, but not its phylogenetic composition. The phylogenetic structure of AMF communities were dramatically changed from phylogenetically random to convergent across our warming gradient under the unclipped treatments and were phylogenetically random in all treatments with clipping. Our findings suggest that the primary ecological processes determining AMF communities shift from stochastic processes to habitat filtering across our warming gradient under the unclipped treatments, whilst there was no such shift under the clipped treatments. This study highlights that the removal of standing dead biomass through winter grazing serves a key role in regulating soil microbial diversity in the much warmer world.","[Shi, Guoxi; Yao, Buqing; Zhao, Xinquan; Zhou, Huakun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Area Qinghai Prov, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Shi, Guoxi; Wang, Wenying] Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci & Geog, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongjun; Jiang, Shengjing; Pan, Jianbin; Feng, Huyuan] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, MOE Key Lab Cell Act & Stress Adaptat, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Feng, HY (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Room 408,Tianyan Bldg,Tianshui South Rd 222, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.; Zhou, HK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xinning Rd 23, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",shigx1986@163.com; bqyao@nwipb.cas.cn; fenghy@lzu.edu.cn; hkzhou@nwipb.cas.cn,,"Liu, Yongjun/0000-0002-2909-1730","National Natural Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500427, 31672475, 31670433, 31572354]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2016YFC0501901]; Province Natural Foundation of Qinghai [2016-ZJ-957Q]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M582735]; Qinghai innovation platform construction project [2017-ZJ-Y20]","We thank Dr. Zhen Ma, Chunhui Zhang, and others in our team for assistance in both the field and laboratory.

The development of Technosols from anthropogenic materials and growth of native metal-tolerant plant species could be a sustainable strategy to minimize such risks. In this study, a 10-month pot experiment was carried out with Technosols developed from acidic tailings amended with marble waste (CaCO3) and two rates of biochar (10 g C kg(-1) and 20 g C kg(-1)), with and without Piptatheiwn miliaceum. The main aims were to assess if biochar addition influenced plant metal uptake, increased soil aggregation, decreased metal mobility and enhanced plant growth. In addition, we assessed if the presence of P. miliaceum improved soil structure, stimulated microbial communities, and increased metal immobilization. Biochar and CaCO3 additions were the main factors responsible for add neutralization. However, the growth of P. miliaceum also contributed to increase soil pH, likely due to increases in electrical conductivity. High organic matter recalcitrance with low content of labile and soluble organic compounds was observed in the developed Technosols. The presence of P. miliaceum positively stimulated microbial biomass and enzyme activities, and contributed to significantly increase the ratio recalcitrant C-to-recalcitrant N. This suggests an effect of rhizosphere in soil organic matter stabilization and degradation. Thus, microorganisms degrade N functional groups in biochar more easily than C functional groups. Greenhouse gas emissions were not increased by addition of biochar. Methane emissions decreased, with no effect of plant growth. The use of biochar and marble waste reduced the mobility of metal(loid)s due to increase in pH, and the presence of plant increased the fraction of Cd retained in Fe/Mn oxides. Plants showed low metal(loid) uptake in shoots, with no effect of biochar rate. Technosols showed higher proportion of macro and microaggregates than original tailings. The presence of plant significantly contributed to increase the proportion of microaggregates. The highest rate of biochar had a negative effect on P. miliaceum biomass which resulted in limited growth compared with the lower biochar rate.","[Moreno-Barriga, Fabian; Faz, Angel; Acosta, Jose A.; Soriano-Disla, Martin; Martinez-Martinez, Silvia; Zornoza, Raul] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Sustainable Use Management & Reclamat Soil & Wate, Paseo Alfonso XIII 48, Cartagena 30203, Spain","Zornoza, R (reprint author), Univ Politecn Cartagena, Sustainable Use Management & Reclamat Soil & Wate, Paseo Alfonso XIII 48, Cartagena 30203, Spain.",raul.zornoza@upct.es,"Acosta, Jose/K-8036-2017","Acosta, Jose/0000-0003-3203-4267","Fundacion Seneca (Agency of Science and Technology of the Region of Murcia, Spain)Fundacion Seneca [18920/JLI/13]","This work was supported by Fundacion Seneca (Agency of Science and Technology of the Region of Murcia, Spain) [grant number 18920/JLI/13].",,98,11,11,5,61,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,1-Dec,2017,307,,,,,,159,171,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.07.040,,,13,Soil Science,Agriculture,FI5PF,WOS:000412035600018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Apostolakis, A; Panakoulia, S; Nikolaidis, NP; Paranychianakis, NV",,,,"Apostolakis, Antonios; Panakoulia, Sotiria; Nikolaidis, Nikolaos P.; Paranychianakis, Nikolaos V.",,,Shifts in soil structure and soil organic matter in a chronosequence of set aside fields,SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dzylands; Aggregates; Fertility restoration; C sequestration; CAST model,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; AGGREGATION; STABILIZATION; FRACTIONS; TILLAGE; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS,"Set-aside is a commonly used practice worldwide to improve soil quality and fertility. However, the benefits of set-aside have not been quantified in a detailed manner and particularly in semi-arid environments where primary production, and hence C inputs to the soil, is constrained by water availability. Using a chronosequence of set-aside fields (0, 6 and 50 years), data were collected regarding the soil structure, addressed with the distribution of aggregate size classes, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen content at the surface soil layer (0-15 cm). Soil structure showed a rapid recovery in the 6-years set-aside field and approached the levels of 50-years set-aside field. The recovery of soil structure, however, was not accompanied by a significant increase in bulk soil or in any aggregate size class SOC. In the 50-years set-aside field, the SOC content was 62% higher compared to the 0-years and 6-years set-aside fields. In this field the SOC content reached identical contents in all aggregate size classes except for the silt-clay fraction. In the latter, lower SOC content was assessed which did not differ from the 0-years and 6-years set-aside fields. In a following step, the Carbon, Aggregation, and Structure Turnover (CAST) model was employed to simulate the evolution of soil structure and C sequestration with time. Overall, the CAST model successfully simulated the evolution of soil structure and SOC stocks and provided critical information about the time required to approach the optimum thresholds under the prevailing environmental conditions. The estimated low rates of C sequestration question the effectiveness of the set-aside practice to restore soil fertility in semi-arid environments. These findings outline the need to evaluate additional practices and/or combinations of practices (e.g addition of organic amendments) to improve its effectiveness. Future work should aim to evaluate such practices considering climatic constraints and soil properties.","[Apostolakis, Antonios; Panakoulia, Sotiria; Nikolaidis, Nikolaos P.; Paranychianakis, Nikolaos V.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece","Paranychianakis, NV (reprint author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece.",niko.paranychianakis@enveng.tuc.gr,,"Nikolaidis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-6223-7519",,,,42,0,0,1,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,DEC,2017,174,,,,,,113,119,,10.1016/j.still.2017.07.004,,,7,Soil Science,Agriculture,FI8PY,WOS:000412265800012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rodriguez-Robles, U; Arredondo, T; Huber-Sannwald, E; Ramos-Leal, JA; Yepez, EA",,,,"Rodriguez-Robles, Ulises; Arredondo, Tulio; Huber-Sannwald, Elisabeth; Ramos-Leal, Jose Alfredo; Yepez, Enrico A.",,,Technical note: Application of geophysical tools for tree root studies in forest ecosystems in complex soils,BIOGEOSCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY; HYDRAULIC REDISTRIBUTION; NORTHERN YUCATAN; KARST FEATURES; WATER; SHALLOW; BIOMASS; MEXICO; SUBSURFACE,"While semiarid forests frequently colonize rocky substrates, knowledge is scarce on how roots garner resources in these extreme habitats. The Sierra San Miguelito Volcanic Complex in central Mexico exhibits shallow soils and impermeable rhyolitic-rock outcrops, which impede water movement and root placement beyond the soil matrix. However, rock fractures, exfoliated rocks and soil pockets potentially permit downward water percolation and root growth. With ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), two geophysical methods advocated by Jayawickreme et al. (2014) to advance root ecology, we advanced in the method development studying root and water distribution in shallow rocky soils and rock fractures in a semiarid forest. We calibrated geophysical images with in situ root measurements, and then extrapolated root distribution over larger areas. Using GPR shielded antennas, we identified both fine and coarse pine and oak roots from 0.6 to 7.5 cm diameter at different depths into either soil or rock fractures. We also detected, trees anchoring their trunks using coarse roots underneath rock outcroppings. With ERT, we tracked monthly changes in humidity at the soil-bedrock interface, which clearly explained spatial root distribution of both tree species. Geophysical methods have enormous potential in elucidating root ecology. More interdisciplinary research could advance our understanding in belowground eco-logical niche functions and their role in forest ecohydrology and productivity.","[Rodriguez-Robles, Ulises; Arredondo, Tulio; Huber-Sannwald, Elisabeth] Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol, Div Ciencias Ambientales, Camino Presa San Jose 2055,Lomas 4ta Secc, San Luis Potosi 78216, Slp, Mexico; [Ramos-Leal, Jose Alfredo] Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol, Div Geociencias Aplicadas, Camino Presa San Jose 2055,Lomas 4ta Secc, San Luis Potosi 78216, Slp, Mexico; [Yepez, Enrico A.] Inst Tecnol Sonora, Dept Ciencias Agua & Medio Ambiente, 5 Febrero 818 Sur, Obregon 8500, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Robles, Ulises] Colegio Frontera Sur, Catedras CONACyT, Villahermosa, Mexico","Arredondo, T (reprint author), Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol, Div Ciencias Ambientales, Camino Presa San Jose 2055,Lomas 4ta Secc, San Luis Potosi 78216, Slp, Mexico.",tulio@ipicyt.edu.mx,"Robles, Ulises Rodriguez/T-7692-2018; Ramos-Leal, Jose Alfredo/M-7731-2017; Yepez, Enrico A./C-2802-2014","Robles, Ulises Rodriguez/0000-0001-5667-8898; Ramos-Leal, Jose Alfredo/0000-0003-4715-7411; Yepez, Enrico A./0000-0003-4746-573X","National Council for Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [332356]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [220788, 224368]","We thank Alejandro Cruz Rosas Palafox for technical advice on the use of the ERT equipment.

Currently, for rubber-based systems, none of the allometric equations takes environmental factors (e.g. climate, topographic condition, soil properties, and management scheme) into consideration to allow pan-tropical usage. Against this background, 30 rubber trees with a root profile of up to 2 m were destructively harvested and 882 rubber trees were measured non-destructively in 27 plots, covering rotation lengths of 4-35 years, elevation gradients of 621-1127 m, and locally used clone types (GT1, PRIM600, Yunyan77-4) in mountainous South Western China. Allometric equations for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimations considering diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), and wood density were superior to other equations. A simpler model with similar performance (AGB = 0.0419DBH(2.316)H(0.478)) can be used if tree-specific wood density is not available. For belowground biomass (BGB) a model using only DBH can provide a robust prediction (BGB = 0.207DBH(1.668)). We also tested goodness of fit for the recently proposed pan-tropical forest model, which includes a bioclimatic factor E, combining indices of temperature and precipitation variability and drought intensity. Prediction of AGB by the model calibrated with the harvested rubber tree biomass and wood density was more accurate than the results produced by the pan-tropical forest model adjusted to local conditions. The relationships between DBH and height and between DBH and biomass were influenced by tapping, therefore biomass and C stock calculations for rubber have to be done using species-specific allometric equations. Based on the analysis of environmental factors acting at the landscape level, we found that above- and belowground carbon stocks were mostly affected by stand age, soil clay content, aspect, and planting density. Increasing planting density to > 570 trees per ha according to the regional plantation management strategy had a negative impact on aboveground carbon stock of old rubber plantations. The integration of bioclimatic and regional management factors is a further approach to build widely applicable biomass models for pan-tropical rubber-based systems. The results of this study provide reference for reliable carbon accounting in other rubber-cultivated regions.","[Yang, Xueqing; Blagodatsky, Sergey; Cadisch, Georg] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Garbenstr 13, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Yang, Xueqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Div & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xueqing; Xu, Jianchu] Kunming Inst Bot, China & East Asia Off Co, World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lanhei Rd 132, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Blagodatsky, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Liu, Feng] Bur Naban River Nat Reserve, Yuanlirt Alley 19, Jinghorzg 666100, Peoples R China; [Beckschaefer, Philip] Univ Gottingen, Chair Forest Inventory & Remote Sensing, Busgenweg 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Blagodatsky, S (reprint author), Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, Garbenstr 13, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",sblag@mail.ru,"Blagodatsky, Sergey/F-2734-2010; Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019","Blagodatsky, Sergey/0000-0003-1428-6014; ",German-Chinese joint project SURUMER (Sustainable Rubber Cultivation in the Mekong Region) - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [FKZ 01LL0919]; German BMZ/GIZ-funded Green Rubber project [13.1432.7-001.00],"The study was supported by the German-Chinese joint project SURUMER (Sustainable Rubber Cultivation in the Mekong Region), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant number FKZ 01LL0919 and by the German BMZ/GIZ-funded Green Rubber project with the project number #13.1432.7-001.00.

An archipelago is featured by distinct and unique gradients between and within islands. The multiple gradient effects on the island ecosystem are worth exploring. We established a multiple gradient system comprising natural, human, and ecological gradients in island and site scales. The natural gradients consist of island area, shape, and distance to mainland in island scale, and terrain and distance to shoreline in site scale; the human gradients include population and exploitation in island scale, and distance to hardened ground in site scale; and the ecological gradients are composed of community type, biomass, biodiversity, and soil physical-chemical properties in site scale. SMB, including SMB carbon (SMBC), SMB nitrogen (SMBN), and SMB phosphorus (SMBP), was used to verify the multiple gradient effects on the island ecosystem, and the northern Miaodao Archipelago in North China was selected as the study area. Results revealed that SMB exhibited distinct spatial heterogeneities. SMBC was sensitive to the natural and human gradients in both scales; SMBN was influenced by parts of natural, human, and ecological gradients in both scales; and SMBP did not show regular changes along the gradients in island scale, yet responded sensitively to the ecological gradients in site scale. The multiple gradient system is unique and fundamental in the spatial heterogeneities of the island ecosystem, and fully revealing the multiple gradient effects is essential for reasonable island conservation and exploitation.","[Chi, Yuan; Shi, Honghua; Zheng, Wei] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chi, Yuan; Shi, Honghua] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jingkuan] Binzhou Univ, Shandong Prov Key Lab Ecoenvironm Sci Yellow Rive, Binzhou 256603, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shi, HH (reprint author), State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, 6 Xianxialing Rd, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China.",shihonghuafio@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41701214]; East Asia Marine Cooperation Platform of China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund [YZ0416003]; Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean of China [201505012],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41701214), the East Asia Marine Cooperation Platform of China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund (YZ0416003) and the Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean of China (Nos. 201505012).

To more accurately model rates of decay, fine root heterogeneity needs to be addressed in fine root decomposition studies. Branching order integrates both structural and chemical properties that are important in indicating litter quality and decay rate. We discuss current views on the controls and patterns of fine root decomposition in combination with recent findings related to the effects of branching order and mycorrhizal decomposition. We examine the counterintuitive finding that nitrogen rich, lower order roots decompose more slowly than woody, higher order roots in temperate and sub-tropical forests. We posit that slower decomposition of first and second compared to higher order roots might be caused by the poor carbon quality associated with higher concentrations of phenols in lower order roots or by inhibition of saprophytes by the mycorrhizal fungi that often preferentially inhabit these roots. Alternatively, apparent recalcitrance of lower order roots could be an experimental artifact caused by severing pre-mortem mycelial connections during sample processing, or exclusion of animals that graze fungal structures by the small mesh sizes characteristic of litterbags. To better predict the residence time of the carbon contained in the entire fine root pool, existing methods should be applied to individual root orders when practical. New methods for characterizing decomposition of undisturbed roots that have senesced naturally are greatly needed.","[Beidler, Katilyn V.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Jordan Hall,Room 234,1001 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Beidler, Katilyn V.; Pritchard, Seth G.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29401 USA","Beidler, KV (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Jordan Hall,Room 234,1001 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kbeidler@indiana.edu,,,,,,177,9,9,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2017,420,2-Jan,,,,,19,36,,10.1007/s11104-017-3393-8,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FO5AM,WOS:000416861200002,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Sun, JF; Xia, ZW; He, TX; Dai, WW; Peng, B; Liu, J; Gao, DC; Jiang, P; Han, SJ; Bai, E",,,,"Sun, Jianfei; Xia, Zongwei; He, Tongxin; Dai, Weiwei; Peng, Bo; Liu, Jun; Gao, Decai; Jiang, Ping; Han, Shijie; Bai, Edith",,,Ten years of elevated CO2 affects soil greenhouse gas fluxes in an open top chamber experiment,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Global warming potential; Microbial community composition; Ammonia oxidizing archaea and methanotrophs; Methane uptake; Nitrous oxide emission; Quercus mongolica,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; N2O EMISSIONS; FOREST SOILS; CHLOROFORM FUMIGATION; METHANE OXIDATION; N AVAILABILITY; SCALE ANALYSIS,"The production and consumption of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in soils are largely regulated by biological processes. Increasing atmospheric CO2 may alter these processes, thereby affecting GHG emissions and their feedbacks to climate. Here, we used an open top chamber (OTC) experiment to examine the effects of elevated CO2 for ten years on soil GHG fluxes in a Quercus mongolica dominated system in northeastern China. Our results showed that elevated CO2 increased soil CO2 emissions, consistent with increased microbial biomass and the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Additionally, elevated CO2 increased CH4 uptake due to stimulated growth of methanotrophs. The seasonal mean soil N2O flux was not changed by elevated CO2, consistent with unchanged ammonia oxidizing bacteria, archaea and denitrifiers, which was probably due to large variations between the individual OTCs and with time. However, seasonal cumulative soil N2O emissions increased by 64.7% under elevated CO2. Our results also hinted that nitrification by ammonia oxidizing archaea was the major process of soil N2O emissions. In our study elevated CO2 increased soil GHG emissions and the cumulative global warming potential by 27.8%, causing an important positive feedback to climate change.","[Sun, Jianfei; Xia, Zongwei; Dai, Weiwei; Peng, Bo; Liu, Jun; Gao, Decai; Jiang, Ping; Han, Shijie] Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jianfei; He, Tongxin] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Change & Resources Use Beibu Gul, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jianfei; He, Tongxin] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Intelligent, 175 Mingxiu East Rd, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China; [Bai, Edith] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, 5268 Renmin Rd, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China","Bai, E (reprint author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, 5268 Renmin Rd, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",baie@iae.ac.cn,,"liu, jun/0000-0001-9311-1874","Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954400]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31522010]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC006]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010301]","This study was supported by the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program) (2014CB954400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31522010) and Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDB-SSW-DQC006) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15010301).

We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analyses to develop the specific primers and applied the qPCR method to determine the belowground diversity of fine roots in soil samples collected from field tree clusters containing different species. Specific primers were successfully developed to identify six tree species. The relative proportions of each species in known fine-root mixtures predicted by the qPCR method agreed well (r (2) > 0.86, P < 0.001) with the actual relative proportions of the corresponding species. All aboveground tree species in belowground fine-root samples were detected.

Several associations were observed between mycorrhizal type and leaf traits directly linked to flammability measures, including specific leaf area, leaf mass, leaf moisture content, and leaf chemistry. The observed patterns suggest that interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and their host plants during the growth and senescence of leaves may have subsequent effects on fire processes.

Over time, natural selection should favour the benefit strategy that confers the highest fitness, eroding genetic variation in partner quality. Yet abundant genetic variation in partner quality exists in many systems (Heath & Stinchcombe, 2014). One possible resolution to this puzzle is that the genetic identity of both a host and its partner affects the benefits each mutualist provides to the other, a pattern known as a genotype-by-genotype interaction (Figure 1). Mounting evidence suggests that genotype-by-genotype interactions between partners are pervasive at the phenotypic level (Barrett, Zee, Bever, Miller, & Thrall, 2016; Heath, 2010; Hoeksema & Thompson, 2007). Ultimately, however, to link these phenotypic patterns to the maintenance of genetic variation in mutualisms we need to answer two questions: How much variation in mutualism phenotypes is attributable to genotype-by-genotype interactions, and what mutualistic functions are influenced by each partner and by the interaction between their genomes? In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Burghardt et al. (2017) use transcriptomics to address both questions in the legume-rhizobia mutualism.","[Wood, Corlett W.; Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Koffler Sci Reserve, Toronto, ON, Canada","Wood, CW (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada.",corlett.wood@utoronto.ca,,,,,,8,2,2,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Functional root traits are becoming a key measure in plant ecology, and root length measurements are needed for the calculation of root traits. Several methods are used to estimate the total root length (TRL) of washed root samples [e.g. modified line intersect (LI) method, WinRHIZO(TM) and IJ_Rhizo], but no standardized comparison of methods exists. 2. We used a set of digital images of unstained root samples to compare measurements given by the LI method and automated methods provided by WinRHIZO(TM) and IJ_Rhizo. Linear regression models were used to detect bias. Both linear regression models and the Bland-Altman`s method of differences were used to evaluate the accuracy of eight methods (1 manual, 2 semi-automated and 5 automated) in comparison with a reference method that avoided root detection errors. 3. Length measurements were highly correlated, but did not exactly agree with each other in 11 of 12 method comparisons. All tested methods tended to underestimate the TRL of unstained root samples. The accuracy of WinRHIZO(TM) was influenced by the thresholding method and the root length density (RLD) in the pictures. For the other methods, no linear relationship was found between accuracy and RLD. With WinRHIZO(TM) (global thresholding + pixel reclassification; RLD=1cmcm(-2)), the Regent's method and the Tennant's method underestimated the TRL by 7.06.2% and 4.7 +/- 7.9%, respectively. The LI method gave satisfactory results on average (underestimation: 4.2 +/- 6.0%), but our results suggest that it can lead to inaccurate estimations for single images. In IJ_Rhizo, the Kimura method was the best and underestimated the TRL by 5.4 +/- 6.1%. 4. Our results showed that care must be taken when comparing measurements acquired with different methods because they can lead to different results. When acquiring root images, we advise to (i) increase the contrast between fine roots and background by staining the roots, and (ii) avoid overlapping roots by not exceeding a RLD of 1cm cm(-2). Under these conditions, good length estimates can be obtained with WinRHIZO(TM) (global thresholding + pixel reclassification). The Kimura method in IJ_Rhizo can be an alternative to WinRHIZO(TM).","[Delory, Benjamin M.; Weidlich, Emanuela W.

Electrochemical results confirmed power generation by the Sedum species tested, with reactors using Sedum hybridum achieving the highest power density (92 mu Wm(-2)), followed by reactors tested with S. rupestre (15.5 mu Wm(-2)). The lowest performance was observed in systems using S. spurium (< 1 mu Wm(-2)). Total organic carbon from root exudates did not have a direct effect on PMFCs performance. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed higher abundance of bacteria in the family Micrococcaceae in anodic biofilms of S. hybridum (13.47 +/- 2.69%) reactors than in biofilms of S. rupestre (2.28 +/- 0.52%), and S. spurium (2.29 +/- 1.94%) PMFCs. Although the current magnitudes observed in our study were lower than those reported for flooded PMFCs, a positive relationship between water content of plant growth media and power outputs was observed. After irrigation, current and water gradually decrease over time with a similar rate, showing a correlation coefficient between both variables of 0.95 +/- 0.01. Moreover, it encourages further testing of PMCFs as potential indicators of soil water content in semiarid green roofs where a better water-use efficiency is needed.","[Tapia, Natalia F.; Bonilla, Carlos A.; Vargas, Ignacio T.] Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable CEDEUS, Santiago, Chile; [Tapia, Natalia F.; Bonilla, Carlos A.; Vargas, Ignacio T.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Rojas, Claudia] Univ OHiggins, Inst Agr Sci, Rancagua, Chile","Vargas, IT (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",itvargas@ing.puc.cl,"Vargas, Ignacio/B-5954-2014; Bonilla, Carlos A/A-1676-2013","Vargas, Ignacio/0000-0001-5974-2795; Rojas-Alvarado, Claudia/0000-0001-7727-2862",CEDEUS center [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110020],"This work is part of the microbial fuel cells project in CEDEUS (Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable), in which we want to acknowledge Dr. Sergio Vera's team for their help and for the access to the Laboratorio de Infraestructura Vegetal (LIVE).

While much research has documented the impact of invaders on native communities and ecosystem services, there has been less work quantifying how invasion affects the genetic composition of native populations. That is, when invaders dominate a community, can they shift selection regimes and impact the evolutionary trajectory of native populations? 2. The invasion of the annual grass Bromus tectorum in the Intermountain West provides an opportunity to quantify the effects of invasion on natural selection in wild populations. The shift from a perennial-dominated native community to one dominated by a highly competitive annual species alters the timing and intensity of competitive pressure, which has the potential to strongly shift selection regimes for native plants. 3. To quantify traits under selection in contrasting environments, we planted seeds of two native perennial grasses, Elymus multisetus and Poa secunda, into three invaded, invaded but weeded and relatively uninvaded sagebrush systems. We quantified phenotypic traits of seedlings from separate maternal plants, describing differences in phenotypes among individuals. We then asked which traits were associated with survival and plant size in adjacent invaded and uninvaded sagebrush systems, following individual seed performance for 3 years. 4. We found evidence for divergent selection between invaded and uninvaded sagebrush systems, with contrasting phenotypic traits associated with greater survival or plant size in these different growing conditions at all three field sites. For example, at one field site, P. secunda families with higher root tip production were more likely to survive in invaded and weeded environments, but this was not the case in uninvaded environments. Similarly, for E. multisetus, root mass fraction, seed mass and allocation to coarse or fine roots affected survival and plant size, again with contrasting relationships across invaded, weeded or uninvaded environments. 5. Synthesis. Impacts of invasive species extend beyond ecosystem and community composition changes and can affect the evolutionary trajectory of native populations. By quantifying natural selection in invaded landscapes, we identified phenotypic traits that are potentially adaptive in these invaded systems. Importantly, these traits differed from traits associated with success in uninvaded communities. This insight into adaptive, contemporary evolution in native species can guide restoration and conservation efforts.","[Leger, Elizabeth A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Mail Stop 186,1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Goergen, Erin M.] St Petersburg Coll, Dept Nat Sci, 2465 Drew St, Clearwater, FL 33765 USA","Leger, EA (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Mail Stop 186,1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",eleger@cabnr.unr.edu,,"Goergen, Erin/0000-0002-8489-9839","USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NEV052XDA, NEV052TH]; University of Nevada, Reno","We thank Erin Espeland for assistance finding field sites and collecting seeds and plants used to produce seed for these experiments, Sandra Li for her help with field monitoring, and Alison Philips and Courtney Rowe for overseeing seedling experiments that provided seed and seeding phenotypic traits for this study.

Impacts of invasive species may change in magnitude and even direction with invasion age. Impacts could increase as the population increases, individuals grow in size and ecological changes accumulate. 2. We used a chronosequence approach to characterize the development of soil impacts over time following the invasion of Cytisus scoparius, a widespread nitrogen-fixing shrub thought to limit reforestation success. In a greenhouse experiment, we evaluated how abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi, Douglas-fir performance and leaf nitrogen changed across a 3- to 31-year chronosequence of invasion. Each of the chronosequence sites were clearcuts where reforestation efforts were unsuccessful and where C. scoparius invaded. To estimate the contributions of the invasion separately from contributions of the accompanying disturbance, i.e. deforestation, we included soils from both invaded and uninvaded patches in each site of the chronosequence. In a complementary soil conditioning experiment, we examined the separate effects of host absence and invader presence on the mycorrhizal mutualism, leaf nitrogen and seedling growth. 3. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was lower in invaded soil, but this effect did not intensify with time. Despite the suppression of the mutualism, Douglas-fir grew larger in invaded soils. This positive response is likely due to nitrogen fertilization, a conclusion supported by higher concentrations of leaf nitrogen of Douglas-fir grown in invaded soils. While leaf N concentration increased with invasion duration, Douglas-fir survival and growth did not. 4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that soil impacts of an invader can develop rapidly and can be surprisingly stable over time. In such systems, recently invaded areas may be as difficult to restore as long-invaded areas, especially where ectomycorrhizal fungi are important drivers of reforestation success. More chronosequence studies or long time series are needed to evaluate whether this is a general pattern.","[Grove, Sara; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Grove, Sara; Haubensak, Karen A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Grove, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Grove, S (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",sgrove@ucsc.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1210661, DEB 1354985]; Plant Ecology and Evolution; American Association of University Women; California Native Plant Society; University of California President's Dissertation Year FellowshipUniversity of California System; UCSC Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology; STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research; Hardman Fund; Northern California Botanists; Marilyn and Raymond Davis Fund","We thank Christina Kellum and Mark Thibo at Wa-DNR and Jeff Foster and Nancy Benson at JBLM for help with field and GIS support.

Recent global trends of increasing woody plant abundance in grass-dominated ecosystems may substantially enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and could represent a strong carbon (C) sink in the terrestrial environment. However, few studies have quantitatively addressed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and soil properties on SOC storage at the landscape scale. In addition, most studies assessing SOC response to woody encroachment consider only surface soils, and have not explicitly assessed the extent to which deeper portions of the soil profile may be sequestering C. 2. We quantified the direction, magnitude and pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC in the upper 1.2 m of the profile following woody encroachment via spatially specific intensive soil sampling across a landscape in a subtropical savanna in the Rio Grande Plains, USA, that has undergone woody proliferation during the past century. 3. Increased SOC accumulation following woody encroachment was observed to considerable depth, albeit at reduced magnitudes in deeper portions of the profile. Overall, woody clusters and groves accumulated 12.87 and 18.67 Mg Cha(-1) more SOC compared to grasslands to a depth of 1.2 m. 4. Woody encroachment significantly altered the pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC to a depth of 5 cm, with marginal effect at 5-15 cm, and no significant impact on soils below 15 cm. Fine root density explained greater variability of SOC in the upper 15 cm, while a combination of fine root density and soil clay content accounted for more of the variation in SOC in soils below 15 cm across this landscape. 5. Synthesis. Substantial soil organic carbon sequestration can occur in deeper portions of the soil profile following woody encroachment. Furthermore, vegetation patterns and soil properties influenced the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in this landscape, highlighting the need for spatially specific sampling that can characterize this variability and enable scaling and modelling. Given the geographic extent of woody encroachment on a global scale, this undocumented deep soil carbon sequestration suggests this vegetation change may play a more significant role in regional and global carbon sequestration than previously thought.","[Zhou, Yong; Boutton, Thomas W.; Ben Wu, X.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Zhou, Y (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",zhouyong1222@tamu.edu,"Boutton, Thomas W./C-5821-2016; Zhou, Yong/B-9795-2017; Zhou, Yong/H-9048-2019; Wu, X.

To date, there have been few studies of AMF biodiversity in Iran, especially in the western forests of the country. For this study, soil and root samples were taken from A. scoparia rhizosphere soil in spring and autumn. Almost half of the root length was colonized by AMF. We identified 13 AMF species belonging to Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae or Diversisporaceae. The three plantations differed in terms of soil electrical conductivity, organic C and P. Spore density was significant correlated with P concentration. Root length colonization was correlated only with soil Ca. Species diversity and richness were significantly correlated with soil N, P, organic C and spore density. AMF diversity in 15-year-old plantations was more similar to that in the natural stand than in the 10-year-old plantation. We confirmed that a 15-year-old plantation is not similar in terms of AMF colonization to natural stands. We conclude that more than 15 years are required for AMF colonization of plantations to resemble that of natural stands.","[Mirzaei, Javad] Univ Ilam, Dept Forest Sci, Fac Agr, POB 69315516, Ilam, Iran; [Moradi, Mostafa] Behbahan Khatam Al Anbia Univ Technol, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Forestry, POB 6361647189, Behbahan, Khuzestan, Iran","Mirzaei, J (reprint author), Univ Ilam, Dept Forest Sci, Fac Agr, POB 69315516, Ilam, Iran.",azongo@hotmail.fr,,"Moradi, Mostafa/0000-0002-1216-3531",Ilam University [32.1164],This study was funded by the Ilam University (Grant No. 32.1164.).,,44,0,1,0,6,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

Within the root system, exudation rates are not homogenous; often the sites of exudation are spatially constrained to different morphologies. Younger roots, root tips and the fine root fraction are likely the primary sites of exudation, yet few studies have tracked heterogeneities in exudation quantity and quality within the root system. Understanding the vertical gradients in exudation is important for properly representing the interfacial area with the anaerobic zone, and correctly estimating the flux of C compounds available to the methanogenic community. Root exudates from Eriophorum vaginatum and Rhododendron groenlandicum, grown in ombrotrophic bog cores removed from the field, were sampled by placing individual root segments of excavated roots into custom-designed root traps. Root extracts were also collected to profile the internal cell concentration. Total root exudation rates for all identified compounds varied by species, with exudation by E. vaginatum totaling 205.9 nmol g(-1) dry weight hr(-1) compared to 365.2 nmol g(-1) dry weight hr(-1) for R. groenlandicum. For each species, variations in root extract and root exudation rates between identified root classes were statistically significant for a number of compounds, often sugars, lactate, malate, oxalate, succinate and tartarate. The strong dependence of exudation on root morphology was confirmed by TOC analysis, which revealed that carbon exudation in E. vaginatum root classes ranged from 1.24 to 2.55 mu g C g(-1) d.wt. hr(-1) between immature and senior roots, whereas non-haired R. groenlandicum roots had relatively low exudation rates between 0.22 and 0.56 mu g C g(-1) d.wt. hr(-1) compared to 18.22 and 10.47 mu g C g(-1) mu g C hr(-1) for fine and coarse haired roots. These finding document important composition differences between bog species and considerable variability in exudates rates between R. groenlandicum root morphologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

European earthworm invasion into temperate deciduous forests in North America has been shown to alter microbial biomass in the soil and reduce the fungi-to-bacteria ratios. It is unclear how changes in earthworm species composition due to interspecific competition may alter this dynamics, especially under the ongoing invasion by Asian Amynthas and Metaphire species. Furthermore, it is also poorly understood how interspecific interactions involving different species may have species-dependent, non-additive effects on different groups of soil microorganisms. By conducting a two-year field experiment in a deciduous forest in the Mid-Atlantic, we examined how the Asian species Amynthas agrestis and Amynthas corticis, the European species Lumbricus rubellus and Octolctsion lacteum, and their interactions affect soil microbial communities, and tested the hypotheses that the Asian species and the interaction between the two European species negatively affect bacterial biomass. We showed that while A. corticis generally had no effect on soil microorganisms, A. agrestis had a positive effect on microbial biomass, primarily by increasing the biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Consistent with our hypothesis, the interaction between L. rubellus and O. lacteum had a negative effect on bacteria biomass. We concluded that the ongoing invasion of the Asian earthworm A. agrestis in forest soils and potential displacement of L rubellus due to interspecific competition may lead to increased bacterial biomass through increasing resource availability and disrupting the interaction between L rubellus and O. lacteum, potentially causing increased carbon mineralization and reducing soil carbon storage.

Though the effect of root distribution characteristics has been studied a lot, the spatial interaction mechanisms of soil-root blocks on pull-out tests around the tree stem are still poorly understood. This paper aims to analyze the effect of root spatial distribution and properties on the behavior of soil resistance around the tree stem by field pull-out tests on a slope covered by Vitex negundo L. var. heterophylla. The relationships between the pull-out strengths and root properties at different positions were compared; and the branch root mechanics were used to explore the correlation between root spatial distribution and soil resistance behavior. The results show that roots evenly distribute in a 0.7 m radius around the main stem. In the position on both sides of the pull-out direction, coarse roots are mainly located near the main stem, while fine roots are farther. Roots develop the highest soil resistance of 2207 N with respect to the pull out direction and 508 N against the pull-out direction. When a higher number of roots with diameter < 5 mm and longer length are located in the front of the tree stem and a higher number of roots with diameter > 5 mm behind the tree stem, the soil resistance are much greater. Branching points have little impact on pull-out strength. Besides, friction at the root-soil interface in either along or against the pull-out direction is greater than bilateral direction of the tree stem.

We examined seedling responses of the common and increasingly dominant species Acer rubrum (red maple) to the combined effects of soil warming (+5 degrees C), chronic nitrogen fertilization (+ 50 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)), and invasion by the phytotoxic plant Allictria petiolata (garlic mustard), and their interactions. We planted 296 first-year A. rubrum seedlings in a multifactorial field experiment to examine the effects of all combinations of the experimental treatments. Second-year Acer rubrum seedlings demonstrated higher aboveground growth under soil warming conditions. Further, soil warming positively influenced plant soil feedbacks through higher arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in fine roots. However, the positive growth responses and mycorrhizal colonization observed under soil warming were moderated by both N fertilization and A. petiolata invasion. Our results highlight the importance of developing management plans that consider how multiple environmental change factors affect tree seedling performance, particularly via the plant-soil interface.","[Wheeler, J.

KARST.; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; PICEA-ABIES; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SCOTS PINE; TREE GROWTH; AMINO-ACID,"The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management. The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N % of litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part of themor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites, respectively. Nitrogen-rich and-poor sites thus differ in the sizes of the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool turns over faster in N -rich systems because the microbes are more limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for available N. Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is further down the soil profile, whereectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds). Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N. In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous dwarf shrubs, are excluded. With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance. Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4+ released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with leaching of nitrate (NO) and gaseous N losses through denitrification. These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model). With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Ecosystem modelling and life cycle assessment tools were used to calculate the mitigation potential in substituting fossil materials and energy, expressed as the net CO2 exchange. Currently recommended management targeting to timber production acted as a baseline management. Alternative management included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking in forests and final felling made at lower breast height diameter than used in the baseline. In alternative management scenarios, logging residues and logging residues with coarse roots and stumps were harvested in final felling in addition to timber. The net CO2 exchange in the southern and eastern sub-regions was higher compared to the western one due to higher net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) over the study period. Maintaining higher stocking with earlier final felling and intensified biomass harvest appeared to be the best option to increase both climate benefits and economic returns. Trade-offs between the highest net CO2 exchange and economic profitability of biomass production existed. The use of alternative displacement factors largely affected the mitigation potential of forest biomass.","[Baul, Tarit Kumar; Alam, Ashraful; Ikonen, Antti; Strandman, Harri; Peltola, Heli; Kilpelainen, Antti] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Baul, Tarit Kumar] Univ Chittagong, Inst Forestry & Environm Sci, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh; [Asikainen, Antti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Joensuu Unit, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Baul, TK (reprint author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.; Baul, TK (reprint author), Univ Chittagong, Inst Forestry & Environm Sci, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh.",tarit.baul@uef.fi; ashraful.alam@uef.fi; ikonen.antti.90@gmail.com; harri.strandman@uef.fi; antti.asikainen@luke.fi; heli.peltola@uef.fi; antti.kilpelainen@uef.fi,,"Baul, Dr. Tarit Kumar/0000-0002-0805-0657; Alam, Ashraful/0000-0001-8118-8161",Finnish Society of Forest Science; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; ADAPT project - Academy of Finland [14907]; FORBIO project - Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland [14970],"Authors gratefully acknowledge all financial supports of this study.

Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in R-s in six land cover types (mixed forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, lawn, wetland, and bare land) in Seoul Forest Park, Republic of Korea, between March 2013 and September 2014, which included a wet (2013) and an extremely dry (2014) summer. Spatially, there was a three-fold difference (0.48-1.45 kgC m(-2)) in annual R-s among the six land cover types. The soil organic carbon stock at a depth of 0.1 m explained 72% of the spatial variation in the annual R-s across the land cover types. During the entire study period, the soil temperature explained 82-97% of the temporal variation in R-s among different land cover types. Comparing the two summers, the 2014 drought only resulted in a decrease in R-s in the lawn plots (25%), which was driven by a reduction in the leaf area index and the fine root density. The temperature sensitivity of R-s in 2014 (dry summer) compared to 2013 (wet summer) was significantly lower in mixed forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and lawn, and did not change in evergreen needleleaf forest, wetland, or bare land. The differences in R-s in these drought responses highlight the importance of the careful selection of land cover type during park planning to better manage carbon cycles.","[Bae, Jeehwan; Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 151921, South Korea; [Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Agr & Forest Meteorol, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Landscape Architecture, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Youngryel] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Seoul, South Korea","Ryu, Y (reprint author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul 151921, South Korea.",yryu@snu.ac.kr,"Ryu, Youngryel/C-3072-2008","Ryu, Youngryel/0000-0001-6238-2479",Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2012R1A1A1004065],This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2012R1A1A1004065).

To gain insight into the extent of genome 9 genome interactions on hosts at the molecular level and to identify potential mechanisms responsible for the variation, we examined host gene expression within nodules (the plant organ where the symbiosis occurs) of four genotypes of Medicago truncatula grown with either Ensifer meliloti or E. medicae symbionts. These host 9 symbiont combinations show significant variation in nodule and biomass phenotypes. Likewise, combinations differ in their transcriptomes: host, symbiont and host 9 symbiont affected the expression of 70%, 27% and 21%, respectively, of the approximately 27,000 host genes expressed in nodules. Genes with the highest levels of expression often varied between hosts and/or symbiont strain and include leghemoglobins that modulate oxygen availability and hundreds of Nodule Cysteine-Rich (NCR) peptides involved in symbiont differentiation and viability in nodules. Genes with host 9 symbiont-dependent expression were enriched for functions related to resource exchange between partners (sulphate/iron/amino acid transport and dicarboxylate/amino acid synthesis). These enrichments suggest mechanisms for host control of the currencies of the mutualism. The transcriptome of M. truncatula accession HM101 (A17), the reference genome used for most molecular research, was less affected by symbiont identity than the other hosts. These findings underscore the importance of assessing the molecular basis of variation in ecologically important traits, particularly those involved in biotic interactions, in multiple genetic contexts.","[Burghardt, Liana T.; Guhlin, Joseph; Young, Nevin D.; Tiffin, Peter] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Chun, Chan Lan; Sadowsky, Michael J.] Univ Minnesota, Biotechnol Inst, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Liu, Junqi; Stupar, Robert M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Young, Nevin D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Pathol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Chun, Chan Lan] Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA; [Chun, Chan Lan] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, Duluth, MN 55811 USA","Burghardt, LT (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",liana.burghardt@gmail.com,"Burghardt, Liana/K-5465-2019; Chun, Chanlan/K-1016-2019; Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016","Burghardt, Liana/0000-0002-0239-1071; Chun, Chanlan/0000-0002-9765-8663; Stupar, Robert/0000-0002-8836-2924; Guhlin, Joseph/0000-0003-3264-7178; Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1237993],"NSF, Grant/Award Number: IOS-1237993",,88,8,9,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Despite the broad consensus that soils provide essential ecosystem services, plant community effects on soil communities and functions have rarely been linked to aboveground and belowground plant traits. Here, we studied the effects of plant species richness, plant trait diversity, and single plant functional traits related to spatial and temporal resource acquisition on soil microbial properties over five years in a grassland biodiversity experiment. The main response variables were soil basal respiration and microbial biomass. Above- and belowground plant traits associated with spatial (plant height, leaf area, rooting depth, and root length density) and temporal resource acquisition (growth start, flowering start) were selected to design communities with different levels of functional diversity as well as to calculate realized community means weighted by plant species cover. Plant species richness and trait diversity effects on soil microbial properties were nonsignificant over the course of the five-year experiment. After four years, however, we found significantly higher soil basal respiration in plant communities with smaller leaves and both denser and shallower root systems than in plant communities with taller plants and sparse root systems. One year later, these effects were significant for both soil basal respiration and soil microbial biomass. Structural equation modeling revealed that plant community effects on soil microbial properties were mostly due to differences in rooting depth, although the explanatory power of our models was low. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating plant traits, particularly root traits, in analyses of plant community effects on soil biota and functions. Selecting for particular plant traits in communities and considering interactive effects of specific plant traits may facilitate the targeted management of grasslands to maintain essential ecosystem services.","[Steinauer, Katja; Roscher, Christiane; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Steinauer, Katja; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fischer, Felicia M.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Georg August Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Berliner Str 28, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Steinauer, K (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",katja.sfeinauer@web.de,"Fischer, Felicia Miranda/K-4384-2019; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015","Fischer, Felicia Miranda/0000-0002-2319-3648; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; ",German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1451]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Ei 862/3-2],"W e would like to thank Madhav Prakash Thakur for his suggestions on data analysis.

The members of these communities are not evenly distributed in soils; instead, soil organisms interact dynamically with biotic and abiotic factors which distribute heterogeneously in soil. Root chemical traits are key factors shaping belowground rhizosphere communities, because they mediate species-specific interactions, affect organisms at multiple trophic levels and, consequently, diverse ecological processes. This review explores the role of root chemical traits in shaping belowground biotic interactions. We first summarize which soil organisms occur and interact over a distinct, vertical gradient in the rhizosphere, i.e., from taproots to fine roots and exudates. Then we explore whether the vertical interaction gradient between roots and soil biota co-occurs with gradients of root chemical traits. We particularly discuss whether and why allocations of defensive chemicals in roots are consistent with the optimal defence allocation theory, which provides a mechanistic understanding of specific detrimental interactions. In order to obtain more detailed data, appropriate sampling scales and methods are necessary to correctly recognize belowground biodiversity and biotic interactions mediated by root chemical traits. Metabolomic approaches which enable us to analyse and identify thousands of root chemicals at once, will help to identify those chemical root traits which are the most important in belowground biotic interactions.","[Tsunoda, Tomonori; van Dam, Nicole M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [van Dam, Nicole M.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [van Dam, Nicole M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Mol Interact Ecol, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands","Tsunoda, T (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",tomonori.tsunoda@idiv.de,"van Dam, Nicole/B-3281-2008","van Dam, Nicole/0000-0003-2622-5446; Tsunoda, Tomonori/0000-0002-1163-2893",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for the Promotion of Science; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118],We wish to thank Dr. Saori Fujii of Free University Amsterdam and Dr. Ryohei Nakano of Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research for discussion on our early draft.

We aimed at quantifying C dynamics of a poorly regenerating disturbance site with a special focus on the role of non-woody ground vegetation. Soil CO2 efflux, fine root biomass, ground vegetation biomass, tree increment and litter input were assessed in (i) an undisturbed section of a similar to 110 years old Norway spruce stand, (ii) in a disturbed section which was clear-cut six years ago (no tree regeneration), and (iii) in a disturbed section which was clear-cut three years ago (no tree regeneration). Total soil CO2 efflux was similar across all stand sections (8.5 +/- 0.2 to 8.9 +/- 0.3 t C ha(-1) yr.(-1)). The undisturbed forest served as atmospheric C sink (2.1 t C ha(-1) yr.(-1)), whereas both clearings were C sources to the atmosphere. The source strength three years after disturbance (-5.5 t C ha(-1) yr.(-1)) was almost twice as high as six years after disturbance (-2.9 t C ha(-1) yr.(-1)), with declining heterotrophic soil respiration and the high productivity of dense graminoid ground vegetation mitigating C loss. C loss after disturbance decreases with time and ground vegetation growth. Dense non-woody ground vegetation cover can hamper tree regeneration but simultaneously decrease the ecosystem C loss. The role of ground vegetation should be more explicitly taken into account in forest C budgets assessing disturbance effects.","[Zehetgruber, Bernhard; Jandl, Robert; Schindlbacher, Andreas] Nat Hazards & Landscape BFW, Fed Res & Training Ctr Forests, Dept Forest Ecol, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Kobler, Johannes; Dirnboeck, Thomas] Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Ecosyst Res & Environm Informat Management, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Seidl, Rupert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Inst Silviculture, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Schindlbacher, A (reprint author), Nat Hazards & Landscape BFW, Fed Res & Training Ctr Forests, Dept Forest Ecol, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria.",andreas.schindlbacher@bfw.gv.at,,"Kobler, Johannes/0000-0003-0052-4245; Seidl, Rupert/0000-0002-3338-3402",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF); Austrian Science Fund FWFAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 25503],Open access funding provided by Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

To assess the coordination among below and aboveground hydraulic traits and the diversity of water-use strategies, we evaluated rooting depth and several leaf hydraulic traits of 15 species in campos rupestres, a seasonally-dry biodiversity hotspot in central Brazil. We assessed the depth of plant water acquisition by excavating roots and analyzing the stable isotope composition of hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) in the xylem and soil water. We also measured mid-morning stomatal conductance, leaf-water potential at turgor loss point (N degrees(TLP)) and pre-dawn leaf water potentials (N degrees(PD)) during wet and dry seasons. We demonstrated that rooting depth is a good predictor of seasonal variations in stomatal conductance and N degrees(PD). Shallow-rooted plants had greater variation in stomatal conductance and N degrees(PD) than deep-rooted plants. Woody plants with shallower roots also had lower N degrees(TLP) than deep-rooted plants, revealing higher drought resistance. We demonstrate that shallow-rooted species, more exposed to variation in water availability, have mechanisms to confer drought resistance through turgor maintenance. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-offs related to drought resistance.","[Brum, Mauro; Teodoro, Grazielle Sales; Abrahao, Anna; Oliveira, Rafael Silva] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, POB 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Teodoro, Grazielle Sales] Univ Fed Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Abrahao, Anna; Oliveira, Rafael Silva] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA, Australia","Brum, M (reprint author), Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, POB 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.; Oliveira, RS (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA, Australia.",maurobrumjr@gmail.com; rafaelsoliv@gmail.com,"Abrahao, Anna/M-6565-2018; Teodoro, Grazielle S/K-2586-2014; Oliveira, Rafael S/B-3422-2013","Abrahao, Anna/0000-0001-9295-2292; Oliveira, Rafael S/0000-0002-6392-2526; Teodoro, Grazielle/0000-0002-5528-8828","CAPES agencyCAPES; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/50327-8, 2012/21015-3, 2010/10204-0, 2011/52072-0]","We gratefully acknowledge CAPES agency for the scholarships granted to MB and AA; financial support by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) with a scholarship to GST (2010/50327-8 and 2012/21015-3) and grant to RSO (2010/10204-0; 2011/52072-0).

In this study, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings were exposed to moderate warming (ca. 1 degrees C), 1.5 x ambient ozone (O-3) concentration, fertilizer addition (120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and shoot herbivory by pine sawfly (Acantholyda posticalis) alone and in combination. We measured fine root morphology, mycorrhizal colonization level, root fungal biomass (ergosterol), rhizosphere emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and microbial biomass (PLFAs) in the rhizosphere soil as well as seedling above- and below-ground growth. Warming and fertilization effects on fine root proportions or root fungal biomass occurred in combination with other factors, combination effects being usually negative on the studied variables, or then warming and fertilization in combination cancelled some other factors' effects. O-3 effects on needle growth, root fungal biomass and BVOCs were more often seen after the third exposure year, and sometimes only in combination with other studied factors. Of abiotic factors, fertilizer addition had reducing effect on rhizosphere BVOCs. Though increased nitrogen availability and warming increased both shoot and root dry masses, growth allocation to above- and below-ground parts was not equally increased in the combined exposures. Thus, we conclude that climate change factors together with increased nitrogen availability and herbivory are likely to affect the below-ground compartments negatively, more often than shoots, and ultimately change in growth allocation pattern which may affect overall seedling growth and survival in later years.

We labeled intact tree roots by brief N-15 exposures using field hydroponic experiments in a temperate forest and a tropical forest in China. A total of 21 dominant tree species were investigated, 8 in the temperate forest and 13 in the tropical forest. All investigated tree species showed highest uptake rates for NH4+ (ammonium), followed by glycine and NO3- (nitrate). Uptake of NH4+ by temperate trees averaged 12.8 mu g N g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) root h(-1), while those by tropical trees averaged 6.8 mu g N g(-1) d.w. root h(-1). Glycine uptake rates averaged 3.1 mu g N g(-1) d. w. root h(-1) for temperate trees and 2.4 mu g N g(-1) d.w. root h(-1) for tropical trees. NO3- uptake was the lowest (averaging 0.8 mu g N g(-1) d. w. root h(-1) for temperate trees and 1.2 mu g N g(-1) d.w. root h(-1) for tropical trees). Uptake of NH4+ accounted for 76% of the total uptake of all three N forms in the temperate forest and 64% in the tropical forest. Temperate tree species had similar glycine uptake rates as tropical trees, with the contribution being slightly lower (20% in the temperate forest and 23% in the tropical forest). All tree species investigated in the temperate forest were ectomycorrhizal and all species but one in the tropical forest were arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM). Ectomycorrhizal trees showed significantly higher NH4+ and lower NO3- uptake rates than AM trees. Mycorrhizal colonization rates significantly affected uptake rates and contributions of NO3- or NH4+, but depended on forest types. We conclude that tree species in both temperate and tropical forests preferred to take up NH4+, with organic N as the second most important N source. These findings suggest that temperate and tropical forests demonstrate similar N uptake patterns although they differ in physiology of trees and soil biogeochemical processes.","[Liu, Min; Li, Changcheng; Xu, Xingliang; Wang, Huimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, 11A,Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Min; Li, Changcheng; Wang, Huimin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xingliang; Yang, Xiaodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wanek, Wolfgang] Univ Vienna, Res Network Chem Meets Microbiol, Div Terr Ecosyst Res, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Jiang, Ning] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huimin] Jiangxi Key Lab Ecosyst Proc & Informat, Jian 343725, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Xu, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, 11A,Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Xu, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",xuxingl@hotmail.com,"Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015; Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012","Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932; Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Jiang, Ning/0000-0002-9656-8500","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470560, 41601318]; Youth Innovation Research Team Project [LENOM2016Q0004]",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470560 and 41601318) and Youth Innovation Research Team Project (LENOM2016Q0004).,,75,5,7,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2017,37,11,,,,,1515,1526,,10.1093/treephys/tpx046,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,FN9YZ,WOS:000416400500007,28482109,,,,10/31/19J,"Rakoczy, R; Lechowska, J; Kordas, M; Konopacki, M; Fijalkowski, K; Drozd, R",,,,"Rakoczy, Rafal; Lechowska, Joanna; Kordas, Marian; Konopacki, Maciej; Fijalkowski, Karol; Drozd, Radoslaw",,,Effects of a rotating magnetic field on gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient; Rotating magnetic field; Magnetic mixer; Mathematical correlation,BACTERIAL CELLULOSE; OXYGEN-TRANSFER; BUBBLE-COLUMN; HOLD-UP; PREDICTION; IMPELLER; WATER; PROLIFERATION; HYDRODYNAMICS; NANOPARTICLES,"The mass transfer coefficient k(L) is a key parameter for an aeration mixing design and optimization. From the practical point of view, the volume-related liquid side mass transfer coefficient (k(L)a) is commonly applied in the gas-liquid contacting devices. This parameter is affected by several factors such as geometrical and operational characteristics of the vessel, media composition and microorganisms. Moreover, the rate of the mass transfer between two phases depends on the physicochemical properties of the mixed system, the interface surface and the hydrodynamic conditions of the process. The present study aim at: (i) analyzing the influence of the rotating magnetic field (RMF) on the aeration process of various types of liquids and (ii) quantifying the obtained liquid volumetric mass transfer coefficients (kLa) by using the new type of relationships. To quantify the impact of RMF on the hydrodynamic conditions, modelling using various correlations issued from the theoretical considerations was performed.

We established a field experiment and applied ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) at monthly intervals over a period of 4 years. We collected soil samples from the ammonium and nitrate treatments and control plots in three different seasons, namely spring, summer, and fall, to evaluate the how the biomass of different soil microbial communities and enzyme activities responded to the ammonium (NH4Cl) and nitrate (NaNO3) applications. Our results showed that the total contents of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) decreased by 24 and 11% in the ammonium and nitrate treatments, respectively. The inhibitory effects of ammonium on Gram-positive bacteria (G(+)) and bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) PLFA contents ranged from 14 to 40% across the three seasons. We also observed that the absolute activities of C, N, and P hydrolyses and oxidases were inhibited by ammonium and nitrate, but that nitrate had stronger inhibitory effects on the activities of acid phosphatase (AP) than ammonium. The activities of N-acquisition specific enzymes (enzyme activities normalized by total PLFA contents) were about 21 and 43% lower in the ammonium and nitrate treatments than in the control, respectively. However, the activities of P-acquisition specific enzymes were about 19% higher in the ammonium treatment than in the control. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that the measured C, N, and P hydrolysis and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were positively correlated with the soil pH and ammonium contents, but were negatively correlated with the nitrate contents. The PLFA biomarker contents were positively correlated with soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N contents, but were negatively correlated with the ammonium contents. The soil enzyme activities varied seasonally, and were highest in March and lowest in October.

Tropical forests exchange more C, energy, and water with the atmosphere than any other class of land ecosystems. Further, tropical-forest C cycling is likely responding to the rapid global warming, intensifying water stress, and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Projections of the future C balance of the tropics vary widely among global models. A current effort of the modeling community, the IL-AMB (International Land Model Benchmarking) project, is to compile robust observations that can be used to improve the accuracy and realism of the land models for all major biomes. Our goal with this paper is to identify field observations of tropical-forest ecosystem C stocks and fluxes, and of their long-term trends and climatic and CO2 sensitivities, that can serve this effort. We propose criteria for reference-level field data from this biome and present a set of documented examples from old-growth lowland tropical forests. We offer these as a starting point towards the goal of a regularly updated consensus set of benchmark field observations of C cycling in tropical forests.","[Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, 8001 Nat Bridge Rd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Asao, Shinichi; Ryan, Michael G.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Asao, Shinichi] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Plant Energy Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Fisher, Rosie] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam, Terr Sci Sect, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Reed, Sasha] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Ryan, Michael G.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Wood, Tana E.] US Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, USDA, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA; [Yang, Xiaojuan] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Yang, Xiaojuan] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Clark, DA (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, 8001 Nat Bridge Rd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",deborahanneclark@gmail.com,"Asao, Shinichi/R-9514-2016; fisher, rosie/Y-4226-2019; Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008; Yang, Xiaojuan/I-3643-2016","Asao, Shinichi/0000-0002-0334-5464; fisher, rosie/0000-0003-3260-9227; Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738; Yang, Xiaojuan/0000-0002-2686-745X; Clark, Deborah/0000-0002-4000-4925; Reed, Sasha/0000-0002-8597-8619; Wood, Tana/0000-0001-6322-6224; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","US Geological Survey John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis; Powell Center; US National Science Foundation LTREB [DEB-1147367, DEB-1357112]; US Department of Energy, Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences [DE-SC0011806]; USDA Forest Service International Institute for Tropical Forestry; University of Puerto Rico; Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics; Biogeochemistry-Climate Feedbacks Scientific Focus Area (BGC Feedbacks SFA) of the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; US Department of Energy, Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0012677]; US Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area","This work was made possible by the support of the US Geological Survey John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis.

One-year-old seedlings of both species were subjected to sediment oiling with Bunker fuel oil 180. In both species, fresh sections of root tips from the control, stained with fluorescein diacetate, exhibited green fluorescence indicating living cells, while those in the oiled treatment, stained with propidium iodide, exhibited red fluorescence indicating dead cells. In roots of both species, ultrastructural changes induced by oil included disorganization of cells in the root cap, epidermis, meristem and conducting tissue. Oil distorted and disorganised cells as well as their internal structure. Ultrastructural changes included loss of cell contents and fragmentation of organelles such as the nucleus and mitochondria. In the leaves of both species, oil caused dilation and distortion of chloroplasts and disintegration of grana and lamellae. This study demonstrated that in both species, oil damaged membrane integrity and caused disorganisation of critical organelles, such as nuclei, chloroplasts and mitochondria which are responsible for cell vitality and energy transformation.","[Naidoo, Gonasageran; Naidoo, Krishnaveni] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, P-B X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa","Naidoo, G (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, P-B X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",naidoogn@ukzn.ac.za,"Naidoo, Gonasageran/F-1059-2010",,National Research Foundation [93560],This research was supported by the National Research Foundation (grant number 93560 to G Naidoo).

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different sources of AM inocula on plant resistance to a root feeding insect in two different soils with different silicon (Si) concentrations. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) was grown in high or low Si soil; plants were treated with either an inoculum comprising the native AM fungi, a commercial AM fungal inoculum or with no AM fungi. Root herbivore (Dermolepida albohirtum) performance was measured in a feeding assay. In the low Si soil AM fungi increased root Si concentrations and reduced root herbivore performance. Both commercial and native AM treatments increased root Si and also reduced root herbivore growth rates by 107% and 81%, respectively. AM colonisation positively correlated with root Si concentrations. Distinct from this, in the high Si soil AM fungi had no impact on root Si or root herbivore growth. However, root consumption was reduced; a response independent of Si concentrations. Our study suggests AM fungi can enhance Si based plant defences against root herbivores, but also highlights that interactions between AM fungi and root herbivores involves multiple mechanisms requiring further research.","[Frew, Adam; Powell, Jeff R.; Johnson, Scott N.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW, Australia; [Allsopp, Peter G.] Sugar Res Australia Ltd, 50 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld, Australia; [Sallam, Nader] Sugar Res Australia Ltd, Bruce, Qld 71378, Australia","Frew, A (reprint author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW, Australia.",afrew@csu.edu.au,"Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010","Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452; Frew, Adam/0000-0001-9859-2419",Sugar Research Australia Ltd.

Shortleaf pine is presumed to be more drought tolerant than loblolly pine, but the drought hardiness of the hybrid pine is not known. Wedetermined biomass partitioning in response to water stress and measured whole-plant transpiration of shortleaf, loblolly, and hybrid pine seedlings. Water stress decreased total seedling biomass, increased biomass partitioning to foliage, and decreased biomass partitioning to coarse roots. Shortleaf pine seedlings partitioned more biomass to coarse roots than loblolly pine, and hybrid pine was intermediate between the parent species. We found no differences in the level of soil moisture at which seedlings of different species began to limit transpiration. Our results suggest that the transpiration response of shortleaf pine and hybrid pine is similar to that of loblolly pine when exposed to water stress. However, greater partitioning to coarse root may allow shortleaf and hybrid pines to better withstand drought due to greater potential belowground carbohydrate supply.","[Bradley, Joshua C.; Will, Rodney E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resources Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Will, RE (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resources Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",rodney.will@okstate.edu,"Will, Rodney/G-8111-2011",,McIntire-Stennis project [OKLO 2929]; Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station,"This research was funded by McIntire-Stennis project OKLO 2929 and the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station.

Recognizing the importance of plant root systems to overcome stability problems, we investigated the contributions of three different herbaceous species typical of calcareous grasslands, that is, Anthyllis vulneraria, Bromus erectus and Stachys recta, to the stability of the superficial layers of dump deposits at limestone quarries in the Botticino extractive basin (Lombardy, Italy). We analysed (i) the root mechanical properties and root diameter distributions of the selected species and estimated (ii) the lateral root reinforcement they can provide through the fibre bundle model. To assess the effective contribution of a species to the topsoil stabilization, we implemented the results obtained in a stability model based on the ordinary method of slices. Our results showed that using species such as B.erectus and S.recta with a density of 100 plants per square metre guarantees a better stability of the superficial layers.

The soil re-spread process increases soil compaction, which may alter soil water, plant composition, rooting depths, and soil organic matter. This may have a direct impact on vegetation establishment and species recruitment. Seasonal wet/dry and freeze/thaw patterns are thought to alleviate soil compaction over time. However, this has not been formally evaluated on reclaimed landscapes at large scales. Our objectives were to (1) determine soil compaction alleviation, (2) rooting depth, and (3) spatial patterns of soil water content over a time-since-reclamation gradient. Soil resistance to penetration varied by depth, with shallow compaction remaining unchanged, but deeper compaction increased over time rather than being alleviated. Root biomass and depth did not increase with time and was consistently less than the values in the reference location. Plant communities initially had a strong native component, but quickly became dominated by invasive species following reclamation, and soil water content became increasingly homogeneous over the 40-year chronosequence. Seasonal weather patterns and soil organic matter additions can reduce soil compaction if water infiltration is not limited. Shallow and strongly fibrous-rooted grasses present in reclaimed sites added organic matter to shallow soil layers, but did not penetrate the compacted layers and allow water infiltration. Strong linkages between land management strategies, soil properties, and vegetation composition can advance reclamation efforts and promote heterogeneous landscapes. However, current post-reclamation management strategies are incompletely utilizing natural seasonal weather patterns to reduce soil compaction.

We assessed the relative importance of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and identity of neighbors for stem growth 3 yr after seedling establishment in a tree diversity experiment in eastern Minnesota. Generally, we found that community-weighted means of key functional traits (including mycorrhizal association, leaf nitrogen and calcium, and waterlogging tolerance) as well as species richness were strong, independent predictors of stem biomass growth. More phylogenetically diverse communities did not consistently produce more biomass than expected, and the trait values or diversity of individual functional traits better predicted biomass production than did a multidimensional functional diversity metric. Furthermore, functional traits and species richness best predicted growth at the whole-plot level (12 m(2)), whereas neighborhood composition best predicted growth at the focal tree level (0.25 m(2)). The observed effects of biodiversity on growth appear strongly driven by positive complementary effects rather than by species-specific selection effects, suggesting that synergistic species' interactions rather than the influence of a few important species may drive overyielding.","[Grossman, Jake J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.; Montgomery, Rebecca A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW, Australia","Grossman, JJ (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",gross679@umn.edu,"Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Grossman, Jake/0000-0001-6468-8551","Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program [DEB-1234162]; Crosby Fund at the University of Minnesota; Rothman Fund at the University of Minnesota; Wilkie Fund at the University of Minnesota; Anderson Fund at the University of Minnesota; Dayton Fund at the University of Minnesota; department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System","Research was supported by the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program (DEB-1234162).

Though a variety of publications have documented the effects of increased precipitation and N deposition on aboveground plant community, the responses of soil microbial community composition and function to these possible global changes still remain largely unknown. In this study, we take advantage of a long-term (9-year) field experiment that was established in a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. The responses of microbial community composition and soil enzymatic activities to simulated N deposition and increased precipitation were examined. It was found that the low level of N addition showed no influence on the relative abundance of bacteria, but the relatively high N deposition increased the relative abundance of bacteria. The increased precipitation in combination with N addition, estimated at all N levels, significantly decreased the relative abundance of fungi and fungi/bacteria ratio. Increased precipitation played important roles in enhancing microbial activity in this semi-arid region. It was observed that water supply increased the activities of the five of the enzymes determined, including peroxidase (PER), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), beta-Glucosidase (BG), protease (PRO) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (alkaline PME). The activity of cellulase was reduced by long-term increased precipitation treatment, but was stimulated by simulated N deposition, which may due to the changes in litter components under projected climate change. The influences of N deposition on the microbial enzymatic activities might be alleviated (such as PER), strengthened (acid PME), or not affected by the projected precipitation increment. We also found that the overall changes in soil enzymatic activity patterns are more sensitive to environmental changes than the variations in soil microbial community composition, which may be explained by the microbial function redundancy and the limitations of research method. By all accounts, in future scenarios of increased precipitation in combination with N deposition, the proportion of soil fungi would be reduced, and the microbial community composition might be shifted to be bacteria-dominant. We also predicted that with the increasing of N deposition level, the activities of cellulolase would be enhanced, whereas the activities of ligninolytic enzymes (PER and PPO) would be reduced sharply.","[Yang, Shan; Xu, Zhuwen; Wang, Ruzhen; Yao, Fei; Jiang, Yong; Li, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shan; Zhang, Yongyong; Zou, Hongtao] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Land & Environm, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuge] Shenyang Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Reg Environm & Ecoremediat, Shenyang 110044, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Turco, Ronald F.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Li, H (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",huili@iae.ac.cn,"Jiang, Yong/A-2263-2012; Wang, Ruzhen/M-1358-2014; Xu, Zhuwen/O-3635-2015","Jiang, Yong/0000-0001-7518-5810; Wang, Ruzhen/0000-0001-8654-6677; Xu, Zhuwen/0000-0002-8898-6577","Major State Research Development Program of China [2016YFC0500601]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371251, 31370009]","This work was financially supported by the Major State Research Development Program of China (2016YFC0500601), and the National Science Foundation of China (41371251 and 31370009).

This barrier to invasion may be overcome if an invader either forms novel mutualistic associations or finds and associates with familiar mutualists in the exotic range. Here, we ask (1) does the community of rhizobial mutualists associated with invasive legumes in their exotic range overlap with that of local native legumes and (2) can any differences be explained by fundamental incompatibilities with particular rhizobial genotypes? To address these questions, we first characterized the rhizobial communities naturally associating with three invasive and six native legumes growing in the San Francisco Bay Area. We then conducted a greenhouse experiment to test whether the invasive legume could nodulate with any of a broad array of rhizobia found in their exotic range. There was little overlap between the Bradyrhizobium communities associated with wild-grown invasive and native legumes, yet the invasive legumes could nodulate with a broad range of rhizobial strains under greenhouse conditions. These observations suggest that under field conditions in their exotic range, these invasive legumes are not currently associating with the mutualists of local native legumes, despite their potential to form such associations. However, the promiscuity with which these invading legumes can form mutualistic associations could be an important factor early in the invasion process if mutualist scarcity limits range expansion. Overall, the observation that invasive legumes have a community of rhizobia distinct from that of native legumes, despite their ability to associate with many rhizobial strains, challenges existing assumptions about how invading species obtain their mutualists. These results can therefore inform current and future efforts to prevent and remove invasive species.","[La Pierre, Kimberly J.; Simms, Ellen L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tariq, Mohsin] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Zafar, Marriam] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Ctr Agr Biochem & Biotechnol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Porter, Stephanie S.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Vancouver, WA USA; [La Pierre, Kimberly J.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","La Pierre, KJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; La Pierre, KJ (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",lapierrek@si.edu,,"Komatsu, Kimberly/0000-0001-7056-4547","Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [NSF-DEB 0645791, NSF-DEB 1355216, NSF-DEB 1457508]","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: NSF-DEB 0645791, NSF-DEB 1355216 and NSF-DEB 1457508",,74,5,6,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Although context dependent, these native ecosystems subjected to prolonged invasion by exotic plants may be instrumental in distinguishing the role of plant-microbe-mineral interactions from the broader edaphic and climatic influences on the formation of soil organic matter (SOM). We hypothesized that the soils subjected to prolonged invasion by an exotic plant that input recalcitrant litter (Japanese knotweed, Polygonum cuspidatum) would have a greater proportion of plant-derived carbon (C) in the aggregate fractions, as compared with that in adjacent soil inhabited by native vegetation that input labile litter, whereas the soils under an invader that input labile litter (kudzu, Pueraria lobata) would have a greater proportion of microbial-derived C in the silt-clay fraction, as compared with that in adjacent soils that receive recalcitrant litter. At the knotweed site, the higher C content in soils under P. cuspidatum, compared with noninvaded soils inhabited by grasses and forbs, was limited to the macroaggregate fraction, which was abundant in plant biomarkers. The noninvaded soils at this site had a higher abundance of lignins in mineral and microaggregate fractions and suberin in the macroaggregate fraction, partly because of the greater root density of the native species, which might have had an overriding influence on the chemistry of the above-ground litter input. At the kudzu site, soils under P. lobata had lower C content across all size fractions at a 0-5 cm soil depth despite receiving similar amounts of Pinus litter. Contrary to our prediction, the noninvaded soils receiving recalcitrant Pinus litter had a similar abundance of plant biomarkers across both mineral and aggregate fractions, potentially because of the higher surface area of soil minerals at this site. The plant biomarkers were lower in the aggregate fractions of the P. lobata-invaded soils, compared with noninvaded pine stands, potentially suggesting a microbial co-metabolism of pinederived compounds. These results highlight the complex interactions among litter chemistry, soil biota, and minerals in mediating soil C storage in unmanaged ecosystems; these interactions are particularly important under global changes that may alter plant species composition and hence the quantity and chemistry of litter inputs in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Tamura, Mioko; Suseela, Vidya; Tharayil, Nishanth] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Simpson, Myrna] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Powell, Brian] Clemson Univ, Dept Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Clemson, SC USA","Suseela, V (reprint author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",vsuseel@clemson.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada",,109,11,12,10,129,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Because soil microbial communities are often altered by anthropogenic disturbance, successful plant community restoration may require the restoration of beneficial soil microbes, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Recent evidence suggests that later successional grassland species are more strongly affected by AM fungi relative to early successional plants and that late successional plants consistently benefit from some AM fungi but not other AM fungal species. Many of these late successional species are also often missing in restorations despite being heavily seeded. 2. To assess the effects of AM fungal composition within grassland restorations, we inoculated plots with six different AM fungal community treatments including one of four different AM fungal species isolated from a prairie, a mixture of all four fungal species, and a non-inoculated control. AM fungi were introduced by planting 16 different inoculated nurse plants into replicated plots. We also seeded the restoration with a diverse, 54 species prairie seed mixture. 3. We found that AM fungal inoculation drove plant community composition; plots inoculated with certain AM fungal treatments were dominated by desirable prairie plants, whereas plots inoculated with other AM fungal species and the non-inoculated control were dominated by non-desirable plants including weeds and exotic species. Specifically, we found that many early successional species established well regardless of AM fungal inoculation, whereas the establishment and growth of many late successional species was strongly dependent on the presence of specific AM fungal species. Many conservative late successional species did not occur without inoculation. Overall, total plant community richness, diversity, and Floristic Quality Index were all significantly improved with AM fungal inoculation, whereas we observed that non-desirable plant abundance was significantly greater in the non-inoculated plots. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the lack of late successional establishment reported in many previous restorations may be due to ineffective arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities at these sites. We conclude that the reintroduction of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from reference prairie environments could improve restoration outcomes by promoting plant diversity and richness, especially for desirable later successional plant species, while simultaneously inhibiting less desirable weedy plants.","[Koziol, Liz] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd ST, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 35B Takeru Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Koziol, L (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd ST, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.; Koziol, L (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 35B Takeru Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",ekoziol@indiana.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1050237, DEB-0919434]; SERDP [RC-2330]; IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2016-67011-25166]; Nature Conservancy; Bever/Schultz laboratory group","We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1050237 and DEB-0919434), the SERDP (RC-2330) and the IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant, the USDA 2016-67011-25166, the Nature Conservancy and the Bever/Schultz laboratory group, with special thanks to Peggy Schultz, G.

Process based Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are a valuable tool to investigate the determinants of vegetation distributions; however, many DGVMs fail to predict the spatial distribution or indeed presence of the South American savanna biome. Evidence suggests that fire plays a significant role in mediating forest-savanna biome boundaries; however, fire alone appears to be insufficient to predict these boundaries in South America. We hypothesize that interactions between precipitation, constraints on tree rooting depth and fire affect the probability of savanna occurrence and the position of the savanna-forest boundary. Location Tropical forest and savanna sites in Brazil and Venezuela north of 23 degrees S. Methods We tested our hypotheses using a novel DGVM, aDGVM2, which allows plant trait spectra, constrained by trade-offs between traits, to evolve in response to abiotic and biotic conditions. Plant hydraulics is represented by the cohesion-tension theory, this allowed us to explore how soil and plant hydraulics control biome distributions and plant traits. The resulting community trait distributions are emergent properties of model dynamics. Results We showed that across much of South America the biome state is not determined by climate alone. Interactions between plant rooting depth, fire and precipitation affected the probability of observing a given biome state and the emergent traits of plant communities. Simulations where plant rooting depth varied in space provided the best match to satellite derived biomass estimates and generated biome distributions that reproduced contemporary biome maps well. Main conclusions Our findings support the contention that areas where multiple vegetation states are possible are widespread and highlight the importance of considering the influence of fire and constraints on plant rooting depth for predicting biome boundaries.","[Langan, Liam] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Higgins, Steven I.] Univ Otago, Dept Bot, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Langan, Liam; Scheiter, Simon] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Higgins, Steven I.] Univ Bayreuth, Lehrstuhl Pflanzenokol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Langan, L (reprint author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",llangan@tcd.ie,"Higgins, Steven I/A-5138-2012; Scheiter, Simon/G-5048-2012","Higgins, Steven I/0000-0001-5695-9665; Scheiter, Simon/0000-0002-5449-841X","Leibnitz Gemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHE 1719/1-1, SCHE 1719/2-1]; Belmont Forum IHDBS project","L.

Research so far mostly focused on direct, individual abiotic or biotic effects on plant growth, but only few studies tested the indirect effects of abiotic soil factors on plant growth. Therefore, we investigated how abiotic soil conditions affect plant performance, via changes induced by soil biota. Methods In a full-factorial experiment, we grew the widespread grass Dactylis glomerata either with or without soil biota and investigated the impact of soil temperature, fertility and moisture on the soil biota effects on plant growth. We measured biomass production, root traits and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as well as microbial respiration. Important Findings We found significant interaction effects between abiotic soil conditions and soil biota on plant growth for fertility, but especially for soil temperature, as an increase of 10 degrees C significantly changed the soil biota effects on plant growth from positive to neutral. However, if tested individually, an increase in soil temperature and fertility per se positively affected plant biomass production, whereas soil biota per se did not affect overall plant growth, but both influenced root architecture. By affecting soil microbial activity and root architecture, soil temperature might influence both mutualistic and pathogenic interactions between plants and soil biota. Such soil temperature effects should be considered in soil feedback studies to ensure greater transferability of results from artificial and experimental conditions to natural environmental conditions.","[Heinze, Johannes; Gensch, Sabine; Weber, Ewald; Joshi, Jasmin] Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res Bot, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Heinze, Johannes; Joshi, Jasmin] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Heinze, J (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res Bot, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",jheinze@uni-potsdam.de,,"Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465; Heinze, Johannes/0000-0002-3556-5883",,,,78,3,3,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Yet, how genomes achieve the ecological transition initiated by the transfer of complex biological traits remains poorly known. Here, we used experimental evolution, genomics, transcriptomics and high-resolution phenotyping to analyze the evolution of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum into legume symbionts, following the transfer of a natural plasmid encoding the essential mutualistic genes. We show that a regulatory pathway of the recipient R. solanacearum genome involved in extracellular infection of natural hosts was reused to improve intracellular symbiosis with the Mimosa pudica legume. Optimization of intracellular infection capacity was gained through mutations affecting two components of a new regulatory pathway, the transcriptional regulator efpR and a region upstream from the RSc0965-0967 genes of unknown functions. Adaptive mutations caused the downregulation of efpR and the over-expression of a downstream regulatory module, the three unknown genes RSc3146-3148, two of which encoding proteins likely associated to the membrane. This over-expression led to important metabolic and transcriptomic changes and a drastic qualitative and quantitative improvement of nodule intracellular infection. In addition, these adaptive mutations decreased the virulence of the original pathogen. The complete efpR/RSc3146-3148 pathway could only be identified in the genomes of the pathogenic R. solanacearum species complex. Our findings illustrate how the rewiring of a genetic network regulating virulence allows a radically different type of symbiotic interaction and contributes to ecological transitions and trade-offs.","[Capela, Delphine; Marchetti, Marta; Clerissi, Camille; Perrier, Anthony; Guetta, Dorian; Gris, Carine; Masson-Boivin, Catherine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo P.

These endophytes synthesize bioactive alkaloids that generally have detrimental effects on the performance of insect herbivores, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Our objective was to determine whether changes in the physiology and/or behavior of aphids explain the changes in performance of insects feeding on endophytic plants. We studied the interaction between the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and the annual ryegrass Lolium multiflorum symbiotic (E+) or not symbiotic (E-) with the fungus Epichloe occultans that can synthesize loline alkaloids. We hypothesized that aphids feeding on E+ plants have higher energetic demands for detoxification of fungal alkaloids, thereby negatively impacting the individual performance, population growth, and structure. Aphids growing on E+ plants had lower values in morphometric and functional variables of individual performance, displayed lower birth rate, smaller population size, and dramatic structural changes. However, aphids exhibited lower values of standard metabolic rate (SMR) on E+ plants, which suggests no high costs of detoxification. Behavioral variables during the first 8 h of feeding showed that aphids did not change the phloem sap ingestion with the presence of fungal endophytes. We hypothesize that aphids may maintain phloem sap ingestion according to their fungal alkaloid tolerance capacity. In other words, when alkaloid concentrations overcome tolerance threshold, ingestion of phloem should decrease, which may explain the observed lower values of SMR in E+ feeding aphids.","[Bastias, Daniel A.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.] Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Machado Assefh, Cristina R.] CONICET CCT Salta, Avda Bolivia 5150,A4408FVY Salta, Salta, Argentina; [Machado Assefh, Cristina R.; Alvarez, Adriana E.] Univ Nacl Salta UNSa, Fac Ciencias Nat, Catedra Quim Biol, Avda Bolivia 5150,A4408FVY Salta, Salta, Argentina; [Young, Carolyn A.] Samuel Roberts Noble Fdn Inc, 2510 Sam Noble Pkwy, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA","Bastias, DA (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, IFEVA, CONICET, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",dabastia@agro.uba.ar,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Young, Carolyn Anne/Q-2963-2019","Young, Carolyn Anne/0000-0003-0406-8398; Alvarez, Adriana/0000-0003-4699-5122; Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Gundel, Pedro/0000-0003-3246-0282; Machado-Assefh, Cristina Renata|/0000-0001-6857-4826",Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica FONCYTANPCyTFONCyT [PICT-2355]; Universidad de Buenos Aires UBAUniversity of Buenos Aires [UBACYT 2014-30BA],The manuscript was significantly improved by the constructive work made by two anonymous reviewers.

Since epichloid endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are highly widespread grass symbionts, here we explore the role of AMF and endophyte in plant-soil feedback within the same grass population. Through a manipulative experiment, we evaluated the performance of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated Lolium multiflorum plants grown in soils previously conditioned by endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants and inoculated or not with three AMF species. The biomass of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants was increased by AMF inoculation, when growing in soils conditioned by equal endophytic status plants (i.e. home soils). When growing in soils conditioned by plants with different endophytic status, plant biomass was higher than in home soil only in absence of AMF. The content of P and the arbuscular colonization also increased in plants growing in home soils. We demonstrated that AMF shift the intraspecific feedback effects between E+ and E- conspecific plants from negative to positive. Furthermore, we found that the outcome of simultaneous occurrence of foliar and root symbionts on grass performance depends on the matching with the endophytic status of the previous plant.","[Garcia-Parisi, P.

The objective was to examine the impacts of different exudate components on microbially-mediated C decomposition and their underlying mechanisms. In a well-controlled simulated rhizosphere system, we added exudate chemicals (glucose, glycine and oxalic acid) to spruce (Picea asperata) plantation soils over a 35-day period. The total C contents, net N mineralization rates, microbial communities and extracellular enzymes were measured. The three exudate components induced different C losses by different mechanisms. Oxalic acid promoted net C loss by accelerating microbial mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). In contrast, glucose resulted in a net C accumulation, which challenged the assumption that glucose serves as a co-metabolite in driving SOM decomposition to lose C. Glycine increased the total C content via negative priming effects. Exudate-induced rhizosphere priming effects are not entirely dependent on the energy properties of root exudates. Different exudates may affect SOM decomposition differently, thus the component-specialized rhizosphere processes induced by individual exudate components on soil C dynamics should be integrated into forest C cycle-climate feedbacks under environmental changes.","[Yuan, Yuanshuang; Zhao, Wenqiang; Zhang, Ziliang; Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yuanshuang; Zhao, Wenqiang; Zhang, Ziliang; Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yuanshuang; Zhang, Ziliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Juan; Yin, Huajun] China West Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Nanchong 637000, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Mingfeng] Sichuan Tourism Univ, Chengdu 610100, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Yin, HJ (reprint author), China West Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Nanchong 637000, Peoples R China.",liuqing@cib.ac.cn; yinhj@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0505200]; CASDefence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-SMC023, Y6C2051100]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670449, 31500445]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS [2013242]; Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation [2016JQ0037]; Key Laboratory of Mountain Surface Processes and Ecological Regulation of CAS","This study was supported jointly by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0505200), Frontier Science Key Research Programs of CAS (QYZDB-SSW-SMC023), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670449, 31500445), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (2013242), the CAS ""Light of West China"" Program (Y6C2051100), Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation (2016JQ0037) and the Key Laboratory of Mountain Surface Processes and Ecological Regulation of CAS.

We conducted 3 years of field observations at three sites along an aridity gradient from the middle to lower reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwestern China. Stable oxygen composition (delta O-18) in plant xylem water, soil water and groundwater were analyzed concurrently with ecophysiological measurements at monthly intervals during the growing seasons. Water source for coexisting R. soongorica and N. sphaerocarpa did not differ at the sites with high precipitation, but significantly differed in more arid locations. The N. sphaerocarpa was more sensitive to summer precipitation than R. soongorica in terms of predawn water potential, stomatal conductance and foliage carbon-isotope discrimination. The plants relying on groundwater maintained consistent water use strategies, but not plants that took up precipitation-derived water. We also found that the difference in water source uptake between the coexisting species was more apparent in more arid locations.","[Zhang, Cicheng; Li, Xiaoyan; Wang, Pei; Wu, Xiuchen; Huang, Yongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Cicheng; Li, Xiaoyan; Wang, Pei; Wang, Yang; Wu, Xiuchen; Li, Wei; Huang, Yongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huawu] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huawu] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Li, XY (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cichengzhang@mail.bnu.edu.cn; xyli@bnu.edu.cn; wuhuawu416@163.com; peiwang@bnu.edu.cn; 201531190008@mail.bnu.edu.cn; xiuchen.wu@bnu.edu.cn; liwei19870316@hotmail.com; ymhuang@bnu.edu.cn,"___, _/S-3522-2019","___, _/0000-0002-8647-253X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 91425301, 91625101]; PCSIRTProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-15R06]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology; Ten Thousand Talent Program for leading young scientist","We thank Engui Li and Lei Liu for their help in field observations and Prof. Wang from Hexi University for providing a laboratory for conducting some experiments.

The C flows were traced using C-13 pulse labelling. Mycorrhizal P uptake responses were lowered by P fertilization in all tested plant species. Independently from the C flow to the roots, the C flow to AMF-signature fatty acid 16:1 omega 5 were reduced by P fertilization in leek and ryegrass (but not in medic). Calculated mycorrhizal C costs ranged between 0.9% and 10.5% of the plant C budget. Suppression of the C flow from the plants to AMF resulted from both reduced abundance of AMF in the roots and lowered relative C income per unit of AMF biomass in P-fertilized pots.

Colonisation pattern was assessed by enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged K. radicincitans in three A. thaliana accessions differing in their growth response. Metabolic impact of bacterial colonisation was determined for the best responding accession by profiling distinct classes of plant secondary metabolites and root exudates. Inoculation of 18 A. thaliana accessions resulted in a wide range of growth responses, from repression to enhancement. Testing the bacterial colonisation of three accessions did not reveal a differential pattern. Profiling of plant secondary metabolites showed a differential accumulation of glucosinolates, phenylpropanoids and carotenoids in roots. Analysis of root exudates demonstrated that primary and secondary metabolites were predominantly differentially depleted by bacterial inoculation. The plant genotype controls the bacterial growth promoting traits. Levels of lutein and beta-carotene were elevated in inoculated roots. Supplementing a bacterial suspension with beta-carotene increased bacterial growth, while this was not the case when lutein was applied, indicating that beta-carotene could be a positive regulator of plant growth promotion.","[Witzel, Katja; Baldermann, Susanne; Neugart, Susanne; Becker, Yvonne; Becker, Matthias; Berger, Beatrice; Schreiner, Monika; Ruppel, Silke] Leibniz Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Theodor Echtermeyer Weg 1, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany; [Strehmel, Nadine; Scheel, Dierk] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Baldermann, Susanne] Univ Potsdam, Inst Nutr Sci, Arthur Scheunert Allee 114-116, D-14558 Nuthetal, Germany; [Strehmel, Nadine] Fed Inst Forens & Social Med, Turmstr 21, D-10559 Berlin, Germany","Witzel, K (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Theodor Echtermeyer Weg 1, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany.",witzel@igzev.de,"Berger, Beatrice/H-8533-2018; Baldermann, Susanne/C-4292-2014; Becker, Yvonne E/N-7031-2016; Neugart, Susanne/B-3760-2014","Baldermann, Susanne/0000-0002-1501-4320; Neugart, Susanne/0000-0002-4574-6733; Schreiner, Monika/0000-0002-5629-4429; Grosch, Rita/0000-0002-7179-5715",German Leibniz association (PAKT project 'Chemical Communication in the Rhizosphere') [SAW-2011-IPB-3],"The technical assistance of Sabine Breitkopf, Andrea Jankowsky, Sylvia Kruger, Annett Platalla, Birgit Wernitz and Sieglinde Widiger is gratefully acknowledged.

Pyrosequencing was used to investigate the root-associated fungal communities of two dominant trees Salix caprea and Betula pendula along a primary successional chronosequence (12-, 20-, 30- and 50-year old sites) on a mine spoil bank in the Czech Republic. Ecological guilds were parsed to fungal OTUs and subsequent multivariate analyses revealed that communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF), fungal plant pathogens (PaF) and fungal root endophytes (EndF) changed statistically significantly along the successional chronosequence. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were very rare across all samples. EcMF and PaF communities were strongly related to the development of the entire plant community along the succession, while this relationship was much less pronounced for EndF communities. Early stage EcMF communities dominated by Pezizales were subsequently replaced by Thelephorales and Russulales in later successional sites. Positive correlation with site age was also found for EndF from order Helotiales. No significant differences were observed between the fungal communities of S. caprea and B. pendula in our study. We conclude that fungal taxa with tight ecological relationship to plants assemble with close feedback to plant communities, which change along the chronosequence, whereas communities of fungal endophytes develop more stochastically during the primary succession.

S. alterniflora invested 33% of newly fixed C-13 in shoots, which was a much higher amount than that in P. australis. For C-13 allocated to belowground, the roots of S. alterniflora had a higher transfer rate than those of P. australis. Roots of P. australis had significantly more (at least 48%) fixed C-13 than S. alterniflora roots. However, S. alterniflora tended to allocate 169% more C-13 to Gram-negative bacteria than P. australis did. Our results also demonstrated that newly fixed C-13 transferred to soil microfauna, even predators, at a high rate for both plant species. However, at least three times more living root-derived C was allocated to soil nematodes at the higher trophic level in native P. australis than in invasive S. alterniflora. These results suggest invasion with S. alterniflora has a large potential to increase soil C flow and turnover efficiency through partitioning newly photosynthate C at the plant-soil interface and in soil food webs.

Differences in ecosystem carbon density between forest edges and interiors were investigated, and how edge effects and plant community characteristics influence ecosystem carbon density explored. In forty-five 40 x 40 m plots within five forest fragments, ecosystem carbon density was significantly higher in interior forest plots than in edge plots. Ecosystem carbon density increased sharply from forest edge to interior. Aboveground biomass and mineral soils were the two largest contributors to the total ecosystem carbon pool in all types of plot. The proportion of total carbon density accounted for by aboveground biomass decreased (35.9%-33.1%) from core to edge plots, while the proportion accounted for by soils increased (38.8% to 46.7%). Hence, edge effects strongly influenced ecosystem carbon density. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of fengshui forests in regional carbon pools and provide data for developing and validating carbon cycling models for subtropical forests.","[Ma, Lei; Fu, Shenglei] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Jinming Ave, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Shen, Chunyu; Lou, Duo; Guan, Dongsheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Chunyu; Lou, Duo; Guan, Dongsheng] Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control &, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Ma, L (reprint author), Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Jinming Ave, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",qdmalei@sina.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41501568],Funding was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41501568).

In this study, we compared the amount of global DNA methylation in seeds of the gynodioecious plant Geranium sylvaticum in relation to the gender and the AMF status of the parents producing the seeds. The amount of DNA methylated was positively related to seed mass. Seeds produced by females had a similar proportion of methylated DNA regardless of the AMF status of the father siring the seed. By contrast, seeds from hermaphrodites had higher DNA methylation when sired by AMF fathers. We show to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that the AMF status of fathers can affect DNA methylation in seeds and that these changes in DNA methylation are further dependent on the gender of the mother producing the seeds.","[Varga, Sandra; Soulsbury, Carl D.] Univ Lincoln, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England","Varga, S (reprint author), Univ Lincoln, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",svarga@lincoln.ac.uk,"Soulsbury, Carl/P-1492-2019; Soulsbury, Carl D./F-3137-2010; Varga, Sandra/B-6044-2012","Soulsbury, Carl/0000-0001-8808-5210; Soulsbury, Carl D./0000-0001-8808-5210; Varga, Sandra/0000-0001-9799-714X",Marie Curie FellowshipEuropean Union (EU); Pump-Priming scheme at the University on Lincoln,This work was supported by a Marie Curie Fellowship and by a Pump-Priming scheme at the University on Lincoln to S.V.,,36,1,1,0,12,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Previous research has investigated the plant communities of R. aureum; however, little information is available regarding interspecific competition and underground soil microbial community composition. The objective of our study was to determine whether the presence of R. aureum creates a unique soil microbiome and to investigate the relationship between R. aureum and other plant species. Our study site ranged from 1,800 to 2,600m above sea level on the northern slope of the Changbai Mountain. The results show that the soil from sites with an R. aureum community had a higher abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and a higher resistance to pathogens than soils from sites without R. aureum. We emphasize that R. aureum promotes a unique soil microbial community structure that is distinct from those associated with other plants. Elevation and microbial biomass were the main influencing factors for plant community structure. Analysis of interspecific relationships reveals that R. aureum is negatively associated with most other dominant shrubs and herbs, suggesting interspecific competition. It is necessary to focus on other dominant species if protection and restoration of the R. aureum competition is to occur. In the future, more is needed to prove whether R. aureum decreases species diversity in the tundra ecosystems of Changbai Mountain.","[Wang, Xiaolong; Li, Lin; Zhao, Wei; Zhao, Jiaxin; Chen, Xia] Jilin Univ, Sch Life Sci, Natl & Local United Engn Lab Chinese Herbal Med B, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Chen, X (reprint author), Jilin Univ, Sch Life Sci, Natl & Local United Engn Lab Chinese Herbal Med B, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",chenxiajlu@163.com,,,,,,82,1,1,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, feedbacks between changes in litter input and soil carbon dynamics remain poorly understood in tropical and subtropical forests. This study aims to test whether the effects of litter manipulation on soil respiration differ between natural and plantation forests. Soil respiration, soil properties, fine root biomass and enzyme activity were measured in adjacent plots with doubling vs. eliminating litter input in both natural and plantation forests of Castanopsis carlesii in southern China. After only 3 years of litter manipulation, the magnitude of change in soil respiration was greater in response to a doubling of the litter input (+24%) than to the elimination of litter input (-15%) in the natural forest, possibly due to a positive priming effect on decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). The quick and intense priming effect was corroborated by elevated enzyme activities for five of the six enzymes analyzed. In contrast, the response to litter removal (-31%) was greater than the response to litter addition (1%; not significant) in the plantation forest. The lack of positive priming in the plantation forest may be related to its lower soil fertility, which could not meet the demand of soil microbes, and to its high clay content, which protected SOC from microbial attack. The positive priming effect in the natural forest but not plantation forest of C. carlesii is also consistent with the significant declines in total soil carbon observed following litter addition in the natural forest but not the plantation forest. Increases in aboveground litter production may trigger priming effects and subsequently transfer more soil carbon to atmospheric CO2 in the natural forest but not in the plantation forest with low fertility. Changes in litter inputs resulting from global change drivers may have different impacts on natural and plantation forests.","[Liu, Xiaofei; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Xiong, Decheng; Lin, Weisheng; Chen, Guangshui; Xie, Jinsheng; Li, Yiqing; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Teng-Chiu] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88,Sect 4,DingChow Rd, Taipei 11677, Taiwan; [Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, 8 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Li, Yiqing] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Honolulu, HI 96720 USA","Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Lin, TC (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, 88,Sect 4,DingChow Rd, Taipei 11677, Taiwan.",tclin@ntnu.edu.tw; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013","Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708; Lin, Teng-Chiu/0000-0003-1088-8771","National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954003]; Joint Fund for Promotion of Cross-strait Cooperation in Science and Technology [U1505233]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500407, 31500408]","This research was jointly supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954003), Joint Fund for Promotion of Cross-strait Cooperation in Science and Technology (U1505233) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31500407 and 31500408).",,56,11,13,6,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2017,418,2-Jan,,,,,141,151,,10.1007/s11104-017-3281-2,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FH5TO,WOS:000411232600011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hanslin, HM; Maehlurn, T; Saebo, A",,,,"Hanslin, Hans Martin; Maehlurn, Trond; Saebo, Arne",,,The response of Phragmites to fluctuating subsurface water levels in constructed stormwater management systems,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rooting depth; Fluctuating watertable; Biomass allocation; Wetland vegetation,ROOT-GROWTH; AUSTRALIS; DEPTH; BIOMASS; REED; SOIL; GROUNDWATER; TOLERANCE; MARSHES; GRASS,"Area-efficient constructed systems for stormwater management and bioretention may involve large fluctuations in subsurface water levels. Such fluctuations challenge vegetation by forcing roots to explore deeper layers to access water during dry periods. In a controlled experiment, we studied growth patterns and the ability of Phragmites australis roots to track subsurface water level fluctuations of differing amplitude and frequency in substrates with contrasting water-holding capacity. We found that P. australis was able to adjust its rooting pattern to considerable subsurface water level fluctuations (to well below 120 cm), but that substrate characteristics can restrict its ability to adjust to larger fluctuations. Fluctuation amplitude was the driving factor for plant growth and biomass allocation responses, while substrate characteristics and fluctuation frequency were less important. When not exposed to large water level fluctuations, P. australis grew larger shoots and only explored intermediate rooting depths. There was a negative relationship between root and rhizome biomass, showing a resource-based trade-off and short-term costs of adjusting rooting patterns to large water level fluctuations. These results indicate that P. australis is suited for systems with considerable subsurface water fluctuations, but constraints on its flexibility need to be investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the impact of grazing on soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), canopy conductance (Gc), and root water uptake in the Patagonian steppe. Studies were done in 3 sites along a gradient of grazing intensity. High grazing intensity increased the soil water storage by 24% and decreased the amount of water extracted from deep layers compared to the low grazing intensity. Grazing affected ET and its partitioning into transpiration (T) and evaporation. High shrub cover and Gc increased ET and T or ET partitioning in the heavily grazed site. Annual ET increased from 78% to 92% of the annual precipitation from the lowest to the highest grazing intensity, respectively. Total T was 21% higher in the highest intensity site compared to the lowest intensity site. Changes in Gc suggest that grazing modified the canopy architecture, and thus the response of vegetation to environmental factors. At the beginning of the growing season when moisture was high, Gc exhibited the highest value in the heavily grazed site, but a strong regulation of water losses was observed under drier conditions. This study emphasizes the need to assess simultaneously multiple factors for understanding regulatory mechanisms of grazing effects on hydrological processes. From a sustainable management point of view, we suggest that increasing the number of water sources, and thus spreading the sheep in a paddock, can enhance the stocking rate while maintaining soil water storage.","[Pereyra, Daniel A.; Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia S.; Scholz, Fabian G.] UNPSJB, Grp Estudios Biofis & Ecofisiol GEBEF, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Pereyra, Daniel A.; Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia S.; Scholz, Fabian G.] UNPSJB, CONICET, Inst Biociencias Patagonia INBIOP, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Ciano, Nicolas] INTA, RA-9600 Trelew, Chubut, Argentina; [Cristiano, Piedad M.; Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Ecol Genet & Evoluc Buenos Aires IEGEVA, Lab Ecol Func, RA-1425 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Scholz, FG (reprint author), UNPSJB, CONICET, Inst Biociencias Patagonia INBIOP, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina.",fgscholz@yahoo.com,,,"ANPCyT-FONCyTANPCyTFONCyT [2008-1202, 2010-0960, 2013-2426]; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA)","ANPCyT-FONCyT, Grant/Award Number: 2008-1202; 2010-0960; 2013-2426; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA)",,72,1,1,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,SEP,2017,10,6,,,,,,,UNSP e1850,10.1002/eco.1850,,,12,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FG7VL,WOS:000410633100012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Paudel, S; Benavides, JC; MacDonald, B; Longcore, T; Wilson, GWT; Loss, SR",,,,"Paudel, Shishir; Benavides, Juan C.; MacDonald, Beau; Longcore, Travis; Wilson, Gail W.

To assess factors influencing plant communities on San Clemente Island, USA, we conducted an islandwide vegetation survey in which we measured plant species richness and percent cover of native and non-native plants, as well as physical environmental variables, soil chemical properties, abundance of soil microbial functional groups (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]), and a human disturbance variable (distance to road). We found that total plant species richness decreased with increasing non-native plant cover, soil pH, and AMF abundance. Native plant cover increased with increasing distance to a major paved road and decreased with increasing soil moisture and pH. Non-native plant cover decreased with increasing distance to a major paved road and increased with increasing soil moisture, AMF abundance, and from southwest to northeast, a geographic/climatic gradient that represents increasing moisture. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination further illustrated that trends in plant community composition were correlated with elevation, distance to a major paved road, and soil moisture, organic matter, and ammonium. These results suggest complex effects of physical environmental, soil chemical, and human-related factors on plant community structure on an oceanic island, and moreover, that different factors affect cover of native and non-native plants. Notably, our observation of apparent moisture limitation of non-native plants suggests that, in some contexts, drought conditions can limit plant invasions and may even represent an opportunity for efficient control or eradication of invasive plants. The apparent negative effect of non-native plants on native plant cover and overall plant species richness represents a conservation concern for native biodiversity on oceanic islands and suggests the potential for community reassembly as invasive species increasingly dominate due to anthropogenic disturbances.","[Paudel, Shishir; Wilson, Gail W.

For example, her-bivory can induce plant defenses that affect subsequent interactions with herbivores, pathogens, mycorrhizae, and pollinators. Parasitic plants are present in most ecosystems, and play important roles in structuring communities. However, the effects of host herbivory on parasitic plants, and the potential mechanisms underlying such effects, are not well known. We conducted a greenhouse study to ask whether gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) damage, host cultivar, and their interaction affected preference of the stem parasite dodder (Cuscuta spp.) on cranberry hosts (Vaccinium macrocarpum). We then assessed the mechanisms that could underlie such effects by measuring induced changes in phytohormones and secondary compounds. We found that damage by gypsy moths delayed dodder attachment by approximately 0.3 days when dodder stems were added 2 days after damage, and reduced attachment by more than 50% when dodder stems were added 1 week after host plant damage. Gypsy moth damage significantly increased jasmonic acid (JA) levels, total volatile emissions, and the flavonol, quercetin aglycone, suggesting possible mechanisms underlying variation in dodder ability to locate or attach to hosts. Dodder preference also differed between cranberry cultivars, with the highest attachment on the cultivar that had significantly lower levels of total volatile emissions and total phenolic acids, suggesting that volatile composition and phenolics may mediate dodder preference. Our results indicate that herbivory can reduce subsequent attachment by a highly damaging parasitic plant, demonstrating the potential importance of early damage for shaping subsequent species interactions.","[Tjiurutue, Muvari C.; Adler, Lynn S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sandler, Hilary A.] UMass Cranberry Expt Stn, East Wareham, MA USA; [Kersch-Becker, Monica F.] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Anim, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Theis, Nina] Elms Coll, Biol Dept, Chicopee, MA USA; [Tjiurutue, Muvari C.] Univ Namibia, Dept Chem & Biochem, 340 Mandume Ndemufayo Ave, Pionierspark, Windhoek, Namibia","Adler, LS (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",lsadler@ent.umass.edu,,,Fulbright Fellowship; Faculty for the Future Fellowship; Plant Biology Graduate program; United States Department of Agriculture/Cooperative Research and Extension Services (Hatch) [MAS000411]; United States Department of Agriculture National Research InitiativeUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2008-02346],"The study was funded by Fulbright Fellowship (MCT), Faculty for the Future Fellowship (MCT), Plant Biology Graduate program (MCT), the United States Department of Agriculture/Cooperative Research and Extension Services (Hatch) MAS000411 (LSA) and United States Department of Agriculture National Research Initiative 2008-02346 (LSA).",,56,2,2,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2017,185,1,,,,,133,145,,10.1007/s00442-017-3915-3,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FG6NG,WOS:000410497400013,28803341,,,,10/31/19J,"De la Fuente, LM; Ovalle, JF; Arellano, EC; Ginocchio, R",,,,"De la Fuente, Luz M.; Ovalle, Juan F.; Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna",,,Use of alternative containers for promoting deep rooting of native forest species used for dryland restoration: the case of Acacia caven,IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Native Tree Domestication; Root Growth Potential; Root Morphology; Seedling Quality,WATER-STRESS; SEEDLING DEVELOPMENT; FIELD PERFORMANCE; TREE SEEDLINGS; ZONE SALINITY; QUERCUS-ILEX; NURSERY; MORPHOLOGY; GROWTH; SIZE,"The size of a container determines the development and quality of root systems. In the case of taprooted forest species used for dryland reforestation, deeper containers may favour early root development and, consequently, better soil profile colonization after outplanting. Although research on container design for worldwide tree species has been developed in the last decades, technical solutions for containerized forest species with a taproot system have been poorly documented. We present a case study using Acacia caven (Mol.) Mol., which has fast-growing taproots and long lateral and superficial roots. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different containers on rooting volume in the early morphological development of A. caven seedlings. Ten day-old seedlings were cultivated in five different PVC container types varying in volume, width and length (T440-Short, T440-Long, T880-Short, T880-Long, and T440-C), in a completely randomized design for one growing season. At the end of the study, whole seedling samples were destroyed to assess taproot length, lateral root biomass, and total root/shoot dry biomass. To evaluate the potential plant capacity for developing new roots, a subsequent experiment using the root growth potential test was performed successfully. Results showed that change in root volume distribution (short vs. elongated containers) had the greatest influence on seedling quality, whereas the size of container (small volume vs. large) was of minor importance. Elongated containers (35 cm to 40 cm in length) with self-pruning basal roots produced seedlings with smaller shoot/root ratios, longer root systems, and a greater ability to restart new root growth in deeper container strata. Elongated containers also prevented taproot deformation. The present study suggests that it would be appropriate to rethink container design for seedlings of deep-rooted xerophytic species destined for water-limited transplanting conditions.","[De la Fuente, Luz M.; Ovalle, Juan F.; Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, POB 8331150, Santiago, Chile; [Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, POB 7820436, Santiago, Chile","Ginocchio, R (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, POB 8331150, Santiago, Chile.; Ginocchio, R (reprint author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, POB 7820436, Santiago, Chile.",rosanna.ginocchio@uc.cl,"Arellano, Eduardo/N-6901-2014; Ginocchio, Rosanna/C-9637-2016","Arellano, Eduardo/0000-0002-2000-3386; Ginocchio, Rosanna/0000-0003-4089-8188",Chilean Research Center for Mining and Metallurgy (CIMM); CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 0002],"The authors would like to thank the Chilean Research Center for Mining and Metallurgy (CIMM) and the CONICYT FB 0002 (2014) for funding the study; Professors Eduardo Olate and Paulina Fernandez for their contribution to the present study; Elisabeth Trangolao, Elena Bustamante, Margaret Opazo and Marcela Jimenez for their help with the experiments; and Consuelo Gazitua for helping with graphical presentations.",,50,1,1,3,21,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,SEP,2017,10,,,,,,776,782,,10.3832/ifor2101-010,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,FF9VX,WOS:000409367600003,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Kivlin, SN; Lynn, JS; Kazenel, MR; Beals, KK; Rudgers, JA",,,,"Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Lynn, Joshua S.; Kazenel, Melanie R.; Beals, Kendall K.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.",,,Biogeography of plant-associated fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems: A meta-analysis,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,altitudinal gradients; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal fungi; ericoid mycorrhizal fungi; foliar endophytes; fungal distributions; root endophytes,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENTS; ENDOPHYTE DIVERSITY; GLOBAL CHANGE; RANGE SHIFTS; RESPONSES; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; FOREST,"Aim: Predicting the potential for climate change to disrupt host-microbe symbioses requires basic knowledge of the biogeography of these consortia. In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups. Main Conclusions: Meta-analysis revealed broad biogeographic patterns in plant-fungal symbiont abundance, diversity and composition that inform predictions of future distributions.","[Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Lynn, Joshua S.; Kazenel, Melanie R.; Beals, Kendall K.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Lynn, Joshua S.; Kazenel, Melanie R.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO USA","Rudgers, JA (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jrudgers@unm.edu,,"Beals, Kendall/0000-0001-5587-8214",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1354972],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB1354972",,60,11,12,4,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Although the dew phenomenon often occurs in the desert, whether plants can absorb and utilise this water source is still unknown. In this study, we tested the effects of 3 amounts of dew, that is, total natural amount of dew, half amount of natural dew, and no amount of (zero) dew, in order to investigate variations in functional traits and demographic traits in relation to the life history of an ephemeral plant Lappula semiglabra. Results showed that variations in functional traits including plant height, crown area, leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content, and net photosynthetic rate were significantly increased with increasing dew amount. Leaf water potential was significantly decreased, whereas root length and root diameter showed no significant differences among 3 amounts of dew. Demographic traits including survival rate, survival, total age, and mean life expectancy increased with increasing dew amount, whereas the vanish rate percentage, mortality rate, mortality, and fatal number decreased. In combination, our results showed that leaf and stem traits L. semiglabra related to dew absorption increased with increasing of dew amount, and hence, obtained more water, whereas root traits related to uptake of soil water remain unchanged. We conclude that leaves and stem of L. semiglabra can absorb and efficiently utilise dew as a water resource for better suitability in the arid desert region.","[Yang, Xiao-Dong; Lv, Guang-Hui; Ran, Qi-Yang; Gong, Xue-Wei; Wang, Fei; Liu, Zhi-Dong; Liu, Wei-Guo] Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao-Dong; Lv, Guang-Hui; Ran, Qi-Yang; Gong, Xue-Wei; Wang, Fei; Liu, Zhi-Dong; Liu, Wei-Guo] Xinjiang Univ, Inst Resources & Environm Sci, 660 Shengli Rd, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Lv, Guang-Hui] Xinjiang Univ, Inst Arid Ecol & Environm, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Zhoushan 316100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Ningbo 315114, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Qin, Lu] Xinjiang Acad Environm Protect Sci, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China","Yang, XD (reprint author), Xinjiang Univ, Inst Resources & Environm Sci, 660 Shengli Rd, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China.",xjyangxd@sina.com,"Zorger, Bianca/O-1015-2018; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Yang, Xiao-Dong/0000-0002-3553-2125","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB251601]; Youth science and technology innovation talents training project of Autonomous region [qn2015bs006, qn2015bs026]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500343, 31560131, 41571034, 31260112]","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China, Grant/Award Number: 2015CB251601; Youth science and technology innovation talents training project of Autonomous region, Grant/Award Number: qn2015bs006 and qn2015bs026; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31500343, 31560131, 41571034 and 31260112",,52,4,6,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,SEP,2017,10,6,,,,,,,UNSP e1858,10.1002/eco.1858,,,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FG7VL,WOS:000410633100002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pizano, C; Mangan, SA; Graham, JH; Kitajima, K",,,,"Pizano, Camila; Mangan, Scott A.; Graham, James H.; Kitajima, Kaoru",,,Host-specific effects of soil microbial filtrates prevail over those of arbuscular mycorrhizae in a fragmented landscape,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; coffee plantations; forest fragments; pastures; plant growth; plant-soil feedbacks; soil microbial filtrates; tropical montane forest,TREE SEEDLINGS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NEGATIVE FEEDBACK; SOUTH BRAZIL; PLANT; FUNGI; BIOTA; PATHOGENS; GROWTH,"Plant-soil interactions have been shown to determine plant community composition in a wide range of environments. However, how plants distinctly interact with beneficial and detrimental organisms across mosaic landscapes containing fragmented habitats is still poorly understood. We experimentally tested feedback responses between plants and soil microbial communities from adjacent habitats across a disturbance gradient within a human-modified tropical montane landscape. In a greenhouse experiment, two components of soil microbial communities were amplified; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and a filtrate excluding AMF spores from the soils of pastures (high disturbance), coffee plantations (intermediate disturbance), and forest fragments (low disturbance), using potted seedlings of 11 plant species common in these habitats (pasture grass, coffee, and nine native species). We then examined their effects on growth of these same 11 host species with reciprocal habitat inoculation. Most plant species received a similar benefit from AMF, but differed in their response to the filtrates from the three habitats. Soil filtrate from pastures had a net negative effect on plant growth, while filtrates from coffee plantations and forests had a net positive effect on plant growth. Pasture grass, coffee, and five pioneer tree species performed better with the filtrate from ""away"" (where these species rarely occur) compared to ""home"" (where these species typically occur) habitat soils, while four shade-tolerant tree species grew similarly with filtrates from different habitats. These results suggest that pastures accumulate species-specific soil enemies, while coffee plantations and forests accumulate beneficial soil microbes that benefit pioneer native plants and coffee, respectively. Thus, compared to AMF, soil filtrates exerted stronger habitat and host-specific effects on plants, being more important mediators of plant-soil feedbacks across contrasting habitats.","[Pizano, Camila; Kitajima, Kaoru] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pizano, Camila] Cenicafe, Biol Conservac, Km 4 Via Antigua, Chinchina Manizales, Colombia; [Mangan, Scott A.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Mangan, Scott A.; Kitajima, Kaoru] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Graham, James H.] Univ Florida, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; [Kitajima, Kaoru] Kyoto Univ, Div Forest & Biomat Sci Trop Forest Resource & En, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, Japan; [Pizano, Camila] Univ Icesi, Dept Biol, Cali, Colombia","Pizano, C (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Pizano, C (reprint author), Cenicafe, Biol Conservac, Km 4 Via Antigua, Chinchina Manizales, Colombia.; Pizano, C (reprint author), Univ Icesi, Dept Biol, Cali, Colombia.",cpizano@icesi.edu.co,"Kitajima, Kaoru/M-8521-2018","Kitajima, Kaoru/0000-0001-6822-8536",Compton Fellowship - Compton Foundation; Aerolineas Aeropobre,"This study was funded by the Compton Fellowship granted by the Compton Foundation to C.

Here we assess the question of topsoil storage time: how does stockpile age impact plant biomass and soil microbial activity, particularly root symbionts such as rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)? Working in Western Australia and in sandy soils, we grew a legume species Acacia saligna (Fabaceae) in one-, two-, three-, five- and ten-year-old stockpile soils under controlled glasshouse conditions. We assessed whether plant biomass, specific root length, and root diameter decreased with stockpile age. Further, we investigated how stockpile age affected the distribution and the number of effective nodules, nodule biomass and AMF colonization in roots. These above and belowground traits were chosen because they reflect the A. saligna response to growing in soils stockpiled for 1-10 years. We hypothesised that in older stockpiles there would be fewer rhizobial and AMF propagules which would constrain A. saligna growth, whereas in younger stockpiles there would be more rhizobial and AMF propagules, and A. saligna growth would be facilitated via these root symbionts. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that total plant biomass was the lowest but AMF percent colonization was the highest when A. saligna was grown in ten-year-old soils, suggesting that AMF spores and hyphae are present in old stockpiles. Our results demonstrate that AMF communities may be initially disrupted by soil disturbance and storage, and then begin to re-establish between 5-10 years after stockpiling. However, other soil microbial communities, such as fungal pathogens that were not assessed in this study may have been responsible for decreased A. saligna biomass in older soils. Further research, particularly on other soil microbial communities, is needed to understand restoration success using stockpiled soil older than ten years.","[Birnbaum, Christina] Tulane Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Ecol & Evolut, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Bradshaw, Laura Elizabeth; Ruthrof, Katinka Xoliswa; Fontaine, Joseph Benjamin] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Environm & Conservat Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia","Birnbaum, C (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Ecol & Evolut, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",chbirnbaum@gmail.com,"Fontaine, Joseph/O-2758-2019","Fontaine, Joseph/0000-0002-6515-7864; Ruthrof, Katinka/0000-0003-2038-2264; Birnbaum, Christina/0000-0002-2511-1845",Tronox Ltd.,We are thankful to reviewers for helpful comments that greatly improved the quality of the manuscript.

Whereas the abiotic controls of SRH have been extensively studied, the influence of plant traits is less well characterised. We used field experiments and a modelling approach to test the relative influence of plant traits on SRH in lowland tropical forest in French Guiana. We measured leaf- and root litter traits for five common tree species and conducted a root decomposition experiment to evaluate the influence of root chemistry on decay rates. We measured SRH in trenched plots and used our field measurements to parameterize and test the Century model of soil C dynamics. Overall, the Century model performed well in simulating SRH, and species-specific root decomposition in Century corresponded well to decomposition rates measured in situ. Root litter characterized by low lignin-to-nitrogen ratios decomposed more rapidly than low-quality root litter during the first 6 months. Model runs over different time scales revealed that litter quality substantially influenced SRH on an annual time-scale by determining the rates of root- and leaf litter decomposition. However, litter mass had an overriding influence on SRH over the longer term in 20-year model runs. Synthesis Using simple plant trait data to parameterise the Century model, we were able to accurately simulate changes in SRH in a lowland tropical forest. Our results suggest that this approach could be used to predict changes in tropical soil C dynamics under global change scenarios by including data on changes in plant productivity and C inputs to the soil (for example litterfall and root turnover).","[Brechet, Laetitia] Univ Lancaster, Dept Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Brechet, Laetitia; Goret, Jean-Yves] INRA, UMR 0745, Ecol Fortes Guyane, Campus Agron,BP 709, Kourou 97387, French Guiana; [Le Dantec, Valerie] Univ Paul Sabatier, Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere, UMR 5126, F-31401 Toulouse, France; [Ponton, Stephane; Bonal, Damien; Epron, Daniel] INRA, Ctr Nancy, UMR 1137, Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Ponton, Stephane; Bonal, Damien; Epron, Daniel] Univ Lorraine, Fac Sci, UMR 1137, Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Sayer, Emma] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Sayer, Emma] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, POB 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama; [Sayer, Emma] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Freycon, Vincent] CIRAD, UPR Forets & Soc, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Roy, Jacques] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Roy, Jacques] CNRS, UPS 3248, Ecotron Europeen Montpellier, 1 Chemin Rioux,Campus Baillarguet, F-34980 Montferrier Sur Lez, France","Brechet, L (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.; Brechet, L (reprint author), INRA, UMR 0745, Ecol Fortes Guyane, Campus Agron,BP 709, Kourou 97387, French Guiana.",l.brechet@lancaster.ac.uk,"Sayer, Emma/B-2514-2010","Sayer, Emma/0000-0002-3322-4487; Brechet, Laetitia/0000-0002-2744-8820","French ""Ministere de l'Education Nationale et de la Recherche""; French National Research Agency through Laboratory of Excellence ARBREFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12- LAB-XARBRE-01]; European Research Council under European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [307888]","We wish to thank Cyril Douthe and Louis Maire for their help during data acquisition in the field and laboratory.

Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is driven by microorganisms that are in turn grazed by metazoan animals. Microbial populations and animal food webs in the soil are both at least partly dependent on labile organic carbon provided by plant roots. In this study, we described the vertical distribution of total C-org, microbial biomass, root biomass and the density of soil arthropods in deep layers (down to 110-210 cm depth) of three soils formed under the south taiga, broadleaved forest and forested steppe vegetation. By modeling the vertical distribution of animal population we estimated the soil depths above which 90% of the animals live (SD90 values). These values were the highest for Collembola, Protura and Symphyla (43-116, 69-144 and 54-95 cm, respectively, across the study locations), but relatively low for Acari (32-55 cm). In the forested steppe, less than 50% of all microarthropods and less than 10% of all insects inhabited litter and the uppermost 10 cm of mineral soil. Using generalized linear mixed-effect models we showed that the distribution of Collembola in the subsoil (below 30 cm) depended on root biomass and total Corg content, while the distribution of mites was affected by total Corg content and microbial biomass. The density of collembolans correlated significantly with root biomass both in the upper and lower parts of the soil profile. This suggests that soil fauna are involved in deep soil C cycling largely via grazing on root associated microorganisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Ecosystem functioning relies heavily on below-ground processes, which are largely regulated by plant fine-roots and their functional traits. However, our knowledge of fine-root trait distribution relies to date on local-and regional-scale studies with limited numbers of species, growth forms and environmental variation. 2. We compiled a world-wide fine-root trait dataset, featuring 1115 species from contrasting climatic areas, phylogeny and growth forms to test a series of hypotheses pertaining to the influence of plant functional types, soil and climate variables, and the degree of manipulation of plant growing conditions on species fine-root trait variation. Most particularly, we tested the competing hypotheses that fine-root traits typical of faster return on investment would be most strongly associated with conditions of limiting versus favourable soil resource availability. We accounted for both data source and species phylogenetic relatedness. 3. We demonstrate that: (i) Climate conditions promoting soil fertility relate negatively to fine-root traits favouring fast soil resource acquisition, with a particularly strong positive effect of temperature on fine-root diameter and negative effect on specific root length (SRL), and a negative effect of rainfall on root nitrogen concentration; (ii) Soil bulk density strongly influences species fine-root morphology, by favouring thicker, denser fine-roots; (iii) Fine-roots from herbaceous species are on average finer and have higher SRL than those of woody species, and N-2-fixing capacity positively relates to root nitrogen; and (iv) Plants growing in pots have higher SRL than those grown in the field. 4. Synthesis. This study reveals both the large variation in fine-root traits encountered globally and the relevance of several key plant functional types and soil and climate variables for explaining a substantial part of this variation. Climate, particularly temperature, and plant functional types were the two strongest predictors of fine-root trait variation. High trait variation occurred at local scales, suggesting that wide-ranging below-ground resource economics strategies are viable within most climatic areas and soil conditions.","[Freschet, Gregoire T.; Tucker, Caroline M.; Violle, Cyrille; Fort, Florian; Urban-Mead, Katherine R.; Roumet, Catherine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5175,Univ Paul Valery Montpellier EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonctionnelle & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Valverde-Barrantes, Oscar J.; Blackwood, Christopher B.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Craine, Joseph M.] Jonah Ventures, Manhattan, KS 66502 USA; [McCormack, M.

Optimal defence allocation theory (ODT) is one of the most prominent theoretical frameworks to explain the allocation of defence compounds within plants. It predicts that the most valuable and vulnerable plant organs have the highest levels of chemical defence. The ODT has been well worked out and experimentally tested for shoot defences, but not for root defences. To assess if ODT principles apply similarly to roots and shoots, we examined glucosinolates in above-ground and below-ground organs of nine plant species belonging to two families. 2. In order to evaluate whether ODT equally applies to shoot and root organs, we designed a conceptual model in which above-ground and below-ground organs were assigned to orders of importance to plant performance. We hypothesized that organs constituting the plant's core structure are better protected than more distal organs. 3. The nine plant species were cultivated, and their roots and shoots were harvested and divided into three orders for glucosinolate analysis. Using a specialist (Delia radicum) and a generalist (Amphimallon solstitiale) root herbivore, we also experimentally tested the hypothesis that the generalist herbivore prefers to feed on fine roots (FRs) with a low glucosinolate concentration, while the specialist prefers taproots (TRs) with a high glucosinolate concentration. 4. We found that both in roots and shoots, the higher ordered core structural organs (TRs and stems) had the highest levels of glucosinolates. Below-ground, TRs and lateral roots were better protected than the more distal, and less costly, FRs in seven out of nine species tested. The specialist root herbivore preferred feeding on the highly defended TRs, which is in line with what has been found for above-ground specialist herbivores. Moreover, the glucosinolate concentration in roots overall was significantly higher than that in shoots. 5. Synthesis. These results support the hypothesis that Optimal defence allocation theory (ODT) generally applies to glucosinolate allocation in above-ground and below-ground organs and may mainly serve to maintain the integrity of the main plant structure. Moreover, it suggests that above-ground and below-ground insect herbivores independently exert similar selection pressures on defence allocation patterns in roots and shoots.","[Tsunoda, Tomonori; Krosse, Sebastian; van Dam, Nicole M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Mol Interact Ecol, IWWR, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Tsunoda, Tomonori] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1-1 Minamiosawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Krosse, Sebastian] B WARE Res Ctr BV, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Dam, Nicole M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [van Dam, Nicole M.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Tsunoda, T (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",tomonori.tsunoda@idiv.de,"van Dam, Nicole/B-3281-2008","van Dam, Nicole/0000-0003-2622-5446; Tsunoda, Tomonori/0000-0002-1163-2893",Tokyo Metropolitan University; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118],"Mr. G.M. van der Weerden and colleagues of the Plant Science and Molecular Interaction Ecology (formerly Ecogenomics) group of Radboud University helped with growing the plants and the experiments.

A recent sampling revealed that only a few fungal groups, as defined by internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence similarity, dominate culturable root endophytic communities of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. plants across Europe. Strains of these fungi display a broad phenotypic and functional diversity, which suggests a genetic variability masked by ITS clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The aims of this study were to identify how genetic similarity patterns of these fungi change across environments and to evaluate their ability to disperse and adapt to ecological conditions. A first ITS-based haplotype analysis of ten widespread OTUs mostly showed a low to moderate genotypic differentiation, with the exception of a group identified as Cadophora sp. that was highly diverse. A multilocus phylogeny based on additional genetic loci (partial translation elongation factor 1 alpha, beta-tubulin and actin) and amplified fragment length polymorphism profiling of 185 strains representative of the five dominant OTUs revealed a weak association of genetic differences with geography and environmental conditions, including bioclimatic and soil factors. Our findings suggest that dominant culturable root endophytic fungi have efficient dispersal capabilities, and that their distribution is little affected by environmental filtering. Other processes, such as inter-and intraspecific biotic interactions, may be more important for the local assembly of their communities.","[Glynou, Kyriaki; Kia, Sevda Haghi; Thines, Marco; Macia-Vicente, Jose G.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany; [Glynou, Kyriaki; Kia, Sevda Haghi; Thines, Marco; Macia-Vicente, Jose G.] Integrat Fungal Res Cluster IPF, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ali, Tahir; Thines, Marco] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany","Glynou, K (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany.",glynouk@gmail.com,"Macia-Vicente, Jose G./I-5665-2019; Ali, Tahir/S-2043-2016","Macia-Vicente, Jose G./0000-0002-7174-7270; Ali, Tahir/0000-0003-2371-0884",LOEWE (Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz) of the state of Hesse,We thank three anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions to improve this manuscript.

We assessed above- and belowground plant biomass stocks at 11 sites in three regions, representing 12- to 46-year-old spruce plantations established on clear-cut areas in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. Biomass and C stocks of trees, understory vegetation, and forest floor litter were determined from plot-level inventories and destructive sampling. Fine root (< 2 mm) biomass and mineral soil organic C (SOC) stock were estimated from soil cores. Tree biomass was quantified using allometric equations based on diameter at breast height (DBH) and height (H). Plant biomass C stocks in spruce plantations rapidly increased from 12 to 20 years at a rate of 7.8 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), but decreased from 25 to 46 years at a rate of 0.79 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). SOC stocks in spruce plantations gradually decreased from 12 to 46 years at a rate of 4.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Total C stock in the ecosystem remained unchanged for the first 20 years after the planting of spruce on cutovers, because the buildup of C stock in spruce biomass during the first 20 years was offset by the decrease in SOC. From 21 to 46 years after the reforestation, ecosystem C stock even decreased at a rate of 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The contribution of the understory vegetation, forest floor litter, and fine root to ecosystem C stock was low (< 5.0 %) in the spruce plantations. Ecosystem C stock in the spruce forest established on the cutover in the eastern Tibetan Plateau was related to stand age. During the first 20 years, this ecosystem was C neutral. However, aged (20-46 years) spruce plantation ecosystem can be a C source if no management was implemented to revitalize tree growth, promote understory vegetation, and enhance SOC accumulation.","[Pang, Xueyong; Huang, Junsheng; Zhao, Qingxia; Feng, Defeng; Bao, Weikai] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Junsheng; Zhao, Qingxia; Feng, Defeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat & Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichu, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Guanglong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tian, Guanglong] Metropolitan Water Reclamat Dist Greater Chicago, Monitoring & Res Dept, Environm Monitoring & Res Div, Lue Hing R&D Complex,6001 W Pershing Rd, Cicero, IL 60804 USA; IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 3201 S Dearborn St, Chicago, IL 60616 USA","Pang, XY; Bao, WK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",pangxy@cib.ac.cn; baowk@cib.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270492]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS [XDA05070306]; National Science & Technology Pillar Program in 12th Five-year Plan of China [2011BAC09B04-02],"We thank the subject editor, two anonymous reviewers, and editor-in-chief for their valuable comments and suggestions on the manuscript of the paper.

Five-day intervals of exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) ranging 1.0-1.8 times ambient did not affect F-CO2. F-CO2 did not decrease until 4 months after termination of the long-term eCO(2) treatment, longer than the 10 days observed for decrease of F-CO2 after experimental blocking of C flow to belowground, but shorter than the similar to 13 months it took for increase of F-CO2 following the initiation of eCO(2). The reduction of F-CO2 upon termination of enrichment (similar to 35%) cannot be explained by the reduction of leaf area (similar to 15%) and associated carbohydrate production and allocation, suggesting a disproportionate contraction of the belowground ecosystem components; this was consistent with the reductions in base respiration and F-CO2-temperature sensitivity. These asymmetric responses pose a tractable challenge to process-based models attempting to isolate the effect of individual processes on F-CO2.","[Kim, Dohyoung; Oren, Ram; Clark, James S.; Palmroth, Sari] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC USA; [Kim, Dohyoung] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Oishi, A.

The coastal dune grass Ammophila arenaria has been moved around the world. We sampled A. arenaria roots in its native range in the United Kingdom, and in Australia and New Zealand where it is invasive. The co-occurring native dune grass Leymus arenarius was also sampled in the United Kingdom, and the native dune grass Spinifex sericeus was sampled in Australia and New Zealand. A. arenaria associates with root fungal communities in its invasive range that are richer than those in the United Kingdom, and richer than those in co-occurring native grasses, demonstrating that exotic plants are not necessarily depauperate in fungal associates. Most of the dominant OTUs associating with A. arenaria were shared among all three geographic regions. However, community composition varied among regions, with differences in temperature, nitrogen and pH correlating with community change. Within regions, community composition varied among dunes, although the majority of sequences obtained were in OTUs that were detected in multiple dunes. Host plant species identity influenced fungal community composition, although the majority of the data were in OTUs that were shared between hosts. While the roots sampled appeared healthy, many of the dominant fungi recovered are potentially pathogenic. This study demonstrates that many fungi are widely dispersed, and that introduced plants are likely to associate with functionally diverse fungal communities that include species from their native ranges. However root-associated fungal community composition is variable, even at regional and local scales in a common plant in a common environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated total concentrations of Ca, magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) in both soil and fresh leaf litter in eight plantation stands of Cryptomeria japonica divided into two groups of highly contrasting soil acid buffering capacity (ABC). In addition to conventional methods, we used a double-crystal high resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF) spectrometer to determine Ca fractions in soils with low and high ABC. Total Ca had accumulated in the 0-10 cm depth horizons of the high-ABC soils, but not in the low-ABC soils. The exchangeable Ca concentration was correlated with total Ca concentration in the 0-10 cm depth of the low-ABC soils. Calcium-K alpha(1,2) emission spectra of the 0-10 cm soils obtained by HRXRF spectrometry separated the total Ca into two fractions, suggesting that the predominant Ca constituents had either passed through biological processes or were derived from weathering hydration in both the high- and low-ABC soils. Calcium concentration in the fresh leaf litter was significantly lower in the stands with low-ABC soil than in those with high-ABC soil and was positively correlated with soil exchangeable Ca concentration in the low-ABC stands; no such correlation was observed in the high-ABC stands. Exchangeable Ca pools in the 0-10 cm depth range were equal to or less than the annual input of Ca via leaf litterfall in the low-ABC stands, but were seven times the annual input in the high-ABC soils. These results suggested that the accumulation of Ca in the upper soil occurs via the process of Ca circulation within C. japonica ecosystems, and that sufficient supply of Ca for tree needs was accompanied by the large accumulation of available Ca by C. japonica in the high-ABC soils. Nevertheless, it is likely that only small amounts of Ca were circulated in the stands on low-ABC soil. The lack of Ca accumulation in the surface soil and the accompanying tight circulation of Ca in the plant-soil system may explain the observed positive feedback in which ABC is gradually reduced in low-ABC soils.

We explored the impacts of natural and simulated root herbivory on seedlings of three boreal forest-forming trees, Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula pendula. We compared the effects of natural herbivory and mechanical damage by placing one larva of the common cockchafer, Melolontha melolontha, of different instars (to manipulate root loss) into a pot with a oneyear -old seedling or we excised a portion of the roots by inserting a 13-mm diameter cork borer into the soil. During the experiment, which lasted from 2 to 8 weeks, the larvae consumed 53-73% of root biomass, whereas the mechanical damage treatment removed 30-40% of roots. Seedling mortality was low (5%) across all treatments, but the aboveground biomass decreased by 3-43% due to natural herbivory and by 6-30% due to mechanical damage. The M. melolontha larvae consumed a larger amount of roots from B. pendula than from either P. sylvestris or P. abies, but the larvae showed similar relative growth rates and mass gains, indicating a different efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI). The values of ECI calculated for larvae of M. melolontha (2.3-3.5%) appeared much lower than the 17% reported earlier for larvae of foliage-feeding beetles, presumably due to the high energetic cost of locomotion in the soil. Consequently, root-feeding insects consume much more plant biomass than leaf-feeding insects do to gain similar body mass, and therefore they inflict relatively more damage to plants per unit of mass gained. Based on the biomass of insect herbivores in European forests, we estimate that they consume 0.5% of the available fine root biomass. The effects of low levels of root damage on growth and reproduction of woody plants remain virtually unknown, emphasising the need for studies of plant and ecosystem-level effects of minor but chronic root herbivory.","[Kozel, Alexander V.] Belarusian State Technol Univ, Dept Forest Protect & Wood Sci, Sverdlova 13a, Minsk, BELARUS; [Zvereva, Elena L.; Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland","Kozlov, MV (reprint author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland.",mikoz@utu.fi,"Zvereva, Elena L./M-8490-2016; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013","Zvereva, Elena L./0000-0003-2934-3421; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [276671],The study was supported by the Academy of Finland (project 276671).

Knowledge of the soil water storage (SWS) within soil profiles in black locust stands is thus critical for optimization of forest management for sustainable production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal stability of SWS to identify the most time-stable locations (MTSLs) for reliably estimating the mean SWS and to further investigate the factors influencing its temporal stability. The SWS values of various soil layers (0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 m) were measured from May 2014 to October 2015 at 70 locations along two 187-m long transects on a hillslope covered with black locust in the Loess Plateau, China. A total of 18 SWS datasets were collected over the period of measurement. Results indicated that the temporal variation of spatial mean SWS decreased and the spatial variation of SWS increased with increasing soil depth. A strong temporal persistence in all soil layers was demonstrated by high Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (P < 0.01), with the temporal stability in deep soil layers relatively more stable than in shallow layer. Among four methods (MRD, mean relative difference; SDRD, standard deviation of relative difference; ITS, index of temporal stability; and MABE, mean absolute bias error) used to identify the MTSLs for the estimation of the mean SWS, the ITS provided the best results. The MTSLs identified in diverse layers of the first transect were then used to successfully predict the mean SWS along the second transect (R-2 > 0.91). Elevation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, leaf area index, and fine root area density were the major factors influencing the temporal stability of SWS. The results of this study were useful for estimating mean SWS and could improve soil water management and hydrological applications in sloping black locust forested areas of the Loess Plateau.","[Duan, Liangxia; Zhang, Zhongdian; Zhang, Luodan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Duan, Liangxia; Huang, Mingbin; Zhang, Zhongdian; Zhang, Luodan] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China","Huang, MB (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",hmbd@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundations of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571130082, 41390463]","Financial assistance for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 41571130082 and 41390463).

Therefore, it is important to estimate the biomass stocks of plantations precisely in the context of carbon management. Previous studies in India have focused on development of allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) through harvesting younger trees (up to 14 yr) only or on studies with small sample sizes without assessing model bias. The objective of this study was to develop biomass estimation models for different tree components in rubber plantations and assess model predictive performance at the stand level. Methods: A total of 67 trees were harvested from plantations of different ages (6, 15, 27 and 34 yr) in North East India and their diameter at 200 cm (D), height and dry weights of different tree components were recorded. The data were used for evaluation of H-D and biomass estimation models at the stand level. Results: The Michaelis-Menten function was found to be the most appropriate model for estimating tree height among 10 commonly used H-D models. For estimation of AGB and coarse root biomass, a model that involves tree volume (i.e. (DH)-H-2) was found to provide better prediction than either D or H alone or a model that combines H, D and stand density. The estimated AGB varied from 28 Mg.ha(-1) in 6 yr. old plantation to 169 Mg.ha(-1) in 34 yr. old plantations. The coarse root biomass was estimated at 4 Mg.ha(-1) for 6 yr. old plantation and 12 Mg.ha(-1) for 34 yr. old stands. Conclusions: It is concluded that models involving tree volume are more appropriate for regional level biomass estimation than simple power-law models for individual stands. We recommend that the power-law model should not be used for estimation of AGB in plantations at different growth stages because power-law parameters can be biased due to data truncation.","[Brahma, Biplab; Nath, Arun Jyoti; Das, Ashesh Kumar] Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar 788011, Assam, India; [Sileshi, Gudeta W.] Plot 1244 Ibex Hill, Lusaka, Zambia","Nath, AJ (reprint author), Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar 788011, Assam, India.",arunjyotinath@gmail.com,,,"DST, GOIDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [DST/IS-STAC/CO2-SR-224/14(c)-AICP-AFOLU-1]","We gratefully acknowledge the owners (Mr. Goutam Nandi and Mr. Kabir Uddin Ahmed) of the Hevea plantations for allowing us to harvest required number of trees from their plantations.

To test the role of tree roots in weathering bedrock, we excavated four pits along a catena in a shale-dominated catchment at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in central Pennsylvania. We measured a variety of biological, physical, and chemical properties including: 1) root density, distribution, and respiration, 2) soil gas, and 3) elemental compositions, mineralogy, and morphology of soil, rock, and rock fracture fill at ridge top, mid-slope, toe slope, and valley floor sites. As expected, root density dedined rapidly with depth; nevertheless, fine roots were present in rock fractures even in the deepest, least weathered shale sampled (similar to 180 cm below the land surface). Root densities in shale fractures were comparable between the ridge top and mid-slope pits. However, they were significantly lower in the toe-slope, despite increasing rock fracture densities, which is likely due to a shallower water table depth at the downslope site. Average root respiration (per mass of dry root tissue) in rock fractures was comparable to rates in the soil. Thus, the total flux of CO2 from root respiration tracked root densities, decreasing with depth. Potential microbial respiration, estimated as the laboratory C mineralization potential, was about an order of magnitude lower than measured root respiration in both the soil and shale fractures. Roots were only observed in large aperture (>50 mu m) shale fractures that were filled with particulate material. The fill in these fractures was mineralogically and geochemically similar to the lowest soil horizons with respect to clay composition, element mobility, extractable dissolved organic C (DOC), inorganic N-species, and potentially mineralizable C and N, while total C and total N values for the fracture fill were similar to the shale bedrock. In the bulk soil, depletion profiles (Al, Fe, K, Mg, and Si) relative to unweathered shale reflected characteristic weathering of illite and vermiculized chlorite to kaolinite and are similar between soils and fracture fill. Such similarities indicate that the fracture coatings are likely the result of pedogenic processes that occur at depth in the fractures rather than translocation of soil particles downward into the fractures. Overall, our data suggest that roots and fill in shale fractures down to similar to 180 cm are qualitatively similar to those in surface soil horizons. Thus, the deepest manifestation of the chemical depletion profiles observed in the pits consists of the rock fracture fill, and this fill is present at low concentrations with similarly low concentrations of fine roots.

Changes in climatic conditions, especially drought as envisaged by climate change projections, could affect the establishment of new individuals that are responsible for ensuring the persistence of species and plant communities. The aim was to study the main morpho-functional traits related to water use and drought resistance of native plant species from Ecuadorian ecosystems during imposed drought periods. Seedlings of six native species representative of the Ecuadorian Andes were studied: lower montane evergreen forest (Alnus acuminata and Cedrela montana), montane cloud forest (Podocarpus sprucei and Aegiphila ferruginea) and montane dry shrubland (Schinus molle and Caesalpinia spinosa). Morphological characterisation, a root growth capacity test and stomatal conductance measurements during two controlled drought periods were used to investigate biomass allocation patterns, the root system morphology and gas exchange patterns of species, respectively. The main results indicated that species-specific differences in morpho-functional traits and allocation patterns determined responses to water availability and drought conditions. Low relative growth rate, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area, and high specific root length, were related to drought-resistant species as P. sprucei and C. spinosa. In contrast, a high or moderate relative growth rate, leaf area and root biomass, but low specific root length as in A. ferruginea, S. molle, C. montana, were related to lower resistance to drought conditions. Despite A. acuminata showed high specific root length, it was reported as a species sensitive to drought. Overall, patterns of stomatal conductance, linked to biomass allocation patterns and root system morphology, especially specific root length, seemed to be related to differences in vulnerability to drought in these species. Drought response was independent of species habitats. Unexpectedly, P. sprucei, belonging to montane cloud forest showed higher drought resistance than S. molle, belonging to montane dry shrubland.

Less is known, however, about the relationship between N and RS in roots of different branch orders within an individual tree along a vertical soil profile; this is especially true in trees with contrasting life strategies, such as pioneer Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) vs mid-successional sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.). In the present research, the impact of root branch order, as represented by those with absorptive vs transporting ability, and soil genetic horizon on root N, RS and the N-RS relationship was examined. Mean RS and total N concentration differed significantly among root branch orders and was significantly higher in absorptive roots than in transporting roots. The soil genetic horizon differentially affected root RS in Scots pine vs sessile oak. The genetic horizon mostly affected RS in absorptive roots of Scots pine and transporting roots in sessile oak. Root N was the highest in absorptive roots and most affected by soil genetic horizon in both tree species. Root N was not correlated with soil N, although N levels were higher in roots growing in fertile soil genetic horizons. Overall, RS in different root branch orders was positively correlated with N in both species. The N-RS relationship in roots, pooled by soil genetic horizon, was significant in both species, but was only significant in sessile oak when roots were pooled by root branch order. In both tree species, a significant interaction was found between the soil genetic horizon and root branch order with root function; however, species-specific responses were found. Both root N, which was unaffected by soil N, and the positive N-RS relationship consistently observed in different genetic horizons suggest that root function prevails over environmental factors, such as soil genetic horizon.","[Trocha, Lidia K.; Kutczynska, Paulina; Mucha, Joanna; Zadworny, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Bulaj, Bartosz; Rutkowski, Pawel] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland","Trocha, LK (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",lktrocha@gmail.com,"Rutkowski, Pawel/N-6464-2019","Rutkowski, Pawel/0000-0003-3614-8923; Zadworny, Marcin/0000-0002-7352-5786; Bulaj, Bartosz/0000-0002-8945-1355; Mucha, Joanna/0000-0002-1290-9639","National Science Centre (Poland) [2011/01/D/NZ8/01,760]; Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","This research was supported by a grant (2011/01/D/NZ8/01,760) from the National Science Centre (Poland) to L.K.T. and by the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.",,62,0,0,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2017,37,8,,,,,1055,1068,,10.1093/treephys/tpx096,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,FF8ET,WOS:000409249000007,28903525,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Lang, M; Hanslin, HM; Kollmann, J; Wagner, T",,,,"Lang, Marion; Hanslin, Hans Martin; Kollmann, Johannes; Wagner, Thomas",,,Suppression of an invasive legume by a native grass - High impact of priority effects,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; Fertilization; Grass; Priority-effect; Restoration; Rhizobia,BROOM CYTISUS-SCOPARIUS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; PLANT; COMPETITION; SHRUB; POPULATIONS; INTENSITY; ARRIVAL; GROWTH,"Nitrogen-limited ecosystems are threatened by extensive spread of broom (Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link), a European leguminous shrub that is invasive in several countries. The establishment of invading species may, however, be suppressed by competition from native vegetation. The neighbor impact of the grass Festuca rubra subsp. commutata Gaudin on the performance of C. scoparius was studied in a greenhouse experiment with different arrival order, under low and high nitrogen supply, and with or without inoculation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Aboveground biomass of both species was measured after a six-months establishment period, and after a five-months regrowth period. In both periods, presence of F. rubra reduced the performance of C. scoparius as indicated by negative neighbor-effect intensity indices (NInt(A)). During the establishment period the competitive impact of F. rubra was highest, when planted before C. scoparius, followed by synchronous and late planting. Inoculation with rhizobia and low fertilization decreased the competitive impact of F. rubra. After cutting and regrowth priority effects of F. rubra were still visible. Interaction between the two study species was not affected anymore by inoculation, but strongly by fertilization, with highest competitive impact of F. rubra on C. scoparius under high nitrogen fertilization. In both study periods biomass of C. scoparius was negatively correlated with biomass of F. rubra. Our study provides knowledge about competition processes, which help to improve conservation and restoration measures regarding the spread of C. scoparius. Early sowing of a native grass can help to suppress the invasive species at an early stage. Competitive impact of the grass might be strengthened by high nitrogen availability.

C. heratensis and C. foliolosa were exposed to combinations of Ni (0, or 20 mu M) and PEG (0, -0.3, or -0.9 MPa) in a full factorial, replicated randomized block design. Results were analyzed using 3-way ANOVA. Ni improved growth, enhanced osmoprotectant synthesis, and decreased oxidative stress in C. heratensis, but had insignificant, or deleterious effects on the same parameters in C. foliolosa. The second order Ni*PEG*species interactions were usually significant, demonstrating that the species responded distinctly to combined exposure to PEG and excess Ni. In most cases this was due to additive deleterious effects of Ni in PEG-treated C. foliolosa, i.e. on growth, shoot water status and stress markers, and beneficial effects or no effects of Ni in PEG-treated C. heratensis. In the absence of Ni exposure, the species were approximately equally tolerant to PEG-simulated drought. Under PEG exposure, Ni positively affected the performance of C. heratensis, but had additive deleterious effects in C. foliolosa. C. heratensis does not only exhibit Ni hypertolerance, associated with a strongly decreased root-to-shoot translocation, but also an enhanced requirement for Ni, particularly when under PEG exposure, in comparison with C. foliolosa.","[Salehi Eskandari, Behrooz; Ghaderian, Seyed Majid] Univ Isfahan, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran; [Schat, Henk] Vrije Univ, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Ecol Sci, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Ghaderian, S (reprint author), Univ Isfahan, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Esfahan 8174673441, Iran.",ghaderian@sci.ui.ac.ir,"Schat, Henk/AAB-8723-2019",,Plant Antioxidants Center of Excellence (PACE) University of Isfahan,We would like to thank the Graduate School of University of Isfahan for providing research facilities.

In this work, in addition to electrical resistivity methods, IP was tested experimentally as a proxy for identifying and discriminating tree coarse roots from the surrounding soil. This study permitted to show the effect of polarization at low frequencies (< 25 Hz) using spectral (SIP) and temporal (TDIP) approaches both in laboratory and in the field. (i) the resistivity of woody roots samples was higher than that of a silty soil; (ii) roots polarized at frequencies lower than that of the soil; (iii) the effects of polarization increased with the volume of the buried roots (iv) the direction of roots relatively to current lines influenced the amplitude of IP response. Applying the SIP method in-situ in semi-controlled conditions gave promising results since phase variations around 1 Hz frequency were correlated with buried root position. SIP and TDIP approaches in the lab demonstrated their potential efficiency for detecting coarse roots. This was further demonstrated in the field with SIP. Using maps at several frequencies was useful as variable environmental conditions may change the polarization relaxation frequency and amplitude.

Since studies about this topic in tropical regions are limited, this could lay the groundwork for related research particularly on Bradyrhizobium elkanii. To determine the genetic diversity of B. elkanii in different regions, we conducted Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and rpoB gene. Also, sequence analysis of symbiotic nifD and nodD1 genes was conducted. Analysis of the rpoB gene revealed a higher genetic diversity than the ITS region, and possible endemic B. elkanii strains were observed. Meanwhile, no variation was detected among the strains in both nifD and nodD1 phylogenies. Through rpoB gene analysis, variations in the ITS-rpoB type of B. elkanii strains were distinguished and differentiated with that of the closest reference strains. We identified potential soybean inoculants which possess symbiotic efficiency regardless of the Rj genotypes used, suggesting broad host-range of the strains. We show how the genetic diversity of soybean-nodulating B. elkanii strains in subtropical and tropical regions might be influenced by temperature and soil pH and, provided some insights between the symbiotic genes and Rj genotypes.","[Mason, Maria Luisa Tabing] Univ Miyazaki, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Agr & Engn, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Mason, Maria Luisa Tabing; Domingo, Apolinario Laxamana] Cent Luzon State Univ, Coll Agr, Sci City Munoz, Nueva Ecija 3120, Philippines; [Matsuura, Shota; Yamamoto, Akihiro; Saeki, Yuichi] Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Shiro, Sokichi] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Sameshima-Saito, Reiko] Shizuoka Univ, Fac Agr, Suruga Ku, 836 Otani, Shizuoka, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan","Saeki, Y (reprint author), Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan.",yt-saeki@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26310313]; Japanese Government (MEXT)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) no. 26310313) and the Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship program.,,70,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2017,417,2-Jan,,,,,349,362,,10.1007/s11104-017-3263-4,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FD8BT,WOS:000407750900024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gervasi, DDL; Selosse, MA; Sauve, M; Francke, W; Vereecken, NJ; Cozzolino, S; Schiestl, FP",,,,"Gervasi, Daniel D.

Commonly, reproductive barriers are separated into pre- and post-zygotic mechanisms that can evolve with different speed. In this study, we measured the strength of different reproductive barriers in two closely related, sympatric orchids of the Ophrys insectifera group, namely Ophrys insectifera and Ophrys aymoninii to infer possible mechanisms of speciation. We quantified pre- and post-pollination barriers through observation of pollen flow, by performing artificial inter- and intraspecific crosses and analyzing scent bouquets. Additionally, we investigated differences in mycorrhizal fungi as a potential extrinsic factor of post-zygotic isolation. Our results show that floral isolation mediated by the attraction of different pollinators acts apparently as the sole reproductive barrier between the two orchid species, with later-acting intrinsic barriers seemingly absent. Also, the two orchids share most of their fungal mycorrhizal partners in sympatry, suggesting little or no importance of mycorrhizal symbiosis in reproductive isolation. Key traits underlying floral isolation were two alkenes and wax ester, present predominantly in the floral scent of O.aymoninii. These compounds, when applied to flowers of O.insectifera, triggered attraction and a copulation attempt of the bee pollinator of O.aymoninii and thus led to the (partial) breakdown of floral isolation. Based on our results, we suggest that adaptation to different pollinators, mediated by floral scent, underlies species isolation in this plant group. Pollinator switches may be promoted by low pollination success of individuals in dense patches of plants, an assumption that we also confirmed in our study.","[Gervasi, Daniel D.

Soil inoculation experiments suggest that the lack of suitable microbial communities, and especially of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF), may contribute to the low restoration success. To understand the limiting role that AMF play in mediating plant community assembly, we used pyrosequencing to investigate how entire AMF communities vary along a restoration gradient, covering 53 semi-natural grasslands in the Belgian Calestienne region. Soil AMF taxon richness, diversity and community composition of grasslands restored between 12 and 20 years ago were not different from the ancient grassland target communities, but strongly deviated from afforested grasslands. Yet, some AMF taxa exclusively occurred in ancient grasslands. Soil AMF communities were highly nested, with AMF communities from afforested grasslands and the youngest restoration stages being subsets of the older restoration stages and ancient grasslands. AMF communities in the roots of two grassland species were large subsets of the AMF communities retrieved from the soil and showed no host specificity. Plant community reassembly on the same grasslands strongly lagged behind the assembly of the AMF communities. Our results suggest low dispersal limitation of AMF, and indicate that AMF communities do not follow changes in the plant community. From a restoration management perspective, our results show that AMF communities reassemble within a reasonable time frame, and that the success of the manual introduction of target species in restored grasslands will likely not be limited by the absence of AMF.","[Honnay, Olivier; Helsen, Kenny; Van Geel, Maarten] Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Helsen, Kenny] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Hgsk Ringen 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Honnay, O (reprint author), Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",olivier.honnay@kuleuven.be,"Helsen, Kenny/D-7759-2015","Helsen, Kenny/0000-0001-6856-7095; Van Geel, Maarten/0000-0001-8688-6225; Honnay, Olivier/0000-0002-4287-8511",Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO)FWO [K8.014.16N]; KU Leuven PDM-grant,"We want to thank Gerrit Peeters for the outstanding laboratory work, Kasper Van Acker and Bea Bossuyt for their help with the sampling, Shanaz Parvin for help with the AMF database, and the Departement de la Nature et des Forets for the Derogation aux mesures de protection de certaines especes pour motif scientifique (2016/RS/n 27).

Roots vary in anatomy, morphology and physiology, both spatially (different parts of the same root system) and temporally (plastic changes, root ageing), suggesting that root trait measurements are strongly affected by root sampling categories. 2. In this context, it is urgent to clarify the functional significance of current root sampling categories (e.g. fine roots of the first order, the first three orders, <= 1 mm or <= 2 mm), establish guidelines for choosing between sampling methods and revise root ontology to account for functional differences between traits measured on distinct root categories. 3. Here, we used a worldwide database of fine-root traits to test the hypothesis that distinct fine-root trait values - with link to fine-root functions - were generally affected by different root sampling categories. We observed indeed a clear functional break between first-order roots and roots of all three other sampling categories, and a smaller but substantial break between roots of the three first orders and the <= 2 mm category, demonstrating globally that different sampling methodologies capture different functional parts of roots. 4. Our synthesis suggests that all current root sampling categories present both advantages and pitfalls and that no single method can appropriately tackle the main current challenge of root functional ecology: i. e. linking fine roots to plant and ecosystem functions in a truly comparable way across all plants. We argue instead that a small set of complementary standardized sampling methods is necessary to capture the linkages between root forms and functions. 5. To assist experimenters selecting adequate sampling we developed a decision table following three logical questions: i) what plant or ecosystem function must be addressed; (ii) what root categories are involved in this function and (iii) what traits should be measured on these root categories. Challenging, strengthening and expending such common reference framework would be a substantial step towards wider comparability of future functional trait datasets.","[Freschet, Gregoire T.; Roumet, Catherine] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Freschet, GT (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,CNRS,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",gregoire.freschet@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,,,,132,21,21,7,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The method has, however, been used only in a limited number of ecological studies, and we know little about its possible limits. We optimized methodology to produce synthetic polyploids in Vicia cracca and explored the differences in stomata size, time to germination and plant size between synthetic and natural polyploids and diploids. We also explored variation in relative genome size and chromosome number of synthetic polyploids and attempted to understand consequences of this variation on plant performance. The creation of synthetic polyploids was possible even though it was met with relatively low success. Stomata length was affected directly by polyploidization. In contrast, plant size was neither a function of polyploidization nor of subsequent evolution. Time to germination increased in synthetic polyploids, suggesting that only subsequent evolution will return the germination rate to the original levels. While the relative genome size of synthetic polyploids fell within the range of natural polyploids, 25% of the synthetic polyploids turned out to be aneuploids. The differences in chromosome number were reflected in performance of the synthetic polyploids. Exclusion of aneuploids from the data, however, did not affect the between-cytotype comparison. A more detailed comparison of the frequency of aneuploids among natural and synthetic polyploids is needed to understand possible differences between synthetic and natural polyploids and the effects of aneuploidy on the conclusions of ecological studies comparing natural and synthetic polyploids.","[Pavlikova, Zuzana; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pastova, Ladislava; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Munzbergova, Z (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.; Munzbergova, Z (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",zuzmun@natur.cuni.cz,"Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013","Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220","GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505-13-32048S]; RVO [67985939]; MSMTMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic","We thank Vlasta Jarolimova for help with counting the chromosomes, Alexander Belyaev with image processing, Ilona Chmelarova for help with the colchicine treatments and cultivation of the C1 plants, Veronika Olivova for help with maintaining and measuring the experiments on C2, Tomas.

To address this question, we focus on tropical forest monodominance, in which a single, often ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species occasionally dominates forest stands within a landscape otherwise characterized by diverse communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. Such monodominance is a striking potential example of community divergence resulting in alternative stable states. However, it is observed only in some tropical regions. A diverse suite of AM and EM trees locally codominate forest stands elsewhere. We develop a hypothesis to explain this geographical difference using a simulation model of plant community assembly. Simulation results suggest that in a region with a few EM species (e.g., South America), EM trees experience strong selection for convergent traits that match the abiotic conditions of the environment. Consequently, EM species successfully compete against other species to form monodominant stands via positive plant-soil feedbacks. By contrast, in a region with many EM species (e.g., Southeast Asia), species maintain divergent traits because of complex plant-soil feedbacks, with no species having traits that enablemonodominance. An analysis of plant trait data from Borneo and Peruvian Amazon was inconclusive. Overall, this work highlights the utility of geographical comparison in understanding the relationship between trait convergence and community convergence.","[Fukami, Tadashi; Nakajima, Mifuyu; Peay, Kabir G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fortunel, Claire] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fine, Paul V.

We collected data for 145 species from 38 sites in Shaanxi Province, including 60 aquatic species and 85 terrestrial species (112 genera and 48 families). Fifteen plant economic traits of these species were measured, including specific leaf area, dry matter content and C, N, P stoichiometry in leaves, stems and roots. Multivariate analysis was employed to uncover the differences in economic trade-offs between aquatic and terrestrial plants. The results indicated that: (1) Hydrophytes exhibited much higher specific leaf area and lower mean leaf dry matter content, stem dry matter content, root dry matter content, stem carbon content and root carbon content compared with that of terrestrial plants in order to adapt to the aquatic environment, that is, there were differences in mean traits about the economic trade-offs faced by hydrophytes and terrestrial plants. (2) The leaf economic spectrum of aquatic plants in this region coincided with the worldwide leaf economics spectrum, while hydrophytes are located at the extreme of thin leaves which is conducive to rapid acquisition of resources. (3) Aquatic and terrestrial species can be discriminated by few functional traits related to resource acquisition and support tissues. (4) Aquatic and terrestrial plants differed in bivariate correlations between certain economic traits (standardized major axis analysis), indicating differences in plant strategies.

One particular concern with these conservation actions is whether species with obligate symbiotic relationships will be able to form these associations in the recipient locations. This study takes advantage of a massive conservation translocation of orchids at the Yachang National Nature Reserve in southwestern China. We compared the mycorrhizal associations of four of these targeted species. Two of the species (Cymbidium bicolor Lindl. and Geodorum eulophioides Schltr.) had narrow geographic ranges and were subjected to CI because the movement had placed them out of their natural ranges. While the other two species (Paphiopedilum dicmthum, Tang and Wang, and Pophiopedilum hirsutissimum, (Lindl. ex Hook. f.) Pfitzer) had wide geographic ranges and were not moved outside of them. This movement can be considered a conventional translocation. Using DNA techniques, we identified orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) associated with translocated and natural populations of these species. Our results indicated that translocated populations of both kinds (CI and conventional translocation) were able to establish new relationships with root fungi, including known OMF groups. Wide-ranging species associated with a greater number (24 OTUs) and more diverse groups of fungi (Shannon diversity (H') = 0.93) than narrow range species (15 OTUs, H' = 0.62). However, translocated populations of wide-ranging species shared fewer fungi with their natural populations than those of narrow-ranging species. This research provides the first evaluation of how critical biotic interactions may change following conservation introduction compared to that of conventional translocation, and shed light upon the feasibility of conservation introduction.","[Downing, Jason L.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Int Ctr Trop Bot, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Downing, Jason L.; Liu, Hong] Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, 10901 Old Cutler Rd, Coral Gables, FL 33156 USA; [Liu, Hong; Deng, Rongyan] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, 100 Daxue Rd, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hong] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Int Ctr Trop Bot, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Shao, Shicheng; Wang, Xilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [McCormick, Melissa] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Smithsonian Inst, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Gao, Jiangyun] Yunnan Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, Lab Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Liu, H (reprint author), Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, 10901 Old Cutler Rd, Coral Gables, FL 33156 USA.; Gao, JY (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, Lab Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",hliu@fiu.edu; jiangyun.gao@ynu.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31360146, 31470450]; Guangxi Science and Technology Bureau [12217-04]; National Science Foundation's East Asian Pacific Islands Summer Institute [1414633]; Fairchild Graduate Fellowship; Kelly Foundation; McKnight Dissertation Fellowship","Thanks to Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden and Chinese Academy of Sciences who kindly hosted our research.

Here, we tested whether mycorrhizal responsiveness varies by plant invasive status while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness among plants with two large grassland datasets. Mycorrhizal responsiveness was measured for 68 taxa from the Northern Plains, and data for 95 taxa from the Central Plains were included. Nineteen percent of taxa from the Northern Plains had greater total biomass with mycorrhizas while 61% of taxa from the Central Plains responded positively. For the Northern Plains taxa, measurable effects often depended on the response variable (i.e., total biomass, shoot biomass, and root mass ratio) suggesting varied resource allocation strategies when roots are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In both datasets, invasive status was nonrandomly distributed on the phylogeny. Invasive taxa were mainly from two clades, that is, Poaceae and Asteraceae families. In contrast, mycorrhizal responsiveness was randomly distributed over the phylogeny for taxa from the Northern Plains, but nonrandomly distributed for taxa from the Central Plains. After controlling for phylogenetic similarity, we found no evidence that invasive taxa responded differently to mycorrhizas than other taxa. Although it is possible that mycorrhizal responsiveness contributes to invasiveness in particular species, we find no evidence that invasiveness in general is associated with the degree of mycorrhizal responsiveness. However, mycorrhizal responsiveness among species grown under common conditions was highly variable, and more work is needed to determine the causes of this variation.","[Reinhart, Kurt O.] USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, MPG Ranch & Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada","Reinhart, KO (reprint author), USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA.",kurt.reinhart@ars.usda.gov,,"Reinhart, Kurt/0000-0002-7985-6738",USDA (CRIS)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [5434-21630-003-00D]; MPG Ranch,"We thank C.

The results indicated that soil organic carbon significantly decreased by 30.7 and 28.5% in MBF and CHF, respectively. The aromatic C and aromaticity also significantly decreased in MBF and CHF (P < 0.05), while alkyl, O-alkyl and carbonyl C contents increased (P > 0.05). Significant changes of the soil microbial community were found after the forest type changed from CBMF to MBF and CHF. Total soil microbial PLFAs, soil bacteria PLFAs, fungus PLFAs, actinobacteria PLFAs, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi PLFAs and protozoan PLFAs ranked as follows: CBMF > CHF > MBF (P < 0.05). The ratio of soil fungus to bacteria was in the order of MBF (0.78) > CHF (0.66) > CBMF (0.49) (P < 0.05), while an opposite order was found for ratio of G+/G- values (CBMF > CHF > MBF, P < 0.05). The converting CBMF into MBF and CHF combined with fertilization and tillage significantly changed the SOC and microbial community. Therefore, necessary measures should be taken to improve the SOC and soil fertility in the MBF and CHF.","[Fang, Xianghua; Zhang, Jinchi; Meng, Miaojing; Guo, Xiaoping; Wu, Yanwen; Liu, Xin] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry South, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fang, Xianghua; Zhao, Keli; Fu, Weijun] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Linan 311300, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Keli; Fu, Weijun] Zhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Subtrop Soil & Plant Nutr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Keli; Ding, Lizhong] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Key Lab Soil Contaminat Bioremediat Zhejiang Prov, Linan 311300, Peoples R China; [Shao, Yangfeng] Technol Promot Ctr Agr & Forestry Linan City, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Zhang, JC (reprint author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry South, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Fu, WJ (reprint author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Linan 311300, Peoples R China.; Fu, WJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Subtrop Soil & Plant Nutr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhang8811@njfu.edu.cn; fuweijun@zafu.edu.cn,,"Fu, Weijun/0000-0001-7498-4653","National Natural Science FoundationsNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200534, 41201323]; Zhejiang Province Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY13C160010]; Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Subtropic Soil and Plant Nutrition, China","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support from the National Natural Science Foundations (Nos. 31200534, 41201323), the Zhejiang Province Natural Science Foundation (No. LY13C160010), the open fund from Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, and Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Subtropic Soil and Plant Nutrition, China.",,43,14,14,8,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,1612-4677,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

We investigated how root life span is influenced by root diameter, branch order, season of birth and soil depth of birth for five temperate tree species growing in monoculture plantations at a common site in northeastern China. The minirhizotron approach was used to estimate root life span from April 2008 to October 2009. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was employed to determine the impact of those four factors on root life span of each species. There was no consistent difference in fine root life span between evergreen conifers and deciduous hardwoods. A bimodal frequency distribution of root life span was observed for all the species; the majority of roots born in summer and autumn survived to the following year, while roots born in spring mostly died in the current growing season. Root life span tended to increase with root diameter across all species, except Juglans mandshurica. The first two root branch orders within each species generally shared similar life span, with the exception of Picea koraiensis. Root life span tended to be longer at greater depths in the soil profile across all five species. Our results suggest that root life span generally depends on complex interrelations among root anatomy, soil environment and seasonal climatic conditions.","[Gu, Jiacun; Wang, Yan; Wang, Zhengquan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Fahey, Timothy J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Gu, JC (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",gjcnefu@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province [C2016004]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100470, 30130160]","We thank Jun Qiu, Hongying Jiang, Ying Liu, Sen Song, Jinliang Liu, and Guoquan Ding and Xiankui Quan for assistances in the field and laboratory.

Bacteria and fungi interact at different levels and bacterial endosymbionts, which dwell inside fungal cells, provide the most intimate example. Bacterial endosymbionts mostly occur in fungi of the phylum Mucoromycota and include Betaproteobacteria (Burkhoderia-related) and Mollicutes (Mycoplasmarelated). Based on phylogenomics and estimations of divergence time, we hypothesized two different scenarios for the origin of these interactions (early vs late bacterial invasion). Sequencing of the genomes of fungal endobacteria revealed a significant reduction in genome size, particularly in endosymbionts of Glomeromycotina, as expected by their uncultivability and host dependency. Similar to endobacteria of insects, the endobacteria of fungi show a range of behaviours from mutualism to antagonism. Emerging results suggest that some benefits given by the endobacteria to their plant-associated fungal host may propagate to the interacting plant, giving rise to a three-level inter-domain interaction.","[Bonfante, Paola] Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Viale PA Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Desiro, Alessandro] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Bonfante, P (reprint author), Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Viale PA Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.; Desiro, A (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",paola.bonfante@unito.it; adesiro@msu.edu,,"Desiro, Alessandro/0000-0003-1347-2843; Bonfante, Paola/0000-0003-3576-8530",Ateneo Project; CSP-Ateneo Mycoplant project,"We thank Alessandra Salvioli, Mara Novero and Stefano Ghignone as well as all the colleagues who, during the years, have contributed to the development of the project Endobacteria in AMF, and whose names have been quoted in the references.

Soil microbial communities may have a role in explaining this variation due to both site-to-site variation in the composition of soil microbial communities and due to variation that can arise due to plant-soil feedbacks. We tested the relative importance of between-site variation in soil microbial community composition and plant-soil feedbacks in shaping plant community composition and ecosystem function. We used a standard two-phase plant-soil feedback design. Soil inoculum was collected from four tallgrass prairie sites. Then, soils were conditioned separately with nine plant species, and conditioned soils were used to inoculate prairie community mesocosms. In a separate experiment using soil from an additional site we tested conditioned soil samples for the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobia. Site of soil origin and plant-soil feedbacks both had effects on the composition and productivity of our plant communities, and the magnitudes of these effects were similar. We also found changes in the abundance of AMF and rhizobia due to plant-soil feedbacks and that AMF abundance were associated with differences in plant community composition. These results indicate that the composition of soil communities due to site-to-site variation and plant-soil feedbacks are both important determinants of plant community composition and productivity. Our results also suggest that AMF and rhizobia are key microbial functional groups underlying plant-soil feedback effects. Synthesis and applications. Site-to-site variation in soil communities can explain some variation in restoration of plant communities. Since plant-soil feedback effects of restored plant species do not overcome this variation, knowledge of soil microbial communities present at a site prior to initiation of restoration efforts may improve predictability of restoration outcomes, and reintroduction of some components of the soil community may be necessary to achieve restoration goals. Additionally, by understanding variation due to plant-soil feedbacks, restoration practitioners can choose plant species for reintroduction that will create favourable soil conditions, including promoting microbial mutualists. Plant-soil feedbacks should also make it possible to increase heterogeneity in soil microbial communities, leading to increases in beta diversity in plant communities.

However, specificity in biotic interactions may differ considerably over a species' distribution range and therefore interactions need to be studied over their entire range to assess their evolution in space and time. The present study investigates the biogeographical history of the interaction between five closely related mycoheterotrophic Thismia species and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi over the distribution range of the plant species. Location Temperate south-east Australia and New Zealand. Methods Phylogenetic relationships of Thismia (nrITS and mtcob) and their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (partial nrSSU) were reconstructed based on data from 65 plant specimens. The diversification times in Thismia were estimated with a Bayesian relaxed clock approach using a Dioscoreales framework (nrSSU, mtatp1, mtmatR, mtnad1 b-c). Ancestral geographical ranges were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood approach. The same approach was used to reconstruct ancestral mycorrhizal associations. Results Our analysis shows that Thismia plants have highly specific, phylogenetically conserved and evolutionarily persistent interactions with Rhizophagus fungi. Nevertheless, Thismia was able to diversify and radiate recently due to the wide geographical distribution of the host fungi. In addition, we find that although the mycorrhizal interactions of this clade of mycoheterotrophs are strictly bound to a fungal lineage, host switches remain possible. Main conclusions In this clade of closely related mycoheterotrophs, dependency on highly specific fungal interactions is the result of phylogenetic niche conservatism, acting over at least 12 million years. Nevertheless, plants that are dependent on highly specific fungal interactions have ample opportunities to disperse and radiate over the geographical range of their hosts.

Here, we used 454-pyrosequencing to analyse the soil microbial community composition in a long-term biodiversity experiment at Jena, Germany. We examined responses of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protists to plant species richness (communities varying from 1 to 60 sown species) and plant FG identity (grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs) in bulk soil. We hypothesized that plant species richness and FG identity would alter microbial community composition and have a positive impact on microbial species richness. Plant species richness had a marginal positive effect on the richness of fungi, but we observed no such effect on bacteria, archaea and protists. Plant species richness also did not have a large impact on microbial community composition. Rather, abiotic soil properties partially explained the community composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), archaea and protists. Plant FG richness did not impact microbial community composition; however, plant FG identity was more effective. Bacterial richness was highest in legume plots and lowest in small herb plots, and AMF and archaeal community composition in legume plant communities was distinct from that in communities composed of other plant FGs. We conclude that soil microbial community composition in bulk soil is influenced more by changes in plant FG composition and abiotic soil properties, than by changes in plant species richness per se.","[Dassen, Sigrid; Cortois, Roeland; Martens, Henk; van der Putten, Wim H.] NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Martens, Henk; de Deyn, Gerlinde B.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Hollander, Mattias] NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Microbial Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kowalchuk, George A.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Lab Nematol, Wageningen, Netherlands","Dassen, S (reprint author), NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",s.dassen@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); NWO-ALW VIDI [864.11.003],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; NWO-ALW VIDI, Grant/Award Number: 864.11.003",,107,24,25,9,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Fine-root distributions were measured in four sites that represent the natural factorial combination of soil types (basalt-derived clay or granite-derived sand) and precipitation regimes [wet (similar to 750 mm mean annual precipitation) or dry (similar to 500 mm mean annual precipitation)] that occur in KNP. Root area and biomass (at soil depths of 0-75 cm) were estimated from measurements of root number, length and width in images from minirhizotron tubes at each site. Measurements were made during one mid-season sampling during three subsequent years. Fine-root area was more than twice as large in clay (2.3 +/- 0.0 mm(2) cm(-2)) than sand (0.8 +/- 0.3 mm(2) cm(-2)) sites but did not differ between wet and dry sites. Root number, length and width, used to derive area, showed similar patterns to fine-root area. Fine-root biomass estimated from these values was 5.5 +/- 0.6 Mg ha(-1) in clay sites and 2.2 +/- 0.9 Mg ha(-1) in sand sites. Across the four sites, a change from sand to clay soils had a greater effect on fine-root abundance and distributions than a 50% increase in precipitation from dry to wet sites. Results highlight the importance of soil properties on root dynamics and carbon pools in the region.","[Kulmatiski, Andrew; Sprouse, Sydney R.

Fine-root exudation could stimulate microbial activity, which further contributes to soil heterotrophic respiration. Although both root respiration and exudation are important components of belowground C cycling, how they relate to each other is less well known. In this study, we aimed to explore this relationship on mature trees growing in the field. The measurements were performed on two canopy species, Quercus serrata Thunb. and Quercus glauca, in a warm temperate forest. The respiration and exudation rates of the same fine-root segment were measured in parallel with a syringe-basis incubation and a closed static chamber, respectively. We also measured root traits and ectomycorrhizal colonization ratio because these indexes commonly relate to root respiration and reflect root physiology. The microbial activity enhanced by root exudation was investigated by comparing the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) between rhizosphere soils and bulk soils. Mean DOC concentration and MBC were ca two times higher in the rhizosphere soils and positively related to exudation rates, indicating that exudation further relates to the C dynamics in the soils. Flux rates of exudation and respiration were positively correlated with each other. Both root exudation and respiration rates positively related to ectomycorrhizal colonization and root tissue nitrogen, and therefore the relationship between the two fluxes may be attributed to fine-root activity. The flux rates of root respiration were 8.7 and 10.5 times as much as those of exudation on a root-length basis and a root-weight basis, respectively. In spite of the fact that flux rates of respiration and exudation varied enormously among the fine-root segments of the two Quercus species, exudation was in proportion to respiration. This result gives new insight into the fine-root C-allocation strategy and the belowground C dynamics.","[Sun, Lijuan] Kyoto Univ, Lab Forest Ecol, Grad Sch Agr, Kitashirakawa OiwakeCho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Ataka, Mioko; Kominami, Yuji] Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Yoshimura, Kenichi] Kyoto Univ, Lab Forest Hydrol, Grad Sch Agr, Kitashirakawa OiwakeCho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Sun, Lijuan] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Main Bldg Agr Sch,Kitashirakawa OiwakeCho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Sun, LJ (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Lab Forest Ecol, Grad Sch Agr, Kitashirakawa OiwakeCho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.; Sun, LJ (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Main Bldg Agr Sch,Kitashirakawa OiwakeCho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",sunlijuan86@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K21131]","This work was financially supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists B, 16K21131 to M.A.).",,75,4,5,3,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2017,37,8,,,,,1011,1020,,10.1093/treephys/tpx026,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,FF8ET,WOS:000409249000003,28338964,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Tonn, N; Ibanez, I",,,,"Tonn, Natalie; Ibanez, Ines",,,Plant-mycorrhizal fungi associations along an urbanization gradient: implications for tree seedling survival,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Eastern NorthAmerica; Northern red oak; Red maple; Seedling establishment; Shagbark hickory,ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; RESOURCE GRADIENTS; AIR-POLLUTION; QUERCUS-RUBRA; URBAN; GROWTH; FOREST,"Mycorrhizal fungi symbioses can be critical determining if established seedlings survive or not. Currently, in remnant forests, plants and their fungal symbionts are exposed to varied anthropomorphic effects related to urbanization, however, little is known about their impact on this association. We investigated the relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and tree seedling survival along an urbanization gradient. We planted three species of temperate tree seedlings (Acer rubrum, Carya ovata, and Quercus rubra) in three landscapes: urban, suburban, and rural. We measured the percent of root length colonized by mycorrhizal fungi and monitored survival during their first growing season. We analyzed mycorrhizal colonization as a function of landscape type (urban-rural) and additional variables known to contribute to mycorrhizal colonization (phosphorus, nitrogen, initial plant height). We then analyzed seedling survival as a function of the degree of mycorrhizal fungi colonization associated with the landscape gradient and of additional environmental factors (light and soil moisture). Within a species we found no changes in the levels of mycorrhizal fungi colonization across the urbanization gradient. Each species, however, had markedly different levels of colonization. Survival of A. rubrum was independent of mycorrhizal colonization, while C. ovata and Q. rubra had a significant positive response to increased mycorrhizal fungi. These findings highlight the resilience of mycorrhizal communities across the rural-urban gradient typical of this region, but they also underscore the potential sensitivity of some tree species to lower levels of mycorrhizal fungi colonization.","[Tonn, Natalie; Ibanez, Ines] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Ibanez, I (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",iibanez@umich.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1252664],Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation to I.

The results revealed that exposure to 500 A mu M ZnSO4.7H(2)O for 10 days markedly reduced the root and shoot dry weights in Zn-treated plants, while the application of SA, SNP and specially SA + SNP significantly increased the root and shoot dry weights in seedlings subjected to Zn stress. Addition of SA, SNP and SA + SNP interestingly reduced root-to-shoot translocation of zinc and increased significantly the level of glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC) in leaves of Zn-stressed plants. The Zn-treated plants supplemented with SA and SNP revealed an improved activity of ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes and those enzymes which are involved in glyoxalase system as compared to the plants treated with Zn only. However, no significant relationship was found between SA or SNP supplementation and glutathione S-transferase activity in Zn-stressed plants. These findings demonstrate that exogenous application of SA or SNP could ameliorate the negative effects of Zn on safflower plants probably by stimulation of antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems.","[Namdjoyan, Shahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Sci, Shahr E Qods Branch, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran; [Kermanian, Hossein] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Energy & New Technol Fac, Dept Pulp & Paper, Tehran, Iran; [Soorki, Ali Abolhasani] Shahid Beheshti Univ, ACECR Res Inst Appl Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Tabatabaei, Sedigheh Modarres] Fac Nat Environm, Dept Environm, Tehran, Iran; [Elyasi, Nazli] Trade Promot Org, Trade Planing Off, Dept Stat, Tehran, Iran","Namdjoyan, S (reprint author), Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Sci, Shahr E Qods Branch, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran.",shahram_biotech@yahoo.com,,"Abolhasani Soorki, Ali/0000-0002-4952-5567",Research Council of the Shahr-e-Qods Branch of Islamic Azad University [448/95/DP],"This work was supported by the funding of Research Council of the Shahr-e-Qods Branch of Islamic Azad University (448/95/DP).

Recovery of secondary resources plays a significant role. Industrial processes developed to regain minerals for commodity production in a circular economy become ever more important in the European Union and worldwide. Landfill mining (LFM) constitutes an important technological toolset of processes that regain resources and redistribute them with an accompanying reduction of hazardous influence of environmental contamination and other threats for human health hidden in former dump sites and landfills. This review paper is devoted to LFM problems, historical development and driving paradigms of LFM from 'classical hunting for valuables' to 'perspective in ecosystem revitalization'. The main goal is to provide a description of historical experience and link it to more advanced concept of a circular economy. The challenge is to adapt the existing knowledge to make decisions in accordance with both, economic feasibility and ecosystems revitalization aspects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Endemic to this biome is the multipurpose tree Spondias tuberosa Arr., which forms numerous root tubers to resist drought stress. In order to develop improved soil management for reforestation with S. tuberosa the response of its root system to different soil amendments was studied with 52 seedlings, using goat manure, clay substrate, biochar as soil amendments, and mineral fertilizer. The default root architecture of three-year-old S. tuberosa and the relation between soil physical parameters and fine root dry matter (<= 2 mm), root length density, root tuber volume, root tuber fresh weight, and shoot-root ratio were analyzed. Seedlings still formed a tap root with a maximum rooting depth of 63 cm and a maximum horizontal extent of 35 cm, developing 2-4 root tubers per seedling. Fine root dry matter in 3000 cm(3) soil samples differed significantly, ranging from 0.23 g in the control to 0.03 g in the treatment combining manure with biochar and mineral fertilizer. According to the orthogonal contrast, manure was the pivotal soil amendment affecting fine root dry matter negatively. Simultaneously, manure application led to increased soil water content compared to treatments without. The shoot-root ratio increased by 32% compared to the control, when S. tuberosa was grown in wet soils. Root tuber growth was significantly enhanced by manure addition. This effect is attributed to a reduction of soil bulk density as root tuber volume exhibited a negative correlation with soil bulk density. There was no statistical relationship between root tuber volume and seedling survival during the field experiment. Compared with the control, neither clay, biochar nor solely mineral fertilization significantly affected root growth. Soil management focused on improving water availability is suspected of hampering fine root growth of S. tuberosa seedlings, whereas reducing soil bulk density enables better root tuber development and could, therefore, be a promising measure to increase S. tuberosa drought resistance in the long term for more successful reforestation. Disregarding its negative impact on fine root growth, we assume manure is the most promising amendment among the tested treatments, due to its positive effect on root tuber growth.

Besides the direct effect of water limitation, drought also influences plant activity, determining changes in the quality and quantity of root exudates, thus indirectly affecting soil microbial activity. To determine how the seasonal changes of plant activity and soil microbial metabolism and structure affect SR response to drought, we investigated the correlation between leaf gas exchange, soil carbon pools and soil respiration sources and the role of soil carbon pools on microbial populations and soil respiration, in a summer deciduous Mediterranean (SDS) and a winter deciduous temperate (WDS) shrublands, experiencing a dry summer period. In both sites, drought reduced photosynthesis, but affected SR differently: in SDS, SR decreased, although microbial heterotrophic respiration (SRh) remained unchanged; in WDS, SR did not vary but SRh was reduced. While in SDS the microbial community was able to respire more complex substrates, in WDS it was strongly dependent on easily decomposable molecules, thus on plant activity. Therefore, the response of soil CO2 efflux to water limitation is not exclusively influenced by climate as it is modulated by the degree of adaptation of the microbial community to drought.","[de Dato, Giovanbattista] Ctr Forestry & Wood CREA FL, Council Agr Res & Econ, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy; [Lagomarsino, Alessandra] Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Council Agr Res & Econ, Via Lanciola 12, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Lellei-Kovacs, Eszter; Kovacs-Lang, Edit; Kroel-Dulay, Gyorgy] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res Inst Ecol & Bot, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Liberati, Dario; Abou Jaoude, Renee; Marabottini, Rosita; Stazi, Silvia Rita; De Angelis, Paolo] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, Via S Camillo Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Guidolotti, Gabriele] CNR, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol IBAF, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy","de Dato, G (reprint author), Ctr Forestry & Wood CREA FL, Council Agr Res & Econ, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy.",giovanbattista.dedato@crea.gov.it; alessandra.lagomarsino@crea.gov.it; lellei-kovacs.eszter@okologia.mta.hu; darioliberati@unitus.it; renee.aboujaoude@gmail.com; marabottini@unitus.it; srstazi@unitus.it; gabriele.guidolotti@ibaf.cnr.it; lang.edit@okologia.mta.hu; kroel-dulay.gyorgy@okologia.mta.hu; pda@unitus.it,"stazi, silvia rita/G-9237-2011; De Angelis, Paolo/A-6863-2012; de Dato, Giovanbattista D./F-9693-2014","stazi, silvia rita/0000-0001-6827-3062; De Angelis, Paolo/0000-0001-8310-8831; Lagomarsino, Alessandra/0000-0003-3325-0084; de Dato, Giovanbattista D./0000-0003-0289-1727; marabottini, rosita/0000-0003-3030-7735",EU-funded infrastructure INCREASE [227628],This research was founded by the EU-funded infrastructure INCREASE (Grant agreement no. 227628).,,79,2,2,0,17,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2017,8,7,,,,,,,241,10.3390/f8070241,,,22,Forestry,Forestry,FC2UP,WOS:000406694400021,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted",,,10/31/19J,"Jiang, YT; Wang, LM",,,,"Jiang, Yongtao; Wang, Limei",,,Pattern and control of biomass allocation across global forest ecosystems,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,allometric model; belowground biomass; biomass allocation; forest ecosystems; global environmental change; root:shoot ratios,BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS; CHINA FORESTS; ROOT BIOMASS; SHOOT RATIOS; CARBON; PLANTS; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; LEAVES,"The underground part of a tree is an important carbon sink in forest ecosystems. Understanding biomass allocation between the below- and aboveground parts (root:shoot ratios) is necessary for estimation of the underground biomass and carbon pool. Nevertheless, large-scale biomass allocation patterns and their control mechanisms are not well identified. In this study, a large database of global forests at the community level was compiled to investigate the root:shoot ratios and their responses to environmental factors. The results indicated that both the aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) of the forests in China (medians 73.0Mg/ha and 17.0Mg/ha, respectively) were lower than those worldwide (medians 120.3Mg/ha and 27.7Mg/ha, respectively). The root:shoot ratios of the forests in China (median=0.23), however, were not significantly different from other forests worldwide (median=0.24). In general, the allocation of biomass between the belowground and aboveground parts was determined mainly by the inherent allometry of the plant but also by environmental factors. In this study, most correlations between root:shoot ratios and environmental factors (development parameter, climate, altitude, and soil) were weak but significant (p<.01). The allometric model agreed with the trends observed in this study and effectively estimated BGB based on AGB across the entire database.","[Jiang, Yongtao; Wang, Limei] Nanyang Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Traveling, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yongtao; Wang, Limei] Nanyang Normal Univ, Prov Key Lab Remote Sensing Monitoring, Coll Environm Sci & Traveling, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China","Wang, LM (reprint author), Nanyang Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Traveling, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China.",jwfreefool@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41604009]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Nanyang Normal University [ZX2016007],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41604009; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Nanyang Normal University, Grant/Award Number: ZX2016007",,50,2,3,4,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Wildfires may influence fine root dynamics directly via heating and indirectly via interactions with wildfire-deposited charcoal. We tested if the presence of charcoal in a recently burned larch forest affected fine root vitality. This study was stratified across vegetation type (understorey and overstorey), soil depth (upper and lower layers), and root diameter classes: fine (ae0.5 mm but < 2 mm diameter), and very fine (diameter < 0.5 mm) in a recently surface-burned Gmelin larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr.) forest in the Russian Far East. Charcoal content and fine root vitality were positively correlated for overstorey vegetation, but negatively correlated for understorey vegetation. On the other hand, total charcoal content did not significantly correlate with very fine root vitality, biomass or necromass. Our study provides the first field evidence that fine root dynamics are influenced by fire-derived charcoal in frequently burned boreal forest. Furthermore, the effect of charcoal on fine root vitality depends on the vegetation type, root diameter, and soil depth, which indicates the necessity of complicated modeling of soil organic carbon derived from fine roots in post-fire boreal forests.","[Bryanin, Semyon V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Nat Management, Far Eastern Branch, Blagoveshchensk 675000, Russia; [Makoto, Kobayashi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Toikanbetsu, Horonobe 0982943, Japan","Bryanin, SV (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Nat Management, Far Eastern Branch, Blagoveshchensk 675000, Russia.",,"Bryanin, Semyon/G-2303-2012","Bryanin, Semyon/0000-0002-2227-5254",,,,59,3,3,12,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2017,416,2-Jan,,,,,409,418,,10.1007/s11104-017-3217-x,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FB1PT,WOS:000405916400029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Boldrin, D; Leung, AK; Bengough, AG",,,,"Boldrin, D.; Leung, Anthony K.; Bengough, A.

Most studies have focused on mechanical reinforcement and its correlation with plant biomechanical traits. The correlations however generally ignore the effects of hydrologic reinforcement. This study aims to quantify the hydrologic reinforcement associated with ten woody species and identify correlations with relevant plant traits. Ten species widespread in Europe, which belong to Aquifoliaceae, Betulaceae, Buxaceae, Celastraceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae and Salicaceae families, were planted in pots of sandy loam soil. Each planted pot was irrigated and then left to transpire. Soil strength, matric suction and plant traits were measured. Transpiration-induced suction was linearly correlated with soil penetration resistance for the ten species due to their different transpiration rates i.e. both suction and soil penetration resistance induced by Hazel and Blackthorn (deciduous) were five times greater than those by Holly and European Box (evergreens). Specific leaf area and root length density correlated with hydrologic reinforcement. The root:shoot ratio correlated best with the hydrologic reinforcement. Specific leaf area, root length density and root:shoot ratio explained the tenfold differences in hydrologic reinforcement provided by the ten different species.","[Boldrin, D.; Leung, Anthony K.; Bengough, A.

This is important because it is a measure of the mechanical strength of soil and it correlates closely with the rate of elongation of roots. A sandy soil was incubated with a synthetic root exudate at different temperatures, for different lengths of time and with selective suppression of either fungi or bacteria. The shape of the temperature response of penetrometer resistance in soil incubated with synthetic exudate was typical of a poikilothermic temperature response. Both penetrometer resistance and small strain shear modulus had maximum values between 25 and 30 degrees C. At temperatures of 20 degrees C and less, there was little effect of incubation with synthetic root exudate on the small strain shear modulus, although penetrometer resistance did increase with temperature over this range (4-20 degrees C). This suggests that in this temperature range the increase in penetrometer resistance was related to a greater resistance to plastic deformation. At higher temperatures (> 25 degrees C) penetrometer resistance decreased. Analysis of the DNA sequence data showed that at 25 degrees C the number of Streptomyces (Gram-positive bacteria) increased, but selective suppression of either fungi or bacteria suggested that fungi have the greater role with respect to penetrometer resistance.","[Gao, W.; Ren, T.] China Agr Univ, Dept Soil & Water Sci, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Munoz-Romero, V.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agron, Ecoefficient Cropping Syst Grp, Edificio C4 Celestino Mutis Ctra Madrid Cadiz, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Ashton, R.

Here, at the intra-species level, we characterized the structural variation in rhizobial populations in soybean rhizosphere under field conditions across 32 sampling sites in three eco-regions. LocationNorth-east (Heilongjiang), north (Hebei-Shandong) and south (Jiangxi) China. MethodsThe intra-species diversity of rhizobia in soybean rhizospheres was investigated by rpoB pyrosequencing. Soybean nodule isolates were characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S intergenic sequences and rpoB PCR sequencing. Patterns and processes of biogeography of identified rhizobia were studied. ResultsSignificant biogeographical patterns of rhizosphere rhizobia at the species level were found, and the abundant species in the rhizosphere were generally the dominant microsymbionts in soybean nodules. The distribution of rhizobial species in the rhizosphere across eco-regions correlated with combined effects of spatial, vegetative, edaphic and climatic variables. Gene flow and genetic differentiation analyses revealed that there was no dispersal limitation among geographical populations of the same rhizobial species, and drift or subsequent diversification might be involved in shaping the biogeographical pattern in addition to environmental factors. Main conclusionsThese results constitute the first report of the existence of rhizobial biogeography in legume rhizospheres at the species level, contrasting with most studies, which focused on nodule isolates. The method developed in this study could be used to uncover, at high resolution, the diversity of local rhizobial populations in soils. This information is crucial for choosing suitable strains or species as inoculants for a specific legume host under local field conditions. Moreover, a similar strategy could be used to study other bacteria with important ecological functions.","[Zhang, Xing Xing; Guo, Hui Juan; Jiao, Jian; Zhang, Pan; Xiong, Hui Yang; Chen, Wen Xin; Tian, Chang Fu] China Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xing Xing; Guo, Hui Juan; Jiao, Jian; Zhang, Pan; Xiong, Hui Yang; Chen, Wen Xin; Tian, Chang Fu] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xing Xing; Guo, Hui Juan; Jiao, Jian; Zhang, Pan; Xiong, Hui Yang; Chen, Wen Xin; Tian, Chang Fu] China Agr Univ, Rhizobium Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Tian, CF (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",cftian@cau.edu.cn,"TIAN, Chang Fu/O-4482-2019","TIAN, Chang Fu/0000-0002-0479-363X",Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-13-0561],"We thank J.

By in situ (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling we investigated C input and microbial utilization of rhizodeposits by analyzing C-13 incorporation into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) of beech- (Fagus sylvatica) and ash associated (Fraxinus excelsior) rhizomicrobial communities. Plant compartments and soil samples were analyzed to quantify the allocation of assimilates. For 1 m high trees, ash assimilated more of the applied (CO2)-C-13 (31%) than beech (21%), and ash allocated twice as much C-13 belowground until day 20. Approximately 0.01% of the applied C-13 was incorporated into total PLFAs, but incorporation varied significantly between microbial groups. Saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi under beech and ash, but also arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Gram negative bacteria under ash, incorporated most C-13. PLFA allowed differentiation of C fluxes from tree roots into mycorrhiza: twice as much 13C was incorporated into the fungal biomarker 18:2 omega 6,9 under beech than under ash. Within 5 days, 30% of the fungal PLFA-C was replaced by rhizodeposit-derived C-13 under beech but only 10% under ash. None of the other microbial groups reached such high C replacement, suggesting direct C allocation via ectomycorrhizal symbioses dominates the C flux under beech.

Do grass and forb species differ in the degree of intraspecific trait variation? Location: Managed grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods: Using a phytometer approach, we raised 20 common European grassland species (ten forbs and ten grasses) and planted them into 54 plots of different land-use types (pasture, meadow, mown pasture). After 1yr in the field, we measured above- and below-ground plant functional traits. Linear mixed effects models (LMEM) were used to identify the most powerful predictors for every trait. Variation partitioning was applied to assess the amount of inter- and intraspecific trait variation in grasses and forbs explained by environmental conditions (land-use intensity, climate and soil conditions) and plant species diversity of the local neighbourhood. Results: For 12 out of the 14 traits studied, either land-use intensity or local neighbourhood diversity were predictors in the best LMEM. Land-use intensity had considerably stronger effects than neighbourhood diversity. Root dry matter content and root phosphorus concentration of forbs were more affected by land-use intensity than those of grasses. For almost all traits, intraspecific trait variation of grasses was much higher than that of forbs, while traits of forbs varied more among species. Overall, inter- and intraspecific variation was of the same magnitude. Conclusion: The similar magnitude of intra- and interspecific trait variation suggests that both sources should be considered in grassland studies at a scale similar to that of our study. The high amount of intraspecific trait variation that was explained by environmental factors and local neighbourhood diversity clearly demonstrates the high potential of species to adjust to local conditions, which would be ignored when only considering species mean trait values.","[Herz, Katharina; Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Dietz, Sophie; Scheel, Dierk] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Scheel, Dierk; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Herz, K (reprint author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",katharina.herz@botanik.uni-halle.de; sophie.nahrstedt@ipb-halle.de; sylvia.haider@botanik.uni-halle.de; ute.jandt@botanik.uni-halle.de; dierk.scheel@ipb-halle.de; helge.bruelheide@botanik.uni-halle.de,"Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014","Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Jandt, Ute/0000-0002-3177-3669","DFG Priority Program ""Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories""German Research Foundation (DFG) [BR 1698/11-3, 1374]","We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Kirsten Reichel-Jung, Katrin Lorenzen, Martin Gorke and all former managers for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure; Christiane Fischer for giving support through the central office, Michael Owonibi for managing the central database, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmoller, Jens Nieschulze, Daniel Prati, Ingo Schoning, Francois Buscot, Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Wolfgang W.

A comparative analysis of the diameter of fine roots, stele and bark volumes, and the frequencies of roots with retained primary bark, root hairs, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and dark septate endophytes has been performed in the invasive and native species from four habitats (by two habitats in the forest-steppe and steppe zones). The roots of A. negundo have been additionally studied in trees from two monospecific stands. It has been found that the structure of fine roots significantly differs between the invasive and native species: the roots of A. negundo are larger, with relatively poorly developed root hairs and low occurrence of dark septate endophytes. In monospecific stands, the frequency of mycorrhiza in A. negundo roots is very low, with arbuscules and dark septate endophytes being totally absent. It is concluded that specific structural features of the belowground absorbing apparatus in A. negundo are accounted for mainly by traits autonomously formed in a plant, rather than by characteristics of symbiotic relationships, and that they are not consistent with the assumption that the invasive species can utilize soil resources more effectively or more rapidly than taxonomically close native species.","[Veselkin, D.

However, their biogeographic distribution patterns along combined gradients of plant communities and environmental variables across regional spatial scales remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems, which occupy one third of the terrestrial surface of China. Here, a regional-scale field investigation was conducted to collect soil samples from 290 plots at 52 sites along a 4000 km transect in temperate grasslands of northern China to assess the distribution patterns of fungal communities. The high-throughput Illumina sequencing revealed that soil fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota across the temperate grasslands. Fungal richness increased with plant species richness and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Bray-Cutis dissimilarities in soil fungal community composition between sites were significantly correlated with plant community composition, geographical distance, and abiotic factors including MAP, mean annual temperature, soil pH, and soil organic carbon. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that variation in fungal community composition was mainly explained by plant community composition, followed by geographical distance and abiotic factors. Structural equation models further highlighted the significant role of plant species richness in determining soil fungal richness. Taken together, these results suggest that the regional-scale distribution pattern of soil fungal communities is predominantly mediated by plant community composition, and also by abiotic factors and geographical distance in arid and semi-arid temperate grasslands.

However, information about the soil animal community involved in fine-root litter decomposition remains limited. We compared the composition of the soil microarthropods involved in leaf and root decomposition in field experiments using litterbags. To evaluate the relative effects of litter type and initial litter position, we set up a two-factor experiment (litter type x litter position). Litterbags containing either roots or leaves were placed at two positions (either on the soil surface or buried within the soil) and were collected to follow the succession of microarthropods in the decomposing litter for three years. We found different successional patterns of soil microarthropods between the natural processes of leaf and root litter decomposition (i.e. leaves on the soil surface and roots buried within the soil), which were caused by taxonomy-specific responses to both litter quality and litter position. Prostigmata were clearly affected by the stage of litter decomposition; they were initial colonisers of decomposition in all litterbag treatments. The abundances of other taxa were more determined by litter position; however, Oribatida showed a preference for later stages of decomposition, while Collembola and Mesostigmata were strongly determined by water content related to litter position. Although litter quality was not the primary factor controlling their distribution, the ratio of Oribatida to Collembola gradually increased during the decomposition process in the belowground litterbags. Our results indicate that Oribatida are primarily involved in root litter decomposition process, particularly in the late stages of decomposition under natural conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Host discrimination mechanisms that reduce the fitness of uncooperative symbionts can stabilise mutualism against collapse, but also present a paradox - if discrimination is effective, why do uncooperative symbionts persist? Here, we test whether mutations or fitness benefits of cheating best explain the prevalence of uncooperative wasps in the fig tree-fig wasp mutualism. By combining theory with field-collected data we demonstrate that the proportions of pollen-free wasps of strongly discriminating hosts are reached with reasonable mutation rates. In contrast, in weakly discriminating hosts, the required mutation rates, assuming a single locus, are untenably high, but the required cheater advantages fall within expected ranges. We propose that when discrimination is weak, uncooperative symbionts proliferate until they reach the equilibrium proportion that balances costs and benefits of cheating. Our results suggest that mechanisms that resolve the paradox of uncooperative symbionts differ among host species.","[Jander, K.

In Ghana, the Social Responsibility Agreement (SRA) is a forest management scheme that entails devolution of decision-making powers on benefit sharing from commercial logging to local authorities to represent local interest. This paper explores how democratic representation is manifested under the choice of local leaders in the context of the SRA by focusing on: choice of local leaders, responsiveness (how represented and desired interests compare), and accountability (feedback and sanction mechanisms). A joint representative body comprised of the chief and the customary structure, and the elected local government leaders represented the communities. The authority of the customary structure is reinforced by cultural and historical settings; enabling chiefs to capture dedsion making powers and dominate activities in the representation processes. Devoid of popular consultation, the leaders largely assume local priorities relying mainly on their nearness to the local population. To some extent, and for multiple reasons, the concluded SRAs under this study succeeded in providing social amenities to the people but due to accountability failures, the scheme was weak in engaging the local population in the negotiation of benefits from commercial forest exploitation. The question remains open as to whether greater accountability - that is, more-democratic representation - would produce greater responsiveness and a more efficient and equitable match between what leaders have to offer and the services people ultimately receive.

Despite a recent overview of the AMF assemblages associated in the naturalized range of C japonica, no such survey has ever been carried out within the native range of this plant species. For this reason, we examined through 454 sequencing the diversity and structure of AMF assemblages in camellia roots and surrounding soil from four locations within the Shimane prefecture (Japan), a region that harbors native C japonica trees. The specific objectives were as follows: (i) to evaluate the differences between the root-colonizing and the soil-dwelling AMF community through different measurements of diversity and (ii) to evaluate if and how deeply the small-scale environmental changes affect the structure of AMF assemblages. We found that a large number of AMF (similar to 90%) could not be assigned to previously known phylotypes, suggesting the occurrence of several undescribed taxa. Diversity was generally higher in roots than in soil samples and the level of dominance was low. Almost 70% of soil-dwelling AMF were retrieved inside the roots and also community structure was very similar between the two niches. Most AMF clades/genera were infrequent and only Rhizophagus/Sclerocystis and Glomus sensu lato were very abundant in both root and soil samples. Above all, soil Fe and Mg content, soil C/N ratio, and the distance from the nearest source of saline water were consistently correlated with AMF community shifts at the local scale.

Four sites were selected along the groundwater depth gradient. At each site, five sample plots (20 x 20 m) and 15 subplots (1 x 1 m) were established for a vegetation inventory of Haloxylon persicum and the herbaceous layer. The vegetation inventory included plant density, canopy coverage, height, and basal stem diameter of H. persicum. Allometric equations were established for H. persicum based on the biomass of 22 excavated trees, which were then applied to inventory data to provide stand estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB), below ground biomass (BGB), and total biomass (TB) of H. persicum. The AGB of the herbaceous layer was measured in subplots (1 x 1 m) and BGB was excavated and measured to a depth of 100 cm at 10-cm intervals. Our results indicated that the BGB-to-AGB ratio at the community level in the herbaceous layer increased notably along the gradient of declining groundwater depth. The depth of the soil horizon that contained 65% of the root surface area and 85% of the root biomass was shallower (0-2.5 m) in the deep end of the groundwater depth gradient than in the shallow end (0-3 m) of the gradient. H. persicum adjusted root distribution to capture water in the upper soil layers in response to the decline in groundwater depth. However, this adjustment was not sufficient to compensate for the decline in the water table: the BGB-to-AGB ratio showed no significant increase as AGB declined. On the contrary, herbaceous plants seemed better adapted to changes in the water table by effectively adjusting their BGB-to-AGB ratio. Use of BGB-to-AGB ratios that are specific to groundwater tables will significantly improve our estimates of BGB carbon stocks in these woodlands. Considering the scarcity of information on biomass stocks and partitioning in desert woodlands, our results might be applicable to other desert regions in Central Asia dominated by H. persicum.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the negative impact of soil compaction on soil physical properties, but the effects of compaction of forest soils on soil chemical and biological processes like the phosphorus availability are largely unknown. Aim of our study was to analyze the effect of skidding activity on the P dynamics on skid trails and the soil recovery ability after skidding. Furthermore, we wanted to assess if acid phosphatase activity is an appropriate indicator of soil structure damage after compaction. We investigated the phosphorus availability, acid phosphatase activity, TOC, pH value, and fine root density of soil samples from skid trails and from control plots without any skidding effect. We conducted our studies at three sites (Gottingen: Cambisols on limestone, Heide: Podzol on glacial drift and sand, and Soiling: Cambisols at loess-covered sandstone) in Lower Saxony, Germany 10 to 40 years after last traffic impact in a space-for-time substitution. We observed mainly higher P concentrations and higher pH values at the wheel tracks than in the control. TOC was predominantly higher at the wheel tracks, but lower TOC at the wheel tracks was also found. In the acidic loams of the Soiling region, the amount of mineralized phosphate was much higher in the tracks compared to the control areas 10 to 30 years after last traffic impact. This suggests a decoupling of P mineralization from P uptake in the wheel tracks for several decades. Furthermore, higher as well as lower phosphatase activity at the wheel tracks compared to the untrafficked control was found, but higher phosphatase activities at the wheel tracks were predominant. Acid phosphatase activity was strongly correlated with TOC, but did not correlate with the time since last traffic impact and the gas diffusivity of the soil. Therefore, our results did not confirm that acid phosphatase activity is an appropriate soil biological indicator of soil compaction and structural recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the St. Lawrence Estuary (Canada), several whale species are threatened by navigation activities in various ways. Since 2013, seasonal voluntary ship strike mitigation measures, including a speed reduction area (SRA) and a no-go area, were implemented annually and largely adopted by the maritime industry to reduce the risks of lethal collisions with four species of baleen whales. While the endangered St. Lawrence beluga population is unlikely to be subject to collisions with large merchant ships, it is known to be negatively affected by vessel-generated underwater noise. To assess how these protection measures modify the beluga's soundscape throughout their critical habitat, we implemented an underwater acoustic module within an existing agent-based model (3MTSim) of ship-whale movements and interactions in the St. Lawrence Estuary. We ran multiple simulations for two scenarios 1) without and 2) with the protection measures to compare the level of noise received by belugas before and after 2013. Overall, the simulations showed a statistically-significant 1.6% decrease in the total amount of noise received by belugas in their critical habitat following the implementation of the protection measures. Although slowing down ships reduces instantaneous radiated noise, it also increases the total amount of acoustic energy released in the environment by extending the time spent in the SRA. Accordingly, our simulations showed a 2.4% increase in the cumulative noise from shipping received by beluga in the SRA. Conversely, belugas located in the Upper Estuary, mostly females and calves, i.e., the most valuable individuals experienced a 5.4% reduction in the cumulative received level of shipping noise. Although refinements are required to improve the modelling of noise sources and propagation for finer scale projections in this complex nearshore environment, this agent -based modelling paradigm of 3MTSim proved informative for underwater acoustic impact assessments.

However, there is little knowledge on the distribution and identity of DSEs in non-mycorrhizal' plants. In the current study, colonization and diversity of DSEs colonizing the roots of eight typically non-mycorrhizal' families were assessed. In total, 120 root samples of 31 plant species were all colonized by DSEs. Intensity of DSE colonization varied greatly among different plant species, with a range of 0.56-47.56%, 8.13% on average. Cladosporium, Cyphellophora and Phialophora were the dominant genera, with a relative abundance of more than 60% over a total of 90 isolates. Our results showed that diverse DSE species colonized the roots of non-mycorrhizal' plants, especially they were more common in degraded mine tailings than in the undisturbed site, but their integral roles to the functional roots are in need of further experimental demonstration.

Rich male; Taxodium 406) has been selected as a species for reforestation in flooding areas, China. To elucidate its adaptive strategies to prolonged flooding environments, morpho-anatomical, photosynthetic and growth responses of Taxodium 406 were investigated during three months of flooding stress, i.e. half-flooding (HF) and total submergence (TS). Taxodium 406 showed 100% survival rate under both flooding treatments. Compared to control (CK), root biomass and root/shoot ratio of HF plants were reduced, while height and shoot biomass were increased by 40% and 58% respectively, and thus total biomass was unchanged. For TS plants, their root biomass, total biomass and root/shoot ratio were 69, 48 and 58% lower respectively, than those of CK plants. Compared to initial values, however, non-elongating height and increased basal diameter of TS plants were observed. Besides, TS plants had greater chlorophyll contents than the other two treatments at the end of the experiment. Well-developed aerenchyma, hypertrophied lenticels, large intercellular spaces and adventitious roots of Taxodium 406 plants were formed under HF flooding treatment. Additionally, tested root morphological parameters, i.e. total length, surface area, volume, tips and length in diameter of four classes were lower for HF and TS plants than for CK plants, and no significant difference was found between HF and TS plants. Compared to CK plants, net photosynthetic rate of HF plants was unchanged, while stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and intercellular carbon dioxide concentration were enhanced across the experiment. Therefore, morpho-anatomical adaption and maintenance of photosynthesis of HF plants and the growth retardation of TS plants are responsible for the survival and growth of Taxodium 406 plants under extreme flooding environments.

European beech (Fagus sylvatica), one of the major tree species in Central Europe, is considered to be particularly threatened by the expected changes in local water regimes. Basic knowledge on the species' genetic variation, environmental adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity is required to assess its potential for climate change adaptation, but sufficient information is lacking. Here, we describe a seedling common garden study at two field sites incorporating 77 natural populations of European beech from an environmentally heterogeneous mountain region in the center of its distribution. We aimed to identify patterns of genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity in growth and phenology, and to associate these with seed source environments. Population differentiation was greater for phenology than for growth (Q(st) = 0.18-0.32 vs. 0.00-0.16), but within-population genetic variation was large for all seedling traits. The phenotype-environment associations indicated adaptive divergence in phenology and growth with respect to temperature and water availability, but not to soil characteristics, latitude, longitude, or topography of the seed source locations. Phenotypic plasticity was detected in growth and leaf duration, the magnitude of which differed among populations with different seed source temperatures. We conclude that seedling phenology is key to temperature and drought adaptation in European beech. Changes in local temperature and water regimes might result in local phenological maladaptation of European beech populations, although within-population genetic variation, gene flow, and phenotypic plasticity might mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Only glyphosate applied at 4.14 ae kg ha(-1) significantly reduced, by 27%, third year seedling survival. Pattern of sensitivity of cedar seedling growth to glyphosate was diameter>height. Seedlings treated with 2.07 and 4.14 ae kg ha(-1) glyphosate had significantly less root biomass than those in the control plots, whereas only cedar treated with 4.14 ae kg ha(-1) glyphosate had lower shoot biomass.

Although this method has advantages in terms of its easy handling and low cost, there are uncertainties in the estimates per unit soil volume or unit stand area, because the net sheet is a two-dimensional material. Therefore, this study aimed to establish calculation procedures for estimating fine root production rates from two-dimensional fine root data on net sheets. This study was conducted in a hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. & Zucc.) Endl.) stand in western Japan. We estimated fine root production rates in length and volume from the number (RN) and cross-sectional area (RCSA) densities, respectively, for fine roots crossing the net sheets, which were then converted to dry mass values. For these calculations, we used empirical regression equations or theoretical equations between the RN or RCSA densities on the vertical walls of soil pits and fine root densities in length or volume, respectively, in the soil, wherein the theoretical equations assumed random orientation of the growing fine roots. The estimates of mean fine root (diameter <1 mm) production rates were similar to 80-100 gm(-2) year(-1) using the empirically obtained regression equations, whereas those from the theoretical equations were similar to 40-50 gm(-2) year(-1). The difference in the estimates was attributed to larger slope values of the empirical regression equations than those of the theoretical equations, suggesting that fine root orientation was not random in our study site. In light of these results, we concluded that fine root production rates were successfully estimated from two-dimensional fine root data on the net sheets using these calculation procedures, with the empirical regression equations reflecting fine root orientation in the study site.","[Noguchi, Kyotaro; Ishizuka, Shigehiro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Soils, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Tanikawa, Toko] FFPRI, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi Ku, 68 Nagai Kyutaro, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Inagaki, Yoshiyuki] FFPRI, Shikoku Res Ctr, 2-915 Asakura Nishimachi, Kochi 7808077, Japan","Noguchi, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Soils, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",kyotaro@affrc.go.jp,"Ishizuka, Shigehiro/A-9975-2011; Inagaki, Yoshiyuki/B-5751-2011","Ishizuka, Shigehiro/0000-0002-9906-9571; Inagaki, Yoshiyuki/0000-0001-9275-3314","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Development of mitigation and adaptation techniques to global warming in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries)","This study was financially supported in part by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Development of mitigation and adaptation techniques to global warming in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries).",,38,1,1,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,2017,37,6,,,,,697,705,,10.1093/treephys/tpx044,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,FA5NK,WOS:000405489900002,28482043,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Fahey, TJ; Yanai, RD; Gonzales, KE; Lombardi, JA",,,,"Fahey, T.

This report provides practical advice for field sampling and laboratory processing of root biomass in these settings. Manual coring is the most efficient method for sampling fine root biomass in the upper soil profile (we sampled to 30 cm). However, careful correction for coarse fragment volume is needed because manual coring is impeded by rocks. Unbiased estimation of root biomass below obstructions requires either excavating a pit or power coring. We recommend power coring because of the very high field labor costs of pit excavation. Roots can be separated from soil either by dry picking or by wet sieving. For surface organic matter-rich horizons typical of many forest soils, only dry picking is feasible. A timed interval approach can greatly reduce laboratory processing time. Because sorting live from dead roots is necessarily subjective, efforts to avoid fragmentation of root systems obtained from cores are strongly recommended. Sample size requirements for detecting changes or differences in root biomass at the stand level are presented based on extensive sampling in northern hardwood forests. Detecting 20% differences in fine root (< 1 mm) biomass in 0-30 cm soil using ten 5-cm manual cores generally would require about nine sample plots in a stand, whereas detecting such differences in deep soil (30-50 cm) would be virtually impossible because of extreme spatial variation. Power analyses such as these can help improve experimental designs, as the spatial intensity of sampling determines the detectable difference, which can in turn guide decisions about the temporal frequency of sampling.","[Fahey, T.

Occurrence of true truffles (Tuber spp.) was therefore screened using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and subsequent PCR amplicon sequencing in tree roots collected at 322 field sites across the Czech Republic. These sites spanned a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. The sampling was a priori restricted to areas thought to be suitable for Tuber spp. inasmuch as they were characterized by weakly acidic to alkaline soils, warmer climate, and with tree species previously known to host true truffles. Eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to Tuber aestivum, T. borchii, T. foetidum, T. rufum, T. indicum, T. huidongense, T. dryophilum, and T. oligospermum were detected. Among these, T. borchii was the OTU encountered most frequently. It was detected at nearly 19% of the sites. Soil pH was the most important predictor of Tuber spp. distribution. Tuber borchii preferred weakly acidic soils, T. foetidum and T. rufum were most abundant in neutral soils, and T. huidongense was restricted to alkaline soils. Distribution of T. aestivum was mainly dictated by climate, with its range restricted to the warmest sites. Host preferences of the individual Tuber spp. were weak compared to soil and climatic predictors, with the notable exception that T. foetidum appeared to avoid oak trees. Our results open the way to better understanding truffle ecology and, through this new knowledge, also to better-informed trufficulture.","[Gryndler, Milan; Stovicek, Vaclav; Novakova, Kristyna] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Sci, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Gryndler, Milan; Hrselova, Hana; Jansa, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, Lab Fungal Biol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Smilauer, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Gryndler, M (reprint author), Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Sci, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",gryndler@biomed.cas.cz,"Hrselova, Hana/H-6340-2014; Jansa, Jan/H-3161-2014; Smilauer, Petr/N-8313-2019; Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016","Hrselova, Hana/0000-0003-3546-2718; Jansa, Jan/0000-0002-0331-1774; Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Gryndler, Milan/0000-0002-9564-1067","Grantova Agentura Ceske RepublikyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-36079G, P504/10/0382]; Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy [LM2015073, RVO61388971]","Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/Award Number: 14-36079G and P504/10/0382; Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy, Grant/Award Number: LM2015073 and RVO61388971",,61,2,2,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Antagonistic species interactions dominate the local adaptation literature relative to mutualistic ones, preventing an overall assessment of adaptation within interspecific interactions. Here, we tested whether the legume Medicago lupulina is adapted to the locally abundant species of mutualistic nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria that vary in frequency across its eastern North American range. We reciprocally inoculated northern and southern M.lupulina genotypes with the northern (Ensifer medicae) or southern bacterium (E.meliloti) in a greenhouse experiment. Despite producing different numbers of root nodules (the structures in which the plants house the bacteria), neither northern nor southern plants produced more seeds, flowered earlier, or were more likely to flower when inoculated with their local rhizobia. We then used a pre-existing dataset to perform a genome scan for loci that showed elevated differentiation between field-collected plants that hosted different bacteria. None of the loci we identified belonged to the well-characterized suite of legume-rhizobia symbiosis genes, suggesting that the rhizobia do not drive genetic divergence between M.lupulina populations.

Many studies have addressed the effects of monocultures on soil features, but few have examined the effects of individual trees within a mixed stand. This work illustrates the differences of litter and soil characteristics in a coastal mixed forest stand in northern Iran. For this purpose, the Alnus glutinosa (AG), Populus caspica (PC), Ulmus minor (UM) and Parrotia persica (PP) species were examined; litter and soil samples were taken under tree canopy cover. Litter quality differed among the tree species, with the highest total N concentration (1.83%) and lowest organic C (38.38%) under AG species. Soil pH (7.19), EC (0.29 ds/m), total N (0.33%), available P (26.21 mg kg(-1)), available Ca (257.30 mg kg(-1)), available Mg (56.80 mg kg(-1)), earthworm density/biomass (4.00 n m(-2) and 49.47 mg m(-2), respectively), microbial respiration (0.49 mg CO2-C g(soil)(-1) day(-1)), net soil ammonification (0.44 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and N mineralization rate (0.30 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) were significantly higher under AG canopy whereas a higher content of available K (355.80 mg kg(-1)) and fine root biomass (95.02 g m(-2)) were found under the PC and UM tree species, respectively. Soil organic carbon and net soil nitrification were not significantly different among tree species. The results of this case study demonstrate that tree influence on litter and soil features is detectable even in a mixed stand and the soil landscape of such forests may be considered as a small-scale mosaic of profiles reflecting the occurrence and chemical characteristics of the various tree species present.","[Kooch, Yahya; Tarighat, Faeze Sadat; Hosseini, Seyed Mohsen] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Marine Sci, Noor 4641776489, Mazandaran, Iran","Kooch, Y (reprint author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Marine Sci, Noor 4641776489, Mazandaran, Iran.",yahya.kooch@yahoo.com; faeze_tarighat69@yahoo.com; hosseini@modares.ac.ir,,,"Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran","Many thanks are due to Mr. Ehsan Rajayee and Mr. Ali Khodadust for their tireless assistance with field sampling.

Since fungal symbionts of Abies alba seedlings regenerating under larch canopy have not been investigated, we aimed to evaluate the diversity of ECM of 1-year-old silver-fir seedlings regenerating under canopy of larch and to compare these communities to those found in adjacent mature silver-fir stands. Three silver-fir stands (F) and three European larch forecrops (L) were selected to study. Seedling size did not differ between F and L stands. ECM colonization was observed in 100% silver-fir seedlings in F and 80% in L stands. The fine roots were highly colonized, and 91 and 87% of live ECM were found in seedlings from F and L stands, respectively. Sequencing analysis revealed a total 53 ECM taxa. The observed number of ECM taxa in the F stands was significantly higher (46) than that in the L forecrops (25), and 34% of taxa were common to both stands. The dominant ECM species in F were unidentified fungus 1, Piloderma sp., Tylospora asterophora and Russula integra. Fir seedlings regenerating in L forecrops formed ectomycorrhizas mostly with unidentified fungus 1, Tomentella sublilacina, Tylospora sp., Hydnotrya bailii and T. asterophora. Based on ANOSIM analysis, ECM communities have shown significant differences between study sites. The diversity of ECM fungal partners and the high colonization rate of silver-fir seedlings regenerating in larch forecrop stands should be sufficient to provide efficient afforestation of post-arable lands and gives the opportunity for their successful rebuilding.","[Wazny, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ, Malopolska Ctr Biotechnol, Gronostajowa 7a, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Kowalski, Stefan] Univ Agr, Dept Forest Pathol, 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland","Wazny, R (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Malopolska Ctr Biotechnol, Gronostajowa 7a, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",rafal.wazny@uj.edu.pl,"Wazny, Rafal/U-4360-2018","Wazny, Rafal/0000-0002-3213-3583",University of Agriculture in Krakow (Department of Forest Pathology) [BZ 573/KFL],"The authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for providing helpful comments on drafts of this manuscript.

We experimentally test this hypothesis with a mesocosm system where AM and ECM tree seedling roots, or their hyphae only, could access mineral soils with C-13- and N-15-enriched organic matter. We quantified loss of soil C and N, plant uptake of N and new inputs of plant C to soil. We found that AM, but not ECM, seedlings reduced soil C relative to controls. Soil C loss was greater in the presence of roots relative to hyphae only for both AM and ECM seedlings, but was correlated with plant N uptake for AM seedlings only. While new plant C inputs stimulated soil C loss in both symbioses, we detected plant C inputs more frequently and measured higher rates of decomposer activity in soils colonized by AM relative to ECM seedlings.

A magnetic treatment device was used to treat the plants. The contents of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in leaves and roots were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), and the fluxes of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and H+ in mesophyll cells and in meristematic zones were measured using a noninvasive micro-test technique (NIMT) after 30 days of treatment. After 90 days, the plants were harvested, and their growth indices and root morphology were measured. The results showed that (i) compared with nonmagnetic treatments (NMT), the magnetic treatments (MT) led to higher K+ and Mg2+ contents and lower Ca2+ content in roots and leaves, while the Na+ content was lower and the K+/Na+ ratio was higher; (ii) MT enhanced Na+ efflux, increased H+ influx, and decreased K+ and Mg2+ efflux compared with NMT; (iii) MT resulted in greater height, diameter, and leaf area of the plants and increased the length, surface area, and number of root tips compared with NMT; and (iv) stomatal conductance (Gs), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and water use efficiency (WUE) were increased in MT, whereas both transpiration rate (Tr) and stomatal limiting value (Ls) were decreased compared with NMT. The results indicate that the use of magnetized water can promote plant quality and regulate the ion absorption, transpiration, and distribution. Thus, MT is conducive to the re-establishment of ionic homeostatic mechanisms via ion-selective absorption and transportation under salt stress.","[Liu, Xiumei; Ma, Fengyun; Zhu, Hong; Ma, Xuesong; Guo, Jianyao; Wan, Xiao; Wang, Lu; Wang, Huatian; Wang, Yanping] Key Lab Silviculture Shandong Prov, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiumei; Ma, Fengyun; Zhu, Hong; Ma, Xuesong; Guo, Jianyao; Wan, Xiao; Wang, Lu; Wang, Huatian; Wang, Yanping] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, HT (reprint author), Key Lab Silviculture Shandong Prov, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Wang, HT (reprint author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wanght@sdau.edu.cn,,,"National Program of the International Introduction of Advanced Science and Technology in Forestry of China (948 Program) [2011-4-60]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416904/zgc]; National Natural Science Funds of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270670, 31070550]; Agricultural Major Application Technology Innovation Program of Shandong Province [36]","The authors are grateful for the funding provided by the National Program of the International Introduction of Advanced Science and Technology in Forestry of China (948 Program, Grant No. 2011-4-60), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, Grant No. 2012CB416904/zgc), the National Natural Science Funds of China (Grant Nos. 31270670, 31070550), and the Agricultural Major Application Technology Innovation Program of Shandong Province (Financial and Agricultural Indicators, 2016, No. 36).

Atractiella grew significantly faster on media substituted with inorganic nitrogen sources and slower in the presence of another fungal genus. To determine plausible causal mechanisms we used metabolomics to explore competitive interactions between Atractiella strains and Fusarium oxysporum or Leptosphaerulina chartarum. Metabolomic screening of potential microbial inhibitors showed increased levels of glycosides produced in vitro by Atractiella when grown with a different fungal genus, relative to when grown alone. Cumulatively, these results suggest Atractiella is a poor competitor with other fungi via direct routes e.g. faster growth rates, but may utilize chemical interactions and possibly nitrogen sources to defend itself, and niche partition its way to abundance in the plant host root and rhizosphere.

The studied traits were shoot height, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, ratio of root/shoot, root length, root perimeter, root area and root volume. SAPs successfully enhanced growth capability of A. sieberi in two soil textures compared to the controls. Ideally, 5 g kg(1) Aquasorb (SNF Company, France) with 100% irrigation and 10 g kg(1) Stockosorb (R) (Evonik Corporation, Germany) with 75% irrigation in a sandy loam texture and 10 g kg(1) Boloorab A (Boloorab Company, Iran) with 75% irrigation in a loamy texture significantly affected all traits, resulting in 100% survival for A. sieberi seedlings. Aquasorb and Stockosorb (R) showed the best results in the sandy loam texture and preferable outputs were obtained by Boloorab A application in the loamy texture. In other words, because of the basic differentiation among soils in terms of mineralogy, temperature and moisture content, different SAPs should be applied. Production of dense root network and root aggregation stimulated by SAPs increased root contact with moisture. Therefore, improving the growth and survival of the plants is accessible using SAPs under water stress condition.","[Rezashateri, Maryam; Khajeddin, Sayed Jamaleddin; Matinkhah, Sayed Hamid] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Nat Resources, Esfahan, Iran; [Abedi-Koupai, Jahangir] Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Water Engn, Esfahan, Iran; [Majidi, Mohammad Mahdi] Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Esfahan, Iran","Abedi-Koupai, J (reprint author), Isfahan Univ Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Water Engn, Esfahan, Iran.",koupai@cc.iut.ac.ir,"Majidi, Mohammad Mahdi/AAB-9491-2019; Matinkhah, SayedHamid/V-8973-2017","Majidi, Mohammad Mahdi/0000-0003-4746-9036; Matinkhah, SayedHamid/0000-0001-6585-630X",,,,38,0,0,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0365-0340,1476-3567,,ARCH AGRON SOIL SCI,Arch.

We examined controls on EMF community composition in an 80 y-old Alnus rubra stand. EMF species were identified using root tip morphology and DNA sequencing, and related to soil variables (soil moisture, total C, total N, C:N ratio, PO4-P, soil pH) and to Frankia nodulation using Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and multivariate techniques. Twenty-two EMF species were identified, including 14 that are new associates of A. rubra. EMF community composition varied temporally and was influenced by Frankia nodulation and soil chemistry.

Biosorption experiments were carried out for the removal of Pb+2 from aqueous solution, using novel lignin gels (soda lignin and sulfonated resinified soda lignin) extracted from Nypa fruitcans. The effects of major variables governing the efficiency of the process such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial concentration and temperature were studied by the batch process. Equilibrium data was fitted into the Langmuir and Frendlich isotherm models. Adsorption kinetics was analyzed using the pseudofirst and second- order models while thermodynamic parameters such as Delta H, Delta S and Delta G were estimated accordingly. The results showed that the sorption process was best represented by the Langmuir isotherm while the pseudo-second-order model was the appropriate model describing the adsorption kinetics. The optimum adsorption occur at pH of 4 and 6, corresponding to a maximum adsorption of 94.24 and 96.34% for the unmodified lignin (UL), and sulfonated resinified lignin (SRL), respectively. The adsorption process was found to be endothermic and spontaneous. An indication of kinetic performance (R-w), suggests that sulfonated lignin approaches equilibrium faster and would likely remove more Pb+2 from solution than the unmodified lignin. Similarly, optimization of the biosorbent dosage in a single stage batch design revealed that more than twice, the amount of SRL biosorbent is required by the UL to remove over 94% of lead (II) ions from aqueous solution.","[Ogunsile, B.

The phytotoxicity of the gamma ray-sterilized crude culture filtrates of sixteen fungal species originating from replanted apple orchards was tested in a bioassay. Low molecular weight compounds released by Fusarium spp. were analyzed. The fungal culture filtrates affected seedling growth and health with an activity that varied from growth inhibition to promotion. Three out of the six species of Fusarium tested produced species-specific mycotoxins such as equisetin and enniatin B and D (< 1 mu g ml(-1) and < 6 mu g ml(-1), respectively) associated with root-tip necrosis, whereas fusaric acid (80-230 mu g ml(-1)) was associated with asymptomatic plant growth inhibition. These findings were consistent with those obtained using pure compounds. Moreover, methoxyconidiol, paecilaminol, integrastatin B and other biologically active compounds, whose fungal origin and phytotoxicity have not yet been reported, were found. in all fungal filtrates. Findings suggest that i) phytopathogenicity of soil borne fungi can be expressed regardless of root infection; ii) a synergistic interaction between co-occurring mycotoxins and other biologically active compounds may explain plant growth inhibition. Iii) fungal metabolites released into soil may represent an underestimated component of nonspecific replant disease.","[Manici, L. M.; Caputo, F.; Sacca, M.

Several, contrasting hypotheses exist on this plasticity, but empirical evidence for these hypotheses is scattered. This study aims to enhance our understanding of tree root plasticity by examining intra-specific variation in fine-root mass and morphology, fine-root growth and decomposition, and associated mycorrhizal interactions in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests on soils that differ in resource availability. We measured the mass and morphological traits of fine roots (i.e. <= 2 mm diameter) sampled to 50 cm depth. Fine-root growth was measured with ingrowth cores, and fine-root decomposition with litter bags. Mycorrhizal fungal biomass was determined using ingrowth mesh bags. Both tree species showed more than three times higher fine-root mass, and a ten-fold higher fine-root growth rate on sand than on clay, but no or marginal differences in overall fine-root morphology. Within the fine-root category however, beech stands had relatively more root length of their finest roots on clay than on sand. In the spruce stands, ectomycorrhizal mycelium biomass was larger on sand than on clay. In temperate beech and spruce forests, fine-root mass and mycorrhizal fungal biomass, rather than fine-root morphology, are changed to ensure uptake under different soil resource conditions. Yet enhancing our mechanistic understanding of fine-root trait plasticity and how it affects tree growth requires more attention to fine-root dynamics, the functional diversity within the fine-roots, and mycorrhizal symbiosis as an important belowground uptake strategy.","[Weemstra, Monique; Sterck, Frank J.; Goudzwaard, Leo] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Weemstra, Monique; Mommer, Liesje] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Visser, Eric J.

We investigate soil community responses to global change under different co-occurring plant species. In a heathland FACE-experiment, we modelled projected global changes by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (to 510 ppm) and soil temperature by 1 A degrees C at 2 cm depth (with night-time reflectance curtains) and reducing summer precipitation for 2-5 weeks annually (with rain-out curtains). We assessed nematode community trophic composition and bacterial and fungal abundance in soil under the dominant plant species Calluna vulgaris and Deschampsia flexuosa in the spring, 10 months after the last experimental drought period. Fungal dominance increased relative to bacterial under elevated CO2. Similarly, elevated CO2 increased abundance of fungivorous nematodes relative to bacterivorous nematodes. Decreased precipitation did not affect the abundances of microorganisms or nematodes, and there were only few effects of warming. Fungivorous nematodes dominated under C. vulgaris, whereas bacterivorous nematodes were relatively more abundant under D. flexuosa. Abundances of plant feeding and omnivorous/predatory nematodes were higher under D. flexuosa than under C. vulgaris. This supports the hypothesis that more carbon will flow through fungal than bacterial channels when below-ground allocation of photosynthetically-derived C increases without a corresponding soil nitrogen increase. Further, as different plant species are associated with distinct belowground decomposer communities, vegetation shifts induced by future CO2 and climate regimes will also shift belowground communities with consequences for decomposition dynamics.","[Dam, Marie; Vestergard, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Terr Ecol Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Dam, Marie] Zealand Inst Business & Technol, Bredahlsgade 1, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark; [Bergmark, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Microbiol Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Bergmark, Lasse] Novo Nordisk, Hagedornsvej 1, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark","Vestergard, M (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Terr Ecol Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",mevmadsen@bio.ku.dk,"Vestergard, Mette/J-4181-2014","Vestergard, Mette/0000-0002-0054-4855",Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation; DONG Energy; Air Liquide; Danish Council for Strategic Research (ASHBACK) [DSF-12-132655]; Danish Council for Independent Research (OP-RICE-ING) [DFF-4002-00274],"The CLIMAITE project was funded by the Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation, DONG Energy and Air Liquide, and we thank Sven Danbaek, Andreas Fernquist, Preben Jorgensen and Nina Wiese Thomsen for keeping the field facility running.

The transect covered five main forest types (Mediterranean and broadleaved forests, southern, middle, and northern taiga). In spring 2015, we assessed major abiotic parameters of soil, soil microbial PLFA markers, and nematode community characteristics (genus richness, abundance, biomass and trophic structure) in the burnt and control plots. Generic richness was the highest in the southern taiga (22 genera) declining both northwards (down to 16) and southwards (down to 13 genera). The highest abundance of nematodes was recorded in the Mediterranean forests (139.4 +/- 15.1 ind. g(-1) soil dwt, control site) and the lowest in the northern taiga (10.8 +/- 1.2 ind. g(-1) soil dwt, burnt site). Biomass followed the same pattern with slight deviations. Abundance and biomass of soil nematodes was not significantly affected by fires in any ecoregion with the exception of Mediterranean forests. We detected consistent fire effects on the abundance of particular nematode feeding groups. Trophic groups abundance of soil nematode communities were considerably modified in burnt forests due to the increase in abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes and reduced number of hyphal-feeding, plant associated and plant-feeding nematodes. This increase in bacterial-feeding nematode biomass coincided with the growth of the ratio between bacterial and fungal biomass in pyrogenic soils. pH of soil solution and actual denitrification rate in the burnt forests correlated with the biomass of predatory nematodes. We conclude that, five years after fire, the structure of the microbial community, pH of soil solution and denitrification activity correlate with the ratio of feeding groups of belowground nematode communities in these forests. Taking into account considerable nematode biomass in soil, shifts in the ratio of trophic groups after fires induced by these factors may potentially lead to changes in the level of ecosystem functions which they deliver in burnt forests.

Evidence shows that grazing can stimulate, inhibit, or have no effect on AM fungi. This inconsistency may be due to empirical limitations, specifically: (i) choice of AM fungal response variable, (ii) confounding effects of soil and plant responses to grazing, and (iii) variation in the duration of studies. To test these hypotheses, we compared AM fungi between grazed and ungrazed grassland plots, with grazing exclosures varying in age from 17 to 85 years. Our findings clearly show that grazing does not universally inhibit AM fungi: grazing had no effect on root colonization plots but spore density was higher and soil hyphal length was lower in grazed plots. While soil and plant variables were unrelated to fungal responses, time since grazing cessation was an important factor explaining the difference between grazed and ungrazed AM fungal communities at a site, indicating possible time lags in responses. Understanding of grazing effects on AM fungi can be enhanced by considering multiple fungal responses and increasing the time scale under which they are studied.","[van der Heyde, Mieke; Bennett, Jonathan A.; Pither, Jason; Hart, Miranda] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","van der Heyde, M (reprint author), Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",mieke.vanderheyde@gmail.com,,"van der Heyde, Mieke/0000-0002-1658-9927; Pither, Jason/0000-0002-7490-6839",NSERC Discovery Grant programNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation,"JP and MMH acknowledge financial support from the NSERC Discovery Grant program, and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.",,76,13,13,4,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

We investigated the association between AMF and the plant community structure in the nearest neighborhood of Festuca brevipila in a semiarid grassland with steep environmental gradients, using high-throughput sequencing of the Glomeromycotina (former Glomeromycota). We focused on the Passenger, Driver and Habitat hypotheses: (i) plant communities drive AMF (passenger); (ii) AMF communities drive the plants (driver); (iii) the environment shapes both communities causing covariation. The null hypothesis is that the two assemblages are independent and this study offers a spatially explicit novel test of it in the field at multiple, small scales. The AMF community consisted of 71 operational taxonomic units, the plant community of 47 species. Spatial distance and spatial variation in the environment were the main determinants of the AMF community. The structure of the plant community around the focal plant was a poor predictor of AMF communities, also in terms of phylogenetic community structure. Some evidence supports the passenger hypothesis, but the relative roles of the factors structuring the two groups clearly differed, leading to an apparent decoupling of the two assemblages at the relatively small scale of this study. Community phylogenetic structure in AMF suggests an important role of within-assemblage interactions.","[Horn, Sebastian] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Horn, Sebastian; Hempel, Stefan; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany; [Hempel, Stefan; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Okol Pflanzen, Berlin, Germany; [Verbruggen, Erik] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol PLECO, Antwerp, Belgium; [Caruso, Tancredi] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Sch Biol Sci, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Caruso, Tancredi] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Inst Global Food Secur, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Caruso, T (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Sch Biol Sci, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.; Caruso, T (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Inst Global Food Secur, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",t.caruso@qub.ac.uk,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515; Horn, Sebastian/0000-0001-7812-5813",German science foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CA 987/1-1]; project SENSE (Structure and Ecological Niche in the Soil Environment) [EC FP7-631399-SENSE],"SH and TC acknowledge funding by the German science foundation (DFG Grant No. CA 987/1-1).

In this study, we used ecosystem delta N-15 to assess effects of increased N deposition on N cycling in an old-growth broad-leaved forest and a secondary pine forest in a high-N-deposition area in southern China. We measured delta N-15 of inorganic N in input and output fluxes under ambient N deposition, and we measured N concentration (%N) and delta N-15 of major ecosystem compartments under ambient deposition and after decadal N addition at 50 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), which has a delta N-15 of 0.7 %. Our results showed that the total inorganic N in deposition was N-15-depleted (10 %) mainly due to high input of strongly N-15-depleted NH4+-N. Plant leaves in both forests were also N-15-depleted (4 to 6 %). The broad-leaved forest had higher plant and soil % N and was more N-15-enriched in most ecosystem compartments relative to the pine forest. Nitrogen addition did not significantly affect % N in the broad-leaved forest, indicating that the ecosystem pools are already N-rich. However, % N was marginally increased in pine leaves and significantly increased in understory vegetation in the pine forest. Soil delta N-15 was not changed significantly by the N addition in either forest. However, the N addition significantly increased the delta N-15 of plants toward the N-15 signature of the added N, indicating incorporation of added N into plants. Thus, plant delta N-15 was more sensitive to ecosystem N input manipulation than % N in these subtropical forests. We interpret the depleted delta N-15 of plants as an imprint from the high and N-15-depleted N deposition that may dominate the effects of fractionation that are observed in most warm and humid forests. Fractionation during the steps of N cycling could explain the difference between negative delta N-15 in plants and positive delta N-15 in soils, and the increase in soil delta N-15 with depths. Nevertheless, interpretation of ecosystem delta N-15 from high-N-deposition regions needs to include data on the deposition N-15 signal.","[Gurmesa, Geshere Abdisa; Lu, Xiankai; Mao, Qinggong; Mo, Jiangming] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gurmesa, Geshere Abdisa; Lu, Xiankai; Mao, Qinggong; Mo, Jiangming] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gurmesa, Geshere Abdisa; Gundersen, Per] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gurmesa, Geshere Abdisa] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Aarhus, Denmark; [Fang, Yunting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Hao, Chen] Chinese Acad Sci, Huanjiang Observat & Res Stn Karst Ecosyst, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China","Mo, JM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Mo, JM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mojm@scib.ac.cn,"Gundersen, Per/B-2192-2008; Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012","Gundersen, Per/0000-0002-9199-4033; Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41473112, 31370498]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954400]; SDC","This study was initiated under the Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research (SDC) and was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41473112, 31370498), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954400), and the SDC.

In this paper, the xylem and phloem based transport of CeO2 NPs in hydroponic cucumber plants was investigated using a split-root system. One half of the root system was treated with 200 or 2000 mg/L of CeO2 NPs for 3 days, whereas the other half remained untreated, with both halves sharing the same aerial part. The quantitative distribution and speciation of Ce in different plant tissues and xylem sap were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscope, X-ray absorption near edge structure, and X-ray fluorescence. Results show that about 15% of Ce was reduced from Ce(IV) to Ce(III) in the roots of the treated-side (TS), while almost all of Ce remained Ce(IV) in the blank-side (BS). The detection of CeO2 or its transformation products in the xylem sap, shoots, and BS roots indicates that Ce was transported as a mixture of Ce(IV) and Ce(III) from roots to shoots through xylem, while it was transported almost only in the form of CeO2 from shoots back to roots through phloem. To our knowledge, this is the first report of root-to-shoot-to-root redistribution after transformation of CeO2 NPs in plants, which has significant implications for food safety and human health.","[Ma, Yuhui; He, Xiao; Zhang, Peng; Zhang, Zhiyong; Ding, Yayun; Zhang, Junzhe; Wang, Guohua; Xie, Changjian; Luo, Wenhe; Chai, Zhifang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Key Lab Biomed Effects Nanomat & Nanosafety, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhiyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing; Zheng, Lirong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ke] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Key Lab Biomed Effects Nanomat & Nanosafety, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZY (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangzhy@ihep.ac.cn,"He, Xiao/D-6584-2014; He, Xiao/K-8033-2019","Ma, Yuhui/0000-0002-7031-4596","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11375009, 11575208, 11405183, 11675190, 11275215, 11275218]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2013 CB932703]","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11375009, 11575208, 11405183, 11675190, 11275215, and 11275218) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2013 CB932703).",,40,17,18,9,67,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Here, we showed that organic amendments in three long-term (23, 154, and 170 yrs, respectively) field experiments significantly increased mineral availability, particularly of short-range-ordered' (SRO) phases. Two microcosm studies demonstrated that the presence of roots significantly increased mineral availability and promoted the formation of SRO phases. Mineral transformation experiments and isotopic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that citric acid, a major component of root exudates, promoted the formation of SRO minerals, and that SRO minerals acted as ""nuclei"" for C retention. Together, these findings indicate that soil organic amendments initialize a positive feedback loop by increasing mineral availability and promoting the formation of SRO minerals for further C binding, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for enhancing carbon storage in soils.","[Yu, Guanghui; Xiao, Jian; Hu, Shuijin; Zhao, Fangjie; Li, Huan; Ran, Wei; Shen, Qirong] Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Waste, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Shuijin; Li, Huan] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Polizzotto, Matthew L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Zhao, Fangjie; McGrath, Steve P.] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Soils & Grassland Syst, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Yu, Guanghui] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, ALS Bldg 3017, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Shen, QR (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Organ Solid Waste Utilizat, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Waste, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shenqirong@njau.edn.cn,"Xiao, Jian/R-1693-2018; Yu, Guanghui/H-4968-2013; McGrath, Steve P/B-5127-2008; Zhao, Fang-Jie/A-8339-2008","Yu, Guanghui/0000-0002-5699-779X; McGrath, Steve P/0000-0003-0952-8947; Zhao, Fang-Jie/0000-0002-0164-169X","Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973 Program)Ministry of Science and Technology, ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150500]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371248, 41371299]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150059]; Qjng Lan Project; UK Biotechnology and Biological Research Council; Lawes Agricultural Trust","We thank Xiangzhi Zhang and Lijuan Zhang for help and support at the BL08U1 beamline and Jingyuan Ma at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF).

Soil microbes are an important source of community resistance to plant invasions, and understanding their role in this process requires urgent investigation. Therefore, three forest communities along successional stages and four exotic invasive plant species were selected to test the role of soil microbes of three forest communities in resisting the exotic invasive plant. Our results showed that soil microbes from a monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest (MEBF) (late-successional stage) had the greatest resistance to the invasive plants. Only the invasive species Ipomoea triloba was not sensitive to the three successional forest soils. Mycorrhizal fungi in early successional forest Pinus massonina forest (PMF) or mid-successional forest pine-broadleaf mixed forest (PBMF) soil promoted the growth of Mikania micrantha and Eupatorium catarium, but mycorrhizal fungi in MEBF soil had no significant effects on their growth. Pathogens plus other non-mycorrhizal microbes in MEBF soil inhibited the growth of M. micrantha and E. catarium significantly, and only inhibited root growth of E. catarium when compared with those with mycorrhizal fungi addition. The study suggest that soil mycorrhizal fungi of early-mid-successional forests benefit invasive species M. micrantha and E. catarium, while soil pathogens of late-successional forest may play an important role in resisting M. micrantha and E. catarium. The benefit and resistance of the soil microbes are dependent on invasive species and related to forest succession. The study gives a possible clue to control invasive plants by regulating soil microbes of forest community to resist plant invasion.

Generally, this happens in exchange of photosynthetically fixed carbon, but occasionally the interaction is mycoheterotrophic, and plants obtain carbon from mycorrhizal fungi. This process results in an antagonistic interaction between mycoheterotrophic plants and their fungal hosts. Importantly, the fungal-host diversity available for plants is restricted as mycoheterotrophic interactions often involve narrow lineages of fungal hosts. Unfortunately, little is known whether fungal-host diversity may be additionally modulated by plant-plant interactions through shared hosts. Yet, this may have important implications for plant competition and coexistence. Here, we use DNA sequencing data to investigate the interaction patterns between mycoheterotrophic plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We find no phylogenetic signal on the number of fungal hosts nor on the fungal hosts shared among mycoheterotrophic plants. However, we observe a potential trend toward increased phylogenetic diversity of fungal hosts among mycoheterotrophic plants with increasing overlap in their fungal hosts. While these patterns remain for groups of plants regardless of location, we do find higher levels of overlap and diversity among plants from the same location. These findings suggest that species coexistence cannot be fully understood without attention to the two sides of ecological interactions.","[Gomes, Sofia I. F.; Merckx, Vincent S. F.

The average R (H) was significantly greater in soils under the mixed-legume and the mixed-native species than in the shrubland and the mixed-conifer soils, and it affected the pattern of soil total respiration (R (S)) of the four soils. The change in R (H) was closely related to the variations of soil organic C, total N and P content, and microbial biomass C. The R (A) and the percentage of R (S) respired as R (A) were only significantly increased by the mixed-native species after reforestation. Probably, this depended on the highest fine root biomass of mixed-native species than the other vegetation types.

Biofilters, also known as stormwater bioretention systems or raingardens, have shown promising, yet variable, results in reducing indicator bacteria in stormwater. Different biofilter design elements, such as filter media composition and vegetation type, have been found to cause this variable removal performance. Although plants play a key role in the treatment of pollutants, relatively little work has been conducted to understand the importance of interactions between vegetation and the biofilter microbial community on fecal microbial removal. A laboratory-scale biofilter experiment was conducted using Escherichia coli as the test fecal microorganism. Biofilter columns with differing soil media and vegetation types were dosed over a two month span, during which inflow and outflow samples were collected to evaluate system performance. The columns were then decommissioned to collect rhizosphere and bulk soil samples. Root exudates were extracted and used in an E. coli survival study to evaluate their contribution to system performance. The study demonstrated that the antagonistic effects of root exudates/rhizosphere microbes and Cu2+ exchanged zeolite antimicrobial filter media adversely impact the survival of E. coli retained within stormwater biofilters. Furthermore, leaf and flower/seed extracts of L. continentale showed some potential antibacterial activity against E. coli. This work supports the concept that natural processes in biological systems can deliver effective results in the removal of fecal microorganisms, and should be promoted to the extent possible in stormwater green infrastructure.

Diversity of fungi associated with hair roots of ericaceous plants may vary as a result of frequent disturbances by human activities.

Nine hundred fungal operational taxonomic units were determined by high-throughput sequencing, including different phyla such as Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Glomeromycota. The dominant phylum in Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations and old-growth forest was Ascomycota, while Basidiomycota was the dominant phylum in secondary forests. The indicator species analyses showed that more pathogenic indicator fungi appeared in the disturbed forests, whereas more putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungi existed in the old-growth forests. Principal component analysis also showed that the fungal communities in the hair roots of R. ovatum were distinct between natural forests and plantations, suggesting that the fungal communities associated with hair roots of R. ovatum after logging were resilient and could recover to predisturbance status.

We estimated the variation and temperature sensitivity (Q(10) value) of Rs and its hetero-, (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) components in relation to abiotic and biotic factors in Norway spruce stands of different ages, and the effect of trenching on microbial and soil characteristics. Methods Trenching method was used to partition Rs into Rh and Ra. Ingrowth core method was used to estimate fine root production. Soil microbial biomass was measured using manometric respirometers. Results Rs varied in differently aged stands demonstrating non-linear response to development stage. The variation of Rs was explained by changes in biotic factors rather than by changes in soil microclimate. Rh was more sensitive to Ts than Rs or Ra. After 4 years of trenching soil pH, N, SOM and dehydrogenase activity were significantly changed in trenched plots compared to control plots. Conclusions Different Q(10) values of Rh and Ra in stands of different ages indicate the importance of Rs partitioning. Trenching should be used during a limited number of years because of the possible changes in chemical characteristics of soil and in the activity of soil microbial community.","[Kukumagi, Mai; Ostonen, Ivika; Kanal, Arno; Kull, Olevi; Lohmus, Krista] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Uri, Veiko] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7,27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Kukumagi, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",mai.kukumagi@ut.ee,"Kukumagi, Mai/F-1121-2017; Ostonen, Ivika/G-9874-2015","Kukumagi, Mai/0000-0002-2313-148X; Uri, Veiko/0000-0002-1774-4079; Ostonen, Ivika/0000-0001-9043-6083; Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko/0000-0002-3056-7820","Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [5466]; Ministry of Education and Science of EstoniaMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT34-9, IUT21-04, IUT2-16, SF0182732s06, SF0180025s12]; European Regional Development fundEuropean Union (EU) [SLOOM12022T]; European Regional Development fund (Centre of Excellence ENVIRON)","This study was supported by the Estonian Science Foundation (grant No. 5466), by the Ministry of Education and Science of Estonia (institutional research funding Nos.

(RP), Caragana korshinskii Kom. (CK), and abandoned land (AL), of which the former two were afforested areas, whereas the latter was not. These areas were converted from similar farmlands 40 years prior. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS gene was used to analyze soil bacterial and fungal diversity. Additionally, plant communities, soil properties, fine root biomass, and C, N, and P levels in fine root and microbial biomass were estimated. Compared to AL, the C:N:P stoichiometry in fine root and microbial biomass in the afforested lands was synchronously changed, especially the N:P ratio. Soil microbial diversities were affected by afforestation and were more related to N:P ratio than C:P and C:N ratios. Moreover, Alpha-proteobacteria, Gamma-proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were significantly more abundant in afforested soils than in the AL soil, and the abundances of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and Nitrospirae ranked as AL > RP or CK. For fungal taxa, Ascomycota abundance responded positively to afforestation, whereas Basidiomycota abundance responded negatively. Changes of soil microbial taxa were significantly correlated with the N:P ratio in fine root and microbial biomass, which explained 54.1 and 55% of the total variation in bacterial and fungal taxa, respectively. Thus, our results provide evidence that compositions of soil microbial communities are linked to the N:P ratio in the plant-soil system.","[Ren, Chengjie; Deng, Jian; Han, Xinhui; Yang, Gaihe; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ren, Chengjie; Deng, Jian; Han, Xinhui; Yang, Gaihe; Feng, Yongzhong; Ren, Guangxin] Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ji] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Key Lab Space Biosci & Biotechnol, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fazhu] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tong, Xiaogang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Shelton, Shelby] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Publ Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Han, XH; Yang, GH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Han, XH; Yang, GH (reprint author), Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Rencj1991@nwsuaf.edu.cn; chenji@ieecas.cn; dengjian@nwsuaf.edu.cn; zhaofazhu@126.com; hanxinhui@nwsuaf.edu.cn; ygh@nwsuaf.edu.cn; xiaogangtong@126.com; fengyz@nwsuaf.edu.cn; shelbyshelton@gwmail.gwu.edu; rengx@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018","Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41301601, 41571501]","The authors especially thank Pinsheng Sun, Yadong Xu, and Tao Wang (Northwest A&F University) for their help with the fieldwork.

Little is known about how the root-exudation rate varies among co-existing woody species. We conducted an in situ experiment in a warm temperate forest on two dominant species, Quercus serrata and Ilex pedunculosa, and two of their congeneric species, Quercus glauca and Ilex macropoda, respectively. We hypothesized that the root-exudation rate varies among these species because of their distinct functional traits and N demands. Root-exudation rates were measured using a non-soil culture method during the growing season from June 2013 to May 2014. We also measured foliar N concentrations and the activities of N-degrading enzymes in the rhizosphere soils. The annual demand for N was calculated from the growth rate and allometric equations for biomass. The root-exudation rates of Q. serrata and I. macropoda were consistently greater than those of their congeneric evergreen species on root-length, root-weight, and individual-tree bases. The variations of the annual N demand of these species mirrored this pattern. Within a species, root-exudation rates correlated positively to leaf N contents, suggesting a physiological linkage between photosynthetic capacities and belowground carbon allocation. Root-exudation rates also correlated positively to the activities of polyphenol oxidase, an enzyme that decomposes N from recalcitrant SOM. Our results suggest that the variations of the root-exudation among co-existing species relate to their functional traits and demand for N.","[Sun, Lijuan; Yoshimura, Kenichi; Kitayama, Kanehiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kominami, Yuji; Yoshimura, Kenichi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Sun, LJ (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",sunlijuan86@gmail.com,,"Sun, Lijuan/0000-0003-4915-525X","Science Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology of Japan [22255002]","We thank Dr. Masako Dannoura, Dr. Keiichi Okada, Dr. Mioko Ataka, Chihiro Ikeda, and Daiki Yokoyama for their invaluable assistance, and Dr. Rebecca Spake, Dr. Ryota Aoyagi, and Dr. Taiki Mori for improving the manuscript.

Climate change projections indicate an increase of water deficit stress upon Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) forests. Thus, soil water holding capacity and its availability for trees are important traits to consider when modeling forest responses to climate change and the effective soil volume for trees is closely related to their maximum rooting depth. In this work we evaluate the evolution over the 21th century of P. halepensis spanish plots under climate change conditions and at two maximum rooting depths. We conclude that, under moderate climate change conditions, the fertilizing effect of an increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration would result on higher productivity, increased carbon sink capacity and higher resilience of P. halepensis forests. Conversely, under severe climate change scenario conditions, the CO2 fertilizing effect would be counterbalanced by the negative effects of increasing aridity. We show that the positive effect of an increased soil depth decreases under major climatic constraints (high temperature and low precipitation). However, we also obtained that it decreases under favorable conditions (mild temperatures 15 degrees C > T > 19 degrees C, and precipitation > 520 mm.year(-1)). We explain that fact because, as precipitation becomes less restrictive, photosynthesis is more linked to seasonal precipitation patterns than soil water storage capacity.","[Nadal-Sala, D.; Sabate, S.; Gracia, C.] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Evolutiva Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Sabate, S.; Gracia, C.] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain","Nadal-Sala, D (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Evolutiva Ecol & Ciencias Ambientales, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",d_nadal@ub.edu,"Sabate, Santiago (Santi)/I-3395-2016","Sabate, Santiago (Santi)/0000-0003-1854-0761",,,,45,3,3,2,7,ASOCIACION ESPANOLA ECOLOGIA TERRESTRE,MOSTOLES,"C/ TULIPSAN S-N, DEPT BIOLOGIA & GEOLOGIA, UNIV REY JUAN CARLOS, MOSTOLES, 28933, SPAIN",1697-2473,,,ECOSISTEMAS,Ecosistemas,MAY-AUG,2017,26,2,,,,,18,26,,10.7818/ECOS.2017.26-2.03,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP8AN,WOS:000441132000003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Moradi, M; Naji, HR; Imani, F; Behbahani, SM; Ahmadi, MT",,,,"Moradi, Mostafa; Naji, Hamid Reza; Imani, Fatemeh; Behbahani, Sareh Moradi; Ahmadi, Mohammad Taghi",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi changes by afforestation in sand dunes,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sand dunes; Afforestation; Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Soil; Glomeraceae,SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; SOIL-MOISTURE; DIVERSITY; LAND; ABUNDANCE; GRADIENT; DENSITY; PLANTS; ROOTS; COAST,"This study was conducted to assess the effects of afforestation and canopy coverage on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity and determination of the effects of soil factors on AMF community changes in sand dunes. To this end, two afforested dunes with canopy coverage of 25-50% and 75-100% and control dune (no afforestation practice) were selected in the southwest region of Iran. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the studied AMF diversity indices in the studied dunes. Sixteen AMF species belonging to four families and six genera were identified in the studied dunes. The most frequent AMF genera were Funneliformis and Glomus with five and four species, respectively. Funnelisformis verruculosom appeared only in the stand with 75-100% canopy coverage while Glomus pansihalos was not observed in this class of canopy. Furthermore, Archaeosporatrappei only appeared in afforestation without control dunes. The AMF diversity changes in the studied dunes were due to the significant effects of afforestation on the soil physiochemical properties and moisture content. These effects resulted in improvement in soil conditions for AMF spore production. Furthermore, soil electrical conductivity, phosphorus, bulk density and moisture content were the soil factors with the most effect on AMF community in sand dunes. Summarily, it was concluded that sand dunes afforestation produced a better soil condition and consequently higher AMF richness and spore production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Differential dispersal of plant and microbial propagules may result in the geographical disassociation of plant populations from their local abiotic conditions and microbial communities, especially in the face of species introductions and changing climates. 2. To assess the potential consequences of disrupting historical relationships between plant populations, microbial communities and soil conditions, we grew Carpinus caroliniana seedlings from populations across the species range in combinations of sterilized soils and soil microbial communities, in soils collected from sites with or without conspecific trees. This controlled environment study simulated the consequences for seedling growth of independently or jointly disrupting the historical plant population-soil match, plant population-microbial community match and microbial community-soil match. 3. Seedlings grown in soils from areas without conspecifics had lower biomass, but benefited from inoculation with their historical microbial communities. For conspecific-cultured soils, growth was optimized when seedlings grew with novel microbial communities, but only when microbial communities were local with respect to abiotic soil conditions. Correlative evidence suggests that this may stem from alignment of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities to abiotic soil conditions. 4. Synthesis. Maintaining historical plant-microbial community relationships may benefit plant species spreading into new areas; however, for movement within current ranges, maintaining the historical relationship between microbial communities and the abiotic aspects of soils may have more important consequences for early growth.","[Keymer, Daniel P.; Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30606 USA; [Keymer, Daniel P.] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lankau@wisc.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity awardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1045977],"We thank Rachel Nodurft, Ryan Baskin and Charlene Chalmers for assistance with greenhouse experiments and field collections.

Biochars (BCs) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to bind metals, and metallophyte can remove metals from soils. Will BC in combination with AMF contain the Cu uptake by a metallophyte growing in a metal-contaminated soil? The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BCs on the Cu immobilization and over soil microbial communities in a metal-contaminated soil in the presence of AMF and metallophyte. Two BCs were produced from chicken manure (CMB) and oat hull (OHB). A Cu-contaminated sandy soil (338 mg kg(-1)) was incubated with CMB and OHB (0, 1, and 5 % w/w) for 2 weeks. Metallophyte Oenothera picensis was grown in pots (500 mL) containing the incubated soils in a controlled greenhouse for 6 months. A number of analyses were conducted after the harvest. These include plant biomass weight, microbial basal respiration, and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), AMF root colonization, spore number, and glomalin production; changes in fungal and bacterial communities, Cu fractions in soil phases, and Cu uptake in plant tissues. The BCs increased the soil pH, decreased easily exchangeable fraction of Cu, and increased organic matter and residual fraction of Cu. The BCs provided favorable habitat for microorganisms, thereby increasing basal respiration. The CMB increased DHA by similar to 62 and similar to 574 %, respectively, for the low and high doses. Similarly, the OHB increased soil microbial activity by similar to 68 and similar to 72 %, respectively, for the low and high doses. AMF root colonization, spore number, and total glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) production increased by similar to 3, similar to 2, and similar to 3 times, respectively, in soils treated with 1 % OHB. Despite being a metalophyte, O. picensis could not uptake Cu efficiently. Root and shoot Cu concentrations decreased or changed insignificantly in most BC treatments. The results show that the BCs decreased bioavailable Cu, decreased Cu uptake by O. picensis, improved habitat for microorganisms, and enhanced plant growth in Cu-contaminated soil. This suggests that biochars may be utilized to remediate Cu-contaminated soils.","[Meier, Sebastian; Curaqueo, Gustavo; Rilling, Joaquin; Vidal, Catalina; Acuna, Jacquelinne; Cornejo, Pablo; Borie, Fernando] Univ La Frontera, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, BIOREN UFRO, Box 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Khan, Naser; Bolan, Nanthi] Univ South Australia, Ctr Environm Risk Assessment & Remediat CERAR, Bldg 10,Univ Blvd, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia; [Khan, Naser; Bolan, Nanthi] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Bldg P,Mat Lane, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia; [Fernandez, Natalia] Univ Nacl Comahue INIBIOMA CONICET, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Microbiol Aplicada & Biotecnol, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Gonzalez, Maria-Eugenia] Univ Catolica Temuco, Nucleo Invest Energias Renovables, Direcc Invest, Temuco, Chile","Meier, S (reprint author), Univ La Frontera, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, BIOREN UFRO, Box 54-D, Temuco, Chile.",sebastian.meier@ufrontera.cl,"Cornejo, Pablo E./B-1039-2015; Cornejo, Pablo/N-9694-2019; Curaqueo, Gustavo/J-3358-2013; Bolan, Nanthi Sirangie/E-8535-2011","Cornejo, Pablo/0000-0003-2124-3100; Curaqueo, Gustavo/0000-0001-9946-737X; Bolan, Nanthi Sirangie/0000-0003-2056-1692; Khan, Naser/0000-0002-7745-2545",FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3130390],"This research was supported by the postdoctoral Fondecyt project number 3130390, Universidad de La Frontera.",,47,20,21,8,308,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

In this study, we examined AMF communities from 166 root samples of 17 woody plant species from 10 quadrats in a Chinese subtropical forest using 454 pyrosequencing of 18S rRNA gene to describe symbiotic AMF-plant association. Our results show the woody plant-AMF networks to be highly interconnected and nested, but in antimodular and antispecialized manners. The nonrandom pattern in the woody plant-AMF network was explained by plant and AMF phylogenies, with a tendency for a stronger phylogenetic signal by plant than AMF phylogeny.

Here, the effects of nitrogen deposition were tested on a native symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. Methods Deposition rates, soil nitrogen concentration, and plant nitrogen isotopic composition were quantified along a predicted deposition gradient in California. Acmispon strigosus seedlings were exposed to fertilization spanning nitrogen concentrations observed in the plant's California range. Both wild and experimental plants from pristine and nitrogen polluted sites were tested using rhizobial strains that varied in nitrogen fixation. Results Deposition intensity was tightly correlated with nitrogen concentration in soils. The growth benefits of rhizobial nodulation were dramatically reduced by even modest levels of mineral nitrogen, and all Acmispon lines failed to form root nodules at high nitrogen concentrations. Conclusions Our dataset suggests that anthropogenic deposition has greatly increased soil nitrogen concentrations in Southern California leading to significantly reduced benefits of rhizobial symbiosis.

Although PE are recognized to be large enough to be taken into account into the ecosystem carbon balance, the exact mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we examined the effect of two characteristics of added compounds on PE, namely metabolic usable energy for microbes and resemblance to recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter (SOM). For this purpose, glucose, cellobiose (energy rich compounds, low resemblance with recalcitrant SOM) and vanillic acid (energy-poor compound, higher resemblance with recalcitrant SOM) were selected. In addition the effect of mineral nitrogen (N) on PE was tested. C-13 labelled compounds were mixed with sandy soil from an ex-arable site. To separate the effect of energy content from that of resemblance to SOM, the amount of carbon and the amount of energy content of added compounds was kept constant in treatments, respectively. The community structure of microbes that were able to use added compounds was evaluated using stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) combined with qPCR and Illumina sequencing. When corrected for energy content, vanilic acid induced the highest CO2 respiration and PE. DNA-SIP revealed that bacterial classes like beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, that are known to harbour many opportunistic bacteria, responded quickly (5 h) with incorporation of C-13 from added substrates, whereas classes like Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria responded over a longer incubation time. In treatments where the energy-level of added compounds was kept constant, vanillic acid caused an increase in DNA copy numbers of bacteria and fungi using native SOM after prolonged incubation. The contribution of fungi to PE was minor, reflecting the low F:B ratio of the soil used for the experiment. Different substrates resulted in different PE but appeared to stimulate the growth of similar bacterial groups. This suggests that the added compounds stimulate different enzyme systems within similar bacterial taxa. Although combined addition of mineral nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) and organic compounds caused a slightly extra increase in PE in Most treatments, this might be an artefact as addition of mineral N only decreased respiration. Overall our results indicate that the effect of chemical structure of added compounds on PE is much larger than the effect of energy-content. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent findings of high molecular diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils under ERC stands led us to consider that the invasiveness of ERC into grasslands may arise in part from its ability to form associations with extant grassland AMF communities. The diversity of AMF in roots of ERC was determined for five age groups ranging from 1 to 65 yr old and varying in stand density from individual seedlings in grassland (< 5 yr) to closed ERC canopies devoid of grass species (65 yr). Roots were analyzed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, cloning, and insert screening by DGGE, and sequencing of ribosomal DNA small-subunit regions. Phylogenetically analyzed AMF sequences were used to define phylotypes. The majority of the sequences obtained were classified into Glomus Group A, with only a few belonging to Gigasporaceae and Acaulosporaceae, the latter two largely restricted to roots from ERC < 5 yr old. The richness of phylotypes tended to decrease with time, ranging from 11 in the youngest age group (1-5 yr) to 4 in the oldest age group (46-65 yr). Abundance of phylotypes varied greatly among the age groups. Overall, AMF diversity within ERC roots tended to decrease with plant age suggesting narrower plant and edaphic selection pressures with increasing ERC stand density.","[Liang, Zhanbei B.; Lee, Donald J.; Dweikat, Ismail M.; Drijber, Rhae A.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Keim Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Wedin, David A.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Hardin Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Yuen, Gary Y.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Plant Pathol, Plant Sci Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA","Drijber, RA (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Keim Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",rdrijber1@unl.edu,"Wedin, David A/K-4093-2012",,federal Hatch program,"We thank E.

At the end of the 90-day incubation period, organic and bio-fertilizer amendments had an increasing impact on aggregate stability and OC content in macro-and micro-aggregate scale. Especially, bio-fertilizers in combination with vermicompost mostly had stronger effects on stability and OC content of aggregates of both size classes in comparison with control and bio-fertilizer treatments alone. In addition, significant (p < 0.05) and positive correlations were observed between stability and OC contents of macro (2-1 mm) and micro (0.25-0.050 mm) aggregates size classes in each treatment.

Less is known about the effects of single, punctuated events in combination with other longer-duration anthropogenic influences on the dynamics of soil carbon (C) loss. In 2012 and 2013, we assessed the effects of decadal-scale anthropogenic global change -warming, increased nitrogen (N) deposition, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), and increased precipitation - on soil respiration rates in an annual-dominated Mediterranean grassland. We also investigated how controlled fire and an artificial wet-up event, in combination with exposure to the longer-duration anthropogenic global change factors, influenced the dynamics of C cycling in this system. Decade-duration surface soil warming (1-2 degrees C) had no effect on soil respiration rates, while + N addition and elevated CO2 concentrations increased growing-season soil CO2 efflux rates by increasing annual aboveground net primary production (NPP) and belowground fine root production, respectively. Low-intensity experimental fire significantly elevated soil CO2 efflux rates in the next growing season. Based on mixed-effects modeling and structural equation modeling, low-intensity fire increased growing-season soil respiration rates through a combination of three mechanisms: large increases in soil temperature (3-5 degrees C), significant increases in fine root production, and elevated aboveground NPP. Our study shows that in ecosystems where soil respiration has acclimated to moderate warming, further increases in soil temperature can stimulate greater soil CO2 efflux. We also demonstrate that punctuated short-duration events such as fire can influence soil C dynamics with implications for both the parameterization of earth system models (ESMs) and the implementation of climate change mitigation policies that involve land-sector C accounting.","[Strong, Aaron L.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Libby Hall Room 227A, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Strong, Aaron L.] Univ Maine, Program Ecol & Environm Sci, Libby Hall Room 227A, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Johnson, Tera P.] Skidmore Coll, Environm Studies Program, 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Chiariello, Nona R.] Stanford Univ, Main Off, Jasper Ridge Biol Preserve, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Field, Christopher B.] Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Yang & Yamazaki Energy & Environm Bldg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Strong, AL (reprint author), Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Libby Hall Room 227A, Orono, ME 04469 USA.; Strong, AL (reprint author), Univ Maine, Program Ecol & Environm Sci, Libby Hall Room 227A, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",aaron.strong@maine.edu,,,Carnegie Institution for Science and Stanford University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Morgan Family Foundation; Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve; Stanford Graduate FellowshipStanford University; Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; Stanford Undergraduate Research in Geosciences and Engineering Program (SURGE),"We thank Todd Tobeck, Shane Easter, Yuka Estrada, Eren Bilir, and Michael Dini for their efforts maintaining, supporting, and making continuing measurements at the Global Change Experiment.

In that context, the identification of critical environmental factors and a better understanding of their impact on forests are decisive. The water balance is recognized as one of the most important soil factors for stand productivity in temperate forests. Hence, the consequences of short or long term climate change might vary considerably spatially in function of soil type within a given forest. Our study objective was to assess the impact of contrasting soil types on the water balance and stand growth of a beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest ecosystem of similar age and management during four climatically contrasting years. The experimental forest site of Montiers presents different soils with contrasting physicochemical properties (Dystric Cambisol, Eutric Cambisol and Rendzic Leptosol) monitored to quantify water fluxes and stand biomass increment. Using data collected over the period 2012-2015, including a particularly dry year (-24% precipitations in 2015), we also quantified the impact of water shortage on stand productivity at the annual scale as a function of soil type. We evidenced important differences in soil water holding capacities (SWHC) along the studied soil sequence, ranging between 57 mm for the Rendzic Leptosol downhill over limestone and 205 mm for the Dystric Cambisol uphill over detrital sediments. The results show that the canopy intercepted the same amount of incident rainfall in the three plots and that there were no significant differences in annual soil moisture dynamics among the studied soils. We evidenced different rooting patterns depending on soil type. Under a same climate and with stand, site exposition and solar radiation equivalency, trees transpiration was the evident primary driver of the stand potential to produce aboveground biomass. Soil water holding capacity, annual trees transpiration and aboveground biomass production increased in that order: Rendzic Leptosol < Eutric Cambisol < Dystric Cambisol. During the drier year 2015, the decrease in aboveground biomass productivity was of similar amplitude on the three soil types. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a case study of Coal Seam Gas (CSG) development in the State of New South Wales, this paper focusses upon the discursive constraints that can marginalise Indigenous agency in the complex milieu presented by CSG development. It argues that discursive framings can, and do, contribute to an ideological setting that may constrain attempts by Aboriginal people who seek to participate in the opportunities presented by extractive industries, particularly those extractive industries that are deemed environmentally risky or damaging. Employing the Strategic Relational Approach (SRA), it contends that discursive framings are not merely ideological tools that socially construct reality, but via the dialectic relationship between discursivity and materiality, they can have substantial material consequences for Aboriginal people.

Rising atmospheric CO2 has the potential to fundamentally alter plant responses to waterlogging by altering gas exchange rates and stoichiometry, modifying growth, and shifting resource-economic trade-offs to favor different ecological strategies. While plant responses to waterlogging and elevated CO2 individually are relatively well characterized, few studies have asked how the effects of waterlogging might be mediated by atmospheric CO2 concentration. We investigated interactive effects of elevated (550 ppm) atmospheric CO2 and waterlogging on gas exchange, biomass accumulation and allocation, and functional traits for juveniles of three woody riparian tree species. In particular, we were interested in whether elevated CO2 mitigated growth reduction under waterlogging, and whether this response was sustained following a refractory "" recovery"" period during which soils were re-aerated. We found species-specific effects of atmospheric CO2 concentration and waterlogging status on growth, gas exchange, and functional traits between species, and no evidence for a general effect of elevated CO2 in mediating plant responses to flooding. For one specie, Casuarina cunninghamiana, elevated CO2 substantially increased growth, but this effect was entirely removed by waterlogging, and there was no recovery following a refractory period. Differential responses to combined waterlogging and elevated CO2 among species may result in compositional changes to riparian plant communities and associated changes in ecosystem functioning.","[Lawson, James R.; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Fryirs, Kirstie A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Lawson, JR (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",james.lawson@mq.edu.au,"Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012","Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Fryirs, Kirstie/0000-0003-0541-3384; Lawson, James/0000-0001-7983-4443",Macquarie University,Macquarie University,,57,3,3,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,APR,2017,10,3,,,,,,,UNSP e1803,10.1002/eco.1803,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,EX2PF,WOS:000403067900007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chakraborty, T; Saha, S; Matzarakis, A; Reif, A",,,,"Chakraborty, Tamalika; Saha, Somidh; Matzarakis, Andreas; Reif, Albert",,,Influence of multiple biotic and abiotic factors on the crown die-back of European beech trees at their drought limit,FLORA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crown die-back threshold; Drought limit of beech; Facilitation; Neighbourhood interaction; Soil water storage capacity; Tree species diversity,FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; OAK QUERCUS-ROBUR; FINE-ROOT BIOMASS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST; GROWTH; STRESS; SOIL; CARBON; PRECIPITATION,"Owing to the growing sensitivity of forests to drought under the warming climate, more attention should be paid to the role of soil drought, plant-plant interactions, tree species and structural diversity, and other abiotic factors on the crown die-back of trees. We studied how permanent soil water stress had impacted on crown die-back of beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at their drought limit in near-natural temperate forests of Germany and Switzerland. Crown die-back was quantified by the proportion of dead above-ground biomass to total biomass for the individual beech tree. We quantified the available soil water storage capacity as a measure of soil drought stress in combination with other biotic (e.g., plant-plant interactions, tree species diversity, stand structural diversity, plant height and proportion of oak trees) and abiotic (e.g., light availability, soil pH, soil bulk density, potential evapotranspiration) factors to determine the influence of those stressors on crown die-back. We found increases in soil water storage capacity, neighbourhood interactions, plant height and light decreased crown die-back of the beech trees. These stressors differently influenced the die-back among different parts of tree crown. Soil water storage capacity, light availability, intra- and interspecific interactions, plant height and tree species diversity had the strongest influence on die-back in the upper part of the crown. Permanent death of beech trees occurred when the amount of dead above-ground biomass exceeded a 58% mortality threshold. We conclude that vitality of beech trees in drought stressed forests is related to soil water storage capacity, light availability, neighbourhood interactions and tree species diversity.

Here we investigate the potential impact of a shift in aspen abundance on soil carbon sequestration and soil carbon stability at the continental scale by conducting a systematic literature review using 23 published studies. Our review shows that aspen's effect on soil carbon is relatively consistent throughout the species range. Aspen stores less C in the forest floor but similar amounts in the mineral soil relative to conifers. However, a robust set of indicators of soil C stability, for example, degree of organo-mineral associations, proportion of readily-available or labile C estimated during long-term soil incubations or using hot-water extraction, pattern of soil C distribution, and temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic respiration, reveals that the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock under aspen is more stable, rendering it more protected against environmental changes and soil disturbances. Therefore, our continental-scale analysis highlights that an increase in the abundance of trembling aspen in North American forests may increase the resistance and resilience of soil C stocks against global changes.","[Laganiere, Jerome; Pare, David] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380,Stn St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Boca, Antra; Van Miegroet, Helga] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Boca, Antra; Van Miegroet, Helga] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Laganiere, J (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380,Stn St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",jerome.laganiere@canada.ca; antraboca@gmail.com; helga.vanmiegroet@usu.edu; david.pare@canada.ca,,"LAGANIERE, JEROME/0000-0003-2649-9113",,,,110,9,9,1,13,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2017,8,4,,,,,,,113,10.3390/f8040113,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,EY6ND,WOS:000404099200019,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"de la Riva, EG; Lloret, F; Perez-Ramos, IM; Maranon, T; Saura-Mas, S; Diaz-Delgado, R; Villar, R",,,,"de la Riva, Enrique G.; Lloret, Francisco; Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M.; Maranon, Teodoro; Saura-Mas, Sandra; Diaz-Delgado, Ricardo; Villar, Rafael",,,The importance of functional diversity in the stability of Mediterranean shrubland communities after the impact of extreme climatic events,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; Donana; drought; functional trait; recruitment; resilience; resistance,ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; SEEDLING GROWTH; LEAF-AREA; DIE-OFF; DROUGHT; TRAITS; GRASSLAND; RESILIENCE; VEGETATION,"Aims Extreme climatic events may have important consequences for plant community structure and composition. In 2005, a severe drought together with a cold winter promoted extensive damage and mortality in shrubland communities of southwest Spain (Donana National Park). Here, we aim to identify the mechanisms underlying community stability (resistance and resilience) in response to this extreme climatic event, considering changes in the functional structure of these communities. Methods We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in 10 functional traits at the community level (community weighted means, CWM) and the functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and divergence) in 18 plots at three different times: predating the climatic event (estimated from the sum of the live and dead volume of each species in 2007), and 2 and 8 years after the 2005 episode. We also quantified the differences in functional traits and functional diversity between adult and recruit stages, which allowed us to better understand the contribution of the recruitment to the maintenance of the functional structure and diversity of the community. Important Findings Communities with higher functional divergence before the climatic event maintained nearly constant their levels of functional divergence 8 years after, but they were more prone to changes in species composition. Community resistance in terms of vegetation cover was positively correlated with root dry matter content, whereas community resilience was positively correlated with leaf chlorophyll (LChl). We also found that some values (weighted means) of functional community traits (such as root dry matter content and LChl) had increased 2 years after the event, returning to the pre-event conditions after 8 years. In addition, there was hardly any establishment of new species in the community and the recruits did not make substantial differences to the community functional structure. Only seed mass differed significantly between the adult and seedling stages. In summary, the extreme climatic event induced rapid vegetation changes, modifying several functional properties of the community, but, in spite of the occurrence of changes in species composition, a rapid convergence of these shrubland communities took place due to the replacement of species with functional redundancy, thus recovering the initial conditions and supporting the existence of strong mechanisms of functional resilience.","[de la Riva, Enrique G.; Villar, Rafael] Univ Cordoba, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Lloret, Francisco; Saura-Mas, Sandra] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Lloret, Francisco; Saura-Mas, Sandra] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Unitat Ecol, Edifici C,Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M.; Maranon, Teodoro] CSIC, IRNAS, Av Reina Mercedes 10,POB 1052, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Diaz-Delgado, Ricardo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain","de la Riva, EG (reprint author), Univ Cordoba, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",enga70@gmail.com,"Saura-Mas, Sandra/M-7968-2015; de la Riva, Enrique Garcia/R-5805-2016; Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M/H-6048-2015; Diaz-Delgado, Ricardo/A-5757-2012; Maranon, Teodoro/K-6648-2014","Saura-Mas, Sandra/0000-0001-8539-427X; de la Riva, Enrique Garcia/0000-0002-3393-8375; Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M/0000-0003-2332-7818; Diaz-Delgado, Ricardo/0000-0002-0460-4616; Maranon, Teodoro/0000-0002-7751-9316","European FEDER fundsEuropean Union (EU); Spanish MEC project DIVERBOS [CGL2011-30285-C02-01, C02-02]; Spanish MEC project SECADIN [CGL2012-32965]; Spanish MEC project ECO-MEDIT [CGL2014-53236-R]; ICTS-Reserva Biologica de Donana [38/2007, 27/2009, 11/2013];  [Catalonian 2014-SGR-453]","This study was funded by the Spanish MEC projects DIVERBOS (CGL2011-30285-C02-01 and C02-02), SECADIN (CGL2012-32965) and ECO-MEDIT (CGL2014-53236-R), the Catalonian 2014-SGR-453 grant, the ICTS-Reserva Biologica de Donana projects 38/2007, 27/2009 and 11/2013 and European FEDER funds.

Here, we report for the first time soil CO2 effluxes and their partitioning for medium-age and old-growth Fitzroya cupressoides forests growing under contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range and Andean Cordillera of southern Chile. Fitzroya is a high biomass and one of the longest lived species in the world. We characterized soil respiration patterns over almost 2 yr. Annual soil respiration was slightly higher in younger forests from the Coastal Range compared with Andean forests during the first studied year (6.37-6.66 vs. 5.06-6.14 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)), and significantly higher during the second year mainly due to a warmer and drier summer (8.08-8.64 vs. 4.98-5.35 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Therefore, warmer and drier conditions, likely to become more common in this region under future climate change, were associated with significantly higher respiration in the shallow soils of the coast, but not in the Andes. A higher proportion of autotrophic respiration was found in the Coastal Range forest probably due to a much higher fine root biomass in this site. However, fine root productivity, an important contributor of belowground carbon fluxes, was a little lower (not significantly) in the coastal site (0.81 +/- 0.60 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.42 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)), indicating a longer root residence time in forests from this area. Soil CO2 effluxes from these forests and their root productivity are at the lower end of values recorded for other mature and old-growth temperate wet forests worldwide. The intrinsic longevity and the particularly poor soils and rainy conditions where these forests grow may influence these facts. Interannual climate variability appears to be especially important for soil respiration in the Coastal Range due to the more Mediterranean climate influence and shallow, poor water retention soils in this area.","[Urrutia-Jalabert, Rocio; Lara, Antonio] Univ Austral Chile, Lab Dendrocronol & Cambio Global, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Recursos Nat, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Independencia 641, Valdivia, Chile; [Urrutia-Jalabert, Rocio; Lara, Antonio] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Blanco Encalada 2002, Santiago, Chile; [Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Lara, Antonio] Fdn Ctr Bosques Nativos FORECOS, Los Robles 510 Interior, Valdivia, Chile","Urrutia-Jalabert, R (reprint author), Univ Austral Chile, Lab Dendrocronol & Cambio Global, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Recursos Nat, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Independencia 641, Valdivia, Chile.; Urrutia-Jalabert, R (reprint author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Blanco Encalada 2002, Santiago, Chile.",rociourrutia@uach.cl,,,"FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160258, 1130410]; Center of Climate and Resilience Research (CR) 2 [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110009]; CRNII project of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GEO-0452325]; Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation [11371-1]; Monica Cole Research Grant; Jackson Foundation; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [321131]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)European Union (EU)","This work has been supported by different sources: Fondecyt Postdoctoral Grant 3160258 awarded to Rocio Urrutia-Jalabert; Fondecyt Project Grant 1130410 awarded to Antonio Lara; Center of Climate and Resilience Research (CR) 2 funded by CONICYT/FONDAP/15110009; the CRNII 2047 project of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, supported by NSF (Grant GEO-0452325); the Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (Project 11371-1) and Monica Cole Research Grant, both granted to Rocio Urrutia-Jalabert.

Hook. We found that, on average, cell wall content accounted for 81.07% of the root biomass (dry mass), and the mean solubilization of aluminum-bound phosphate by cell wall preparations was 1.89 g.kg(-1). Tissue type (i.e., phloem or xylem) had a significant effect on cell wall content, with more cell wall material in the xylem, whereas P-solubilizing activity was greater in the phloem. In addition, the cell wall content of xylem increased with increasing root diameter, but P-solubilizing activity did not. A significant difference was also observed among the P-solubilizing activity of the three age classes, with lower P-solubilizing activity in the roots of 10 year old trees than in those of 22 and 34 year old trees.

This study was based on mensuration data of individual-tree biomass from large samples of Chinese pine. The purpose was to construct compatible and additive biomass models using the nonlinear error-in-variable simultaneous equations and dummy variable modeling approach. This approach could ensure compatibility of an aboveground biomass model with a biomass conversion factor (BCF) and a stem volume model and compatibility of a belowground biomass model with a root-to-shoot ratio (RSR) model. Also, stem, branch, and foliage biomass models were additive to the aboveground biomass model. Results showed that mean prediction errors (MPEs) of the developed one-and two-variable aboveground biomass models were less than 4% and MPEs of the three-component (stem, branch, and foliage) and belowground biomass models were less than 10%. Furthermore, the effects of main climate variables on above-and below-ground biomass were analyzed. Aboveground biomass was related to mean annual temperature (MAT), while belowground biomass had no significant relationship with either MAT or mean annual precipitation (MAP). The developed models provide a good basis for estimating biomass of Chinese pine forests.","[Zeng, WeiSheng; Chen, XinYun; Cheng, ZhiChu] State Forestry Adm, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China; [Zhang, LianJin] Chinese Acad Forestry, Forestry Expt Ctr North China, Beijing 102300, Peoples R China; [Ma, KeXi; Li, ZhiHua] State Forestry Adm, North Western Forest Inventory & Planning Inst, Xian 710048, Peoples R China","Zeng, WS (reprint author), State Forestry Adm, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China.",zengweisheng0928@126.com,,,"State Forestry Administration of China; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270697, 31370634]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of CAF [CAFYBB2014QA035]","The authors acknowledge the National Biomass Modeling Program in Continuous Forest Inventory (NBMP-CFI), which was funded by the State Forestry Administration of China, for providing measured biomass data for Chinese pine.

The population of wild E. hentyi has declined rapidly due to habitat destruction, overexploitation, and poor natural regeneration. The E. henryi root sprouts are stimulated by external disturbances, such as injuries; moreover, this phenomenon might be an important means of regeneration and may mitigate its extinction. The E. henryi tree roots were treated in situ and subjected to four injury levels (control, scraping, peeling, and cutting), two exposure levels (exposed and buried), and three seasons (spring, summer, and fall). To study the effects of injury, tree ages, root diameters, and soil depth on the hormone contents in the root of E. henryi, we observed the growth dynamics and quantitative variance of the root sprouts. Our results showed that the callus areas of the injured roots vary significantly between different treatments, and the order of the ratios of callus areas was scraping > peeling > cutting; for different seasons, the order of the ratios of callus area was spring > summer > fall. Exposure stimulated root sprout formation, which decreased as soil depth increased. As the root diameter increased, the number of root sprouts formed in the physically damaged roots linearly increased with injuries but declined in the undamaged roots. As the E. henryi tree grew, the ability of sprouting of the root increased. Cutting significantly stimulated more sprouts than other injury treatments. However, most sprouts grew together with a high density on the callus, which resulted in high mortality. Initially, scraping and peeling stimulated fewer sprouts than cutting, but the stimulation time of the former two levels was longer and eventually resulted in more sprouts. Moreover, differences in root sprout ability among E. henryi trees are attributed to different hormones in the root. A high ratio of cytokinin (CK) to auxin (IAA) ratio means a strong stump stool sprout of E. henryi. Studies showed that artificial damage treatment to enhance the root sprouting ability is based on the increase in CK/IAA ratio in the E. henryi root in its original habitat. Based on the effects of different damage treatments on the amount and growth of rootsucker of E. hentyi, treatment measures for scraping or peeling should be performed to stimulate the sprouting of E. henryi root to provide adequate sprouting seedlings and regenerate the population.

Results showed the presence of heterogeneity in decomposition rates within fine-root architecture, and this pattern was influenced by classification methods (root order or diameter class). Specifically, the heterogeneity in decomposition rates was shown only when fine roots were classified by root order, but not when fine roots were classified by diameter class. The slower decomposition rates of lower-order roots (the first two orders) were related to their higher acid-unhydrolyzable residues. Furthermore, lower-order roots were found to account for 57-71% of annual root litter inputs of the first five orders. Given the slow decomposition rates and high annual litter inputs of lower-order roots of tree species, our findings suggest that lower-order roots should be important contributors to forest soil organic C.

Total genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia of aforementioned Phytophthora isolates. Species-specific primers for P.cactorum, P.megasperma, P.plurivora, P.pseudosyringae and P.quercina were designed based on ITS sequences of rDNA. The amplification efficiency of target DNA varied from 93.1% (P.pseudosyringae) to 106.8% (P.quercina). The limit of the detection was calculated as 100 - 1,000fg DNA, depending on the Phytophthora species. In mixed soil samples, all Phytophthora species were detected for Ct values shifted by 0.7 - 2.1 cycles. Based on these real-time PCR assays we were able to identify the five Phytophthora species. These techniques will be of value in the identification of these pathogens, which may cause up to 80 - 90% fine root loss in oak stands.","[Nowakowska, J.

The European wild boar (Sus scrofa) was introduced in central Argentina in 1900s and later expanded into Patagonia. Here, we determined the diversity and abundance of fungal taxa, and the frequency of hypogeous fungal spores in wild boar feces in Patagonia. We collected fecal samples on Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, and identified fungi using microscope and DNA metabarcoding of ITS2 rDNA. Hypogeous fungal spores occurred in almost all fecal samples. The most abundant species belonged to the genera Hysterangium, Melanogaster, Radiigera and Gautieria. In addition to the symbiotrophic hypogeous taxa, we also identified numerous pathotrophit and saprotrophic taxa. Not only diverse native hypogeous fungi, but also introduced ones are part of the diet of the wild boar in forests of Patagonia. If viable, introduced fungi are being dispersed as far as 2.5 km from the nearest plantation, highlighting how the introduced wild boar might alter the local distribution and composition of fungal communities.

However, it amplifies the challenge of how to objectively classify the diversity of fungal sequences into meaningful units, often in the absence of morphological characters. Here, we test the utility of modern multilocus Bayesian coalescent-based methods for delimiting cryptic fungal diversity in the orchid mycorrhiza morphospecies Serendipita vermifera. We obtained 147 fungal isolates from Caladenia, a speciose Glade of Australian orchids known to associate with Serendipita fungi. DNA sequence data for 7 nuclear and mtDNA loci were used to erect competing species hypotheses by clustering isolates based on: (a) ITS sequence divergence, (b) Bayesian admixture analysis, and (c) mtDNA variation. We implemented two coalescent-based Bayesian methods to determine which species hypothesis best fitted our data. Both methods found strong support for eight species of Serendipita among our isolates, supporting species boundaries reflected in ITS divergence. Patterns of host plant association showed evidence for both generalist and specialist associations within the host genus Caladenia. Our findings demonstrate the utility of Bayesian species delimitation methods and suggest that wider application of these techniques will readily uncover new species in other cryptic fungal lineages.

N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone-dependent quorum-sensing signaling represses the biosynthesis of bacterial cyclodipeptides (CDPs) that act as auxin signal mimics in the host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, we performed bioinformatics, biochemical, and plant growth analyses to identify nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are involved in CDP synthesis. A reverse genetics strategy allowed the identification of the genes encoding putative multi-modular-NRPS (MM-NRPS). Mutations in these genes affected the synthesis of the CDPs cyclo(L-Pro-L-Val), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Leu), and cyclo(L-Pro- L-Tyr), while showing wild-type-like levels of virulence factors, such as violacein, elastase, and pyocyanin. When analyzing the bioactivity of purified, naturally produced CDPs, it was found that cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo(L-Pro-L-Val) were capable of antagonizing quorum-sensing-LasR (QS-LasR)-dependent signaling in a contrasting manner in the cell-free supernatants of the selected NRPS mutants, which showed QS induction. Using a bacteria-plant interaction system, we further show that the pvdJ, ambB, and pchE P. aeruginosa mutants failed to repress primary root growth, but improved root branching in A. thaliana seedlings. These results indicated that the CDP production in P. aeruginosa depended on the functional MM-NRPS, which influences quorum-sensing of bacteria and plays a role in root architecture remodeling.","[Gonzalez, Omar; Diaz-Perez, Alma L.; Campos-Garcia, Jesus] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Quim Biol, Lab Biotecnol Microbiana, Edif B-3,Ciudad Univ, Morelia 58030, Michoacan, Mexico; [Ortiz-Castro, Randy; Magana-Duenas, Viridiana; Lopez-Bucio, Jose] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Quim Biol, Lab Biol Desarrollo Vegetal, Edif A1,Ciudad Univ, Morelia 58030, Michoacan, Mexico; [Ortiz-Castro, Randy] Inst Ecol AC, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Diaz-Perez, Cesar] Univ Guanajuato, Div Ciencias Salud & Ingn, Dept Ingn Agroind, Salvatierra, Gto, Mexico","Campos-Garcia, J (reprint author), Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Quim Biol, Lab Biotecnol Microbiana, Edif B-3,Ciudad Univ, Morelia 58030, Michoacan, Mexico.",jcgarcia@umich.mx,"Perez, Cesar Diaz/X-5157-2019; Campos-Garcia, Jesus/A-9368-2013","Perez, Cesar Diaz/0000-0001-7847-1062; Campos-Garcia, Jesus/0000-0002-8337-5830; Ortiz-Castro, Randy/0000-0002-6026-8311",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [256119]; Marcos Moshinsky Foundation; Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo/C.I.C.2.14 grant; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"This study was funded by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) of Mexico (grant number 256119), the Marcos Moshinsky Foundation, and Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo/C.I.C.2.14 grant.

The extent to which root traits mediate responses to aridity, and how they are coordinated with leaf traits, remains unclear. Here, we measured variation in root tissue density (RTD), specific root length (SRL), specific leaf area (SLA), and seed size within and among thirty perennial grass communities distributed along an aridity gradient spanning 190-540 mm of climatic water deficit (potential minus actual evapotranspiration). We tested the hypotheses that traits exhibited coordinated variation (1) among species, as well as (2) among communities varying in aridity, and (3) functional diversity within communities declines with increasing aridity, consistent with the ""stress-dominance"" hypothesis. Across communities, SLA and RTD exhibited a coordinated response to aridity, shifting toward more conservative (lower SLA, higher RTD) functional strategies with increasing aridity. The response of SRL to aridity was more idiosyncratic and was independent of variation in SLA and RTD. Contrary to the stress-dominance hypothesis, the diversity of SRL values within communities increased with aridity, while none of the other traits exhibited significant diversity responses. These results are consistent with other studies that have found SRL to be independent of an SLA-RTD axis of functional variation and suggest that the dynamic nature of soil moisture in arid environments may facilitate a wider array of resource capture strategies associated with variation in SRL.","[Butterfield, Bradley J.; Bradford, John B.; Munson, Seth M.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.; Bradford, John B.; Munson, Seth M.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Bradford, John B.; Munson, Seth M.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Gremer, Jennifer R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Butterfield, BJ (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Butterfield, BJ (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Bradley.Butterfield@nau.edu,"Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303",US Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area,"We thank Kaitlyn Toledo, Jonathan Paklaian, and Kyle Doherty for assistance with field work; and Julie Wachara, Austin Rueda, and Kelsey Blodgett for assistance with lab work.

Associated increases in soil temperature, decreases in water availability and changes in winter snow pack and soil frost are likely to affect soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Most studies of the effects of climate change on soil function have focused on the upper-organic part of the soil profile (e.g., forest floor), and little is known about effects on deeper mineral soil horizons. We exploited an elevation/orientation gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate how variation in climate, similar to that projected to occur over the next 50-100 years, affects soil C and N pools and transformation rates in different soil horizons of northern hardwood forests. Lower elevation, south-facing plots with higher soil temperature, less soil moisture and snow, and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw events had less soil inorganic N content and lower potential net N mineralization rates compared to higher elevation, north facing plots. These differences in N pools and fluxes were consistent for all soil horizons, but sensitivity to climate variation increased with soil depth, confirming that assessments of climate change effects that do not consider variation throughout the soil profile are likely to be incomplete and potentially inaccurate. Nitrogen cycling processes were more sensitive to climate variation than C cycling processes, suggesting a decoupling of C and N cycles in coming decades, with important implications for ecosystem function. Soil processes showed greater sensitivity to climate variation in summer than in spring, and in the warmer and less snowy year of sampling, suggesting that the effects of climate change might become More pronounced as temperatures increase and snow fall and water availability decrease in the coming decades.

Phenanthfene desorption in sdils increased monotonically with the increase of added GRSP concentration (0-50 mg/L) in solution.

We grew 12 plant species of three functional groups (grasses, forbs, and legumes) under two N pulse frequencies (high vs. low supply frequency) and two N amounts (high vs. low supply amount). Compared to low-amount N supply, high-amount N supply stimulated biomass accumulation and root growth by either increasing the thickness and length of roots or decreasing the root mass fraction. Compared to low-frequency N supply, high-frequency N supply improved biomass accumulation and root growth in forbs or grasses, but not in legumes. Furthermore, the magnitude of the response to N frequency was significantly negatively correlated with root size at the species scale, but this was only true when the N amount was high. We conclude that root responses to N frequency are related to plant functional types, and non-legume species is more sensitive to N frequency than legume species. Our results also suggest that root size is a determinant of root responses to N frequency when N supply amount is high. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Interestingly, eight PSB strains were observed as psychrotolerant i.e. growing and solubiliziiig P at lower temperature (4 degrees C) as well as at 28 degrees C. The P-solubilization by these PSB strains was potentially carried out by acidification which was justified by significant lowering of pH in tested cultures overtime compared to control broth. For ecological characterization, the isolated PSB were evaluated for their interactions against each other and other soil microorganisms i.e. nematodes and fungi isolated from the same Himalayan origin. No inhibition of PSB with P solubilizing fungi, showed their potential for their mutual application to increase P-availability to plants.

Here, the mycorrhizal status of eucalypts of different ages was assessed over the year in three plantations in the humid Mediterranean climate zone of Algeria (using morphological, anatomical, and histological criteria) and quantified in the dry and wet seasons over three years (using the grid-line intersect method of Giovannetti and Mosse (1980, New Phytol. 84: 489-500, doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.1980.tb04556.x) on randomized fine root segments). Unexpectedly, the results revealed the persistence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in old trees and their dominance over ectomycorrhizae during the dry season, while the opposite pattern was observed in the wet season. Composite mycorrhizae displaying intimately mixed arbuscular mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae anatomical structures also occurred and were more frequent during the dry season. Eucalypts were clearly able to form a wide diversity of symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi locally associated with native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. Therefore, the mycorrhizal status should not be a limiting factor to the silviculture of eucalypts in this area of Algeria because the dual symbiotic habit provides complementary benefits in a poor soil and in an alien environment.","[Adjoud-Sadadou, Djamila; Halli-Hargas, Rosa] Univ Mouloud Mammeri, Equipe Mycorhizes, Lab Prod Ameliorat & Protect Vegetaux, BP 17, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria","Adjoud-Sadadou, D (reprint author), Univ Mouloud Mammeri, Equipe Mycorhizes, Lab Prod Ameliorat & Protect Vegetaux, BP 17, Tizi Ouzou 15000, Algeria.",adjoudiam@gmail.com,,,,,,40,2,2,1,16,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The biomass and carbon storage for larch (Larix spp.) in large geographic regions in China were failed to be accurately estimated from current biomass equations, because they were usually based on a few sample trees on local sites, generally incompatible to volume estimation, and not additive between components and total biomass. China needs reliable biomass estimation of the important species in the whole country. This study was based on the mensuration data of above- and belowground biomass from 600 and 198 destructive sample trees of larch from four regions in China, respectively. The main purpose was to develop compatible individual tree equations on both national and regional levels for above- and belowground biomass, biomass conversion factor and root-to-shoot ratio, using the nonlinear error-in-variable simultaneous equation approach. In addition, diameter at breast height (D) and tree height (H) growth models were also developed, and effects of key climate variables on biomass variation and growth process were analyzed. The results showed that mean prediction errors (MPEs) of regional aboveground biomass models were from 3.86 to 7.52%, and total relative errors (TREs) are within +/- 3%; and for regional belowground biomass equations, the MPEs are from 9.91 to 28.85%, and the TREs are within +/- 4%. The above- and belowground biomass and D- and H-growth were significantly related to mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. The biomass equations and growth models developed in this paper will provide good basis for estimating and predicting biomass of larch forests in China.","[Zeng, WeiSheng; Chen, XinYun; Wang, XueJun; Pu, Ying] Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, State Forestry Adm, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China; [Duo, HaiRui] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Lei, XiangDong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Resource Informat Tech, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Zou, WenTao] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry Policy & Informat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Zeng, WS (reprint author), Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, State Forestry Adm, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China.",zengweisheng@forestry.gov.cn; duohr@126.com; xdlei@ifrit.ac.cn; 375201918@qq.com; 37183728@qq.com; 490048985@qq.com; zouwentao1982@126.com,,"Zeng, Weisheng/0000-0002-5462-0737","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270697, 31370634]; State Forestry Administration of China","This paper was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under (Grant No. 31270697 and 31370634).

Although increased nitrogen (N) availability and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) often have interacting effects on root and microbial dynamics, it is unclear whether these biotic effects can translate into altered soil pore structure and water retention. This study was based on a long-term experiment (7 yr at the time of sampling) in which a C-4 pasture grass (Paspalum notatum) was grown on a sandy loam soil while provided factorial additions of N and CO2. Through an analysis of soil aggregate fractal properties supported by 3D microtomographic imagery, we found that N fertilization induced an increase in intra-aggregate porosity and a simultaneous shift toward greater accumulation of pore space in larger aggregates. These effects were enhanced by eCO(2) and yielded an increase in water retention at pressure potentials near the wilting point of plants. However, eCO(2) alone induced changes in the opposite direction, with larger aggregates containing less pore space than under control conditions, and water retention decreasing accordingly. Results on biotic factors further suggested that organic matter gains or losses induced the observed structural changes. Based on our results, we postulate that the pore structure of many mineral soils could undergo N-dependent changes as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, having global-scale implications for water balance, carbon storage, and related rhizosphere functions.","[Caplan, Joshua S.; Gimenez, Daniel; Subroy, Vandana] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 19010 USA; [Heck, Richard J.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Prior, Stephen A.; Runion, G.

Facultative endosymbionts, including pathogens and mutualists, face changing and spatially structured environments during the symbiotic process, which impose diverse selection pressures. Here, we provide evidence that different selection regimes, involving different times spent in the plant environment, can result in either intra- or extracellular symbiotic adaptations. In previous work, we introduced the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis, the rhizobial symbiont of Mimosa pudica, into the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and selected three variants able to form root nodules on M.pudica, two (CBM212 and CBM349) being able to rudimentarily infect nodule cells and the third one (CBM356) only capable of extracellular infection of nodules. Each nodulating ancestor was further challenged to evolve using serial ex planta-in planta cycles of either 21 (three short-cycle lineages) or 42days (three long-cycle lineages). In this study, we compared the phenotype of the 18 final evolved clones. Evolution through short and long cycles resulted in similar adaptive paths on lineages deriving from the two intracellularly infectious ancestors, CBM212 and CBM349. In contrast, only short cycles allowed a stable acquisition of intracellular infection in lineages deriving from the extracellularly infecting ancestor, CBM356. Long cycles, instead, favoured improvement of extracellular infection. Our work highlights the importance of the selection regime in shaping desired traits during host-mediated selection experiments.","[Marchetti, Marta; Clerissi, Camille; Yousfi, Yasmine; Gris, Carine; Capela, Delphine; Masson-Boivin, Catherine] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo] Inst Pasteur, Microbial Evolutionary Genom, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75015 Paris, France; [Clerissi, Camille; Rocha, Eduardo] CNRS, UMR3525, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75015 Paris, France; [Bouchez, Olivier] INRA, GeT PlaGe, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Bouchez, Olivier] Univ Toulouse, GenPhySE, INRA, INPT,ENVT, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] CNRS, UMR8030, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux, F-91057 Evry, France; [Cruveiller, Stephane] CEA, Commissariat Energie Atom, DSV, IG,Genoscope LABGeM, 2 Rue Gaston Cremieux, F-91057 Evry, France; [Jauneau, Alain] UPS, CNRS, Federat Recherches Agrobiosci, Interact,Biodivers,Plateforme Imagerie TRI, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Masson-Boivin, C (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LIPM, INRA, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",catherine.masson@toulouse.inra.fr,"Rocha, Eduardo/B-7009-2009","Rocha, Eduardo/0000-0001-7704-822X","French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-ADAP-0014-01]; French Laboratory of Excellence project 'TULIP' [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]; France Genomique National Infrastructure [ANR-10-INBS-09]; European Research Council starting grant [EVOMOBILOME] [281605]","We are grateful to Jacques Batut for helpful comments on the manuscript.

We used genomic data from 55 individuals in seven locations across North America to perform genome scans to detect signatures of positive selection and assess whether temperature and precipitation were associated with genetic differentiation. We found that S.brevipes exhibited overall strong population differentiation, with potential admixture in Canadian populations. This species also displayed genomic signatures of positive selection as well as genomic sites significantly associated with distinct climatic regimes and abiotic environmental parameters. These genomic regions included genes involved in transmembrane transport of substances and helicase activity potentially involved in cold stress response.

However, there are few estimates of N quantities annually fixed, hindering the understanding of factors that control BNF, like low phosphorus availability. The quantities of N fixed in three dry forest (caatinga) fragments of the semiarid Brazilian northeastern region with different legume plant proportions were determined and seedlings of Mimosa tenuiflora were grown with phosphorous fertilized soil from the fragments to verify if lack of fixation was due to the absence of rhizobia populations or P deficiency. The vegetation of all areas was dominated by legume plants, mainly potentially nodulating ones, despite the relatively high soil N availability. M. tenuiflora was the most abundant nodulating legume in all fragments, with annual leaf productions from 800 to 1400 kg ha(-1). BNF amounts were low (1.4, 18 and 3.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the mature caatinga of Petrolina and in the mature and regenerating caatingas of So Joo, respectively) considering the high proportions of potentially nodulating plants (33, 61 and 82% of total plant basal area), because 80, 10 and 70% of these plants were not fixing and those fixing had only 20-46% of their N derived from the atmosphere. Since the pot grown seedlings nodulated abundantly, the low BNF could not be explained by absence of microsymbionts but likely to low symbiosis efficiency due to relatively high N and low P availability.","[da Silva, Aleksandro Ferreira; Santiago de Freitas, Ana Dolores; Costa, Tania Lucia; de Rosalia e Silva Santos, Carolina Etienne] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Agron, Rua Dom Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan] Embrapa Semiarido, BR 428,Km 152, BR-56302970 Petrolina, PE, Brazil; [Vieira Martins, Lindete Miria; Souza Menezes, Kelly Alexsandra] Univ Estado Bahia, Dept Tecnol & Ciencias Sociais, Ave Edgard Chastinet S-N, BR-48900000 Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [de Sa Barretto Sampaio, Everardo Valadares] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Energia Nucl, Ave Prof Luis Freire 1000, BR-50740540 Recife, PE, Brazil","de Freitas, ADS (reprint author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Agron, Rua Dom Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil.",aleks.agro@gmail.com; ana.freitas@pq.cnpq.br; tanialuciacosta@gmail.com; paulo.ivan@embrapa.br; lindete.martins1@gmail.com; carolina.ssantos@ufrpe.br; kelly_alexsandra@hotmail.com; esampaio@ufpe.br,"Sampaio, Everardo/B-7988-2013; Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan/M-6706-2017","Sampaio, Everardo/0000-0002-4745-016X; Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan/0000-0002-6390-3720",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [472997/2012-2],"The authors thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq; Projeto Universal 2012, Processo 472997/2012-2) for the financial support.

Starting from winter-spring 2013, several black pines (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold) suffered crown die-back. Declining trees occurred nearby individuals with no signs of die-back, raising hypotheses about the occurrence of individual-specific hydraulic strategies underlying different responses to extreme drought. We investigated possible processes driving black pine decline by dendrochronological and wood anatomical measurements, coupled with analysis of tree-ring carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopic composition in healthy trees (H) and trees suffering die-back (D). Die-back trees showed higher growth rates than H trees at the beginning of the last century, but suffered important growth reduction following the dry summers in 2003 and 2012. After the 2012 drought, D trees produced tracheids with larger diameter and greater vulnerability to implosion than H ones. Healthy trees had significantly higher wood delta C-13 than D trees, reflecting higher water-use efficiency for the surviving trees, i.e., less water transpired per unit carbon gain, which could be related to lower stomatal conductance and a more conservative use of water. Relatively high delta O-18 for D trees indicates that they were strongly dependent on shallow water sources, or that they sustained higher transpiration rates than H trees. Our results suggest that H trees adopted a more conservative water- use strategy under drought stress compared with D trees. We speculate that this diversity might have a genotypic basis, but other possible explanations, like different rooting depth, cannot be ruled out.","[Petrucco, Laura; Nardini, Andrea] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via L Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Petrucco, Laura; von Arx, Georg; Cherubini, Paolo] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Saurer, Matthias] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Nardini, A (reprint author), Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via L Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",nardini@units.it,"Cherubini, Paolo/N-9702-2013; von Arx, Georg/E-1785-2012; von Arx, Georg/L-6486-2019; Nardini, Andrea/C-6525-2009; Saurer, Matthias/C-6724-2018","Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X; von Arx, Georg/0000-0002-8566-4599; von Arx, Georg/0000-0002-8566-4599; Saurer, Matthias/0000-0002-3954-3534","University of Trieste (Finanziamento di Ateneo per la Ricerca Scientifica - Climate change and forest mortality: from physiological mechanisms to ecological consequences); Erasmus Placement; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI [C12.0100, C14.0104]","This study was funded by the University of Trieste (Finanziamento di Ateneo per la Ricerca Scientifica 2013 - Climate change and forest mortality: from physiological mechanisms to ecological consequences).
