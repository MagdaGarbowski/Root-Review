However, the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness are still not well elucidated. In this study, we compared the invader with its two native congeners (E. heterophyllum and E. japonicum) at four irradiances in terms of growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and photosynthesis. The higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P (max)) and total leaf area of the invader may contribute to its higher relative growth rate (RGR) and total biomass compared with its native congeners. Total biomass and RGR increased significantly with the increase of P (max) and total leaf area. The higher support organ mass fraction and the lower root mass fraction of the invader may also contribute to its higher RGR and biomass through increasing carbon assimilation and reducing respiratory carbon loss, respectively. The higher growth rate of the invader increased its total leaf area, ramet number, and crown area. These traits may help the invader to form dense monoculture, outshading native plant species. However, consistently higher leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf mass fraction were not found across irradiances for the invader compared with its native congeners. Higher plasticity in response to irradiance was also not found for the invader. The invader retained advantages over the natives across irradiances, while its performance decreased with lower irradiance. The results indicate that the invader may be one of the few super invaders. Reducing irradiance may inhibit its invasions.","[Zheng, Yu-Long; Feng, Yu-Long; Liao, Zhi-Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Kunming 650223, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yu-Long; Liao, Zhi-Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wan-Xue] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Beijing 10094, Peoples R China","Feng, YL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Kunming 650223, Peoples R China.",fyl@xtbg.ac.cn,"Feng, Yulong/B-7416-2012; YuLong, zheng/H-3716-2012",,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30670394, 30830027]; Applied Basic Study Project of Yunnan Province; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2002CB111400]","We are grateful to Chang-Long Zhang for his assistance in measurements, and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Several competition indices, a model of overstorey fine root density, relative photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) values, and soil water values were used in these approaches. In the factorial experiment relative PAR and soil water content were measured and used for the prediction of seedlings height growth. In the field experiment this was done by using relative PAR and estimated fine root biomass as a surrogate for below ground resource availability. The latter approach was compared with a model where we used various competition indices representing the impact of overstorey trees on beech seedlings. Our results suggested that (1) models which combine resource based growth functions are suitable for the prediction of individual height growth of beech seedlings. Resource based models offer the opportunity to investigate on the independent multiplicative effect of irradiance and water supply and their interactions on tree seedlings. It was (2) shown that a combined model could be used not only to predict individual height growth of beech seedlings in a controlled experiment but also in the field. The model parameters of a pure light response function for the controlled factorial experiment are comparable to those obtained in the field study. The results showed (3) that the precision of predicting beech seedlings height growth is comparable between the model types tested within this study. Approximately half of the observed variation in seedlings relative height growth rate could be explained. However, the simple competition index approach provides no information on the environmental factors constraining tree seedlings growth; whereas the multiplicative combined models can be used to get a better understanding of growth dynamics in the field.","[Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Wagner, Sven] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Silviculture & Forest Protect, D-01735 Tharandt, Germany; [Madsen, Palle] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Appl Ecol Forest & Landscape, DK-7100 Vejle, Denmark","Ammer, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",wagner@forst.tu-dresden.de; pam@life.ku.dk; christian.ammer@forst.uni-goettingen.de,,"Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135",,,,98,17,18,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

S. polyrrhiza selectively accumulated a diverse range of aromatic compound-degrading bacteria in its rhizosphere, regardless of the origin of water samples, despite no exposure to phenol. The relative abundances of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O) gene (C12O DNA) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) gene (C23O DNA) were calculated as the ratios of the copy numbers of these genes to the copy number of 16S rDNA and are referred to as the rhizosphere effect (RE) value. The RE values for C12O DNA and C23O DNA were 1.0 x 10(1)-9.3 x 10(3) and 1.7 x 10(2)-1.5 x 10(4) times as high, respectively, in rhizosphere fractions as in bulk water fractions, and these higher values were associated with a notably higher sequence diversity of C12O DNA and C23O DNA. The RE values during phenol degradation were 3.6 x 10(0)-4.3 x 10(2) and 2.2 x 10(0)-1.7 x 10(2), respectively, indicating the ability of S. polyrrhiza to selectively accumulate aromatic compound-degrading bacteria in its rhizosphere during phenol degradation. The bacterial communities in the rhizosphere fractions differed from those in the bulk water fractions, and those in the bulk water fractions were notably affected by the rhizosphere bacterial communities. S. polyrrhiza released more than 100 types of phenolic compound into its rhizosphere as root exudates at the considerably high specific release rate of 1520 mg TOC and 214 mg phenolic compounds/d/g root (wet weight). This ability of S. polyrrhiza might result in the selective recruitment and accumulation of a diverse range of bacteria harboring genes encoding C12O and C23O, and the subsequent accelerated degradation of phenol in the rhizosphere.

Large root volume (Rv) has potential to alleviate transplant shock because of higher root growth potential and greater access to soil water. We investigated impacts of drought and transplant Rv on photosynthetic assimilation (A), transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (g(s)), predawn leaf xylem water potential (Psi(L)), and growth of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings to explain mechanisms associated with susceptibility to transplant shock. One year-old barerooot seedlings were graded into four Rv categories and either well watered or subjected to drought consisting of low, medium, or high moisture stress by discontinuing irrigation at 22-day intervals for 3 months. Thereafter, all treatments were re-watered to examine recovery. Transplant shock was signified by reduced A, E, g(s), and Psi(L), which generally increased with increasing moisture stress and Rv. Physiological status improved during recovery, though stress was still evident in seedlings exposed to medium or high moisture stress and in larger Rv seedlings. Growth declined with increasing moisture stress but was generally similar among Rv treatments, likely reflecting greater A at the whole plant level and/or reliance upon stored reserves in large Rv seedlings. The most effective drought avoidance mechanisms were root growth, stomatal regulation, reduced leaf area, and higher growth allocation to roots relative to shoots. Our results suggest that large initial Rv does not enhance drought avoidance during the first season after transplant in northern red oak seedlings.","[Jacobs, Douglass E.; Salifu, K.

The aims were: (1) to assess the performance of two methods for estimating sap-flows in oak seedlings following planting by correlating the data they provided with natural light intensities over a three-week period, and (2) to compare the estimates with transpiration data obtained by weighing pots. Estimates of sap flows obtained from data provided by constant power (Dayau-type) heat balance gauges under low light conditions (100-450 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were less variable than estimates from variable power (EMS-type) heat balance gauges. The EMS-type system yielded data with little between-gauge variation, but consistently underestimated transpiration on a daily basis, a systematic error that should be corrected by other methods. The Dayau-type gauges yielded data with substantial variations, and several gauges arc probably needed in research to cover these variations. Further, both systems provide rather uncertain estimates of short-time (hour) transpiration ratcs. However, provided that these considerations arc taken into account, we conclude that it should be possible to use either system in various research contexts.","[Lof, Magnus; Welander, N.

Human impact in terms of fuelwood collection, selective cutting and grazing was found to influence species diversity patterns in all organism groups. Species richness of trees, climbers and polypores at plot level (alpha-diversity) generally responded negatively to human impact, whereas species richness of herbs and shrubs showed a positive relation. Species turnover (beta-diversity), measured as length of the DCA first axis, was significantly correlated to distance to village for all species groups. This indicates that the human impact is very important for the biodiversity patterns in the study area, and that biodiversity connected to undisturbed forest habitats are potentially threatened in the area.

The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated a different bacterial community structure in the rhizosphere and in bulk soil, however, with almost no seasonal changes between late spring and autumn samples and no apparent impact of the three plant species. In addition, root colonization of the three plant species by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was microscopically assessed monthly from May until October 2006. A presumably accidental correlation between monthly precipitation and the degree of arbuscule formation, with the latter lagging 1 month, was noted for M. piperita, the most heavily colonized of the three plant species. With all three plants, the phosphorus content in roots correlated positively with most AMF structures. Microsclerotia of DSE were mainly abundant in autumn samples. Fungal diversity in roots was estimated using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis separation of the fungal polymerase chain reaction products obtained for both 18S-rDNA and the 5.8S-ITS2-28S rDNA segments.

Additionally, the combinations of legume tree-cactus were inoculated with either a consortium of desert arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB; the diazotroph Azospirillum brasilense Cd, and the phosphate solubilizer Paenibacillus sp.), or a mixture of all. The field experiments were evaluated periodically during 30 months for survival and growth. Cardons reared in an outdoor screen house survived better in the field than those reared in a controlled growth chamber and hardened later outdoors. Association with any legume nurse tree increased survival and enhanced growth of untreated cardons. For cardons growing alone, application of either compost, AM fungi, and all the treatments combined increased survival. For these plants, no treatment affected plant growth during the first 3 months after transplanting. Later, all treatments, except for AM fungi, enhanced plant growth. However, only 2 years after transplanting the enhanced growth effect of AM fungi was also significant. In the presence of the legume nurse trees, transient positive effects on cardon growth were recorded. General evaluation after 30 months of cultivation showed that the treatments positively affected cardon growth when growing alone or in combination only with mesquite amargo but not with the other two legume trees. This study proposes that young legume trees have the capacity to enhance survival and growth of cardon cactus, depending on the legume cactus combination. Additional treatments such as compost or PGPB can either amplify the effect or else attenuate it.","[Bashan, Yoav; Salazar, Bernardo; Esther Puente, Ma.; Bacilio, Macario] NW Ctr Biol Res CIBNOR, Environm Microbiol Grp, La Paz 23090, Baja California, Mexico; [Bashan, Yoav] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Linderman, Robert] USDA ARS, Corvallis, OR USA","Bashan, Y (reprint author), NW Ctr Biol Res CIBNOR, Environm Microbiol Grp, Mar Bermejo 195,Colonia Playa Palo de Santa Rita, La Paz 23090, Baja California, Mexico.",bashan@cals.arizona.edu,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Mexico (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [50052-Z]; Bashan Foundation, USA","We thank Claudia Rojas, Manuel Moreno, and Luis Leyva for technical assistance in establishing the initial stages of the field studies and Rocio Villalpando, Juan-Pablo Hernandez, Elsa Samarano, and Diana Arizmendi for taking plant measurements and for their help in hand irrigation of the field experiments for 2 years.

We investigated whether light and soil source affect ECM colonization and community properties on red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings. Seedlings were grown under 10%, 45%, and full sunlight in soils removed beneath red oak and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) trees. Between soils, colonization and diversity were significantly greater in intermediate-high versus low light. Across light levels, colonization, richness, and diversity were greater on seedlings grown in oak versus hemlock soils. The frequency of seedlings colonized by three of the four most common morphotypes was more responsive to light in oak versus hemlock soil. Colonization differences between soil sources were associated with differences in richness, which may in turn reflect host specificity and fine root length differences. Increasing colonization with increasing light was associated with increased richness, which in turn may reflect increased carbon allocation to roots. Results suggest that differences in responses of individual ECM morphotypes coupled with host responses to light and soil source may influence ECM colonization and diversity. Changes in ECM colonization and diversity could in turn affect seedling recruitment, especially for seedlings encountering variable light regimes and host species.","[Turner, Gregory D.; Lewis, J.

A common garden experiment with seedlings of Fagus sylvatica provenances from the center (Germany) and eastern margin (Poland) of the species' distribution range was conducted. Responses of morphological, physiological, chemical and growth parameters to three drought treatments were analyzed. Relative growth rates of the marginal provenance were lower as compared to the central provenance. The marginal seedlings showed a tendency to higher total biomasses because of higher seed masses. In both provenances drought decreased biomass production and root/shoot ratio which was lower in the central provenance. A lower specific root area of the marginal provenance indicated a better adaptation to low xylem water potentials. Under moderate drought, lower leaf delta(13)C signatures may indicate lower stomatal limitation (or a reduced rate of CO(2) assimilation) in the marginal provenance. We conclude that marginal beech provenances may exhibit a better drought adaptation.","[Rose, Laura; Leuschner, Christoph; Koeckemann, Benjamin; Buschmann, Holger] VIMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Rose, Laura; Leuschner, Christoph; Koeckemann, Benjamin; Buschmann, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Rose, L (reprint author), VIMO, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",lrose@gwdg.de,,"Rose, Laura/0000-0003-4523-4145",Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft (HGF)Helmholtz Association,"The authors wish to thank Boris Rewald for fruitful discussions regarding the Weld work.

Fifty-four wild forage plant species were collected and examined, and 27 of these were colonized by AM fungi. Some plants belonging to families that are presumed to lack mycorrhizas (Cyperaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Chenopodiaceae) were also found to be mycorrhizal. Higher proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants were found in perennial (56.1%) and monocotyledonous (64.7%) forage species. However, neither percentage of root length colonized nor spore density varied significantly between the two life forms or cotyledon types. Twenty-seven species belonging to 7 genera of AM fungi were identified in total according to the morphological characteristics of the spores from field soil and trap Cultures, and the results indicate that Glomus was the dominant AM genus and Glomus geosporum (Nicolson & Gerdemann) Walker and Glomus mosseae (Nicolson & Gerdemann) Gerdemann & Trappe were the dominant species in field soil and trap cultures, respectively.

Models are also developed of root-soil plate spread in relation to soil group and tree characteristics and are applied with the Resistance model to provide predictions of anchorage based on the diameter at breast height. To examine the relative sensitivity of trees on different soil groups and with different rooting depths, the models are applied here to an example where the leeward 'hinge' radius is constrained to a maximum of 1 m.

We studied how the principal direct defenses (iridoid glycosides) and indirect defenses (volatile organic compounds) of Plantago lanceolata L. are affected by insect herbivory and mechanical wounding. Volatile compounds were collected and quantified from mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal P. lanceolata plants that underwent three different treatments: 1) insect herbivory, 2) mechanical wounding, or 3) no damage. The iridoids aucubin and catalpol were extracted and quantified from the same plants. Emission of terpenoid volatiles was significantly higher after insect herbivory than after the other treatments. However, herbivore-damaged mycorrhizal plants emitted lower amounts of sesquiterpenes, but not monoterpenes, than herbivore-damaged non-mycorrhizal plants. In contrast, mycorrhizal infection increased the emission of the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in untreated control plants, making it comparable to emission from mechanically wounded or herbivore-damaged plants whether or not they had mycorrhizal associates. Neither mycorrhization nor treatment had any influence on the levels of iridoid glycosides. Thus, mycorrhizal infection did not have any effect on the levels of direct defense compounds measured in P. lanceolata. However, the large decline in herbivore-induced sesquiterpene emission may have important implications for the indirect defense potential of this species.","[Fontana, Anna; Reichelt, Michael; Gershenzon, Jonathan; Unsicker, Sybille B.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Biochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Hempel, Stefan] UFZ Helmholtzctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany","Unsicker, SB (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Biochem, Hans Knoll Str 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",sunsicker@ice.mpg.de,"Gershenzon, Jonathan/K-1331-2013","Gershenzon, Jonathan/0000-0002-1812-1551; Unsicker, Sybille/0000-0002-9738-0075",Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society,"We thank Carsten Renker, Udo Kornmesser, Andreas Weber and the gardeners of the MPICO, Daniel Rosenberger, Amelie Zander, Tobias Kollner, Grit Kunert, and Tim Walter for their assistance in various aspects of this work.

We studied the water economy of nine woody species differing in rooting depth in a Patagonian shrub steppe from southern Argentina to understand how soil water availability and rooting depth determine their hydraulic architecture. Soil water content and potentials, leaf water potentials (I(Leaf)), hydraulic conductivity, wood density (rho(w)), rooting depth, and specific leaf area (SLA) were measured during two summers. Water potentials in the upper soil layers during a summer drought ranged from -2.3 to -3.6 MPa, increasing to -0.05 MPa below 150 cm. Predawn I(Leaf) was used as a surrogate of weighted mean soil water potential because no statistical differences in I(Leaf) were observed between exposed and covered leaves. Species-specific differences in predawn I(Leaf) were consistent with rooting depths. Predawn I(Leaf) ranged from -4.0 MPa for shallow rooted shrubs to -1.0 MPa for deep-rooted shrubs, suggesting that the roots of the latter have access to abundant moisture, whereas shallow-rooted shrubs are adapted to use water deposited mainly by small rainfall events. Wood density was a good predictor of hydraulic conductivity and SLA. Overall, we found that shallow rooted species had efficient water transport in terms of high specific and leaf specific hydraulic conductivity, low rho(w), high SLA and a low minimum I(Leaf) that exhibited strong seasonal changes, whereas deeply rooted shrubs maintained similar minimum I(Leaf) throughout the year, had stems with high rho(w) and low hydraulic conductivity and leaves with low SLA. These two hydraulic syndromes were the extremes of a continuum with several species occupying different portions of a gradient in hydraulic characteristics. It appears that the marginal cost of having an extensive root system (e.g., high rho(w) and root hydraulic resistance) contributes to low growth rates of the deeply rooted species.","[Bucci, Sandra J.; Scholz, Fabian G.; Goldstein, Guillermo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bucci, Sandra J.; Scholz, Fabian G.; Arce, Maria E.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias Nat, Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Buenos Aires, FCEyN, Lab Ecol Func, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Meinzer, Frederick C.] US Forest Serv, Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Bucci, SJ (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",sj_bucci@unpata.edu.ar,"Meinzer, Frederick/C-3496-2012; Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019","Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031; Bucci, Sandra Janet/0000-0003-1079-9277",La Dora Ranch,We thank Hector R.

Here, we used a comparative approach to test whether instantaneous measurements of plant traits can capture both the amount of resources depleted under plant cover over time (competitive effect) and the way competitors perceived this resource depletion (competitive response). We performed a large competition experiment in which phytometers from a single grass species were transplanted within 18 different monocultures grown in a common-garden experiment, with a time-integrative quantification of light and water depletion over the phytometers' growing season. Resource-capturing traits were measured on both phytometers (competitive response traits) and monocultures (competitive effect traits). The total amounts of depleted light and water availabilities over the season strongly differed among monocultures; they were best estimated by instantaneous measurements of height and rooting depth, respectively, performed when either light or water became limiting. Specific leaf area and leaf water potential, two competitive response traits measured at the leaf level, were good predictors of changes in phytometer performance under competition, and reflected the amount of light and water, respectively, perceived by plants throughout their lifespan. Our results demonstrated the relevance of instantaneous measures of plant traits as indicators of resource depletion over time, validating the trait-based approach for competition ecology.","[Violle, Cyrille; Garnier, Eric; Roumet, Catherine; Podeur, Cecile; Blanchard, Alain] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34033 Montpellier, France; [Lecoeur, Jeremie] Montpellier SupAgro, UMR Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environm, Montpellier, France; [Navas, Marie-Laure] Montpellier SupAgro, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, Montpellier, France","Violle, C (reprint author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34033 Montpellier, France.",cyrille.violle@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154","CNRS, FranceCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [GDR 2574]","We thank J.

AM fungal inoculation also modified the induced chemical response following herbivory by the specialist lepidopoteran herbivore Junonia coenia, and fungal species varied in how they affected induced responses. On average, inoculation with AM fungi substantially reduced the induced chemical response as compared with sterile controls, and inoculation with a mixture of AM fungi suppressed the induced response of P. lanceolata to herbivory. These results suggest that AM fungi can exert controlling influence over plant defensive phenotypes, and a portion of the substantial variation among experimental tests of induced chemical responses may be attributable to AM fungi.","[Bennett, Alison Elizabeth; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bowers, M.

More information is needed on interactive CO2 and O-3 effects on roots, particularly fine-root life span, a critical demographic parameter and determinant of soil C and N pools and cycling rates. We conducted a study in which ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seedlings were exposed to two levels of CO2 and O-3 in sun-lit controlled-environment mesocosms for 3 years. Minirhizotrons were used to monitor individual fine roots in three soil horizons every 28 days. Proportional hazards regression was used to analyze effects of CO2, O-3, diameter, depth, and season of root initiation on fine-root survivorship. More fine roots were produced in the elevated CO2 treatment than in ambient CO2. Elevated CO2, increasing root diameter, and increasing root depth all significantly increased fine-root survivorship and median life span. Life span was slightly, but not significantly, lower in elevated O-3, and increased O-3 did not reduce the effect of elevated CO2. Median life spans varied from 140 to 448 days depending on the season of root initiation. These results indicate the potential for elevated CO2 to increase the number of fine roots and their residence time in the soil, which is also affected by root diameter, root depth, and phenology.","[Phillips, Donald L.; Johnson, Mark G.; Tingey, David T.] US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Storm, Marjorie J.] US EPA, Dynamac Int Inc, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Phillips, DL (reprint author), US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, 200 SW 35th St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",phillips.donald@epa.gov,"Phillips, Donald/D-5270-2011",,"US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)United States Environmental Protection Agency; US Dept. of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [(DE-AI0396ER62288]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [RW89937719, 68-C6-0005]; Dynamac Corporation","The information in this document has been funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and by an interagency agreement between the US Dept. of Energy (DE-AI0396ER62288) and EPA (RW89937719).

However, the successional direction of soil N mineralization and nitrification in relation to species shifts in the subtropical regions remains little studied. In this study, successional patterns of net soil N mineralization and nitrification rates, litter-fall, forest floor litter, fine root and soil properties were quantified through a successional sequence in the subtropical forests of eastern China. Net N mineralization rate was 'U-shaped' through succession: highest in climax evergreen broad-leaved forest (CE: 1.6 +/- 0.2 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1)) and secondary shrubs (SS: 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1)), lowest in conifer and evergreen broad-leaved mixed forest (MF: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1)) and intermediate in conifer forest (CF: 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1)) and sub-climax forest (SE: 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1)). Soil nitrification increased with time (0.02 +/- 0.1, 0.2 +/- 0.1, 0.5 +/- 0.1, 0.2 +/- 0.1, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg-N kg(-1) yr(-1) in SS, CF, MF, SE and CE, respectively). Annual production of litter-fall increased through succession. Fine root stocks and total N concentration, soil total N, total carbon (C) and microbial biomass C also followed 'U-shaped' temporal trends in succession. Soil bulk density was highest in MF, lowest in CE, and intermediate in SS, CF and SE. Soil pH was significantly lowest in CE. Temporal patterns of soil N mineralization and nitrification were significant related to the growth of conifers (i.e. Pinus massoniana) and associated successional changes of litter-fall, forest floor, fine roots and soil properties. We concluded that, due to lower litter quality, the position of Pinus massoniana along the succession pathway played an important role in controlling temporal trends of soil N transformation.","[Yan, En-Rong; Wang, Xi-Hua; Guo, Ming; Zhong, Qiang; Zhou, Wu] E China Normal Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Yan, En-Rong; Wang, Xi-Hua] Chinese Natl Ecosyst Observat & Res Network, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst, Ningbo 315114, Peoples R China; [Li, Yong-Fu] Zhejiang Forestry Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, Linan 311300, Peoples R China","Yan, ER (reprint author), E China Normal Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",eryan@des.ecnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30770365]; Doctoral Program Foundation of Higher Education in China [20070269011],"The authors thank Jia-Yue Shi, Zhan Shi, Liang Zhao, Dong He, Rui Wang, Liang-Yan Wang and Jian-Ping Chen for their help in the field work, and Qiu-Ming Di and Zhan Shi for their help during laboratory work.

We examined fine-root distributions, mass, growth and tissue N and C concentrations for six tree species established in 16-year-old plantations in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica in a randomized-block design (n = 4). The study included five native species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia ferruginea and Vochysia guatemalensis) and one exotic (Pinus patula). Under all species > 60% of the total fine-root mass to one meter deep was located in the uppermost 15 cm of the soil. Fine-root live biomass and necromass (i.e., the mass of dead fine roots) varied significantly among species but only within the uppermost 15 cm, with biomass values ranging from 182 gm(-2) in Pinus to 433 gm(-2) in Hyeronima plots, and necromass ranging from 48 gm(-2) in Pinus to 183 gm(-2) in Virola plots. Root growth, measured using ingrowth cores, differed significantly among species, ranging from 261 gm(-2) yr (-1) in Pinus to 891 gm(-2) yr (-1) in Hyeronima. Turnover rates of fine root biomass ranged from 1.09 to 2.03 yr (-1) in Virola and Hyeronima plots respectively. Fine-root biomass was significantly and positively correlated with fine-root growth (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001), but did not correlate with fine-root turnover (r = 0.10; P = 0.20), suggesting that fine-root accumulation is a function of growth rate rather than mortality. Fine-root longevity was not correlated (r = 0.20, P = 0.34) and growth was negatively correlated with root N concentration across species (r = -0.78, P < 0.0001), contrary to reported trends for leaves, perhaps because N was relatively abundant at this site.","[Valverde-Barrantes, Oscar J.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Raich, James W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Russell, Ann E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Valverde-Barrantes, OJ (reprint author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",ovalverd@kent.edu; jraich@iastate.edu; arussell@iastate.edu,"Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361",,,,1,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2009,320,2-Jan,,,,,333,334,,10.1007/s11104-009-9996-y,,,2,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,456FV,WOS:000266828500023,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Li, CP; Sun, OJ; Xiao, CW; Han, XG",,,,"Li, Chunping; Sun, Osbert Jianxin; Xiao, Chunwang; Han, Xingguo",,,Differences in Net Primary Productivity Among Contrasting Habitats in Artemisia ordosica Rangeland of Northern China,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Artemisia ordosica; net primary production (NPP); Ordos Plateau; soil organic carbon (SOC) density; turnover rate,FINE-ROOT TURNOVER; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-USE; ECOSYSTEMS; DESERT; CARBON; DESERTIFICATION; BIOMASS; PINE,"Artemisia ordosica Krasch. is a semishrub native to the Ordos Plateau of Inner Mongolia, northern China, and forms a unique and dominant vegetation type in the sandland of the region. To determine the variation of productivity in A. ordosica rangeland, we investigated net primary production (NPP), fine root turnover, soil microbial C (C-mic), and soil organic carbon density (SOCd) on sand dunes differing in mobility (i.e., fixed, semifixed, and shifting sand dunes) in Mu Us sandland. We found that, oil an area basis, the NPP, SOCd, C-mic, and fine root turnover rates all increased with increasing vegetation cover. However, the ratios of root NPP to total NPP (RMRN) increased with declining vegetation cover. Total NPP varied markedly among habitats and ranged from 18.3 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for communities on the shifting sand dunes to 293.8 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for communities on the fixed sand dunes; whereas the rates of fine root turnover varied from 0.16.yr(-1) to 0.54.yr(-1). Our study demonstrated that habitat change in sandland has significant impacts on ecosystem productivity by affecting many related aspects of NPP. From the perspective of biomass production, protection of the semifixed dunes from degradation should be taken as a higher priority than trying to convert shifting sand dunes to semifixed sand dunes; whereas conversion of semifixed sand dunes to fixed sand dunes would appear to be a much easier task than restoring shifting sand dunes.","[Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunping; Xiao, Chunwang; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Sun, OJ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",sunjianx@bjfu.edu.cn,"Han, Xingguo/B-3980-2012; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016","Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984",,,,36,4,4,3,20,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Both species contain at least one phytotoxic flavonoid root exudate with demonstrated negative influences on other plants. Previous findings indicated that Silky lupine (Lupinus sericeus), among other legumes, was relatively resistant to Spotted knapweed invasion and allelochemistry. We hypothesized that legume species may exhibit resistance to flavonoids in knapweed root exudates and may serve as candidate species for management efforts. Because legumes form symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, these bacteria must also be evaluated for allelochemical resistance before legumes can be recommended for restoration. In this study, we examined four legume species for effects of 7,8-benzoflavone (from Russian knapweed) and (+/-)-catechin (from Spotted knapweed) on rhizosphere interactions involving legume roots and associated rhizobia. Pure cultures of four rhizobia strains exhibited varied responses when grown with 7,8-benzoflavone or (+/-)-catechin. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and its bacterial symbiont, Sinorhizobium meliloti, exhibited allelochemical resistance that varied with (+/-)-catechin concentration when grown in vitro. Four legume species were grown under greenhouse conditions. Plants that were inoculated and nodulated generally exhibited no response to 7,8-benzoflavone or (+/-)-catechin treatments. Plants that were not inoculated exhibited stronger responses. Therefore, inoculation and nodulation may confer resistance to allelochemicals. These results, when coupled with previous research and field observations, suggest that legumes may not be susceptible to knapweed allelopathy and may be good choices in restoration of knapweed infestations when inoculated, particularly on sites with low soil nitrogen.","[Alford, Elan R.; Vivanco, Jorge M.; Paschke, Mark W.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Vivanco, Jorge M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Vivanco, Jorge M.; Paschke, Mark W.] Colorado State Univ, Ctr Rhizosphere Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Alford, Elan R.; Paschke, Mark W.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Paschke, MW (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",mark.paschke@colostate.edu,"Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013","Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905; Alford, Elan/0000-0001-9602-0177","U.S. Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [SI-1388]; United States Department of Agriculture, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, Western Regional Integrated Pest Management (USDA-CSREES-WRIPM)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2005-34103-16108]","U.S. Department of Defense SERDP project #SI-1388 and United States Department of Agriculture, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, Western Regional Integrated Pest Management (USDA-CSREES-WRIPM) contract #2005-34103-16108.

Poly P was quantified by two enzymatic assays: long-chain poly P (>similar to 20 inorganic phosphate [P-i] residues) with polyphosphate kinase, and total poly P with polyphosphate exopolyphosphatase. The difference between these values was designated as short-chain poly P (<similar to 20 P-i residues). The content of long-chain poly P in mycorrhizal roots and plant growth was poorly correlated or not, depending in fungal species. However, the content of short-chain poly P and plant growth was highly correlated in both species. This difference suggests that short-chain poly P in mycorrhizal roots colonized by Glomus spp. functions as a pool of P-i for the plant. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the relationship between aggregation stability and glomalin in a Haplic Calcisol comparing abandoned and active cultivation of olive groves. Abandonment was associated with increases in soil organic carbon, the percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA(1-2mm)), and easily extractable and total Bradford-reactive soil protein. WSA(1-2mm) was strongly positively correlated with both easily extractable and total Bradford-reactive soil protein. While easily extractable Brad ford-reactive soil protein measured in both stable and unstable aggregates did not show any significant differences, Bradford-reactive soil protein was twice as high in stable than in unstable aggregates under both tillage and abandonment. Our results suggest that Bradford-reactive soil protein influences aggregate stability, even in soils with low organic matter and high calcium carbonate contents. However, more research is needed to elucidate the role of easily extractable Bradford-reactive soil protein in soil aggregation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The timings of leaf flush and the end of the canopy duration period (CDP) were also investigated from the perspective of the temporal positive carbon gain. Two numerical experiments with different seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI) were carried out using above-canopy hydrometeorological data as input data. The first experiment involved seasonally varying LAI estimated based on time-series of radiative transmittance through the canopy, and the second experiment applied an annually constant LAI. The first simulation captured the measured seasonal changes in soil surface moisture; the simulated transpiration agreed with seasonal changes in heat pulse velocity, corresponding to the water use of individual trees, and the simulated An became slightly negative. However, in the second simulation, A(n) became negative in the dry season because the decline in stomatal conductance due to severe soil drought limited the assimilation, and the simultaneous increase in leaf temperature increased dark respiration. Thus, these experiments revealed that the leaflessness in the dry season is reasonable for carbon gain and emphasized the unfavorable soil water status for carbon gain in the dry season. Examining the duration of positive A(n) (DPA) in the second simulation showed that the start of the longest DPA (LDPA) in a year approached the timing of leaf flush in the teak plantation after the spring equinox. On the other hand, the end appeared earlier than that of all CDPs. This result is consistent with the sap flow stopping earlier than the complete leaf fall, implying that the carbon assimilation period ends before the completion of defoliation. The model sensitivity analysis in the second simulation suggests that a smaller LAI and slower maximum rate of carboxylation likely extend the LDPA because soil water from the surface to rooting depth is maintained longer at levels adequate for carbon gain by decreased canopy transpiration. The experiments also suggest that lower soil hydraulic conductivity and deeper rooting depth can postpone the end of the LDPA by increasing soil water retention and the soil water capacity, respectively.

Ecologically sensitive arid and semi-arid rangelands are increasingly Subject to severe grazing pressure, which cause their rapid degradation. This Study therefore quantified the seasonal trend in root distribution and root/shoot ratio with depth arid degradation along a soil-water gradient in a semi-arid rangeland, over a 7-year period (1999/2000-2005/2006). Rangeland artificially maintained in three different conditions (good, moderate arid poor) was regularly sampled. Roots were cored bimonthly to a depth of 1200 mm at 50 mm intervals arid separated from the soil by wet sieving. Generally root distribution increased with depth for rangeland in good condition when soil-water content decreased, with the reverse being true for degraded rangeland. The rangelands in good and moderate conditions showed an increase in root mass with depth at about 75 mill, regardless of soil-water availability. Above- arid belowground phytomass production increased linearly over the growing season (September to April) with increasing soil-water content arid this effect was enhanced as rangeland condition improved from Poor through moderate arid good. Sufficient plant-available water in spring is important for optimal aboveground production in rangeland in good condition, while high soil-water is important for optimal autumnal aboveground growth in degraded rangeland. In the dormant period (May to August) root die back Occurred with increasing soil-water content. Regardless of rangeland condition, higher soil-water content increased the ratio of belowground to aboveground production. Water was used more efficiently with ail increase in soil-water content, regardless of rangeland condition, but was always lower for the poor condition rangeland. This is of the few information where soil-water instead of rainfall was used in regressions to estimate above- arid belowground production Of semi-arid rangelands. Maintaining rangeland in good condition ensures greater utilization of plant-available water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The deviation of the sample N-15 proportion from that of atmosphere (delta N-15) was similar in non-legumes Cordia alliodora, Posoqueria latifolia, Rollinia pittieri, and T. cacao. Deep-rooted Hieronyma alchorneoides had lower delta N-15 than other non-N-2-fixers, which probably reflected uptake from a partially different soil N pool. Gliricidia sepium had low delta N-15. Inga edulis had high delta N-15 in leaves and branches but low in stem and coarse roots. The percentage of N fixed from atmosphere out of total tree N (%N-f) in G. sepium varied 56-74%; N-2 fixation was more active in July (the rainiest season) than in March (the relatively dry season). The variation of delta N-15 between organs in I. edulis was probably associated to N-15 fractionation in leaves. Stem and coarse root delta N-15 was assumed to reflect the actual ratio of N-2 fixation to soil N uptake; stem-based estimates of %N-f in I. edulis were 48-63%. Theobroma cacao below I. edulis had lower delta N-15 than T. cacao below mixed-species shade, which may indicate direct N transfer from I. edulis to T. cacao but results so far were inconclusive. Further research should address the N-15 fractionation in the studied species for improving the accuracy of the N transfer estimates. The delta N-15 appeared to vary according to ecophysiological characteristics of the trees.","[Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Leblanc, Humberto A.] EARTH Univ, San Jose 44421000, Costa Rica","Nygren, P (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.nygren@helsinki.fi,,,,,,42,19,19,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

I. cylindrica was introduced 1 year after the following treatments were established: a control with no native species, five monocultures, a grass mix treatment, a forb mix treatment, and a 3-species treatment and a 5-species treatment. Monthly cover, final biomass, root length, root length density (RLD) and specific root length (SRL) of all species were determined for one full growing season. There was a significant negative linear relationship between the cover of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.59, P = 0.01) and a negative logarithmic relationship between the biomass of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.70, P = 0.003). There was no diversity-invasibility relationship. Grasses proved to be the most resistant functional group providing resistance alone and in mixed functional communities. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that treatments including Andropogon virginicus were the most resistant to invasion over time (P < 0.001). Significantly greater root length (P = 0.002), RLD (P = 0.011) and SRL (P < 0.001) than all of the native species and I. cylindrica in monocultures and in mixed communities made A. virginicus successful. The root morphology characteristics allowed it to be a great competitor belowground where I. cylindrica was most aggressive. The results suggest that species identity could be more important than species or functional richness in determining community resistance to invasion.","[Daneshgar, Pedram] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Jose, Shibu] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Daneshgar, P (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",pedram@iastate.edu; sjose@ufl.edu,,,,,,44,13,14,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

One reason for this is that current methods that measure N availability do not account for the rapid exchange of resources between roots and their closely associated microbial communities. In this paper, we review the tight interactions between roots and microbes and discuss why ignoring the significance of these interactions has led to unrepresentative estimates of N availability in intact plant communities and an incomplete understanding of the environmental factors that control plant-available N. We also explain why current standard methods to measure soil N availability do not account for important rhizospheric processes.

Aboveground and total biomass production increased with increasing plant species richness while belowground production remained constant. Root to shoot biomass production ratios (R/S) in mixtures were lower than expected from monoculture performance of the species present in the mixtures, showing that interactions among species led to reduced biomass partitioning to belowground organs. This change in partitioning to belowground organs was not confined to mixtures with legumes, but also measured in mixtures without legumes, and correlated with aboveground overyielding in mixtures. It is suggested that species-rich communities invest less in belowground biomass than do monocultures to extract soil resources, thus leading to increased investment into aboveground organs and overyielding.","[Bessler, Holger; Engels, Christof] Humboldt Univ, Inst Plant Nutr, Landwirtschaftlich Gartner Fak, FG Pflanzenernahrung & Dungung, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Temperton, Vicky M.; Roscher, Christiane; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07749 Jena, Germany; [Temperton, Vicky M.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Phytosphere Inst ICG3, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07749 Jena, Germany","Engels, C (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Plant Nutr, Landwirtschaftlich Gartner Fak, FG Pflanzenernahrung & Dungung, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",christof.engels@agrar.hu-berlin.de,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Temperton, Vicky/0000-0003-0543-4521","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 456, En 342/7]; Swiss Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31-65224.01]","The Jena Experiment is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FOR 456).

LINK,"In natural grassland ecosystems, root-feeding nematodes and insects are the dominant below-ground herbivores. In coastal foredunes, the ectoparasitic nematode Tylenchorhynchus ventralis would be a major root herbivore if not strongly controlled by soil microorganisms. Here, we examined if the suppressive effects of the microbial enemies of T. ventralis act by local interactions such as predation, parasitism or antagonism, or local induction of plant defence, or by non-local interactions, such as systemic effects when microorganisms in one section of the plant roots can affect nematode control in another section of the root system. We show that abundance of T. ventralis in the root zone of the grass Ammophila arenaria is suppressed by local interactions. We compared local vs. non-local control of nematodes by a natural community of soil microorganisms in a split-root experiment, where nematodes and microbes were inoculated to the same, or to opposite root compartments. The split-root experiment revealed that microorganisms affected T. ventralis numbers only when present in the same root compartment. Therefore, the effects of microorganisms on T. ventralis are due to local interactions and not due to induction of a systemic defence mechanism in the plant host. When inoculated together with microorganisms, the nematodes were heavily infected with unknown bacteria and with fungi that resembled the genus Catenaria, suggesting that microorganisms control nematodes through parasitism. However, local defence induction cannot be completely excluded. Besides microbial enemies of nematodes, the root zone of A. arenaria also contains plant pathogens. Root biomass was reduced by nematode infection, but also by the combination of nematodes and microorganisms, most likely because the soil pathogens overwhelmed the effects of nematode control on plant production. We conclude that there may be a trade-off between beneficial effects of soil microorganisms on the plant host due to nematode control vs. pathogenic effects of soil microorganisms on the plant host. We propose that such trade-offs require more attention when studying below-ground multitrophic interactions.","[Piskiewicz, Anna M.; Duyts, Henk; van der Putten, Wim H.] Ctr Terr Ecol, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, NL-6666 GA Heteren, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, NL-6709 PD Wageningen, Netherlands","Piskiewicz, AM (reprint author), Ctr Terr Ecol, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, Boterhoeksestr 48, NL-6666 GA Heteren, Netherlands.",a.piskiewicz@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [HPRN-CT 2002 00210],"Authors thank Sofia Costa for useful comments on this study.

The effects of these phenylcarboxylic acids on root growth and cell cycle progression were examined in germinated seeds of cucumber. All 12 phenylcarboxylic acids (0.25 mM) tested significantly inhibited cucumber radicle growth, and cinnamic acid exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. At 6 h after exposure to the acids, transcript levels of the cell cycle-related genes, including two cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and four cyclins were reduced. Among them, transcript of CycB, a marker gene for mitosis showed a remarkable reduction. The temporal analysis showed that expression of mitotic genes (CDKB, CycA, and CycB) were reduced throughout the experiment, while the reduction of the other genes (CDKA, CycD3;1, and CycD3;2) were observed only at earlier time points. At 48 h after treatment with benzoic and cinnamic acids, an enhancement of endoreduplication was observed. Further time course analysis indicated that endoreduplication started as early as 6 h after exposure to cinnamic acid. These results provide evidence that exposure to benzoic and cinnamic acids can induce rapid and dramatic down-regulation of cell cycle-related genes, thus leading to root growth inhibition. Meanwhile, the block of mitosis caused by phenylcarboxylic acids also induced an increased level of endoreduplication.","[Zhang, Yun; Gu, Min; Xia, Xiaojian; Shi, Kai; Zhou, Yanhong; Yu, Jingquan] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Hort, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jingquan] Agr Minist China, Key Lab Hort Plants Growth Dev & Biotechnol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Yu, JQ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Hort, Huajiachi Campus,Kaixuan Rd 268, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jqyu@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB11900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40571083, 3050344, 30671428]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2009CB11900), National Natural Science Foundation of China (40571083; 3050344; 30671428) and PhD Program of MOE.",,63,14,21,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Does this interaction influence their population dynamics? A semiarid coastal sand dune system in southeast Spain. For 3 years we monitored physiological status, growth and reproductive effort of Juniperus phoenicea and Pistacia lentiscus, the dominant shrub species, growing either alone or in close spatial association. We also recorded adult mortality patterns and characterized seedling survival, soil properties and microclimate conditions beneath canopies and in bare ground. There was a strong bi-directional interaction between the two studied species, with a net balance that changed in sign with increasing plant development. While mature individuals facilitated the establishment of seedlings of both species, adult mortality patterns suggested asymmetric competition at later life stages. The interaction with Pistacia negatively affected growth of juniper and contributed to its high mortality rates, while juniper had almost no effect on mature Pistacia individuals. Physiological data suggested that Pistacia had a competitive advantage over juniper, most likely because of differences in rooting patterns and tolerance to salinity, which may determine the source of water available for each species. Community dynamics are governed by facilitation at the seedling stage and shaped by differences in physiological traits in adult plants. Plant-plant interactions, which are strongly affected by environmental gradients, are important drivers of community dynamics in this system.","[Armas, Cristina; Pugnaire, Francisco, I] CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Armas, C (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, C Gen Segura 1, E-04001 Almeria, Spain.",cris@eeza.csic.es; fip@eeza.csic.es,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Kulik, Cristina Armas/A-1128-2012","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Kulik, Cristina Armas/0000-0003-0356-8075","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [RNM2001-1544/GLO]; I3P CSICConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)","We thank the Junta de Andalucia environmental department, and particularly Juan Carlos Nevado, for funding and support.

We examined the existence of an invasive phenotype in the herbaceous perennial Artemisia vulgaris, a frequent invader of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US. Populations from both the native (European) and the introduced (North American) ranges were grown in intra-specific competition (same population), inter-specific competition with the native perennial herb Solidago canadensis, and alone in a common garden to quantify shifts in resource allocation and neighbor effects on performance and competitive ability. Without competition, introduced A. vulgaris populations were much shorter than native populations, but germinated earlier, produced more ramets, more belowground and total biomass, and maintained higher root-to-shoot ratios. Under inter- and intra-specific competitions, introduced A. vulgaris populations were shorter, but produced more ramets, belowground, and total biomass than native populations. S. canadensis belowground and total biomass were more highly suppressed by introduced than native A. vulgaris. Our data suggest that since the introduction to North America, A. vulgaris has evolved a more competitive invasive phenotype characterized by many short ramets with more extensive root/rhizome networks. This rapid evolutionary shift likely benefits A. vulgaris in its introduced range by allowing establishment and subsequent dominance in dense stands of existing vegetation.","[Barney, Jacob N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Whitlow, Thomas H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [DiTommaso, Antonio] Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Barney, JN (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbarney@ucdavis.edu,"Barney, Jacob/C-2412-2008","Barney, Jacob/0000-0003-2949-5003; DiTommaso, Antonio/0000-0001-8215-2777",Andrew W.

Carr. and Pinus sylvestris (L). We analysed the monoterpene content of green needles, needle litter, F (fermentation) layer material and roots collected from monoculture plots. The rate of loss of monoterpenes from freshly fallen litter in the field was also studied at two monthly intervals over 10 months, to assess the length of time that monoterpenes entering the litter layer remain. Monoterpene analysis was carried out by extracting homogenised samples in hexane and identifying and quantifying the resulting monoterpenes using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Mean total monoterpene concentrations varied significantly between the three species examined (e.g. in freshly fallen litter 1531 +/- 96, 100 +/- 5 and 1175 +/- 122 mu g g(-1) d. wt for P. abies, P. sitchensis and P. sylvestris); each species had distinctive and consistent monoterpene profiles associated with each type of tissue, and total monoterpene concentrations in green needles varied between individual trees of the same species, particularly for P. sitchensis. A substantial proportion of the monoterpene content of green needles remained in the needles after litter fall for P. abies (42%), P. sitchensis (11%) and P. sylvestris (30%). Although rates of monoterpene loss from needle litters varied initially (P sylvestris > P. abies > P. sitchensis), the majority of the monoterpene content was lost after 4-6 months. Maximum monoterpene emission rates from decaying litter were calculated of 39 (P abies), 1.7 (P. sitchensis) and 39 mu g m(-2) h(-1) (P. sylvestris). Monoterpene concentrations in F layer material were very low (<10 mu g g(-1) d. wt). Roots, particularly in P. sylvestris, represented a significant pool of monoterpenes (185 +/- 16, P. abies; 258 +/- 54, P. sitchensis; 2133 +/- 200 mu g g(-1) d. wt, P. sylvestris). The monoterpene profile was similar between roots and litter of P. sylvestris (a-pinene most abundant), and for P. sitchensis, (limonene and a-pinene most abundant), although a different pattern was observed between needle litter (most abundant beta-pinene) and roots (most abundant myrcene) of P abies. The relatively high concentrations and different profiles of monoterpenes characterised in upper organic soil horizons here emphasise the need for their influence on soil ecological processes to be assessed.

In a Free Air CO2 Enrichment Experiment at the alpine treeline, we estimated the contribution of C-13-depleted recent plant C to DOC of mor-type organic layers. In an additional laboratory soil column study with 40 leaching cycles, we traced the fate of C-13-labelled litter-DOC (22 and 45 mg l(-1)) in intact Oa horizons at 2 and 15 degrees C. Results of the field study showed that DOC in the Oa horizon at 5 cm depth contained only 20 +/- 3% of less than six-year-old C, indicating minor contributions of throughfall, root exudates, and fresh litter to leached DOC. In the soil column experiment, there was a sustained DOC leaching from native soil organic matter. Less than 10% of totally added litter-DOC was leached despite a rapid breakthrough of a bromide tracer (50 +/- 7% within two days). Biodegradation contributed only partly to the DOC removal with 18-30% of added litter-DOC being mineralized in the Oa horizons at 2 and 15 degrees C, respectively. This was substantially less than the potential 70%-biodegradability of the litter-DOC itself, which indicates a stabilization of litter-DOC in the Oa horizon. In summary, our results give evidence on an apparent 'exchange' of DOC in thick organic layers with litter-DOC being retained and 'replaced' by 'older' DOC leached from the large pool of indigenous soil organic matter.

Although it has been shown that plant productivity and stability are dependent on the composition and functionalities of soil microbial communities, more particularly on the abundance and diversity of soil symbiotic micro-organisms (mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia), the impact of tree introduction on soil microbiota has been scarcely studied. This research has been carried in a field plantation of Acacia holosericea (Australian Acacia species) inoculated or not with an ectomycorrhizal fungus isolate, Pisolithus albus IR100. After 7 year's plantation, the diversity and the symbiotic properties of Bradyrhizobia isolated from the plantation soil or from the surrounding area (Faidherbia albida (Del.) a. Chev. parkland) and able to nodulate E albida, a native Sahelian Acacia species, have been studied. Results clearly showed that A. holosericea modified the structure of Bradyrhizobia populations and their effectiveness on F albida growth. This negative effect was counterbalanced by the introduction of an ectomycorrhizal fungus, P albus, on A. holosericea root systems. In conclusion, this study shows that exotic plant species can drastically affect genotypic and symbiotic effectiveness of native Bradyrhizobia populations that could limit the natural regeneration of endemic plant species such as E albida.

A total of 107 ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified from 969 independently sampled root tips by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA. Forty, 59 and 51 species were identified in three pine and spruce forests. Within all sites only about 25% of the species overlapped between the limed and the reference areas. However, the most abundant species were often found in both limed and reference plots and 60-70% of the root tips at each site were colonised by species occurring in both limed and reference plots. Across all three sites, fungal species belonging to the genus Tylospora and the order Pezizales became significantly more frequent in limed plots, while species belonging to the genera Russula and Lactarius decreased in frequency. At individual sites, several species within the genera Amphinema, Piloderma, Inocybe and Hygrophorus were also significantly influenced by liming. We estimate that, at the root tip level, about 30% of the roots were colonised by a different fungal species as a consequence of liming. The observed shift in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities was related to an increased pH and base saturation with liming. We conclude that even a moderate level of liming have long lasting effects on belowground ectomycorrhizal community composition. We discuss the observed community changes in relation to ectomycorrhizal functionality and biodiversity in limed forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Mechanical reinforcement by poplar root systems aids slope stabilisation, particularly when the roots are anchored into the fragipan or underlying rock. Total root length, mass and distribution of coarse roots (a parts per thousand yen2 mm diameter) were determined for three Populus deltoides x nigra 'Veronese' trees in their 12th growing season after being planted as 3 m poles at upper slope (TU), mid-slope (TM) and lower slope (TL) positions on an erodible hillslope near Palmerston North in the southern North Island. Most of the roots were distributed in the top 40 cm of soil. Depth of penetration of vertical roots was dependent on slope position and limited by the available depth of the soil above a fragipan (0.35 m at the upper slope to 1.4 m at the lower slope). Roots penetrated the fragipan at the upper slope position where the soil depth was shallowest, and at the mid-slope, but not the lower slope position. Total coarse root length was 287.9 m for TU, 1,131.3 m for TM and 1,611.3 m for TL, and total coarse root dry mass (excluding root crown) was 8.15 kg for TU, 38.77 kg for TM and 81.35 kg for TL.","[McIvor, I.

In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, seasonally dry tropical forests are subject to frequent fire, and early-successional stands are extremely dense. We applied vegetation thinning (removal of all stems < 2 cm in diameter) to hasten secondary succession and open the understory to reduce the fire ladder in an 11-yr-old stand. We quantified the effect of vegetation thinning on above- and belowground carbon over 5 yr. Aboveground carbon included all standing vegetation and belowground carbon included fine roots and organic carbon in the Oi, Oe, and Oa soil horizons. Trees with diameter of 2-10 cm and > 10 cm had higher carbon accumulation rates in thinned plots than in control plots. Carbon stored in the Oi-horizon and the Oe > 2 mm fraction remained significantly higher in thinned plots even 5 yr after treatment. Carbon in fine roots was significantly higher in thinned plots, and radiocarbon (C-14) data suggest that fine roots in thinned plots were recently produced in comparison with fine roots in control plots. We did not find significant differences in total ecosystem carbon after 5 yr (126 +/- 6 and 136 +/- 8 Mg C/ha, respectively). These results suggest rapid carbon recovery and support the hypothesis that young tropical forests thinned to hasten succession and reduce the fire hazard may have only a short-term negative impact on carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils.","[Vargas, Rodrigo; Allen, Edith B.; Allen, Michael F.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Vargas, R (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rvargas@nature.berkeley.edu,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008","Vargas, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6829-5333","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-061542, DEB 9981607]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); University of California Institute for Mexico","We are grateful for help from El EdEn Ecological Reserve to establish the study plots and for technical assistance.

Rhizosphere processes, such as the production and release of organic acids, contribute to differences in properties between rhizosphere (R) and nonrhizosphere (NR) soils. We compared the organic acid composition/concentrations in the R and NR soil extracts of Picea glauca and Abies lasiocarpa, and in the root exudates of the same tree species. We also evaluated the chemical properties and mineral composition of the soil samples. Higher concentrations of organic acids were observed in R than in NR soils with aliphatic acids predominating in both soil extracts and root exudates. Acetic, formic, and protocatechuic acids were the predominant aliphatic and aromatic organic acids in R and NR soil extracts. Several organic acids in R soil extracts were not detected in NR soil extracts, with the reverse being true as well. Malonic and oxalic acids were predominant in the root exudates of both plant species. The total organic acid concentration was higher in P. glauca than in A. lasiocarpa. Glutaric and isocitric acids were found only in A. lasiocarpa, while gluconic, succinic, and protocatechuic acids were exclusive to P. glauca. Acetic and formic acids were detected in all R soil extracts, but not in root exudates. Glutaric acid (in P. glauca) and gluconic/succinic acids (A. lasiocarpa) were undetectable in root exudates, but were present in the corresponding R soil extracts. Soil pH was lower in the R than NR soil of P. glauca. Cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable Ca(2+) and K(+) were higher in R than in NR soils except for the A. lasiocarpa LFH horizon. Chlorite, mica, kaolinite, and vermiculite were detected in all soil samples. Smectite was detected more frequently in R than NR soils. Our results suggest that high amounts of organic acids might have played a significant role in the transformation of mica and chlorite into smectite in R soils.","[Tuason, Melissa Marie S.; Arocena, Joselito M.] Univ No British Columbia, Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Arocena, Joselito M.] Univ No British Columbia, Canada Res Chair Soil & Environm Sci, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada","Tuason, MMS (reprint author), Univ No British Columbia, Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",,,,Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,We would like to thank Colin Chisholm for his assistance during the collection of soil samples.

We measured the effect of elevated soil temperatures on mycorrhizal function and on the response of both plant and fungal symbionts, using fungal inoculum isolated from either high-temperature thermal or nonthermal grassland soils. Our source for thermal soils was Yellowstone National Park, USA, where plants experience rooting zone temperatures of 45 degrees C or more. In the greenhouse, we grew three plant species (Dichanthelium lanuginosum, Agrostis scabra, and Mimulus guttatus) with three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) treatments (no AMF, nonthermal AMF, thermal AMF) and two soil temperatures (ambient, elevated). Biomass of the facultative thermal plants Agrostis scabra and Mimulus guttatus decreased by 50% in elevated-temperature soils, and AMF had no effect on measured plant traits. In contrast, the biomass and total root length of the obligate thermal plant Dichanthelium lanuginosum were greater at elevated soil temperatures, but only when mycorrhizal. Both mycorrhizal colonization levels and length of extraradical hyphae (ERH) increased with soil temperature across all host species. The source of the AMF inoculum, on the other hand, did not affect colonization level, ERH length, host plant biomass, or flowering for all host species in either temperature treatment, suggesting that AMF from thermal soils are not specifically adapted to higher temperatures. In the field we collected soil cores to measure in situ depth distributions of D. lanuginosum roots and ERH, and to determine which AMF species were active in plants growing in thermal soils. Roots were limited to soils with an average temperature <= 30 degrees C, while ERH existed in the hottest soils we sampled, averaging 35 degrees C. Molecular analyses of roots indicated that thermal AMF communities were composed of both generalist and possibly unique fungal species. The increase in host plant allocation to AMF, apparent lack of temperature adaptation by AMF, and differential host response to AMF suggest that AMF could be significant drivers of plant community response to increased soil temperature associated with global change.","[Bunn, Rebecca; Zabinski, Catherine] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark","Zabinski, C (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",cathyz@montana.edu,,,The Montana Space Grant Consortium; Thermal Biology Institute; American Association of University Women,"We thank Ann McCauley, Tracy McCreery, Karin Neff, Brian Eckenrod, Karla Sartor, Tamara Sperber, Dirk Redecker, Susan Appoloni, and Remy Jurie-Joly for invaluable assistance with this project.

We utilized a wide gradient in AMF abundance, obtained through long-term (17 and 6 years) large-scale field manipulations. Burning and N-fertilization increased soil AMF hyphae, glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) pools and water-stable macroaggregates while fungicide applications reduced AMF hyphae, GRSP and water-stable macroaggregates. We found that AMF abundance was a surprisingly dominant factor explaining the vast majority of variability in soil aggregation. This experimental field study, involving long-term diverse management practices of native multispecies prairie communities, invariably showed a close positive correlation between AMF hyphal abundance and soil aggregation, and C and N sequestration. This highly significant linear correlation suggests there are serious consequences to the loss of AMF from ecosystems.","[Wilson, Gail W.

This vegetation Occurs in altitudes higher than 1000 in and is one of the most endangered biomes of the world. This study aimed to restore an area of rupestrian field used to keep iron-ore products, in which vegetation had been cut and thus resilience did not occur, worsening the low fertility of the fragile soil. Therefore, a revegetation model was proposed using two native species, Centrosema coriaceum (Leguminosae) and Tibouchina multiflora (Melastomataceae), inoculated with selected strains of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and/or a rhizobium strain. After 48 months of plantation, the plant growth, survival index, physical and chemical soil properties, leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), and P soil were evaluated. Inoculated plants benefited in all the analyzed aspects. While T multiflora presented increased P content in leaves and soil rhizosphere only in inoculated plants, C coriaceum showed the highest P content in both leaves and soil independently of inoculation. Although the inoculated plants presented more intense root colonization (AMF), the same mycorrhizal species were found in both inoculated and non-inoculated plants of C. coriaceum and T multiflora. However, species of the Gigasporaceae family were favored in the C coriaceum rhizosphere, as compared with T multiflora. In addition, C coriaceum was able to select in its rhizosphere a rhizobia strain efficient in P solubilization and a large and efficient population of phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms (PSM), preferentially composed of fungi. Through the similarity of their Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequences, the PSM fungi were identified as Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus fischeri using the BLAST database. The data presented suggest that C. coriaceum showed a strong rhizosphere effect in favor of a tripartite action of rhizobia, fungi and AMF Populations as strategies to solubilize soil phosphate for survival and plant growth in the rupestrian field. Therefore, the inoculation of these microorganisms is desirable for mine recover. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The mixed forest was a weak carbon sink (net ecosystem exchange, -44 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and it became a large carbon source (569 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) after clearcutting. However, the large emission in the harvest year rapidly decreased in the following 2 years (495 and 153 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) as the gross primary production (GPP) increased, while the total ecosystem respiration (RE) remained relatively stable. The rapid increase in GPP was attributed to an increase in biomass and photosynthetic activity of Sasa dwarf bamboo, an understory species. Soil respiration increased in the 3 years following clearcutting, in the first year mainly owing to the change in the gap ratio of the forest, and in the following years because of increased root respiration by the bamboo. The ratio of soil respiration to RE increased from 44% in the forest to nearly 100% after clearcutting, and aboveground parts of the vegetation contributed little to the RE although the respiration chamber measurements showed heterogeneous soil condition after clearcutting.","[Takagi, Kentaro; Kayama, Masazumi; Nomura, Mutsumi; Hojyo, Hajime; Sugata, Sadao; Shibata, Hideaki; Akibayashi, Yukio; Koike, Takayoshi; Sasa, Kaichiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan; [Fukuzawa, Karibu] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Nayoro, Hokkaido 0960071, Japan; [Liang, Naishen; Takahashi, Yoshiyuki; Nakaji, Tatsuro; Oguma, Hiroyuki; Fujinuma, Yasumi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Fukazawa, Tatsuya] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Mano, Masayoshi] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Agrometeorol Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; [Murayama, Takeshi] Hokkaido Elect Power Co Inc, Dept Res & Dev, Ebetsu, Hokkaido 0670033, Japan","Takagi, K (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.",kentt@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp,"__, _____/A-6650-2012; Koike, Takayoshi/A-5204-2012; Liang, Naishen/H-8284-2018; Shibata, Hideaki/N-9974-2019; Takagi, Kentaro/C-2222-2012; Shibata, Hideaki/A-6909-2008","Shibata, Hideaki/0000-0002-8968-3594","Hokkaido University; National Institute for Environmental Studies; Hokkaido Electric Power Co; Global Environment Research Fund [B-073]; Ministry of the EnvironmentMinistry of the Environment, Japan [13760109, 18710002]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Teshio Experimental Forest","We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

We hypothesized that a tannin-rich, ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) plant promotes the retention of protein-tannin N in soil, and that this N source is accessible to saprotrophic ERM symbionts and their hosts, but remains less available to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbionts and their hosts. We tested this feedback hypothesis in a southern Appalachian forest community composed of two microsites: a hardwood microsite with ECM and AM trees in the overstorey and understorey, and an AM herb layer; and a rhododendron microsite where the understorey and herb layer are replaced by ERM rhododendron. We synthesized N-15-enriched protein-tannin complexes from leaf litter extracts representing each forest microsite and examined the fate of N-15 in soil volumes 3 months and 1 year after the complexes were placed in the field. Protein-tannin complexes derived from the rhododendron microsite led to a higher retention of N-15 in soil organic matter and a lower recovery in dissolved N pools than those from the hardwood microsite, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron tannins create stable complexes that increase organic N retention in soils. Rhododendron complexes led to greater N-15-enrichment in ERM roots than in AM and ECM roots, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron can better access the N complexed by its own litter tannins than can co-occurring forest trees and plants. Our results suggest that both fungal saprotrophy and a high specific root length contribute to the ability of ERM roots to acquire N from complex organic sources. Synthesis. This study provides evidence of an intricate N feedback where plant litter chemistry influences the cycle of N to maximize N acquisition by the host's mycorrhizal roots, while hindering N acquisition by mycorrhizal roots of co-occurring plants. Feedback processes such as these have the potential to drive patterns in nitrogen cycling and productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems.","[Wurzburger, Nina; Hendrick, Ronald L.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Wurzburger, N (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",nwurzbur@princeton.edu,,,Coweeta Long-Term Ecological Research Site [DEB-0218001]; University of Georgia D.

Disturbances events are complex, often affecting multiple environmental parameters simultaneously and causing selective removal of biomass. For this reason, observational studies often fail to elucidate the primary mechanism by which disturbance modifies assembly structure. This is particularly true of microbial systems where reduction in biomass or removal of competitive dominants is not visually obvious. Fire is a major disturbance in pinaceous forests, which are characterized by ectomycorrhizal fungal root associations. To determine the specific mechanisms through which this disturbance affects ectomycorrhizal communities, we experimentally simulated the effects of fire by growing seedlings in field soil exposed to factorial combinations of soil heating and ash addition. Ectomycorrhizal colonists in each of the treatments were then identified from seedling roots using DNA sequences. Both soil heating and ash addition caused changes to the soil chemical environment and altered the fungal assemblages found on seedling roots. The effect on the ectomycorrhizal assembly was most pronounced from soil heating, which caused an overall simplification and increasing dominance by a few taxa with ruderal life-history strategies. We also conducted a follow-up experiment to see whether selective mortality of ectomycorrhizal spores might contribute to these patterns. Heat exposure had strong negative effects on all species tested. However, spore heat tolerance was highest for the species that showed the greatest increase in abundance on seedlings grown in heated soils. Synthesis. Fire alters below-ground communities through changes in soil chemistry and mortality of resident organisms. Our results show that soil heating and selective mortality are key mechanisms determining post-fire assemblage structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These disturbances favour competitively inferior species and may help maintain diversity of ectomycorrhizal assemblages at the landscape scale.","[Peay, Kabir G.; Garbelotto, Matteo; Bruns, Thomas D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bruns, Thomas D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Peay, KG (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kpeay@nature.berkeley.edu,,"Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412","NASA Earth Systems Science Fellowship; Chang Tien Lin Environmental Scholarship; Pacific Coast Science and Learning Center; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 236096, DEB 0742868]","We thank Wayne Sousa, Alison Forrestel, Rachel Linzer and Katy Hayden for helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript, and Point Reyes National Seashore for supporting our research efforts there.

The AM fungal community colonizing G. struthium was investigated from the morphological and molecular points of view. All plants were well colonized and showed a high level of infective AM propagules. Roots were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism screening, and sequence analyses of the ribosomal DNA small subunit region. Four AM fungal types were identified and clustered into the AM fungal family: Glomeraceae, Glomus being the only taxon present. One fungal type was present in all the selected areas. Two fungal types are distinct from any previously published sequences and could be specific to gypsum soils.

This has been explained by discrimination against the heavier isotope during decomposition or by the accumulation of N-15-enriched microbial biomass versus plant biomass in older SOM. In particular, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi have been suggested to accumulate in old SOM since this group is among the most N-15-enriched components of the microbial community. In the present study we investigated the microbial community in soil samples along a chronosequence (7,800 years) of sites undergoing isostatic rebound in northern Sweden. The composition of the microbial community was analyzed and related to the delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotope values of the SOM in soil profiles. A significant change in the composition of the microbial community was found during the first 2,000 years, and this was positively related to an increase in the delta N-15 values of the E and B horizons in the mineral soil. The proportion of fungal phospholipid fatty acids increased with time in the chronosequence and was positively related to the N-15 enrichment of the SOM. The increase in delta C-13 in the SOM was much less than the increase in delta N-15, and delta C-13 values in the mineral soil were only weakly related to soil age. The C:N ratio and the pH of the soil were important factors determining the composition of the microbial community. We suggest that the N being transported from the soil to aboveground tissue by EM fungi is a driver for N-15 enrichment of soil profiles.","[Wallander, Hakan] Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Morth, Carl-Magnus] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol & Geochem, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Giesler, Reiner] Umea Univ, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-98107 Abisko, Sweden","Wallander, H (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",Hakan.Wallander@mbioekol.lu.se,,,"Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Research Council for the Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas","The study was supported by a grant from the Carl Trygger Foundation and from the Swedish Research Council for the Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas).",,64,25,25,4,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2009,160,1,,,,,87,96,,10.1007/s00442-008-1270-0,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,431YK,WOS:000265100500009,19169713,,,,10/31/19J,"Shim, JH; Pendall, E; Morgan, JA; Ojima, DS",,,,"Shim, Jee H.; Pendall, Elise; Morgan, Jack A.; Ojima, Dennis S.",,,Wetting and drying cycles drive variations in the stable carbon isotope ratio of respired carbon dioxide in semi-arid grassland,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon cycle; Carbon isotope; Isotope partitioning; Plant functional type; Precipitation pulses,ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION; SHORTGRASS STEPPE; PRECIPITATION PULSES; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; WATER RELATIONS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL-WATER; DELTA-C-13; FLUXES; EXCHANGE,"In semi-arid regions, where plants using both C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways are common, the stable C isotope ratio (delta C-13) of ecosystem respiration (delta C-13(R)) is strongly variable seasonally and inter-annually. Improved understanding of physiological and environmental controls over these variations will improve C cycle models that rely on the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2. We hypothesized that timing of precipitation events and antecedent moisture interact with activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses to determine net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and delta C-13(R). Field measurements included CO2 and delta C-13 fluxes from the whole ecosystem and from patches of different plant communities, biomass and delta C-13 of plants and soils over the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons. NEE shifted from C source to sink in response to rainfall events, but this shift occurred after a time lag of up to 2 weeks if a dry period preceded the rainfall. The seasonal average of delta C-13(R) was higher in 2000 (-16aEuro degrees) than 2001 (20aEuro degrees), probably due to drier conditions during the 2000 growing season (79.7 mm of precipitation from April up to and including July) than in 2001 (189 mm). During moist conditions, delta C-13 averaged -22aEuro degrees from C-3 patches, -16aEuro degrees from C-4 patches, and -19aEuro degrees from mixed C-3 and C-4 patches. However, during dry conditions the apparent spatial differences were not obvious, suggesting reduced autotrophic activity in C-4 grasses with shallow rooting depth, soon after the onset of dry conditions. Air and soil temperatures were negatively correlated with delta C-13(R); vapor pressure deficit was a poor predictor of delta C-13(R), in contrast to more mesic ecosystems. Responses of respiration components to precipitation pulses were explained by differences in soil moisture thresholds between C-3 and C-4 species. Stable isotopic composition of respiration in semi-arid ecosystems is more temporally and spatially variable than in mesic ecosystems owing to dynamic aspects of pulse precipitation episodes and biological drivers.","[Pendall, Elise] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pendall, Elise] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Shim, Jee H.; Ojima, Dennis S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Shim, Jee H.; Ojima, Dennis S.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Morgan, Jack A.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Pendall, E (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",Pendall@uwyo.edu,"Ojima, Dennis/C-5272-2016","Pendall, Elise/0000-0002-1651-8969","National Science Foundation (NSF)-IRCNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-9977066 001, NSF NNGO4GH63G]; Biological and Environmental Research Program; U.

Spatial patterns of AM fungi, glomalin and soil enzyme activities were investigated in five plots located in the Mu Us sandland, northwestern China. Soils to 50 cm depth in the rhizosphere of Astragalus adsurgens Pall. were sampled. The study demonstrated that A. adsurgens Pall. could form strong symbiotic relationships with AM fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal status and distributions were significantly different among the five studied plots. Correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that spore density was significantly and positively correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC), soil acid phosphatase and to two Brad ford-reactive soil protein (BRSP) fractions (P < 0.01). Colonization of arbuscules and vesicles were positively correlated with protease activity. The BRSP fractions were also significantly and positively correlated to eclaphic factors (e.g. SOC, available nitrogen, and Olsen phosphorus) and soil enzymes (e.g. soil urease and acid phosphatase). The means of total BRSP and easily extractable BRSP were 0.95 mg g(-1) and 0.5 mg g(-1) in all data, respectively. The levels of BRSP in the desert soil were little lower than those in native and arable soils, but the ratios of BRSP to SOC were much higher than farmland soils. The results of this study support the conclusion that glomalin could be an appropriate index related to the level of soil fertility, especially in desert soil. Moreover, AM fungal colonizations and glomalin might be useful to monitor desertification and soil degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth rates of B. luridus and S. bovinus were significantly higher than that of S. luteus at the same NaCl level; the biomass yields of three ECM fungal species were different, S. bovinus < S. luteus < B. luridus. Of the three species, B. luridus exhibited the highest growth rates, best biomass yield, and greatest Na(+) concentration in the mycelia over the NaCl gradient tested, indicating B. luridus has the most tolerance to NaCl stress and assimilation to Na(+) under salt stress. The growth rate of S. luteus was the lowest, but the biomass yield and Na(+) concentration in the mycelia were only lower than those of B. luridus. S. bovinus was the most sensitive to NaCl stress and its growth rate was faster than that of S. luteus, but the biomass yield and Na+ concentration in the mycelia were the lowest.

The respiration rates of fine roots (<5 mm) were significantly higher than those of coarse roots (>5 mm) for both A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla species. The root respiration of A. crossicarpa showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher value in the wet season. For E. urophylla, the seasonal pattern was observed for fine roots but not for coarse roots. After determining the biomass of fine roots and coarse roots and their specific rates of respiration at different time points, root respiration at the stand level (R.) was estimated using a direct up-scaling model. We found that the R-a accounted for 14% and 19% of total soil respiration (R-s) for A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla, respectively. The fine (R-Tf) and coarse (R-Tc) root respiration at the stand level accounted for about 47% and 53% of the R-a for A. crassicarpa, and accounted for 58% and 42% for E. urophylla. This suggests that coarse root respiration cannot be ignored when estimating the root respiration at the stand level. Our results showed that the Q(10) values were more accurate in representing the temperature dependence when the confounding effect of soil moisture was considered. This study introduces an alternative approach to estimate stand level root respiration, but its reliability is largely dependent on the accuracy of root biomass quantification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Models of stomatal control fitted to field data therefore suffer from ambiguous parameter identification, with multiple acceptable (i.e., nearly optimal) model structures emphasizing different moisture status indicators and different processes. In an effort to minimize these correlations and improve parameter and process identification, we conducted an irrigation experiment on red maples (Acer rubrum L.) at Harvard Forest (summers of 2005 and 2006). Control and irrigated trees experienced similar radiative and boundary layer forcings, but different soil moisture status, and thus presumably different diurnal cycles of internal leaf water potential. Measured soil moisture and atmospheric forcing were used to drive a transient tree hydraulic model that incorporated a Jarvis-type leaf conductance in a Penman-Monteith framework with a Cowan-type (resistance and capacitance) tree hydraulic representation. The leaf conductance model included dependence on both leaf matric potential, psi(L) (so-called feedback control) and on vapor pressure deficit, D (so-called feedforward control). Model parameters were estimated by minimizing the error between predicted and measured sap flow. The whole-tree irrigation treatment had the effect of elevating measured transpiration during summer dry-downs, demonstrating the limiting effect that subsurface resistance may have on transpiration during these times of moisture stress. From the best fitted model, we infer that during dry downs, moisture stress manifests itself in an increase of soil resistance with a resulting decrease in psi(L), leading to both feedforward and feedback controls in the control trees, but only feedforward control for the irrigated set. increases in the sum-of-squares error when individual model components were disabled allow us to reject the following three null hypotheses: (1) the f(D) stress is statistically insignificant (p = 0.01): (2) the f(psi(L)) stress is statistically insignificant (p = 0.07): and (3) plant storage capacitance is independent of moisture status (p = 0.07).

The impact of rangeland degradation on root production, root/shoot ratio and water-use efficiency was therefore determined for a semi-arid rangeland, over a 7-year period (1999/00 to 2005/06 growing seasons). Water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the quantity of above- and/or belowground phytomass produced over a certain period of time per unit of water evapotranspired. Sampling was from rangeland artificially maintained in three different rangeland conditions, viz. good, moderate and poor. As much as 86, 89 and 94% of the roots for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively, occurred at a depth of less than 300 mm. Root mass was strongly seasonal with the most active growth taking place during March and April. Root mass appears to be greater than aboveground phytomass for this semi-arid area, with an increase in roots in relation to aboveground phytomass production with rangeland degradation. The mean monthly root/shoot ratios for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions were 1.16, 1.11 and 1.37, respectively. Rangeland degradation significantly lowered above- and belowground phytomass production as well as the water-use efficiency. The mean WUE (root production included) were 4.79, 3.54 and 2.47 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively. These water-use efficiency observations are among the few also including root production in its calculation. As a proportion of annual phytomass, litter fall of 7.17. 4.64 and 3.41% was obtained for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively. Increasing rangeland degradation increased the replacement of total root system by about 10 months and decomposition time of litter by 6 months. The importance of a well-established root system for sustainable production in the semi-arid rangelands cannot be overemphasized. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

While most previous work has examined how escape from specialist enemies has influenced herbivore or pathogen resistance of exotic species, post-introduction shifts in exotic dependence on mutualists have not been considered. In a common environment, we compared dependence on AM fungi of North American and European populations of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), a forb native to Europe. Introduced North American populations responded less to inoculation with AM fungi than did European populations. Root architecture was strongly correlated with mycorrhizal response, and introduced populations had finer root architecture than native populations. Finally, introduced populations exhibited decreased root and increased reproductive allocation relative to European populations, consistent with a transition to a weedier life history; however, biomass allocation patterns were uncorrelated with mycorrhizal response. These findings are the first demonstration of a genetically based reduction of mycorrhizal dependence and shift in root architecture in an introduced species.","[Seifert, Elizabeth K.; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jbever@indiana.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0049080, DEB-0616891, DEB-0318719]","Our manuscript was improved by comments of H.

Darwin's naturalization hypothesis suggests that phylogenetic relatedness should be a critical factor governing such feedbacks in invaded communities but is rarely considered in soil feedback studies. We investigated the effects of soil biota from experimentally established native and invaded California grassland communities on resource capture and allocation of three native and three exotic grass species, comprising three tribes, grown in the laboratory. Phylogeny was the single greatest determinant of grass biomass, root : shoot ratio, and growth rate, with presence of soil biota explaining the second greatest proportion of variance in total grass biomass. Similar trends were observed in soil collected from naturally occurring stands of native perennial and exotic annual grasses. Species of similar life history/provenance exhibited similar biomass responses to the same soil community, while more closely related species exhibited similar root : shoot ratio responses to the same soil community. Relationships between the plant community composition of a field plot and species responses to soil inoculum collected from that field plot were idiosyncratic, with many aspects of plant community structure potentially contributing to soil feedbacks. Thus, future studies should explicitly consider both phylogeny and provenance and evaluate soil feedbacks in a community setting.","[Brandt, Angela J.; Seabloom, Eric W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Hosseini, Parviez R.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Brandt, AJ (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",brandtan@science.oregonstate.edu,"Brandt, Angela/V-5514-2019; Hosseini, Parviez/F-8439-2010","Brandt, Angela/0000-0001-5980-9128; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259",Andrew W.

Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that interactions among above- and belowground communities may mediate ecosystem responses to global change. We used grassland mesocosms to manipulate the abundance of one important group of soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and to study community and ecosystem responses to CO2 and N enrichment. Responses of plants, AM fungi, phospholipid fatty acids and community-level physiological profiles were measured after two growing seasons. Ecosystem responses were examined by measuring net primary production (NPP), evapotranspiration, total soil organic matter (SOM), and extractable mineral N. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the causal relationships among treatments and response variables. We found that while CO2 and N tended to directly impact ecosystem functions (evapotranspiration and NPP, respectively), AM fungi indirectly impacted ecosystem functions by influencing the community composition of plants and other root fungi, soil fungi and soil bacteria. We found that the mycotrophic status of the dominant plant species in the mesocosms determined whether the presence of AM fungi increased or decreased NPP. Mycotrophic grasses dominated the mesocosm communities during the first growing season, and the mycorrhizal treatments had the highest NPP. In contrast, nonmycotrophic forbs were dominant during the second growing season and the mycorrhizal treatments had the lowest NPP. The composition of the plant community strongly influenced soil N, and the community composition of soil organisms strongly influenced SOM accumulation in the mesocosms. These results show how linkages between above- and belowground communities can determine ecosystem responses to global change.","[Antoninka, Anita; Wolf, Julie E.; Bowker, Matthew; Classen, Aimee T.; Johnson, Nancy Collins] No Arizona Univ, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Wolf, Julie E.] USDA, Dept Mycol, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Oak Ridge Labs, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wolf, Julie E.] USDA, Microbiol Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Antoninka, A (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",aja6@nau.edu,"Antoninka, Anita/I-8664-2019; wolf, julie/I-6829-2012; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; wolf, julie/O-5357-2019; Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019","Antoninka, Anita/0000-0001-6583-9892; wolf, julie/0000-0002-1437-982X; Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; wolf, julie/0000-0002-1437-982X; ","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0316136, DEB-9806529]; Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-02ER63366]","This research was funded by National Science Foundation grants to NCJ: DEB-0316136, DEB-9806529.

Using an inadvertent, whole-ecosystem radiocarbon ((14)C) release in a temperate deciduous oak forest and numerical modeling, we estimated that the mean age of stored C used to grow both leaf buds and new roots is 0.7 years and about 55% of new-root growth annually comes from stored C. Therefore, the calculated mean age of C used to grow new-root tissue is similar to 0.4 years. In short, new roots contain a lot of stored C but it is young in age. Additionally, the type of structure used to model stored C input is important. Model structures that did not include storage, or that assumed stored and new C mixed well (within root or shoot tissues) before being used for root growth, did not fit the data nearly as well as when a distinct storage pool was used. Consistent with these whole-ecosystem labeling results, the mean age of C in new-root tissues determined using 'bomb-(14)C' in three additional forest sites in North America and Europe (one deciduous, two coniferous) was less than 1-2 years. The effect of stored reserves on estimated ages of fine roots is unlikely to be large in most natural abundance isotope studies. However, models of root C dynamics should take stored reserves into account, particularly for pulse-labeling studies and fast-cycling roots (< 1 years).","[Gaudinski, J. B.; Torn, M. S.; Riley, W.

This opened up an opportunity for studies that compare the interannual variability in tree growth with eddy covariance-based net ecosystem production (NEP). A possible link between multiyear biometric-based net primary production (NPP) and eddy covariance-based NEP was investigated to determine the contribution of autotrophic production and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to the interannual variability of NEP in deciduous forest ecosystems. We also defined the NEP(*) as the measurable organic matter stored in an ecosystem during the interval in which soil respiration (SR) measurements were taken. The difference of biometric-based NEP(*) from eddy covariance-based NEP within a given year varied between 55% and 105%. Woody tissue NPP (stems and coarse roots) varied markedly from 0.88 to 1.96 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the 8-year study period (1999-2006). Annual woody tissue NPP was positively correlated with eddy covariance-based NEP (r(2)=0.52, P < 0.05). However, neither foliage NPP (r(2)=0.03) nor HR (r(2)=0.06) were correlated with eddy covariance-based NEP. Therefore, it was hypothesized that interannual variability in the ecosystem carbon exchange was directly responsible for much of the interannual variation in autotrophic production, especially carbon accumulation in the woody components of the ecosystem. Moreover, similar interannual variations of biometric-based NEP(*) and eddy covariance-based NEP with small variations in SR and foliage NPP suggest a constant net accumulation of carbon in nonliving pools at the Takayama site.","[Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki] Gifu Univ, Inst Basin Ecosyst Studies, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Saigusa, Nobuko] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan; [Koizumi, Hiroshi] Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Dept Biol, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628480, Japan","Ohtsuka, T (reprint author), Gifu Univ, Inst Basin Ecosyst Studies, 1-1 Yanagito, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",toshi@green.gifu-u.ac.jp,", _______/V-6687-2019; Saigusa, Nobuko/I-4695-2018",", _______/0000-0002-9032-7933; ","Ministry of EnvironmentMinistry of the Environment, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We acknowledge the Takayama Forest Research Station of the Institute for Basin Ecosystem Studies, Gifu University, for facilities support.

The abilities of ozone-treated KLs in reducing aluminum toxicity and accelerating root elongation increased markedly by saponification. Furthermore, KL treated with 0.1 M NaOH at room temperature overnight also effectively reduced aluminum toxicity and accelerated root elongation.

To estimate biomass from minirhizotron data, a conversion factor for length to biomass must be developed, and assumptions regarding depth of view must be made. In a scrub-oak ecosystem in central Florida, USA, root length density (RLD) was monitored for 10 years in a CO2 manipulation experiment using minirhizotron tubes. In the seventh year of the study, soil cores were removed from both ambient and elevated CO2 chambers. Roots from those cores were used to determine specific root length values (m/g) that were applied to the long-term RLD data for an estimation of root biomass over 10 years of CO2 manipulation. Root length and biomass estimated from minirhizotron data were comparable to determinations from soil cores, suggesting that the minirhizotron biomass model is valid. Biomass estimates from minirhizotrons indicate the < 0.25 mm diameter roots accounted for nearly 95% of the total root length in 2002. The long-term trends for this smallest size class (< 0.25 mm diameter) mirrored the RLD trends closely, particularly in relation to suspected root closure in this system. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect specific root length as determined by the soil cores. A significant treatment effect indicated smallest diameter fine roots (< 0.25 mm) were greater under elevated CO2 during the early years of the study and the largest (2-10 mm) had greater biomass under elevated CO2 during the later years of the study. Overall, this method permits long-term analysis of the effects of elevated CO2 on fine root biomass accumulation and provides essential information for carbon models.","[Stover, Daniel B.] Earthwatch Inst, N Amer Reg Climate Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Brown, Alisha L.

However, the exact contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to soil isotopic patterns remains unknown. in this study, we compared C-13 and N-15 patterns of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), which includes a main fraction derived from AMF, litter, and bulk soil in four temperate rainforests. GRSP was an abundant C and N pool in these forest soils, showing significant C-13 and N-15 enrichment relative to litter and bulk soil. Hence, cumulative accumulation of recalcitrant AMF turnover products in the soil profile likely contributes to C-13 and N-15 enrichment in forest soils. Further research on the relationship between GRSP and AMF should clarify the exact extent of this process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing nodules systemically suppress subsequent nodule formation, a phenomenon known as autoregulation. Grafting experiments revealed that some forms of autoregulation are controlled by the shoot. In the present study, we examined shoot-controlled regulation of AM fungal colonization using a reciprocal grafting technique. Ten-day-old seedlings of wild-type soybean cv. Enrei and its hypernodulating mutant En6500 were cut below the cotyledons and the shoots were grafted to self or reciprocal roots. Grafted seedlings were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Gigaspora rosea and grown in a glasshouse for 60 days. The arbuscule abundance of the En6500 (shoot)/En6500(root) graft was 1.5-fold higher than that of the Enrei/Enrei graft. In grafts between Enrei and En6500, an increased arbuscule abundance was detected only when En6500 was used as the shoot. The arbuscule abundance of Enrei/En6500 when Enrei was used as the shoot was comparable to that of Enrei/Enrei. The intensity of AM fungal colonization was lower in Enrei/En6500 than in the other grafting treatments. From the results obtained, we suggest that soybean shoots systemically control arbuscule formation in both AM symbiosis and nodule formation.","[Sakamoto, Kazunori; Nohara, Yoshihisa] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Chiba 2718510, Japan","Sakamoto, K (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",ksakamoto@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"SAKAMOTO, Kazunori/R-8750-2019; Sakamoto, Kazunori/R-8728-2019","Sakamoto, Kazunori/0000-0002-8817-814X","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16380046, 18380047]","We are grateful to Dr Motoki Takahashi, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences, for providing the seed material.

Heterogeneity of soil was produced inside 150 cm depth pots, by applying manual compaction or enriching different soil layers with NH4 (vertical heterogeneity) and, by splitting the root system into two columns with differing soil bulk density or NH4 conditions (horizontal heterogeneity). Root distribution patterns were assessed by collecting roots within layers, each 10 cm depth, and by recording both the fine (diameter <2 mm) and the coarse (diameter >= 2 mm) root biomass. Root systems significantly responded to the vertical gradients of soil bulk density, decreasing their maximum depth and showing lower values of fine root densities at the layers with a dry bulk density of 1.62 Mg m(-3). The split-root system showed that maximum rooting depth of the axis with a dry bulk density of 1.38 Mg m(-3) was limited by the reduced rooting depth of the adjacent more compacted axis. Root systems were less dense in the NH4 Soil treatment than in the control soil treatment (34 mg dm(-3) vs. 212 mg dm(-3)), even at the lowest rate used (0.1 g NH4 L-soil(-1)). This high sensitivity to NH4 conducted to a significant decrease of shoot height and root depth (50 and 43%, respectively). The split-root system showed that unfavourable conditions of NH4 content have local consequences on the rooting depth and systemic consequences on the fine root density. The implications of root growth restrictions for Q. ilex natural regeneration, seedling survival, and decline are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Five provenances were used: Mtao, Gokwe, Nyazura, Chesa (Zimbabwe) and Kapirimposhi (Zambia). Two weeks after germination, seedlings were inoculated with mycorrhizal inoculum and raised in a glasshouse. Height and collar diameter were measured at one, three and five months of age (before stem dieback), and at 14 months (after stem dieback). At the time of dieback, percentage of seedlings losing leaves, stem dieback and mortality were recorded; numbers of new shoots produced in the recovery period were also determined. To further assess growth, leaf, stem and root dry biomass were measured after stem dieback at 14 months. At one month, Chesa seedlings were the tallest and Kapirimposhi seedlings were significantly shorter (p < 0.05) than the rest of the provenances. However, at three and five months of height growth no significant differences were observed. At one month, diameter growth was significantly different with the Kapirimposhi provenance having the smallest diameter (p < 0.05). At three and five months of seedling growth only the Gokwe provenance was significantly different from the rest of the provenances. By seven months of age, stem dieback was observed and foliage loss was over 60% in each of the five provenances. At 14 months of seedling growth after stem dieback the Nyazura and Kapirimposhi provenances were significantly shorter, whereas there were no significant differences in diameter growth and dry biomass from root, stem, leaf or root: shoot dry biomass ratio. Fourteen months after germination new shoots emerged from various axillary bud positions depending on the extent of dieback.","[Chisha-Kasumu, E.; Woodward, S.; Price, A.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 5UA, Scotland","Woodward, S (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Cruickshank Bldg,St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 5UA, Scotland.",s.woodward@abdn.ac.uk,"Price, Adam/A-2465-2010",,,,,41,1,1,0,0,NATL INQUIRY SERVICES CENTRE PTY LTD,GRAHAMSTOWN,"19 WORCESTER STREET, PO BOX 377, GRAHAMSTOWN 6140, SOUTH AFRICA",2070-2620,2070-2639,,SOUTH FORESTS,South.

We analyzed the influence of stand density on its mechanical and biological stability, diversity and biomass of understory plants and microclimate conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, light, etc.). Higher stand density results in higher Susceptibility to wind and snow damage, due to changes in height to diameter ratio (tree slenderness). The mechanical stability of stands may be promoted by silvicultural activities such as light thinning applied before growth stagnation. In addition, the reduction of stand density during stand development may increase biomass allocation to coarse roots that stabilize trees in the soil. High tree density may increase stand susceptibility to pathogens and insects and thus increase tree mortality. Trees growing at higher density (with higher intraspecific competition) may allocate less assimilates for defense against herbivorous insects and pathogens. The effect of tree density on stability of multi-species stands is inconclusive, since such studies were only occasionally undertaken. Since tree density influences light conditions (mainly before canopy closure), there is a negative relationship between stand density and herbaceous species diversity and biomass. Based on the published data, We Summarized consequences of silviculture at different stand densities and proposed future directions of research needed to fill the gaps in current knowledge. Understanding the long-term ecological consequences of variable stand densities is essential for development of sustainable and stable forest ecosystems.","[Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.; Oleksyn, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy, Zaklad Ochrony Lasu, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Jagodzinski, AM (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Ul Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",amj@man.poznan.pl; oleks001@umn.edu,"Oleksyn, Jacek/I-4539-2012",,,,,119,15,15,0,31,POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO LESNE,WARSZAWA,"KOMITET REDAKCYJNY SYLWANA, UL BITWY WARSZAWSKIEJ 1920 R NR 3, WARSZAWA, PL-02 362, POLAND",0039-7660,,,SYLWAN,Sylwan,APR,2009,153,4,,,,,219,230,,,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,484ZO,WOS:000269090100001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Makita, N; Hirano, Y; Dannoura, M; Kominami, Y; Mizoguchi, T; Ishii, H; Kanazawa, Y",,,,"Makita, Naoki; Hirano, Yasuhiro; Dannoura, Masako; Kominami, Yuji; Mizoguchi, Takeo; Ishii, Hiroaki; Kanazawa, Yoichi",,,Fine root morphological traits determine variation in root respiration of Quercus serrata,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,closed static chamber system; immediate field measurements; mean root diameter; root Co(2) efflux; specific root length,CLONAL EUCALYPTUS STANDS; BROAD-LEAVED FOREST; BELOW-GROUND CARBON; NORWAY SPRUCE; SOIL RESPIRATION; HARDWOOD FOREST; LOBLOLLY-PINE; SUGAR MAPLE; LIFE-SPAN; CO2 FLUX,"Fine root respiration is a significant component of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Although fine roots differ functionally from coarse roots, these root types have been distinguished based on arbitrary diameter cut-offs (e.g., 2 or 5 mm). Fine root morphology is directly related to physiological function, but few attempts have been made to understand the relationships between morphology and respiration of fine roots. To examine relationships between respiration rates and morphological traits of fine roots (0.15-1.4 mm in diameter) of mature Quercus serrata Murr., we measured respiration of small fine root segments in the field with a portable closed static chamber system. We found a significant power relationship between mean root diameter and respiration rate. Respiration rates of roots < 0.4 mm in mean diameter were high and variable, ranging from 3.8 to 11.3 nmol CO(2)g(-1)s(-1), compared with those of larger diameter roots (0.4-1.4 mm), which ranged from 1.8 to 3.0 nmol CO(2)g(-1)s(-1). Fine root respiration rate was positively correlated with specific root length (SRL) as well as with root nitrogen (N) concentration. For roots < 0.4 mm in diameter, SRL had a wider range (11.3-80.4 mg(-1)) and was more strongly correlated with respiration rate than diameter. Our results indicate that a more detailed classification of fine roots < 2.0 mm is needed to represent the heterogeneity of root respiration and to evaluate root biomass and root morphological traits.","[Makita, Naoki; Dannoura, Masako; Ishii, Hiroaki; Kanazawa, Yoichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro; Kominami, Yuji; Mizoguchi, Takeo] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Makita, N (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",makita_701@yahoo.co.jp,"makita, naoki/D-2473-2012; Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014",,,,,43,44,58,0,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2009,29,4,,,,,579,585,,10.1093/treephys/tpn050,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,442OI,WOS:000265850100011,19203981,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Ghani, MA; Stokes, A; Fourcaud, T",,,,"Ghani, Murad Abd.; Stokes, Alexia; Fourcaud, Thierry",,,The effect of root architecture and root loss through trenching on the anchorage of tropical urban trees (Eugenia grandis Wight),TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,Biomechanics; Anchorage rotational stiffness; Critical turning moment; Mechanical stability; Acclimation; Root eccentricity,PINUS-PINASTER AIT.; SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE; MECHANICAL STABILITY; SOIL-CONDITIONS; SCOTS PINE; GROWTH; SPRUCE,"Eugenia grandis (Wight) is grown in urban environments throughout Malaysia and root systems are often damaged through trenching for the laying down of roads and utilities. We investigated the effect of root cutting through trenching on the biomechanics of mature E. grandis. The force necessary to winch trees 0.2 m from the vertical was measured. Trenches were then dug at different distances (1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 m) from the trunk on the tension side of groups of trees. Each tree was winched sideways again and the uprooting force recorded. No trenches were made in a control group of trees which were winched until failure occurred. Critical turning moment (TMcrit) and tree anchorage rotational stiffness (TARS) before and after trenching were calculated. Root systems were extracted for architectural analysis and relationships between architectural parameters and TMcrit and TARS were investigated. No differences were found between TMcrit and trenching distance. However, in control trees and trees with roots cut at 1.5 m, significant relationships did exist between both TMcrit and TARS with stem dimensions, rooting depth and root plate size. TARS was significantly decreased when roots were cut at 0.5 m only. Surprisingly, no relationships existed between TMcrit and TARS with any root system parameter when trenching was carried out at 0.5 or 1.0 m. Our study showed that in terms of TARS and TMcrit, mechanical stability was not greatly affected by trenching, probably because rooting depth close to the trunk was a major component of anchorage.","[Ghani, Murad Abd.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Design & Architecture, Dept Landscape Architecture, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Stokes, Alexia] INRA, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Fourcaud, Thierry] CIRAD, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Ghani, Murad Abd.] Univ Bordeaux 1, INRA, CNRS, UMR US2B, F-33400 Talence, France","Ghani, MA (reprint author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Design & Architecture, Dept Landscape Architecture, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",muradupm@yahoo.co.uk; alexia.stokes@cirad.fr; fourcaud@cirad.fr,,"stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911",City Hall of Kuala Lumpur; Malaysian government; University Putra Malaysia,"We are grateful to the City Hall of Kuala Lumpur for permission to work at the study site and the support given during the study, especially to Zarina Ahamad Osman, Khairul Azlan Hj.

Most of the return flux to the atmosphere is through soil respiration, which has two major sources, one heterotrophic (organisms decomposing organic matter) and one autotrophic (roots, mycorrhizal fungi and other root-associated microbes dependent on recent photosynthate). We used tree-girdling to stop the flow of photosynthate to the belowground system, hence, blocking autotrophic soil activity in a 120-yr-old boreal Picea abies forest. We found that at the end of the summer, two months after girdling, the treatment had reduced soil respiration by up to 53%. This figure adds to a growing body of evidence indicating (t-test, d.f. = 7, p < 0.05) that autotrophic respiration may contribute more to total soil respiration in boreal (mean 53 +/- 2%) as compared to temperate forests (mean 44 +/- 3%). Our data also suggests that there is a seasonal hysteresis in the response of total soil respiration to changes in temperature. We propose that this reflects seasonality in the tree below-ground carbon allocation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The fertilizer, manure and control plots were established in the grassland, and carbon budgets were estimated for 2 years using an ecological technique. In the manure plot, beef cattle manure was applied at the rate of 43-44 Mg fresh matter ha(-1) year(-1), and a supplement of chemical fertilizer was also added to equalize the application rate of mineral nitrogen (N) to that of the fertilizer plots (164-184 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was significantly larger in the fertilizer and manure plots than in the control plot. The belowground biomass indicated no distinct seasonal change; therefore the belowground net primary production (BNPP) was supposed to be zero. The CO(2) fluxes from soil surface including roots in the fertilizer, manure and control plots were higher in spring (beginning of March-end of June) than in other seasons (beginning of July-end of February) at the same soil temperature, while the relationship between CO(2) flux and soil temperature in the root-excluded plot was well explained by a single exponential regression throughout the study period. This suggests that there might be an increment of root respiration (RR) or heterotrophic respiration of litter (RHI) produced by fine roots (which means BNPP = RHI). Heterotrophic respiration of soil (RHs) ranged from 3.7 to 4.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Heterotrophic respiration of manure (RHm) accounted for 41% in the added carbon in manure for 2 years. Finally, the net ecosystem production (NEP) in this study was estimated as ANPP-RHs-RHm. The annual NEP were 2.6 and 1.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the fertilizer plot, -1.6 and -1.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the manure plot, and -1.1 and -0.8 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for the control plot in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The annual net biome production (NBP) in the fertilizer and control plots ranged from -3.9 to -2.9 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), suggesting the loss of carbon in the field. On the other hand, NBP in the manure plot was 0.3 and 0.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in 2005 and 2006, respectively. These results indicate that manure application is necessary to prevent carbon loss in the managed grassland. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By the fifth year soil moisture depletion/recharge pattern under the trees alone was similar to that under open pasture and under trees with pasture understoreys. Maximum plant available moisture storage was 207-223 mm in the top meter of this Templeton silt loam soil but only 69-104 mm at 1-2 m depth where coarse textures often predominated. Lucerne reduced soil moisture content (SMC) to lower levels during drier summers and extracted more water from 1 to 2 m depth than ryegrass/clover. Evapotranspiration (ET) during early summer when soil moisture was high was close to the Penman potential evapotranspiration (E (p) ), but the difference increased when SMC in the top meter dropped below 200 mm. The silvopasture treatments had higher ET in winter than pasture alone but this was still less than E (p) . Soil moisture deficits (SMD) at the end of each summer were sufficiently large to require slightly higher than normal winter rainfall and ET < E (p) to recharge the soil to field capacity before the next summer. The soil moisture results, taken together with root and growth data, suggest that trees and understorey pastures are complementary in the first three or four growing seasons but this balance subsequently declines in favor of the pine trees. Management options, to extend the period that understorey pastures are productive, include reducing tree stockings, more vigorous pruning, using competitive understoreys and changing from pines to deciduous trees. Research on new silvopastoral combinations is suggested.","[Pollock, K. M.; McKenzie, B.

Most of Texas is encroached by Prosopis glandulosa, but on the eastern Edwards Plateau, a limestone plateau with thin soils, P. glandulosa is rare and Juniperus ashei is dominant. We hypothesised that P. glandulosa is excluded from sites where bedrock at a depth of I m or less restricts the development of taproots, thus rendering this normally deep-rooted species too vulnerable to drought. To test this idea, we monitored the physiological status of the two species on a site where both species were encroaching and the soil was 1.5-2-5 m deep, thus relatively deep for the Edwards Plateau region but not for regions where P. glandulosa dominates. Data were collected across three tree size classes from May to November 2006. Stem water potentials were similar across species and water potentials and photosynthetic rates decreased with tree size. Based on isotopic evidence, the effective rooting depth of P. glandulosa increased with tree size, but not in J. ashei. P. glandulosa had a higher rate of leaf gas exchange overall as expected for a drought-avoider; except for large trees during a summer drought, when species differences in photosynthesis rates diminished and the stomatal conductance for J.ashei exceeded that of P. glandulosa. We speculate that restrictions of soil depth may limit the invasiveness of P. glandulosa in part through negative effects on large trees, which may lower fecundity.

SR(a) and SR(h) were distinguished underneath groups of beech and spruce trees using the root exclusion method. Seasonal courses of SR(a) and SR(h) were studied from 2002 to 2004, with the summer of 2003 being extraordinarily warm and dry in Central Europe. We (1) analyzed the soil temperature (T(s)) and moisture sensitivity of SR(a) and SR(h) underneath both tree species, and (2) examined whether drought caused differential decline of SR(a) between spruce and beech. Throughout the study period, SR(a) of beech accounted for 45-55% of SRt, independent of the soil water regime; in contrast, SR(a) was significantly reduced during drought in spruce, and amounted then to only 25% of SR(t). In parallel, fine-root production was decreased during 2003 by a factor of six in spruce (from 750 to 130 mg l(-1) a(-1)), but remained at levels similar to those in 2002 in beech (about 470 mg l(-1) a(-1)). This species-specific root response to drought was related to a stronger decline of SR(a) in spruce (by about 70%) compared to beech (by about 50%). The sensitivity of SR(a) and SR(h) to changing T(s) and available soil water was stronger in SR(a) than SR(h) in spruce, but not so in beech. It is concluded that SR(a) determines the effect of prolonged drought on the C efflux from soil to a larger extent in spruce than beech, having potential implications for respective forest types.","[Nikolova, Petia S.; Blaschke, Helmut; Matyssek, Rainer; Haeberle, Karl-Heinz] Tech Univ Munich, Weihenstephan Ctr Life & Food Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Raspe, Stephan] Bayer Landesanstalt Wald & Forstwirtschaft, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Andersen, Christian P.] US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Mainiero, Raphael] Univ Ulm, Inst Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Haberle, KH (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Weihenstephan Ctr Life & Food Sci, Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",haeberle@wzw.tum.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 607],"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding through SFB 607 ""Growth and Parasite Defence-Competition for Resources in Economic Plants from Agronomy and Forestry'' provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

There is still an essential lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between wood structure and hydraulic properties, especially of coarse roots. To this end, the study aimed (1) to work out a novel approach, based on the combination of computer tomography (CT) and light microscopy (LM), for determining the cumulative cross-sectional lumen area of conduits involved in the water transport of coarse roots in European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) and (2) to demonstrate its adequacy in quantifying the functional relationship between sapwood anatomy and ascending water mass flow in the xylem. The cross-sectional sapwood area of coarse roots was assessed through CT. The cumulative cross-sectional lumen area of conduits in the sapwood (i.e. the lumen area of conductive conduits) was measured by LM in combination with interactive image analysis. The new approach was developed with coarse roots of both the tree species growing in a 60-year-old mixed forest in Bavaria, Germany. The combination of the two methods unveiled spruce to possess a distinct sapwood/heartwood boundary in small-diameter roots, whereas such roots of beech reflected a gradual transition zone; only large-diameter roots displayed a distinct boundary in beech. Additionally, the cumulative lumen area of conductive conduits was found to be approximately 12% of the total coarse root cross-sectional area in both the tree species. The new approach of measuring the conductive lumen area of coarse-root conduits yielded levels of specific sap flow (i.e. axial conductivity) that substantially differed from those derived from commonly applied methods, which were based on sap flow per unit of total cross-sectional root area or xylem cross-sectional area of individual roots. The combination of CT and LM will facilitate functional comparisons of woody roots differing in diameter and of tree species of different anatomical xylem structure.","[Seifert, Thomas] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Nikolova, Petia S.; Blaschke, Helmut; Matyssek, Rainer] Tech Univ Munich, Weihenstephan Ctr Life & Food Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Yield Sci, Weihenstephan Ctr Life & Food Sci, D-85356 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Seifert, T (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Fac AgriSci, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",seifert@sun.ac.za,"Yang, Da/L-6267-2013; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019; Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014","Yang, Da/0000-0001-7306-3289; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Seifert, Thomas/0000-0002-9611-6272",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 607],"This research was accomplished within the framework of the collaborative research centre SFB 607 ""Growth and Parasite Defence'', funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The investigation was carried out by comparing existing stands that represent the four major stages of the envisaged conversion process. Major results are: (i) the number of Nematoda genera was highest at the species enrichment stage pointing to a positive influence of a rich ground vegetation on the diversity of Nematoda, (ii) predaceous species reached a particularly high, and omnivorous species having a particularly low, density at the species enrichment stage, and (iii) root-hair feeding Nematoda profited from qualitative changes of fine roots during the conversion process and gradually increased in abundance from the even-aged pure spruce stands to the diverse continuous cover forests. Altogether the comprehensive investigation of the Nematoda of the four conversion stages indicates that forest conversion only weakly alters the structure of the Nematoda community. Neither an overall change nor a clear trend in Nematoda richness and abundance could be established. However, due to the specific responses of the different Nematoda feeding groups to the conditions of the individual conversion stages it seems to be ecological useful to maintain special qualities of each conversion stage (e.g. forest gaps in the species enrichment stage) during forest conversion protecting the structure and diversity of the Nematoda communities.

Recent evidence suggests that both partner choice and sanctioning may play roles in preventing the invasion of less-beneficial rhizobia in legume-rhizobium mutualisms. The importance of these mechanisms in natural communities, however, remains unclear. We grew 12 Medicago truncatula maternal families with a mixture of three rhizobium strains from their native range for three plant generations and estimated the symbiotic benefits (nodule number and size) conferred to each rhizobium strain. In this experiment, the majority of M. truncatula genotypes formed more nodules with more beneficial rhizobium strains, providing evidence for adaptive partner choice. We also found that three generations of symbiosis resulted in an increase in the relative frequency of rhizobium strains that were most beneficial to plants-suggesting that partner choice affects rhizobium fitness. By contrast, we found no evidence that plants differentially rewarded rhizobia postnodulation via sanctioning leading to differences in nodule size. Taken together, our data suggest that plants have evolved to recognize beneficial rhizobial signals during the early stages of symbiosis, and that signaling between plants and rhizobia may be subject to coevolutionary pressures.","[Heath, Katy D.; Tiffin, Peter] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Heath, KD (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",katy.heath@utoronto.ca,,,NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0508305]; Bell Museum of Natural History,"We thank J.

Some of these species reduce water stress by rooting into moist bedrock crevices. A dominant woody plant (Juniperus ashei) and co-occurring xeric sedge (Carex planostachys) were green house-grown in growth tubes with or without water-blocking partial barriers in tubes with water added below the barrier (similar to 70 cm). Soil moisture at various depths was related to growth response (above- and below-ground biomass, root length, and number of root tips) per species. Barrier treatment yielded significantly drier soil than non-barrier. Juniperus plants were significantly smaller with barrier treatment, while Carex showed no significant differences between treatments. The results suggest the sedge is more able than the shrub to increase root production in the upper layers of the soil when faced with access restriction to lower layers. The sedge may resist drought by exploring sub-superficial soil layers. When access to sub-superficial water Sources is restricted, the shrub is more affected than the sedge. The plants' growth in water-restricted surface soil for several months suggests these species may not need deep water to survive. In fact seedling growth may differ in mature plants.

Non-native plants can alter both native microbe communities and ecosystem processes. These changes may indirectly affect native plant communities. We tested whether an invasive plant influences other plant species through above- and below-ground microbial associations. These factors have received less attention than direct competition for resources in research on plant invasions. 2. Previous work in the mid-western US revealed that the above-ground fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) in non-native tall fescue grass (Lolium arundinaceum) reduced establishment of native tree species, slowing plant succession from grassland to forest relative to communities lacking the symbiont. Here, we examined potential soil-mediated mechanisms underlying these negative impacts on trees. 3. We challenged nine tree species with soil conditioned by tall fescue grass either with (E+) or without (E-) the symbiotic endophyte. We collected field soil from replicated, experimental E+ and E-field plots, sterilized half to eliminate soil microbes, then conditioned the soil in the greenhouse with either E+ or E-tall fescue. Individual tree seeds received one of five soil treatments: E-live, E sterile, E+ live, E+ sterile, or no tall fescue conditioning (control). Tree survival and biomass were assessed after approximately 80 days. 4. Soil conditioning by E+ tall fescue reduced the biomass of three tree species (Elaeagnus umbellata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Platanus occidentalis) and the survival of P. occidentalis relative to conditioning by E-tall fescue. However, decreased biomass occurred only in live soil, suggesting indirect effects of the endophyte via altered soil microbes. In addition, two species (F. pennsylvanica, Prunus serotina) grew larger in both unconditioned soils and E-live soil relative to all other soil treatments, and two species (Ailanthus altissima, P. occidentalis) performed poorly in all soil treatments relative to unconditioned soil. Finally, three species did not significantly respond to any soil treatment (Acer negundo, Quercus palustris, Cercis canadensis). 5. Synthesis. Our results show that negative impacts of a non-native grass on native trees can depend on both above-and below-ground microbial associations. Because tree species responded divergently to soil conditioning, the endophyte symbiosis has the potential to alter plant succession and the future composition of forest communities.","[Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Orr, Samuel] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Rudgers, JA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jrudgers@rice.edu,,,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute CapstoneHoward Hughes Medical Institute; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-054278, DIB-0200485]","We thank Leslie Campbell, Keith Clay, Alissa Packer and Kurt Reinhart for comments that improved the manuscript.

After 5 days, Chime produced the greatest number of root axes (similar to 6) and Mehola significantly less (similar to 4) in all growing methods. Total root length was longest in GSH01915 and shortest in Mehola for all methods, but both total length and average root diameter were significantly larger for plants grown in gel chambers than those grown in soil. The ranking of particular growth traits (root number, root angular spread) of plants grown in gel plates, soil sacs and X-ray pots was similar, but plants grown in the gel chambers had a different order of ranking for root length to the soil-grown plants. Analysis of angles in soil-grown plants showed that Tadmore had the most even spread of individual roots and Chime had a propensity for non-uniform distribution and root clumping. The roots of Mehola were less well spread than the barley cultivars supporting the suggestion that wild and landrace barleys tend to have a narrower angular spread than modern cultivars.

However, use of this additional water by plants has limited experimental evidence. We applied a 16-mm summer water pulse (12% of mean annual precipitation) to two plant communities of the Patagonian steppe, and compared responses of three dominant species, which can be ordered by decreasing xerophytism and increasing rooting depth arid summer activity: 1) colapiche, evergreen dwarf shrub (Nassauvia glomerulosa [Lag.] Don); 2) coiron amargo, evergreen grass (Stipa speciosa Trin. et Rupr.); and 3) neneo, drought deciduous shrub (Mulinum spinosum [Cav.] Pers.). Shallow-rooted species (S. speciosa arid N. glomerulosa), which use water from dry soil layers, showed a greater leaf water potential response to watering than deep-rooted species (M. spinosum). Leaf water potential response was greater and quicker in xerophytic species than in mesophytic ones (N. glomerulosa > S. speciosa > M. spinosum). However, this response only translated into leaf conductance and transpiration responses for coiron amargo, probably because the species with winter phenological cycle (N. glomerulosa) is less able to utilize Summer water inputs than species with a summer phenological cycle (S. speciosa). The lick of response of deep-rooted M. spinosum in leaf conductance, transpiration, arid photosynthesis may have been due to the high leaf water potential of control plants. Instead, in S. speciosa and N. glomerulosa net photosynthesis decreased below zero following watering, suggesting the start of growth pulses. The complex chain of plant processes triggered by rainfall, arid the constraints imposed to different species by rooting depth, phenology, and xerophytism, could explain the frequent low response to both large rainfall events and above-average rainfall years in this arid community. Our results Suggest that, paradoxically, water may be suboptimally used at local scales in and rangeland ecosystems.","[Golluscio, Rodolfo A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Forrajicultura, IFEVA,CONICET,Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculada, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Golluscio, RA (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Forrajicultura, IFEVA,CONICET,Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculada, Av San Martin 4453, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",gollusci@ifeva.edu.ar,,"Perez Di Giorgio, Juliana/0000-0002-8959-5500","Experimental Field of Rio Mayo; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria.

Despite this importance, belowground dynamics of riparian plant species are not commonly investigated, in part because of difficulties of sampling in a belowground riparian environment. We investigated the field utility of a root-ingrowth sampling technique for measuring root production. We established four streamside sampling sites in southeastern Oregon, and randomly located four plots within each site. In each plot we established two 7.6-cm-diameter sand-filled ingrowth cores in September of 2004. In September of 2005 we harvested the cores with the use of a vacuum sampling technique in which a 5.1-cm-diameter camphored polyvinyl chloride casing was driven into the center of the root core and sand and root materials were suctioned out. Root-length density was determined by computer image analysis, and roots were dried and weighed to determine production by weight. Results indicate that root-length density averaged 7.2 (+/- 0.7) cm . cm(-3) across 2 sites and root-production index was 356.7 (+/- 20.6) g . m(-2). Our index to root production by weight was consistent with previous estimates of annual root production reported in the literature. Our sampling technique proved to be a practical solution for root sampling in riparian environments, and helps overcome some of the difficulties in sequential coring of saturated soils. Use of any ingrowth core technique to index root production can potentially bias production estimates because of the artificial, root-free environment of the core. However, these biases should be consistent across sites, making ingrowth cores useful for determining differences between manipulative treatments.","[Boyd, Chad S.; Svejcar, Tony J.] USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, Burns, OR 97720 USA","Boyd, CS (reprint author), USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, 67826 A Hwy 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",chad.boyd@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,14,3,3,0,0,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

The site history, soil properties, spores, seeds, stem fragments, mycorrhizae, species, populations, and other remnants may influence the composition of the replacement community or ecosystem to varying degrees. The remnants may also hold the site to a trajectory that has implications for ecological restoration. This is true in urban situations in particular where repeated disturbance has masked the history of the site. The ecological memory remaining may be insufficient for a site to heal itself; restoration activities are required to direct the future of the site. Conversely, in light of climate change and other rapidly changing environments, the existing ecological memory may be poorly suited to the new conditions and restoration projects need to create new and perhaps novel ecosystems. The loss of ecological memory facilitates the establishment of foreign invasive species. These invasives may eventually create a new stability domain with its own ecological memory and degree of resilience. To be successful, invasive species control must address both internal within patch memory of invasives and external between patch memory. Further research is necessary to document and conserve ecological memory for ecological restoration in response to future ecosystem changes.","Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Schaefer, V (reprint author), Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",schaefer@uvic.ca,,,,,,41,29,33,1,57,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

These disturbances alter the structure of the forest ecosystem and consequently its carbon budget. We analysed the role of fine root dynamics in the soil carbon budget of tropical moist forests in Southeast Asia along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.

In this paper we studied if ectomycorthizal (EcM) fungi can be involved in this upward transport via their extramatrical hyphae. We tested the use of gallium (Ga) as proxy for Al. Transport of Al through EcM hyphae was studied in vitro in a two-compartment Petri dish system. Two of the five fungal isolates tested transported Al. Using Ga instead of Al revealed the same trend in these systems, confirming the use of Ga as proxy for Al. Upward transport of Ga was studied in an artificial podzol. Pinus sylvestris seedlings were colonised by a natural community of EcM fungi from fresh forest soil. Gallium addition to the mineral soil led to increased Ga content in roots in the organic horizon and in the shoot. Upward Ga allocation was significantly higher when roots were excluded from the mineral soil by a mesh, only allowing fungal mycelium to grow through. We conclude that at least some EcM fungi transport Al and that Ga, and probably also Al, can be transported upwards by EcM fungal hyphae in a podzol system. These findings support the hypothesis that EcM fungi play a role in upward transport of Al in podzols.

LAI(max) was calculated from the carbohydrates reserve, which integrates past ecological conditions. Allocation coefficients to the various compartments were originally fixed constant in the basic version, with no temporal and spatial variation. In the improved version, these coefficients were modified spatially and temporally according to functional rules. Carbon allocation to fine roots was simulated by accounting for hydraulic constraints. An empirical model was developed to simulate allocation to reserves. Allocation to aboveground woody biomass was the residual; remaining carbon after allocation to reserves and fine roots. Then, this residual carbon was partitioned into stem diameter and height growth. The allocation model was tested on 20 stands of oak and beech in the Fontainebleau forest. The model reproduced wood growth and LAI(max) dynamics between 1994 and 1999. While the basic version of the model overestimated the growth (364 g cm(2) year(-1) vs. 261 g cm(2) year(-1)) and did not reproduced the growth variability well between sites (r = 0.4), the new version better reproduced the average level of growth (235 g cm(2) year(-1) vs. 261 g cm(2) year(-1)) and the variability (r = 0.64). That model also reproduced the decline of productivity with age and the processes leading to temporal variability in LAI, such as water stress in the previous year. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve forest stands were selected to investigate fine root biomass, morphology, and growth along a gradient of increasing forest conversion from near-natural forest to cacao agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Fine root biomass decreased markedly with increasing forest disturbance. Fine root growth rate showed a weak dependence on forest disturbance, whereas fine root turnover (growth per standing fine root biomass) was higher in the more heavily disturbed stands. Specific root area was higher in the stands with large timber extraction and fine root N concentration was particularly high in the cacao agroforests. These two root morphological traits were positively related to fine root turnover. We conclude that the higher growth activity of fine roots in the moderately and heavily disturbed forests resulted from differences in fine root morphology and N concentration, hence partly compensating for the decrease in fine root biomass with disturbance.

All mammals ate some fungus, but only bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) regularly did so, and their diet included most of the fungal taxa that we identified across all mammals in the study. The composition of bush rat diet changed significantly with each change in habitat from woodland, to forest, to rainforest. In particular, there was a significant difference in the diets of rats caught either side of the open forest-rainforest ecotone, which marks the change in fungal community from one dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi, to a community dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Movement patterns of bush rats living around the open forest-rainforest ecotone suggest that they transport fungal spores between these contrasting fungal communities.

Positive feedback dynamics are commonly observed in many invaded systems and have been suspected in California grasslands, where native plants associate strongly with soil mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In response to disturbance, invading nonnative plants proliferate, and to the degree these species associate weakly with soil mutualists, we would expect mutualist efficacy to degrade over time. Degraded mutualist efficacy would negatively impact mutualist-dependent native species or their recruitment following a disturbance. We investigated the feedback dynamics of soil conditioned both with native and nonnative herbaceous communities of southern California grasslands to test this degraded mutualist hypothesis. Using a mesocosm approach, we inoculated each community with live soil originating from a remnant native grassland and varied the plant communities (i.e., native or nonnative) along a plant-species-richness gradient. After one year, we then used this conditioned soil for reciprocal feedback tests on a native and nonnative indicator species. We show that a native herbaceous forb (Gnaphalium californicum) grows best in soil conditioned by a diverse mix of other native species that includes G. californicum but is inhibited by soil conditioned by a diverse mix of nonnative species. We also show that an invasive, nonnative herbaceous forb (Carduus pycnocephalus) exhibits strong growth in soil lacking arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and in soil conditioned by a diverse mix of nonnative species that include C. pycnocephalus, and that it is inhibited by the same soil that best promotes the native, G. californicum. Separate bioassays for mycorrhizal density show a reduction of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the nonnative-conditioned soil relative to the native-conditioned soil, which suggests that nonnative species do not promote the growth of mycorrhizal fungi in the same way that native species do. The growth patterns resulting from the vegetative history of these distinct soil communities provide evidence of a biotic feedback mechanism that may account for the maintenance of persistent communities of nonnative (and often invasive) plants ubiquitous throughout California grasslands.","[Vogelsang, Keith M.; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Vogelsang, KM (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kvogelsa@indiana.edu,,,Land Institute and the California Native Plant Society; California Department of Transportation,"This work was supported by awards from the Land Institute and the California Native Plant Society to K.

Why did the effect of diversity on productivity become so much stronger through time? Because our grassland system is N limited, we simultaneously measured critical variables associated with the storage and cycling of this element, such as plant and soil N pools, soil N availability, soil N mineralization rates, and plant N-use efficiency, as well as the initial soil N concentration of each diversity plot when the experiment was established in 1994. We used linear and multiple regression analyses to test for potential effects of these variables on aboveground productivity and to address whether and how such variables were in turn affected by plant species diversity and functional composition across years and also at different time intervals within the same year. We found that seven variables simultaneously controlled productivity: (1) initial total soil nitrogen (N) of each plot, (2) diversity-dependent increases in total soil N through time, ( 3) soil N mineralization rates, (4) soil nitrate (NO(3)(-)) utilization, (5) increases in plant N-use efficiency at greater plant diversity, (6) legume presence, and (7) higher species numbers. The surprising continued significance of higher plant diversity may occur because of its effects on seasonal capture of soil NO(3)(-) and moisture and on the accumulation of root-N pools, all of which may have also increased productivity through time at higher species numbers.","[Fornara, D.

Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are present in the Arctic and Antarctic to 82 degrees N and 63 degrees S, respectively, with fine endophyte being the dominant form of AM in roots at higher latitudes. Ecto- (ECM) and ericoid (ERM) mycorrhizas both occur in the Arctic to 79 degrees N, owing to the presence of species of Salix, Dryas, Vaccinium and Cassiope to this latitude. ECM and ERM are not present in Antarctic ecosystems, owing to an absence of suitable hosts. Arbutoid and orchid mycorrhizas are infrequent in the Arctic, whilst the latter are present at one location in the sub-Antarctic. Data from studies of AM, ECM and ERM colonisation along a latitudinal transect through the Arctic indicate that the frequency of plant species not colonised by mycorrhizas increases at higher latitudes, largely owing to an increase in non-mycorrhizal and a decrease in obligately mycorrhizal plant families at more northerly locations. A separate group of root- and rhizoid-associated fungi, the dark septate root endophytes (DSE), are widespread to 82 degrees N and 77 degrees S, and are apparently more frequent than mycorrhizal fungi in polar regions. The functions of DSE are largely unclear, but studies suggest beneficial effects on plant growth under defined conditions. We advocate further research into the effects of DSE on their host plants in polar regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.","[Newsham, K.

This meta-analysis estimated the magnitude of the impacts of current [O-3] and future [O-3] on the biomass, growth, physiology and biochemistry of trees representative of northern hemisphere forests. Current ambient [O-3] (40 ppb on average) significantly reduced the total biomass of trees by 7% compared with trees grown in charcoal-filtered (CF) controls, which approximate preindustrial [O-3]. Above- and belowground productivity were equally affected by ambient [O-3] in these studies. Elevated [O-3] of 64 ppb reduced total biomass by 11% compared with trees grown at ambient [O-3] while elevated [O-3] of 97 ppb reduced total biomass of trees by 17% compared with CF controls. The root-to-shoot ratio was significantly reduced by elevated [O-3] indicating greater sensitivity of root biomass to [O-3]. At elevated [O-3], trees had significant reductions in leaf area, Rubisco content and chlorophyll content which may underlie significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity. Trees also had lower transpiration rates, and were shorter in height and had reduced diameter when grown at elevated [O-3]. Further, at elevated [O-3], gymnosperms were significantly less sensitive than angiosperms. There were too few observations of the interaction of [O-3] with elevated [CO2] and drought to conclusively project how these climate change factors will alter tree responses to [O-3]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the carbon-sink strength of northern hemisphere forests is likely reduced by current [O-3] and will be further reduced in future if [O-3] rises. This implies that a key carbon sink currently offsetting a significant portion of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions could be diminished or lost in the future.","[Wittig, Victoria E.; Ainsworth, Elizabeth A.; Long, Stephen P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ainsworth, Elizabeth A.] USDA ARS, Photosynth Res Unit, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Naidu, Shawna L.] Univ Illinois, Mol & Cellular Biol Program, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Karnosky, David F.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Long, SP (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 190 ERML,1201 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",stevel@life.uiuc.edu,"Long, Stephen/AAA-1741-2019",,U.S. Department of Energy's Global Change Education ProgramUnited States Department of Energy (DOE),"The authors thank K.

The use of a high-density 16S rRNA microarray (PhyloChip) for bacterial and archaeal community analysis has allowed definition of the populations that respond to the root within the complex grassland soil community; this research accompanies compositional changes reported earlier, including increases in chitinase- and protease-specific activity, cell numbers and quorum sensing signal. PhyloChip results showed a significant change compared with bulk soil in relative abundance for 7% of the total rhizosphere microbial community (147 of 1917 taxa); the 7% response value was confirmed by16S rRNA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This PhyloChip-defined dynamic subset was comprised of taxa in 17 of the 44 phyla detected in all soil samples. Expected rhizosphere-competent phyla, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were well represented, as were less-well-documented rhizosphere colonizers including Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Nitrospira. Richness of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased in soil near the root tip compared with bulk soil, but then increased in older root zones. Quantitative PCR revealed rhizosphere abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria at about 10(8) copies of 16S rRNA genes per g soil, with Nitrospira having about 10(5) copies per g soil. This report demonstrates that changes in a relatively small subset of the soil microbial community are sufficient to produce substantial changes in functions observed earlier in progressively more mature rhizosphere zones.","[DeAngelis, Kristen M.; Brodie, Eoin L.; DeSantis, Todd Z.; Andersen, Gary L.; Firestone, Mary K.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Dept Ecol, Berkeley, CA USA; [DeAngelis, Kristen M.; Lindow, Steven E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Firestone, Mary K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Firestone, MK (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ecosyst Sci Policy & Management, 137 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mkfstone@nature.berkeley.edu,"Andersen, Gary/G-2792-2015; Brodie, Eoin L/A-7853-2008","Andersen, Gary/0000-0002-1618-9827; Brodie, Eoin L/0000-0002-8453-8435; DeAngelis, Kristen/0000-0002-5585-4551","Environmental Protection Agency Science To Achieve Results Program (EPA-STAR)United States Environmental Protection Agency; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); California Experimental Station Project [6117-H]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryUniversity of California System [DE-AC0205CH11231]; Program for Ecosystem Research","We gratefully acknowledge Ellen Simms for thoughtful discussions regarding statistical analysis of the data, and Yvette Piceno for technical assistance with the PhyloChip.

The interactions in plant-endophyte associations vary from mutualistic to parasitic with environmental conditions and the genotypes of interacting species. The possible pros and cons of endophytic fungi are expected to be most evident during the seedling establishment, where host fitness is most directly affected. If this holds true, endophytes may play a focal role in local adaptation of hosts to different environments. We examined if endophyte-infected and uninfected seeds and seedlings of two native grass species, Festuca rubra and F. ovina, differ in seed germination and seedling growth rates under greenhouse conditions. The germination of F. rubra seeds was also studied in the field. This is the first time that the effects of EpichloA << endophyte on seedling establishment of fine fescues from natural populations have been experimentally evaluated. Mother plant (seed family) had a marked effect on many response variables in both grass species. Length and mean biomass of tillers of endophyte-infected (E+) F. ovina seedlings were lower, but root:shoot ratios were higher than in endophyte-free (E-) seedlings. In F. rubra, the effects of the endophyte were dependent on the habitat where the seeds were collected. The E+ seeds from river banks germinated faster than E+ seeds from meadows, and E+ seedlings from the river banks produced fewer but taller and heavier tillers than the other seedlings. Our data suggest that the effects of the endophyte infection on the seedling stage of fine fescues are dependent the species of grass, host genetic background and mother plant habitat. The germination strategy and growth form of E+ red fescue seedlings from river banks may be beneficial to surviving in the harsh conditions of that habitat.","[Wali, Piippa R.] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Helander, Marjo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Saloniemi, Irma] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Genet Lab, Turku 20014, Finland; [Saikkonen, Kari] Univ Turku, Kevo Subarct Res Inst, Turku 20014, Finland; [Ahlholm, Jouni] Ctr Appl Mycol, Ctr Dev & Informat Cent Carelia, Raakkyla 82300, Finland","Wali, P (reprint author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu 90014, Finland.",piippa.wali@oulu.fi,"Saloniemi, Irma/C-8893-2011; Wali, Piippa/H-8562-2017","Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321; Wali, Piippa/0000-0002-2484-7455","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; Finnish Konkordia Fund; Faculty of Science, University of Oulu","This study was funded by Academy of Finland, by Finnish Cultural Foundation, by Finnish Konkordia Fund and by Faculty of Science, University of Oulu.

Minimal microbial respiration rate was estimated based on the linear regression equations between soil CO2 efflux and root mass at different experimental sites. Soil CO2 efflux, ranging from 4.99 to 16.29 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), depended on the seasonal changes in soil temperature. The root mass at 0-10 cm soil depth was 0.82 and 1.27 kg m(-2) in Apr. and Sep., respectively. The root mass at 0-10 cm soil depth comprised 60% of the total root, mass at 0-50 cm soil depth. The root productivity at 0-30 cm depth varied from 8 to 180 g m(-2) month(-1). Microbial and root respiration rates ranged from 1.35 to 5.51 and 2.72 to 12.06 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The contribution of root respiration to the total Soil CO2 efflux averaged 53%, ranging from 33% to 72%. The microbial respiration rate was exponentially related to soil temperature at 10 cm depth (R-2 = 0.9400, P = 0.002, n = 6), and the root respiration rate was linearly related to the root production at 0-30 cm depth (R-2 = 0.6561, P = 0.042, n = 6).","[Wang Wei] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang Wei] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Feng Jiang] NE Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Oikawa, T.] Univ Tsukuba, Inst Biol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan","Wang, W (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wangw@urban.pku.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30670342, 30870408]; Jilin Provincial Natural Science Funds [20060105]",Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 30670342 and 30870408) and the Jilin Provincial Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (No. 20060105).,,51,14,16,0,26,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,FEB,2009,19,1,,,,,31,39,,10.1016/S1002-0160(08)60081-8,,,9,Soil Science,Agriculture,411NL,WOS:000263656200004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cheng, XR; Huang, MB; Shao, MG; Warrington, DN",,,,"Cheng, Xiangrong; Huang, Mingbin; Shao, Mingan; Warrington, D.

Caragana korshinkii Kom is a shrub that is widely planted in this region to control soil erosion and land desertification. The objective of this study was to investigate the fine root distribution of mature C. korshinkii and its water consumption, when grown in either silt loam or sandy soils, in order to understand differences between the water cycles of two such soils found in the transition zone between fertile loess hills and desert of the Northern Loess Plateau. Fine root distributions were measured using the trench-profile method. Soil water dynamics were monitored with a neutron probe during two growing seasons. The results showed that fine root area density (FRAD) declined with increasing soil depth in both soils, with 70.7% and 96.6% of the total fine roots being concentrated in the upper 1-m layer of the silt loam and sandy soils, respectively. Water consumption by C. korshinkii in the silt loam was close to that in the sandy soil. Most water consumption in both soil types was from the upper 1-m layer. Little variation in plant available water ( PAW) occurred in the 3-6 m soil layer during the whole study period. However, in this layer, the PAW was significantly lower in the silt loam soil than in the sandy soil. Total actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was slightly higher from the sandy soil plots than from those of the silt loam soil during both growing seasons. Our study indicated that mature C. korshinkii effectively uses about the same amount of water from either the silt loam or sandy soils, but that more soil water at depth was extracted from silt loam soil than from sandy soil.","[Huang, Mingbin] NW A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiangrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiangrong; Huang, Mingbin; Shao, Mingan; Warrington, D.

Because mycorrhizal fungi mediate the interaction between plants and soil, we hypothesized that distinct ectomycorrhizal fungi would colonize Quercus garryana roots on serpentine and nonserpentine soils. We sampled roots of Q. garryana on serpentine soils at two locations in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon and identified ectomycorrhizas by morphological and molecular methods. The same six most abundant and most frequent mycorrhizal species, Cenococcum geophilum, Tuber candidum, Genea harknessii, Tomentella sp., Sebacina sp., and Inocybe sp., were found on serpentine and nonserpentine soils. Based on similarities calculated using the Sorensen index in Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling, mycorrhizal communities on serpentine and nonserpentine soils were not significantly different. This study showed that ectomycorrhizal species associated with Q. garryana exhibit edaphic tolerance and were neither reduced nor excluded by serpentinite or peridotite parent materials.","[Moser, A.

However, basic information is required to understand the unfolding pattern of soil development and to corroborate evidence for increasing rates of organic matter accumulation suggested by earlier work. Soil properties were measured in bare pyroclastic sites without lupines or other plants, under live and under dead L. lepidus. In 2005, pyroclastic substrates had low cation exchange capacity but appeared able to supply sufficient P for plant growth. Soil under live and dead lupines contained higher concentrations of soluble and total C and N, larger, more active microbial communities, more Bradford reactive soil protein and enzymes, and had higher mineralization potentials than bare soil. Comparatively, lupine soil was less dense and had lower C to N ratios and relative respiration rates. Soil microbial biomass-C, determined by substrate-induced respiration, had not increased under lupines since 1990, and was indistinguishable from hot water soluble-C, suggesting microorganisms were a predominant pool of labile-C in these developing soils. Evidence for an important soil glycoprotein, glomalin, in these pyroclastic substrates suggests it can form early during soil development. Concentrations of total C and N under lupines have risen to nearly 4 and 0.4 g kg(-1) respectively since the 1980 eruption, but 2005 data indicate little change since 1997 and imply inputs from lupines into soil are in equilibrium with losses.","[Halvorson, Jonathan J.] ARS, USDA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, Beaver, WV 25813 USA; [Smith, Jeffrey L.] ARS, USDA, Land Management & Water Conservat Res Unit, Pullman, WA USA","Halvorson, JJ (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, 1224 Airport Rd, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",Jonathan.Halvorson@ars.usda.gov,"yang, lixia/D-7815-2011",,,,,113,17,18,4,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2009,315,2-Jan,,,,,211,228,,10.1007/s11104-008-9745-7,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,404TB,WOS:000263174800017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Karst, J; Jones, MD; Turkington, R",,,,"Karst, Justine; Jones, Melanie D.; Turkington, Roy",,,Ectomycorrhizal colonization and intraspecific variation in growth responses of lodgepole pine,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intraspecific variation; Phenotypic variation; Thelephora terrestris,ECOSYSTEM; SEEDLINGS; TREES; SOIL,"Across different host plant species, the effects of mycorrhizal colonization on host growth parameters can vary, but intraspecific variation in this relationship has rarely been measured.

Root tips of seedlings from eight full sib seed families varied in levels of ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization from 39% to 100%. We observed positive, negative, or neutral relationships between colonization level and shoot mass, depending on plant family. For the majority of seed families no relationship was observed between colonization level and root mass; however, two seed families showed negative relationships. Shoot height differed only by seed family. Results from our study indicate that the relationship between colonization level and host growth depends on host genotype.

To this end, photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) were simulated in a growth chamber (PFD 100, 50 or 25 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Relative and absolute growth rates (RGR and AGR, respectively) of the species were regressed on ten different ecophysiological and morphogenetic plant attributes. No significant relationships were found between plant attributes and relative growth rate, while six attributes explained a significant proportion of the interspecific variance in absolute biomass growth: net photosynthetic rate at growth PFD (P (net) ) (75.5%), leaf apparent quantum yield of CO2 fixation (62.5%), leaf dark respiration rate (65.2%), leaf compensation PFD (71.0%), root: shoot ratio (66.4%) and plant nitrogen content on a mass basis (42.0%). Only species with extremely low allocation to roots and very high (relatively speaking) net photosynthetic rates were able to grow fast in low light. Specific leaf area (SLA), instantaneous photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) and leaf nitrogen content on a mass basis as well as on an area basis were not significantly related to growth. The absence of effects of plant traits on RGR, unlike for AGR, could arise from a relationship that we observed between AGR and a fitted start value of the biomass-time course (i.e. seed mass or germination time). This suggests that interspecific differences in the very early growth stages of the plants were responsible for differences in successful development under low light, rather than differences in RGR. Based on its high explanatory power, its relative constancy with plant age and the lack of effect of growth PFD, P (net) would be the best candidate for characterizing potentially shade-tolerant species that are likely to establish in dense vegetation in the field.","[Seidlova, L.; Gloser, J.] Masaryk Univ, Dept Plant Physiol & Anat, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Verlinden, M.; Milbau, A.; Nijs, I.] Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Verlinden, M (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",maya.verlinden@ua.ac.be,,"Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883","Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (Prime Minister's Office, Brussels, Belgium) under the Programme SPSD II; FWO-VlaanderenFWO","This research was supported by the Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (Prime Minister's Office, Brussels, Belgium) under the Programme SPSD II.

The objectives of the present study were to examine seasonal variations in soil respiration during the growing season, and to explore the factors affecting the variation in soil respiration rates for three forest types (Mongolian oak, Manchurian walnut and mixed forests) of temperate secondary forest in Northeast China. The results showed that (1) the maximum total R (S) rate occurred in July, following a bell-shaped curve with season, (2) for all forest types, the total R (S) was significantly influenced by soil temperature (P < 0.01), and did not significantly correlate with soil moisture, (3) compared with fine root biomass, coarse root biomass was more closely related with the root respiration in mixed forest (R (2) = 0.711, P = 0.017) and in Manchurian walnut forest (R (2) = 0.768, P = 0.010), and (4) microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen were significantly correlated with heterotrophic R (S) in Mongolian oak forest (R (2) = 0.664, P = 0.026; R (2) = 0.784, P = 0.008, respectively) and in mixed forest (R (2) = 0.918, P = 0.001; R (2) = 0.967, P = 0.001, respectively). We can conclude that in temperate secondary forests: (1) the R (S) rate and the relationships between R (S) and abiotic/biotic factors change greatly with forest types, and (2) R (S) is strongly influenced by soil temperature, MBC, microbial biomass nitrogen and coarse root biomass in temperate secondary forests.","[Zhu, Jiaojun; Yan, Qiaoling; Yang, Kai; Hu, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiaojun; Yan, Qiaoling; Yang, Kai; Hu, Zhibin] Key Lab Management Noncommercial Forests Liaonin, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Fan, A'nan] Dalian Forest Inst, Dalian 116039, Peoples R China","Yan, QL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",yanqiaoling1978@126.com,,"ZHU, Jiaojun/0000-0002-2512-7900","National Nature Scientific Foundation Project of China [30671669, 30830085]; National Forestry Scientific Support Program [2006BAD03A0903]","This research was supported by grants from the National Nature Scientific Foundation Project of China (30671669, 30830085), and National Forestry Scientific Support Program (2006BAD03A0903).",,39,8,12,1,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

The biomass of wood, foliage, and roots was highest in the unthinned control stands, lowest in stands measured 3 years after thinning, and intermediate in the stands measured 16 years following the same prescription. While total wood net primary production (NPP) followed the same pattern as biomass across treatments, an apparent doubling of shrub foliage NPP in the 3 years following overstory thinning reduced the impacts of thinning on total foliage NPP. Similarly, reductions in coarse root NPP associated with tree removal were largely offset by increases in fine root production. Compensatory NPP by shrubs and fine roots increased the light use efficiency of thinned stands 60% over that of unthinned plots. Both soil respiration and the decomposition of aboveground dead wood appeared conserved across all treatments. Results suggest that when modeling the influence fuel reduction treatments on regional carbon dynamics, it may be necessary to consider the compensatory responses of understory vegetation as such shifts in growth form can effect meaningful changes in the capture and allocation of carbon in the ecosystem.

A random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) 'fingerprinting' technique was exhibited to detect genotoxin-induced DNA damage of plants from heavy metal contaminated soil. This study compared the effects occurring at molecular and population levels in barley seedlings exposed to cadmium (Cd) contamination in soil. Results indicate that reduction of root growth and increase of total soluble protein level in the root tips of barley seedlings occurred with the ascending Cd concentrations. For the RAPD analyses, nine 10-base pair (bp) random RAPD primers (decamers) with 60-70% GC content were found to produce unique polymorphic band patterns and subsequently were used to produce a total of 129 RAPD fragments of 144-2639 base pair in molecular size in the root tips of control seedlings. Results produced from nine primers indicate that the changes occurring in RAPD profiles of the root tips following Cd treatment included alterations in band intensity as well as gain or loss of bands compared with the control seedlings. New amplified fragments at molecular size from approximately 154 to 2245 bp appeared almost for 10, 20 and 40 mg L-1 Cd with 9 primers (one-four new polymerase chain reaction, (PCR) products), and the number of missing bands enhanced with the increasing Cd concentration for nine primers. These results suggest that genomic template stability reflecting changes in RAPD profiles were significantly affected and it compared favourably with the traditional indices such as growth and soluble protein level at the above Cd concentrations. The DNA polymorphisms detected by RAPD can be applied as a suitable biomarker assay for detection of the genotoxic effects of Cd stress in soil on plants. As a tool in risk assessment the RAPD assay can be used in characterisation of Cd hazard in soil. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Yang, Y.

The aims of this research were: to determine plants colonizing this slag heap; to analyze colonization and morphological biodiversity of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); to determine spore distribution in undisturbed samples: to know mycelium and glomalin abundance in the rhizosphere of these plants, and to investigate glomalin participation in Cd-stabilization. Forming vegetal islands, 22 different pioneering plant species from 11families were colonizing the slag heap. The most common plants were species of Fabaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae. Almost all plants were hosting AMF in their roots, and spores belonging to Gigaspora, Glomus, Scutellospora and Acaulospora species were observed. Micromorphological analysis showed that spores were related to decomposing vegetal residues and excrements, which means that mesofauna is contributing to their dispersion in the groundmass. Mycelium mass ranged from 0.11 to 26.3 mg/g, which contained between 13 and 75 mg of glomalin/g. Slag-extracted total glomalin was between 0.36 and 4.74 mg/g. Cadmium sequestered by glomalin extracted from either slag or mycelium was 0.028 mg/g. The ecological implication of these results is that organisms occupying vegetal patches are modifying mine residues, which contribute to soil formation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This symbiosis is thought to have contributed to the early colonisation of land by plants. Morphological stasis over 400 million years and the lack of an observed sexual stage in any member of the phylum Glomeromycota led to the controversial suggestion of AMF being ancients asexuals. Evidence for recombination in AMF is contradictory. Results: We addressed the question of recombination in the AMF Glomus intraradices by sequencing 11 polymorphic nuclear loci in 40 morphologically identical isolates from one field. Phylogenetic relationships among genotypes showed a reticulate network pattern providing a rationale to test for recombination. Five statistical tests predicted multiple recombinant regions in the genome of a core set of isolates. In contrast, five clonal lineages had fixed a large number of differences. Conclusion: Our data show that AMF from one field have undergone recombination but that clonal lineages coexist. This finding has important consequences for understanding AMF evolution, co-evolution of AMF and plants and highlights the potential for commercially introduced AMF inoculum recombining with existing local populations. Finally, our results reconcile seemingly contradictory studies on whether AMF are clonal or form recombining populations.","[Croll, Daniel; Sanders, Ian R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.croll@unil.ch; ian.sanders@unil.ch,"Croll, Daniel/B-4933-2008; Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; Croll, Daniel/C-1661-2018","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Croll, Daniel/0000-0002-2072-380X",The Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [3100AO-105790/1],"We thank Rui Rodrigues Martins Candeias for help with in vitro cultivation and DNA extraction.

The combination of both factors for plant performance under water limitation has not yet been studied. To investigate the influence of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus, hydrogel and the combination of both factors, a drought-sensitive poplar, Populus euphratica, was examined in this study. After 16 weeks of inoculation, no ectomycorrhizas were found. Nevertheless, P. involutus-inoculated poplars displayed increased concentrations of soluble sugars and osmolality, leading to an improved water status. Growth was diminished compared with non-inoculated P. euphratica. The presence of hydrogels in the rooting medium resulted in increased biomass and higher plant water content and decreased the osmolality of plant tissues. Drought markedly decreased water contents in rooting medium and plants, and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, and stimulated the root growth, concentrations of soluble sugars and osmolality in plants. Under drought conditions, P. euphratica exhibited osmoregulation by accumulation of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates. These data indicate that adding hydrogels to soils may improve the plant performance. The reasons for improved osmoregulation by fungi and hydrogels were probably related to their stimulating influence on the formation of soluble carbohydrates under drought conditions.","[Luo, Zhi-Bin; Polle, Andrea] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Abt Forstbotan & Baumphysiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Luo, Zhi-Bin] NW A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Ke; Jiang, Xiangning] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Luo, ZB (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Abt Forstbotan & Baumphysiol, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",lzhibin@gwdg.de,,,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"We are grateful to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for providing financial support to the PRG (Poplar Research Group, Germany) for Andrea Polle and to the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) for funding a postdoctoral scholarship for Zhi-Bin Luo in the program ""Modern Application of Biotechnology"".",,38,36,40,2,46,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Roots are known to produce various defense compounds to protect themselves against these herbivores, both with direct and indirect-inducible-defense compounds. Recent literature reviews reveal no overall pattern for root-shoot defense allocation. Optimal defense allocation patterns within roots may be predicted with an ecophysiological model taking into account the value and vulnerability of root classes. Induced responses elicited by root herbivores are likely to result in systemic responses in the shoots. These systemic responses may affect aboveground herbivores and higher trophic levels. This calls into question whether root-to-shoot systemic induction is an adaptive response. Physiological responses conferring tolerance may co-occur with resistance responses, depending on the biotic and abiotic environment of the roots. More detailed analyses of root defenses and the feeding sites of herbivores are needed to gain a better understanding of optimal defense allocation in roots.","NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","van Dam, NM (reprint author), NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",n.vandam@nioo.knaw.nl,"van Dam, Nicole/B-3281-2008","van Dam, Nicole/0000-0003-2622-5446",,,,104,122,124,1,130,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Nevertheless, the interactions between the two groups of organisms in natural ecosystems are far from understood. We carried out an inoculation experiment to examine the effect of two root herbivores, Pratylenchus penetrans and P. dunensis (Nematoda), oil the composition of the AMF communities of the interaction in terms of associated with two populations or the dune grass Ammophila arenaria. The outcome plant and nematode performance was also analyzed. The total percentage of AM F colonization was not affected by the presence of root-feeders, but they did alter the composition of the AMF communities inside the roots. These changes were dependent oil the root-feeder species and the original AMF community: the most severe alterations were observed in the mycorrhizal plants from Wales attacked by P. penetrans. Plant growth was impaired in plants from Wales inoculated with AMF and P. dunensis, which suggests a highly species-specific synergistic interaction with negative consequences for the plant. Root infection by the nematodes was reduced in all mycorrhizal plants when compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. However, a significant reduction of the final number of nematodes was observed only ill the mycorrhizal plants from one population. (C) 2008 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

This study was planned to evaluate if those seedlings develop rnycorrhizal associations once installed in plantations, and if those associations are originated from inoculums acquired in the nursery. Three evaluations were done: 1) analyses of seedlings at the end of nursery period, to evaluate their initial mycorrhizal condition, 2) analyses after 6 month, with seedlings transplanted into pots with semi-sterile substrate, to establish if there exists inoculum in the system that did not express because of the high fertilization levels and, 3) analyses after 24 month, with seedlings planted in a field distant from any source of ectomycorrhizal inoculum, to evaluate the associations developed in the planting site. Results showed that: 1) the studied nursery produced seedlings with null or very low levels of mycorrhization, with low morphotypes' richness; 2) seedlings showed very high rnycorrhizal percentages after 6 months (under greenhouse conditions) and after 24 months (in field conditions); 3) different mycorrhizal fungi behave differently under fertilization. The analyzed nursery fortuitously incorporated mycorrhizal inoculum that rapidly colonized seedlings, immediately after fertilization was interrupted. This fact demonstrates that the hypothesis that ponderosa pine seedlings can establish and grow in anectotrophic environments without EM symbioses is false.","[Salgado Salomon, Maria Eugenia; Rajchenberg, Mario; Barroetavena, Carolina] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Salgado Salomon, Maria Eugenia; Rajchenberg, Mario; Barroetavena, Carolina] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Salomon, MES (reprint author), Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Sarmiento 849,CP 9200, Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mesalgadosalomon@gmail.com,,,,,,49,2,2,0,14,"UNIV AUSTRAL CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS FORESTALES",VALDIVIA,"CASILLA 567, VALDIVIA, 00000, CHILE",0717-9200,,,BOSQUE,Bosque,,2009,30,3,,,,,127,134,,10.4067/S0717-92002009000300002,,,8,Ecology; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,533FS,WOS:000272809700002,,"Other Gold, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Nygren, P; Lu, M; Ozier-Lafontaine, H",,,,"Nygren, Pekka; Lu, Miaoer; Ozier-Lafontaine, Harry",,,Effects of turnover and internal variability of tree root systems on modelling coarse root architecture: comparing simulations for young Populus deltoides with field data,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FRACTAL BRANCHING MODELS; GENERAL-MODEL; FINE ROOTS; BIOMASS; SIZE; AGROFORESTRY; COMPONENTS; PREDICTOR; DIAMETER; DYNAMICS,"The behaviour of the FracRoot model, which describes coarse-root architecture based on proximal root diameters using a recursive algorithm, was studied using field data on Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. in a short-rotation plantation. Roots were described as a branching, hierarchical network of connected links. Diameters of daughter links were estimated from the diameter of the mother link using scaling parameter p and allocation parameter q, which were based on sharing of the root cross-sectional area by daughter links. Parameters were estimated from complete root excavations. The length of each link and the vertical and horizontal branching angle distributions were recorded. Parameter p values were distributed log-normally, and q values followed a beta distribution both for the whole root system and within 5 mm link diameter classes. Including the variability of p and q in the model did not significantly improve root length estimates compared with the use of mean p and q values over all branching points. Including a coarse-root turnover factor based on field-observed evidence on root mortality improved the model fit to field data. Root length was more sensitive to parameter values and turnover factor than root mass. Field observations and the importance of the turnover factor to simulation accuracy suggest that coarse-root turnover should be considered in root research, at least under conditions of strong competition or other external stress.","[Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lu, Miaoer] Univ Missouri, Dept Forestry, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Ozier-Lafontaine, Harry] INRA, Unite Agropedoclimat Zone Caraibe, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France","Nygren, P (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.nygren@helsinki.fi,,,,,,28,10,10,1,9,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The ratio of nonmycorrhizal plants species decreased with the decreasing impact of cattle. The highest mycorrhizal colonization was found at the control site on a level of the screened plant community (78.57% of root length) as well as on a species level (97.78% of root length of Plantago major L.). At the severely impacted site, 31.67% and 35.56% of root colonization was found on community and species level (Plantago major L.), respectively.

We present an inexpensive approach to soil profile-wall mapping using a desktop scanner that allowed us to spend reduced time in the field. The scanner was pressed onto the vertical surface of a 1 x 1m soil pit and images of the roots were taken in situ. In a common garden planting of eleven, 30-year-old conifer and hardwood tree species in Poland, we compared root counts (number of roots cm(-2)) obtained by this method with independent measurements of root length density (RLD) obtained from soil cores. We found a positive correlation (Spearman rank correlation r=0.93; P<0.001) suggesting general agreement of the two approaches in ranking among the species. Soil coring as well as grid mapping with plastic overlays took a longer total time for quantifying root distribution than the scanning procedure. The desktop scanner approach we developed is an inexpensive, time efficient and accurate way of quantifying root distribution and abundance that allows a unique coupling of root data to soil properties.","[Dauer, Jenny M.; Withington, Jennifer M.; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Dauer, Jenny M.; Withington, Jennifer M.; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Oleksyn, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Oleksyn, Jacek; Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Chorover, Jon] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Chadwick, Oliver A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Eissenstat, DM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dme9@psu.edu,"Oleksyn, Jacek/I-4539-2012","Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN 9596050, DEB 01298944, DEB 0090069, DEB 0128958]","We thank S.

In a landscape-scale field study we quantified plant, BSC, and AM fungal communities at 216 locations along a gradient of soil stability levels in southern Utah, USA. We used multivariate modeling to examine the relative influences of plants, BSCs, and AM fungi on surface and subsurface stability in a semiarid shrubland landscape. Models were found to be congruent with the data and explained 35% of the variation in surface stability and 54% of the variation in subsurface stability. The results support several tentative conclusions. While BSCs, plants, and AM fungi all contribute to surface stability, only plants and AM fungi contribute to subsurface stability. In both surface and subsurface models, the strongest contributions to soil stability are made by biological components of the system. Biological soil crust cover was found to have the strongest direct effect on surface soil stability (0.60; controlling for other factors). Surprisingly, AM fungi appeared to influence surface soil stability (0.37), even though they are not generally considered to exist in the top few millimeters of the soil. In the subsurface model, plant cover appeared to have the strongest direct influence on soil stability (0.42); in both models, results indicate that plant cover influences soil stability both directly (controlling for other factors) and indirectly through influences on other organisms. Soil organic matter was not found to have a direct contribution to surface or subsurface stability in this system. The relative influence of AM fungi on soil stability in these semiarid shrublands was similar to that reported for a mesic tallgrass prairie. Estimates of effects that BSCs, plants, and AM fungi have on soil stability in these models are used to suggest the relative amounts of resources that erosion control practitioners should devote to promoting these communities. This study highlights the need for system approaches in combating erosion, soil degradation, and arid-land desertification.","[Chaudhary, V.

Yet, mutualisms are common and persistent, even in the largely promiscuous associations between plants and soil microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In two different systems, we demonstrate preferential allocation of photosynthate by host plants to the more beneficial of two AM fungal symbionts. This preferential allocation could allow the persistence of the mutualism if it confers sufficient advantage to the beneficial symbiont that it overcomes the cost of mutualism. We find that the beneficial fungus does increase in biomass when the fungi are spatially separated within the root system. However, in well-mixed fungal communities, non-beneficial fungi proliferate as expected from their reduced cost of mutualism. Our findings suggest that preferential allocation within spatially structured microbial communities can stabilize mutualisms between plants and root symbionts.","[Bever, James D.; Richardson, Sarah C.; Lawrence, Brandy M.; Holmes, Jonathan; Watson, Maxine] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jbever@indiana.edu,,"Richardson, Sarah/0000-0003-0882-2554",,,,50,260,267,6,156,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

N-2-fixation rates tracked plant phenology during the 1997 (drought) and 1998 (normal precipitation) growing seasons. The best model for predicting acetylene reductase activity (ARA, mu mol C2H4 center dot g nodule(DWT)(-1 center dot)h(-1)) across all stands and sampling periods included a linear response to soil temperature and a quadratic response to Julian day (r(2) = 0.23, P < 0.0001). There were few significant relationships between seasonal maximum values for ARA and measured leaf traits; however, we did detect an inverse correlation between foliar N to P ratio and seasonal maximum ARA. During 1998, stands with higher maximum ARA had higher soil %N, and maximum ARA was positively correlated with subcanopy %P in O and A soil horizons. During 1997, leaf %P and N resorption were lower and leaves were thinner compared to 1998. Drought effects were most pronounced in mid-succession, where alder exhibited reduced ARA, leaf %P, leaf thickness, and lower leaf resorption of P and N. Although ARA and nodule biomass did not differ among stand types, increases in alder densities with successional time translated to increasing ecosystem-level N inputs across the chronosequence. These results contradict established theory predicting a decline in N-2-fixation rates and N-2-fixer abundance during successional stand development.","[Mitchell, Jennifer S.; Ruess, Roger W.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Ruess, RW (reprint author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",rwruess@alaska.edu,,,Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0423442]; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Pacific Northwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [PNW01-JV11261952-231],"We would like to thank the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks for providing logistical support to this project and J.

Future levels of atmospheric CO2 are likely to increase C input into the soils through increased above- and below-ground production of forests. This increased input will result in greater sequestration of C only if the additional C enters stable pools. In this review, we compare current observations from four large-scale Free Air FACE Enrichment (FACE) experiments on forest ecosystems (EuroFACE, Aspen-FACE, Duke FACE and ORNL-FACE) and consider their predictive power for long-term C sequestration. At all sites, FACE increased fine root biomass, and in most cases higher fine root turnover resulted in higher C input into soil via root necromass. However, at all sites, soil CO2 efflux also increased in excess of the increased root necromass inputs. A mass balance calculation suggests that a large part of the stimulation of soil CO2 efflux may be due to increased root respiration. Given the duration of these experiments compared with the life cycle of a forest and the complexity of processes involved, it is not yet possible to predict whether elevated CO2 will result in increased C storage in forest soil.","[Lukac, Martin; Lagomarsino, Alessandra; Moscatelli, M.

Carr.),FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PLANTATIONS; YIELD,"This study challenges all-else-equal assumptions in the analysis of thinning effects and more specifically those regarding local variation in forest site productivity. It is demonstrated that considerable variation may occur in site productivity in apparently homogeneous forest stands, whether thinned or unthinned, and that this may not be reflected in height, but rather in basal area growth. To account for such variation, the suggestion is to include an unbiased pre-treatment measure of site productivity, such as total volume production prior to first thinning, as a covariate in the analysis. In a wider perspective, the study further challenges two general site productivity hypothesis, namely, the general assumption that stand volume growth correlates well with stand height (the site index hypothesis, i.e. that site productivity can be estimated based on stand height) and the assumption that, for a given species, total volume production at a given stand height is identical for all site classes (Eichhorn's rule). The thinning response pattern for even-aged Sitka spruce is quantified for different site types based on two thinning experiments in Denmark and six comparable experiments in Great Britain, Norway and Sweden. The effect of thinning from below on stand volume growth is strongly site dependent, but heavy thinning usually leads to a reduction in volume growth as compared with an unthinned stand growing under similar site conditions. For some sites, typically those with stable and ample water supply and a deeply developed root system, stand volume growth is maximized through light thinning. For some other sites, typically those with a high ground water table and a shallow root system, thinning reduces stand volume growth and considerably so with increasing thinning grade. There seems to be a gradient in the reduction, so that it is lessened with increasing rooting depth and with increasing stability of water supply. Due to site-dependent variation in the relation between height growth and stand volume growth as well as site-dependent variation in thinning response pattern, it is recommended to establish and maintain unthinned observation plots in managed stands to ensure reliable growth and yield prognoses. Such plots can serve as a reference for thinning practices as well as a standard for potential volume growth. This recommendation could also hold for other species and in other parts of the world.","Univ Copenhagen, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","Skovsgaard, JP (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, 11 Horsholm Kongevej, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",jps@life.ku.dk,,,,,,49,23,23,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,JAN,2009,82,1,,,,,87,104,,10.1093/forestry/cpn047,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,404OT,WOS:000263163600007,,Bronze,,,10/31/19S,"Murach, D; Horn, A; Ke-Hong, W; Rapp, C",,"Brumme, R; Khanna, PK",,"Murach, D.; Horn, A.; Ke-Hong, W.; Rapp, C.",,,"Fine Root Biomass, Turnover and Litter Production",FUNCTIONING AND MANAGEMENT OF EUROPEAN BEECH ECOSYSTEMS,Ecological Studies-Analysis and Synthesis,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; IMAGINARY PROBLEM; DOUGLAS-FIR; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; BEECH; OVERESTIMATION; AVAILABILITY; MATTER; WATER,,"[Murach, D.] Fachhsch Eberswalde, Fac Forest & Environm, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Horn, A.; Ke-Hong, W.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Murach, D (reprint author), Fachhsch Eberswalde, Fac Forest & Environm, Alfred Moller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany.",dmurach@fh-eberswalde.de; chr.rapp@t-online.de,,,,,,44,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",0070-8356,,978-3-642-00339-4,ECOL STUD-ANAL SYNTH,Ecol.

To elucidate the interactive effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and soil N availability on forest productivity and C allocation, we hypothesized that (1) trees maximize fitness by allocating N and C to maximize their net growth and (2) that N uptake is controlled by soil N availability and root exploration for soil N. We tested this model using data collected in Free-Air CO2 Enrichment sites dominated by evergreen (Pinus taeda; Duke Forest) and deciduous [Liquidambar styraciflua; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)] trees. The model explained 80-95% of variation in productivity and N-uptake data among eCO(2), N fertilization and control treatments over 6 years. The model explains why fine-root production increased, and why N uptake increased despite reduced soil N availability under eCO(2) at ORNL and Duke. In agreement with observations at other sites, the model predicts that soil N availability reduced below a critical level diminishes all eCO(2) responses. At Duke, a negative feedback between reduced soil N availability and N uptake prevented progressive reduction in soil N availability at eCO(2). At ORNL, soil N availability progressively decreased because it did not trigger reductions in N uptake; N uptake was maintained at ORNL through a large increase in the production of fast turnover fine roots. This implies that species with fast root turnover could be more prone to progressive N limitation of carbon sequestration in woody biomass than species with slow root turnover, such as evergreens. However, longer term data are necessary for a thorough evaluation of this hypothesis. The success of the model suggests that the principle of maximization of net growth to control growth and allocation could serve as a basis for simplification and generalization of larger scale forest and ecosystem models, for example by removing the need to specify parameters for relative foliage/stem/root allocation.","[Franklin, Oskar] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Franklin, Oskar; McMurtrie, Ross E.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Iversen, Colleen M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Iversen, Colleen M.; Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Crous, Kristine Y.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Tissue, David T.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Tissue, David T.; Ellsworth, David S.] Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Plant & Food Sci, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Franklin, O (reprint author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",franklin@iiasa.ac.at,"Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016; Tissue, David T/N-1710-2019; Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012; Iversen, Colleen M/B-8983-2012; Tissue, David/AAA-8829-2019","Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533; Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Iversen, Colleen M/0000-0001-8293-3450; Tissue, David/0000-0002-8497-2047; Franklin, Oskar/0000-0002-0376-4140; Ellsworth, David/0000-0002-9699-2272; Crous, Kristine/0000-0001-9478-7593",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian Greenhouse Office; US Department of Energy Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Biological and Environmental Research Program; TERACC (NSF) [0090238],"Franklin and McMurtrie acknowledge grant support from the Australian Research Council and the Australian Greenhouse Office.

Understanding the relationship between environmental changes and rates of soil respiration is critical for projecting changes in soil carbon fluxes in a changing climate. Although significant attention has been focused on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition, the factors that affect this temperature sensitivity are still debated. In this study, we examined the effects of substrate availability on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in several different kinds of soils. We found that increased substrate availability had a significant positive effect on temperature sensitivity, as measured by soil Q(10) values, and that this effect was inversely proportional to original substrate availability. This observation can be explained if decomposition follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The simple Q(10) model was most appropriate in soils with high substrate availability.","[Gershenson, Alexander; Cheng, Weixin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Gershenson, Alexander] San Jose State Univ, Dept Environm Studies, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Bader, Nicholas E.] Whitman Coll, Dept Geol, Walla Walla, WA 99362 USA","Gershenson, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",agersh@gmail.com,"Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011","Cheng, Weixin/0000-0003-2964-2376; Bader, Nicholas/0000-0002-8092-5163","USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2006-35107-17225]; Kearney Foundation of Soil Science; Department of Environmental Studies, University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System","We thank Feike Dijkstra, Daniel Keck, and Biao Zhu for their invaluable assistance, Dr Eric Davidson and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on this manuscript.

Dense ponderosa pine regeneration establishes several years after treatment and eventually increases crown fire risk if allowed to grow. Using prescribed fire to control this regeneration is hampered by the limited knowledge of fire-related mortality threshold values for seedlings (< 1.4 m tall) and saplings (0.25 to 10 cm diameter at breast height). The present study was initiated to assess fire-related mortality of ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings on prescribed burns across the Black Hills. We established plots in several burn units after the first post-fire growing season to measure crown volume scorch, crown volume consumption, basal scorch, and ground char for ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of mortality based on tree size, flame length, and direct fire effects. Tree size, flame length, crown damage, ground char, and basal char severity were all important factors in the prediction of mortality. Observed mortality was > 70% for seedlings but was only 18 to 46% for sapling-sized trees. The differences in mortality thresholds for ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings highlight their susceptibility to different damage pathways and give managers several options when designing burn prescriptions.","[Battaglia, Mike; Smith, Frederick W.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Battaglia, Mike; Shepperd, Wayne D.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Battaglia, M (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",mbattaglia@fs.fed.us,,,US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [03-JV-11221616-232]; National Fire Plan [01.RMS.C.4]; McIntire-Stennis,"The present research was supported by Joint Venture Agreement no. 03-JV-11221616-232 with the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, National Fire Plan project 01.RMS.C.4, and by McIntire-Stennis funding to the Colorado State University Department of Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship.

A number of experimental studies have supported the hypothesis that diversity increases invasion resistance, but several mechanisms were proposed to explain this relationship. We studied spontaneous invasion in experimental grasslands varying in species richness (1-16 (60)) and plant functional group richness and identity (1-4; grasses, legumes, tall herbs small herbs) during the first 3 years after establishment on large-area plots of 20 x 20 m size. 2. Invader species number, biomass and density decreased with increasing community species richness. The identity of successful invaders changed through time as the relative importance of external invaders (= species not belonging to the experimental species pool) decreased, while internal invaders (= species belonging to the experimental species pool) became more important. The presence of legumes increased, while the presence of grasses in the plant communities decreased density, biomass and species number of external invaders and biomass of internal invaders in the second and third year after establishment. 3. Analyses of viable seeds in the topsoil, a higher invasion in communities with more potential invaders in adjacent plots and an edge effect with a higher invader density and species number at the margin of the plots suggested recruitment limitation of internal invader species in contrast to external invader species that were more strongly limited by community characteristics. 4. Resource availability, in particular percentage cover of resident species, root length density and soil nitrate, and propagule availability had significant effects on invasibility. However, statistical analyses revealed that these variables did not completely control for effects of community species richness and the presence of grasses and legumes respectively on invasion resistance. 5. Separate analyses of frequent invader species showed that the invasion success of individual species varied in response to biodiversity and resource niches. 6. Synthesis. Our results confirm that a more complete use of available resources in plant communities of increasing species richness generally decreases invasibility. However, the overall positive effects of biodiversity on invasion resistance are dependent on species identity of the invader species. Thus, mechanisms at species level are important to understand community invasion resistance.","[Roscher, Christiane; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Bessler, Holger; Engels, Christof] Humboldt Univ, Inst Plant Nutr, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Oelmann, Yvonne; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geog, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Roscher, C (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, POB 100164, D-07701 Jena, Germany.",croscher@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Oelmann, Yvonne/J-8730-2016; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016","Oelmann, Yvonne/0000-0003-3513-6568; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [(FOR 456)]; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society,"The Jena Experiment is funded by the German Science Foundation (FOR 456) with support from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Max Planck Society.

We used a mesocosm experiment to determine the how both the intensity and relative importance of root and shoot competition, and their interactions, influence the structure of plant communities. Experimental communities of nine grassland plant species were planted under different levels of soil fertility. Root, shoot, and total competition intensity and relative importance, along with plant community structure (evenness) were measured in each mesocosm. Structural equation modelling was used to separate the direct and indirect influences of root, shoot and total competition on species evenness. 2. Increasing shoot competition intensity and importance reduced plant community evenness, while increases in root competition intensity and importance had no direct effects on evenness. Root competition intensity and importance indirectly reduced plant community evenness because increased root competition intensity increased shoot competition intensity. 3. We propose that the separate influences of shoot competition and root-shoot competition interactions on community structure can be integrated through a new state variable: the total size-asymmetry of competition. We propose that there is a direct relationship between the overall size-asymmetry of competition and the influence of competition on plant community structure. 4. Synthesis. This study provides the first experimental evidence that, even though there are no direct links between the intensity or relative importance of root competition and plant community structure, root competition may indirectly structure communities through root-shoot competition interactions. Integrating root and shoot competition as competitive size-asymmetry can explain why intense root competition can be unimportant for community structure, while relatively less intense shoot competition and root-shoot competition interactions can have strong effects on plant community composition and diversity.","[Lamb, Eric G.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Kembel, Steven W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Lamb, EG (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",eric.lamb@usask.ca,"Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015; Lamb, Eric G/D-9319-2011","Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516; Lamb, Eric G/0000-0001-5201-4541; Kembel, Steven/0000-0001-5224-0952",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank S.

The existence of indirect effects between mycorrhizal fungi and protection-for-food mutualists, such as extrafloral nectar-foraging 'bodyguard ants', is unknown. In this study, we examined the potential for indirect effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on aggressive ant bodyguards, mediated by changes in the expression of extrafloral nectaries of a shared host plant. We found that mycorrhizal plants grew larger and produced more extrafloral nectaries compared to their non-mycorrhizal counterparts. The difference in the number of nectaries between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, however, was too small to elicit differences in ant attendance. In spite of the lack of a significant indirect effect of mycorrhizal fungi on ant attendance, mycorrhizal plants suffered damage to a significantly greater proportion of their leaves compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. This result likely stems from other (non-ant-mediated) indirect effects of mycorrhizal fungi on herbivores.","[Laird, Robert A.; Addicott, John F.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Laird, RA (reprint author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",rlaird@connect.carleton.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Ingenuity Fund; Alberta Conservation Association's Biodiversity; Killam Trusts,"We thank A.

A field investigation was conducted in three grassland sites of typical steppe in Inner Mongolia. The three plant communities, one of which was undegraded, one moderately degraded and the third severely degraded, were studied by collecting soil samples and samples of four plant species that occurred in all three sites. The percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi was estimated and the species composition and diversity of AM fungus spores recovered from the soil were determined using spore morphological characteristics. Although differences between the sites may have been due partly to other factors, it is likely that the degree of degradation was an important factor. No decline was found in the AM colonization of the roots of the indicator plant species in the moderately or severely degraded plant communities, and two plant species showed higher colonization status in the two degraded areas. Glomus geosporum and Scutellospora calospora were the dominant AM fungi in the undegraded steppe, while G. geosporum and Glomus aggregatum dominated the two degraded sites which also had low spore densities, species richness and diversity indices. However, different AM species showed different distributions among the three plant communities and the results indicate that both biotic and abiotic factors were important in determining the AMF communities, with biotic factors possibly the more important.

The evidence for the darwinulid ostracods is as yet inconclusive. Recent males have been found in a single species, but their functionality is uncertain and their morphology highlights the erroneous assignment of male status to a single individual of Darwinula stevensoni, presently the best candidate for an ancient asexual darwinulid. Previous records of putative fossil males for the past 200 million years have been rejected. Genetic signatures of ancient asexuality are equally inconclusive: there is no Meselson effect in the darwinulids, but neither the presence nor the absence of the Meselson effect does provide conclusive evidence for or against sex. However, it would seem that a combination of a general purpose genotype with powerful homogenising genetic mechanisms (gene conversion, DNA repair) could counter the deleterious effects of the absence of sex in at least a number of darwinulid species.","[Schoen, Isa; Martens, Koen] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Rossetti, Giampaolo] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-43100 Parma, Italy","Schon, I (reprint author), Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",isa.schoen@naturalsciences.be; giampaolo.rossetti@unipr.it; isa.schoen@naturalsciences.be,"Rossetti, Giampaolo/I-5703-2014","Rossetti, Giampaolo/0000-0002-8136-6965",,,,97,28,30,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-481-2769-6,,,,2009,,,,,,,217,240,,10.1007/978-90-481-2770-2_11,,,24,Evolutionary Biology; Reproductive Biology,Evolutionary Biology; Reproductive Biology,BRT43,WOS:000283623900011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lauber, CL; Sinsabaugh, RL; Zak, DR",,,,"Lauber, Christian L.; Sinsabaugh, Robert L.; Zak, Donald R.",,,Laccase Gene Composition and Relative Abundance in Oak Forest Soil is not Affected by Short-Term Nitrogen Fertilization,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; ERICOID MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NORTHERN HARDWOOD FORESTS; TEMPERATE FOREST; ENZYME-ACTIVITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; LOWER MICHIGAN; DEPOSITION; DIVERSITY,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition affects a wide range of soil processes including phenol oxidase (PO) activity and soil organic matter dynamics. Depression of phenol oxidase activity in response to N saturation is believed to be mediated by the activity of white-rot basidiomycetes, whose production of extracellular oxidative enzymes can be limited by high N availability. We examined the effect of short-term N deposition on basidiomycete laccase gene diversity and relative abundance in temperate oak forest soil in which significant decreases in phenol oxidase and increased SOM have been recorded in response to experimental N deposition. UniFrac was used to compare the composition of laccase genes between three control- and three nitrogen-fertilized (80 kg(-1) ha(-1) per year) oak forest soils. The relative abundance of laccase genes was determined from qPCR analysis of laccase and basidiomycete ITS gene abundances. Our results indicate that there was no significant shift in the composition of laccase genes between control- and N-fertilized soils, nor was there a significant change in the relative abundance of laccase genes. These data suggest that N deposition effects on mineral soil PO activity do not result from changes in laccase gene diversity of white-rot basidiomycetes but are likely the result of altered microbial abundance or expression in this ecosystem type. Furthermore, laccase gene composition may be tied to factors that structure microbial communities in general, as soil laccase gene communities are more similar to other forest soils than with the corresponding litter.","[Lauber, Christian L.] Univ Colorado, Boulder CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lauber, Christian L.; Sinsabaugh, Robert L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lauber, CL (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Boulder CIRES, 216 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",christian.lauber@colorado.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337","Office of Science (BER), US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-03ER63591]","This research was supported by the Office of Science (BER), US Department of Energy, grant no.

We characterize the time dependency of the human mitochondrial hypervariable region one mutation rate by generating 14 new phylogeny-based mutation rate estimates using within-human comparisons and archaeological dates. Rate estimates based on population events between 15,000 and 50,000 years ago are at least 2-fold lower than pedigree-based estimates. These within-human estimates are also higher than estimates generated from phylogeny-based human-chimpanzee comparisons. Our new estimates establish a rapid decay in evolutionary mutation rate between approximately 2,500 and 50,000 years ago and a slow decay from 50,000 to 6 Ma. We then extend this analysis to the mtDNA-coding region. Our within-human coding region mutation rate estimates display a similar, though less rapid, time-dependent decay. We explore the possibility that multiple hits explain the discrepancy between pedigree-based and phylogeny-based mutation rates. We conclude that whereas nucleotide substitution models incorporating multiple hits do provide a possible explanation for the discrepancy between pedigree-based and human-chimpanzee mutation rate estimates, they do not explain the rapid decline of within-human rate estimates. We propose that demographic processes such as serial bottlenecks prior to the Holocene could explain the difference between rates estimated before and after 15,000 years ago. Our findings suggest that human mtDNA estimates of dates of population and phylogenetic events should be adjusted in light of this time dependency of the mutation rate estimates.","[Henn, Brenna M.; Mountain, Joanna L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gignoux, Christopher R.; Mountain, Joanna L.] 23&Me Inc, Mountain View, CA USA; [Feldman, Marcus W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Henn, BM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bmhenn@stanford.edu,,,"Department of Anthropology, Stanford UniversityStanford University","We thank Charles Roseman and Tim Weaver for stimulating discussions in the early stages of research.

Soil cores were collected from 10 sites of each shrubland, transferred to a glasshouse, and sown with seed of both tree species. Mycorrhizal colonisation was examined after 19 weeks' growth. Overall, seedlings of Douglas-fir were larger than those of Corsican pine, but the amount of Corsican pine seedlings that were colonised (56%) was about twice that of Douglas-fir (29%). Across the sites, 7-61% of Douglas-fir and 16-81% of Corsican pine seedlings had mycorrhizas. Colonisation of the two tree species was correlated in soil cores from kanuka stands, but not from manuka stands. Colonisation was significantly greater in kanuka than manuka stands in Douglas-fir, but not in Corsican pine. Kanuka stands were of a lower overall elevation than manuka stands and had higher levels of soil available phosphorus. Both factors may have contributed to the greater mycorrhizal colonisation of Douglas-fir in kanuka stands. Differences in colonisation between sites could be partially explained by the proximity of sources of spores of mycorrhizal fungi. It is concluded that low numbers of mycorrhizal propagules may constrain mycorrhizal formation in environments distant from a spore source, but are ultimately unlikely to preclude it, or limit successful seedling establishment.","[Davis, Murray; Smaill, Simeon] Scion, Christchurch, New Zealand","Davis, M (reprint author), Scion, POB 29 237, Christchurch, New Zealand.",murray.davis@scionresearch.com,,"Smaill, Simeon/0000-0001-6242-4931",Department of Conservation [3820],Funding for this project was provided by the Department of Conservation (Contract No. 3820).

Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) was applied to field-collected samples from both burdened environments and proved to be an effective technique for rapid profiling and identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF).

The formation and functioning of AM depend on a complex signal exchange process, which ultimately results in shifts in the metabolism of the symbionts and differentiation of a symbiotic interface in cortical root cells. The mechanisms regulating AM development are not well understood, but it is known that phosphate ( P) concentration in plants plays a key role in this process. Plant P concentration may affect the balance of sugars and phytohormones (PH), as well as the expression of plant defense-related genes. With the advent of genomics and proteomics, several genes essential for the development of AM have been identified and their regulation mechanisms are being elucidated. Hitherto, it is known that plants secrete several compounds that stimulate spore germination and the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). There is also evidence that AMF synthesize molecules that are recognized by the host plants. At least three genes are essential for the recognition of this molecule and the transduction of the molecular signal. The roles of these genes and the possible mechanisms regulating their expression, as well as the role of PH in controlling AM development are discussed in this review.","[Kiriachek, Soraya Gabriela; Basilio de Azevedo, Lucas Carvalho; Lambais, Marcio Rodrigues] ESALQ, Dept Ciencia Solo, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Pereira Peres, Lazaro Eustaquio] ESALQ, Dept Ciencias Biol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","Kiriachek, SG (reprint author), ESALQ, Dept Ciencia Solo, Caixa Postal 09,Av Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",skiriachek@gmail.com; lucascba@cefeturutai.edu.br; mlambais@esalq.usp.br; lazaropp@esalq.usp.br,"Lambais, Marcio/C-1319-2012; Peres, Lazaro EP/C-1598-2012; Azevedo, Lucas/F-8609-2012","Lambais, Marcio/0000-0002-7218-3665; Peres, Lazaro EP/0000-0002-8761-5934; ",,,,130,18,24,1,34,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

Truffle orchard management, mycorrhizal development and seedling growth were studied. Fourteen additional truffle orchards containing more than 2000 Q. robur were established during 2000 and 2001. In 2004, T. aestivum mycorrhizae were detected in all truffle orchards. In 2005, the first T. aestivum truffle was found, 6 years after planting. This is the first cultivated truffle in Scandinavia and despite the northerly location they were produced within a timescale comparable with France. Tuber aestivum mycorrhizae survived in soils which differed from naturally producing locations by having a sand content 95%, pH 6.4 and calcium content 0.1%. In a second series of experiments Swedish Q. robur, C. avellana and Carpinus betulus seedlings were inoculated with Swedish T. aestivum. Eleven months after inoculation T. aestivum mycorrhizae were found in 0-78% of the seedlings, depending on species, inoculation treatment and substrate. Because of the continuing decline of oaks in Sweden and associated fauna and flora, truffle cultivation may favour oak forest restoration programmes as well as making a direct contribution to rural economies.","[Weden, Christina] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Chem, Div Pharmacognosy, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [Pettersson, Lina] Kalmar Kronoberg Cty Agr Soc, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Danell, Eric] Uppsala Univ, Bot Sect, Museum Evolut, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden","Weden, C (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Chem, Div Pharmacognosy, BMC,Box 574, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden.",Christina.Weden@fkog.uu.se,,,Municipality of Gotland; European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee FundEuropean Union (EU); European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU); Konsul Faxes Fund; KK Foundation; Sparbanksstiftelsen Alfa; Carl the XVI Gustafs 50th Anniversary Fund; Carl Tryggers Foundation,"We are grateful to Gerard Chevalier and Alessandra Zambonelli for mycorrhiza confirmation, and to Gerard Chevalier for valuable advice on truffle cultivation.

However, little is known about the microbial communities that mediate the rhizosphere carbon dynamics, especially how their activity is influenced by changes in soil management. We combined a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labeling experiment with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis in differently managed Belgian grasslands to identify the active rhizodeposit-C assimilating microbial communities in these grasslands and to evaluate their response to management practices. Experimental treatments consisted of three mineral N fertilization levels (0, 225 and 450 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and two mowing frequencies (3 and 5 times y-1). Phospholipid fatty acids were extracted from surface (0-5 cm) bulk (BU) and root-adhering (RA) soil samples prior to and 24 h after pulse-labeling and were analyzed by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-c-IRMS). Soil habitats significantly differed in microbial community structure (as revealed by multivariate analysis of mol% biomarker PLFAs) as well as in gram-positive bacterial rhizodeposit-C uptake (as revealed by greater C-13-PLFA enrichment following pulse-labeling in RA compared to BU soil in the 450N/5M treatment). Mowing frequency did not significantly alter the relative abundance (mol%) or activity (C-13 enrichment) of microbial communities. In the non-fertilized treatment, the greatest C-13 enrichment was seen in all fungal biomarker PLFAs (C16:1 omega 5, C18:1 omega 9, C18:2 omega 6,9 and C18:3 omega 3,6,9), which demonstrates a prominent contribution of fungi in the processing of new photosynthate-C in non-fertilized grassland soils. In all treatments, the lowest C-13 enrichment was found in gram-positive bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs. Fungal biomarker PLFAs had significantly lower C-13 enrichment in the fertilized compared to non-fertilized treatments in BU soil (C16:1 omega 5, C18:1 omega 9) as well as RA soil (all fungal biomarkers). While these observations clearly indicated a negative effect of N fertilization on fungal assimilation of plant-derived C, the effect of N fertilization on fungal abundance could only be detected for the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) PLFA (C16:1w5). On the other hand, increases in the relative abundance of gram-positive bacterial PLFAs with N fertilization were found without concomitant increasesin C-13 enrichment following pulse-labeling.

The general pathways of phenol biosynthesis are known, but the regulation and controlling factors determining the quality and quantity of phenols in plant tissue remain active and controversial areas of research. Much of the controversy arises because regulating factors at several levels, ranging from intrinsic species- and genotype-specific factors- to various extrinsic environmental factors, may interact with each other resulting in a wide variation of plant polyphenol production among and within species through time and space. Production of secondary compounds in plants may be induced at the level of the phenotype in response to abiotic factors which might additionally affect genotype selection in the long term. Both short-term phenotypic variations and genotype selection at larger timescale have implication for litter quality input and soil phenol contents. The multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors involved in the regulation of plant phenol production is comprehensively discussed here. Specific issues will be focused on the causes that affect the biosynthesis of plant phenols and in turn the composition and concentration of soil phenolic compounds.","[Muscolo, A.; Sidari, M.] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept Agr & Forest Syst Management, I-89060 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy","Muscolo, A (reprint author), Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept Agr & Forest Syst Management, I-89060 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",,"Muscolo, Adele M/O-5875-2015","Muscolo, Adele M/0000-0002-0439-1614",,,,116,1,1,0,2,"NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC",HAUPPAUGE,"400 OSER AVE, STE 1600, HAUPPAUGE, NY 11788-3635 USA",,,978-1-60876-264-4,AGR ISSUES POLICIES,,,2009,,,,,,,1,30,,,,,30,Soil Science,Agriculture,BRR04,WOS:000283460400001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rudawska, M; Leski, T",,,,"Rudawska, Maria; Leski, Tomasz",,,The significance of knowledge about ectomycorrhizal fungal community in bare-root nurseries for artificial inoculation,SYLWAN,,,Polish,Article,,,,,,forest nurseries; seedlings; ectomycorrhizal fungi; ascomycetes; basidiomycetes,NORWAY SPRUCE SEEDLINGS; FOREST NURSERIES,"This review is based on our observations and detailed studies conducted in more than 100 bare-root forest nurseries in Poland.

Parameters examined included those controlling biomass growth and turnover, dead organic matter decay and model initialization. our approach is based on the use of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis software packages that are freely available on the Internet and accessible to model users. We simulated four different landscapes, three with different species but the same rotation length and one using the same species with two different rotation lengths, to evaluate interactions between modelled scenarios and assumptions about parameter variability. We assessed the impacts of parameter variation on stocks and fluxes. The model was sensitive to variation in parameters controlling the foliage and fine root pathways, but the sensitivity differed depending on whether a softwood or hardwood landscape was being simulated. our findings indicate that inferences drawn from sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of forest carbon models are specific to the landscapes and time horizons being modelled.

However, permanent vegetation change will occur only if tree recruitment patterns are also affected. Here, we analyze how a massive mortality event triggered by the 1998-1999 drought affected adult and sapling mortality and recruitment in a mixed Nothofagus dombeyi (Mirb.) Blume-Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Flor. et Boult. forests of northern Patagonia. Comparing drought-induced and tree-fall gaps, we assessed changes in forest composition, microenvironments, and seedling density and survival of both species. Drought-kill disturbance shifted species composition of both canopy and sapling cohorts in favour of A. chilensis. Drought gaps were characterized by a shadier and more xeric environment, affecting the recruitment pattern of N. dombeyi seedlings. The seedling cohort was composed mostly of A. chilensis, and its survival was always higher than that of N. dombeyi. Additionally, A. chilensis seedlings showed higher plasticity than N. dombeyi seedlings, increasing its root to shoot ratios in drought gaps. The results suggest that extreme drought itself is a strong driving force in forest dynamics, with important imprints on forest landscapes. Future climate-change scenarios, projecting an increased in frequency and severity of droughts, alert us about expected long-term compositional shifts in many forest ecosystems.","[Suarez, Maria L.; Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Suarez, ML (reprint author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",marialau.suarez@gmail.com,"Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121",,,,42,70,71,0,23,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS,OTTAWA,"BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Quercus montana and Q. rubra were the most susceptible oak species to stem inoculation. Lesion sizes were considerably larger when 20-year-old trees were inoculated. Generally, no significant differences in lesion sizes were detected in greenhouse tests when the summer and fall inoculation periods were compared.

The industrial ripper was used in one pass across the experimental plots and the prototype ripper in both two and four passes. While the maximum root depths, after five growing seasons, attained by trees were similar to the target soil loosening depths for the cultivation techniques, the total number of roots suggests that root development was not uniform across the soil profile. All treatments significantly increased both the maximum root depth and total number of roots compared with the untreated control; the complete cultivation had approximately double the number of roots compared with the other treatments. Larger average root diameters and a higher percentage of coarse roots also suggest that roots experienced physical restriction in the control, two-pass prototype and industrial ripper plots. Similarly, while all species had attained significantly greater height growth on the treated soils compared with the control, the height of A. cordata, L. kaempferi and B. pendula was greatest after complete cultivation.

One-year-old rooted cuttings were grown individually in pots containing sandy soil in a greenhouse for 90 days in four water-table depth treatments: constant depth at 45 cm from the soil surface, constant depth at 30 cm, constant depth at 15 cm, and fluctuating depths between 45 and 30 cm. Growth responses, biomass partitioning, and structure and morphology of leaves and roots were determined for harvested trees every 30 days. Fine (< 1-mm diameter) root growth was affected by water-table levels and water profiles, even in the fluctuating water-table depth treatment. Fine root proliferation was inhibited below the water table and was stimulated in the layers just above the water table and near the soil surface. At the whole-plant level, with deeper water tables, P. alba allocated more biomass to roots and root morphology changed, but total root length did not increase, suggesting that trees faced with soil water deficits are not likely to increase root surface area to obtain more water. Total biomass and root length in each treatment were positively correlated and the relationships were similar among the treatments, although the growth responses varied under the various water-table conditions. These results suggest that variation in root length may have an important effect on the biomass of the rooted cuttings across a gradient of water-table depths.","[Imada, S.; Yamanaka, N.; Tamai, S.] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan","Imada, S (reprint author), Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan.",s-imada@alrc.tottori-u.ac.jp,,,,,,42,49,55,4,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Karst savannas, like many savannas elsewhere, are encroached by woody plants, with possibly negative consequences on aquifer recharge. However, the role of savanna tree species in hydrological processes remains unclear, not least because the location and water absorption zones of tree roots in the spatially complex subsurface strata are unknown. This study examined the water sources and water relations of two savanna trees, Quercus fusiformis (Small) and Juniperus ashei (Buchholz) in the karst region of the eastern Edwards Plateau, Texas (USA). Stable isotope analysis of stem water revealed that both species took up evaporatively enriched water during the warm season, suggesting a relatively shallow water source in the epikarst, the transition zone between soil and bedrock. Q. fusiformis had consistently higher predawn water potentials than J. ashei during drought, and thus was probably deeper-rooted and less capable of maintaining gas exchange at low water potentials. Although the water potential of both species recovered after drought-breaking spring and summer rain events, associated shifts in stem water isotope ratios did not indicate significant uptake of rainwater from the shallow soil. A hypothesis is developed to explain this phenomenon invoking a piston-flow mechanism that pushes water stored in macropores into the active root zones of the trees. Epikarst structure varied greatly with parent material and topography, and had strong effects on seasonal fluctuations in plant water status. The study suggests that tree species of the Edwards Plateau do not commonly reduce aquifer recharge by tapping directly into perched water tables, but more likely by reducing water storage in the epikarst. A more general conclusion is that models of savanna water relations based on Walter's two-layer model may not apply unequivocally to karst savannas.","SW Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Schwinning, S (reprint author), SW Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",schwinn@txstate.edu,"Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291","Texas State University-San Marcos, College of Science","This research was supported by a start-up grant from Texas State University-San Marcos, College of Science.

The results showed that the speciation of Cu and Cd in the rhizosphere was significantly influenced by inoculation of ectomycorrhizal fungus Boletus edulis. Compared to the rhizosphere, the content of exchangeable Cu slightly decreased in the mycorrhizosphere of the seedlings grown in 166 and 400 mg kg(-1) Cu contaminated soil, whereas the exchangeable Cd in the mycorrhizosphere decreased remarkably to only 33% and to 60% that of the rhizosphere at 0.75 and 1.50 mg kg(-1) Cd levels, respectively. These indicate the potential capacity of mycorrhizas to alleviate the damage of heavy metals to the host plants by reducing the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil. Distribution of the 4 tested fractions of Cu and Cd at different contamination levels showed that there was a strong tendency of changing from loosely associated fractions to strongly associated fractions in the mycorrhizosphere. The most stable Cd fraction, organically bound Cd, was significantly larger in the mycorrhizosphere than in the rhizosphere at different Cd contamination levels. This phenomenon was also observed for Cu but the difference was not statistically significant.","[Huang Yi; Li Ting; Huang Zhi-Ji; Fei Ying-Heng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Huang, Y (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yhuang@pku.edu.cn,,"Fei, Ying-heng/0000-0002-3542-4634",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [20777004],Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 20777004).,,33,9,9,1,19,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,DEC,2008,18,6,,,,,758,765,,10.1016/S1002-0160(08)60071-5,,,8,Soil Science,Agriculture,381PP,WOS:000261548700009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Palfner, G; Canseco, MI; Casanova-Katny, A",,,,"Palfner, Goetz; Ines Canseco, Maria; Casanova-Katny, Angelica",,,Post-fire seedlings of Nothofagus alpina in Southern Chile show strong dominance of a single ectomycorrhizal fungus and a vertical shift in root architecture,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Descolea antarctica; Ectomycorrhizal community; Fire; Nothofagus alpina; Regeneration; Tertiary root morphology,RESISTANT PROPAGULES; FOREST; FIRE; COMMUNITIES; WILDFIRE; PONDEROSA; SOIL,"We investigated belowground responses of Nothofagus alpina seedlings to post-fire conditions during natural regeneration after a wildfire in Chile, focusing on mycorrhizal community and root architecture. The complete root systems of 2-year-old N. alpina seedlings were extracted from a post-fire site with natural regeneration and compared to roots of seedlings from undisturbed forest nearby. Mycorrhizal morphotype richness was determined in each seedling. Morphometric parameters of tertiary root structure and dry biomass of whole root systems were determined in 5 cm vertical intervals and in four lateral root classes. With 43.5% of colonized vital mycorrhizal root tips, the Basidiomycete Descolea antarctica was the most abundant fungal symbiont on post-fire seedlings. Tertiary root morphology of these seedlings was distinct from control plants and characterized by a deep-reaching tap root with rather evenly distributed lateral branches whereas seedlings from the undisturbed site had shallower root systems with most lateral roots concentrated in the upper soil layers. Post-fire seedlings had more mycorrhizal rootlets and mycorrhiza-bearing third order lateral roots than control plants which was expressed in a 34% higher total root number but only a 10% higher total root biomass, although both values were not statistically significant. A major part of these fine roots in seedlings from burnt forest was found in deeper soil horizons, compared to the seedlings from undisturbed forest. According to our results, post-fire conditions clearly favour Descolea antarctica as an early ectomycorrhizal colonizer of Nothofagus seedlings at the studied site. As no significant changes in soil chemistry could be observed at the burnt site, the deep-reaching tertiary root architecture of these seedlings may be interpreted as a response to other abiotic factors like reduced moisture in surface soil.","[Palfner, Goetz] Univ Concepcion, Lab Quim Prod Nat, Dept Bot, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile; [Ines Canseco, Maria] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agropecuarias & Forestales, Dept Recursos Nat, Temuco, Chile; [Casanova-Katny, Angelica] Univ Concepcion, Ctr Biotecnol, Concepcion, Chile","Palfner, G (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Lab Quim Prod Nat, Dept Bot, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",gpalfner@udec.cl; ines.canseco@gmail.com; angecasanova@udec.cl,,,"Research Department of the La Frontera University, Temuco [PPF 140306]","We would like to thank the following persons and institutions: CONAF ( Chilean National Forest Corporation) for the permission to perform sampling and for sharing site-specific information and field data, especially Miguel Angel Jara, CONAF Temuco and the park rangers of the Malleco forest reserve, Niblinto station, who always gave us professional logistic support during the field work; the Research Department of the La Frontera University, Temuco for assigning research grant PPF 140306 to G.

Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1 omega 5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific delta(13)C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the example of rhizobia-legume symbiosis, we addressed these feedbacks in terms of the metabolic (C <-> N) exchange resulting in the parallel improvements of the partners' fitness (positive feedbacks). These improvements are correlated to the symbiotic efficiency dependent on the ratio of N(2)-fixing bacterial strains (""genuine mutualists"") to the non-N(2)-fixing strains (""symbiotic cheaters"") in the root nodules. The computer experiments demonstrated that an interplay between the frequency-dependent selection (FDS) and the Darwinian (frequency-independent) selection pressures implemented in the partners' populations ensures an anchoring or even domination for the newly generated host-specific mutualists (which form N2-fixing nodules only with one of two, available plant genotypes) more successfully than for the non-host-specific mutualists (which form N(2)-fixing nodules with both plant genotypes). The created model allows us to consider the mutualistic symbiosis as a finely balanced polymorphic system wherein the equilibrium in bacterial population may be shifted in favor of ""genuine mutualists"" due to the partner-stipulated selection for an improved symbiotic efficiency implemented in the plant population.

KUNTZE; ANCHORAGE; RESPONSES; ARCHITECTURE; COMPACTION; SEEDLINGS; NITROGEN; TREES,"Araucaria angustifolia is a critically endangered tall tree species of valuable wood, and field observations led to the suggestion that limitations imposed to the vertical growth of its tap root system greatly restrict the height of mature individuals. However, experimental studies dealing with the effects of soil depth on the species growth are mostly lacking. This study evaluated and compared the growth responses of young plants of A. angustifolia to distinct rooting depths but same soil volumes. Seeds were planted in pots of different heights and diameters, all containing 3 liters of soil mixture. Plants were submitted to four available rooting depths: 65 (T1), 35 (T2), 20 (T3), and 10 (T4) cm. There were eight experimental units in each treatment, arranged in a randomized complete block design, each block containing two units per treatment. Contrary to what was expected, the T3 and T4 plants had accumulated more mass and attained the same height as the other two groups, after a 10-month growth period in a green house. Those plants also had thicker stems, longer shoot branches, and thicker and longer lateral roots, which were interpreted as compensatory responses to increase plant anchorage and stability. The inverse relationship between rooting depth and plant mass was attributed to a down-regulation of shoot growth because or restricted lateral space and/or poor soil aeration of the longer and narrower pots. This experiment allowed us to demonstrate that is not the possibility of the tap root to grow deep into the soil that ensures a better growth to plants of A. angustifolia: provided that the offer of soil volume and resources are the same, the vertical extension of the tap root does not result in greater growth of the plants. In fact, much greater growth impairment is expected from lateral than from vertical restriction to root growth.","[Korndoerfer, Carla L.; Mosena, Morgana; Dillenburg, Lucia R.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Dillenburg, LR (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, Campus Vale,Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",lucia.dillenburg@ufrgs.br,"Dillenburg, Lucia Rebello/D-9120-2013",,Agronomy School of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior'' (CAPES/Brazil)CAPES,"We thank the Agronomy School of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul for allowing the use of their greenhouse facilities and the ""Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior'' (CAPES/Brazil) for the fellowship awarded to the first author.

We evaluated microbial communities in soils under oxic, intermittent, and anoxic conditions along a river floodplain continuum using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and 16S rRNA genes-based terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) bacterial fingerprints. in all the soils tested, microbial communities clustered according to soil redox state by both evaluation techniques. Bacteria were dominant components of soil microbial communities, while mycorrhizal fungi composed about 12% of the microbial community in the oxic soils. Gram-positive bacteria consisted >10% of the community in all soils tested and their abundance increased with increasing soil depth when shifting from oxic to anoxic conditions. In the anoxic soils, Gram-positive bacteria composed about 16% of the total community, suggesting that their growth and maintenance were not as sensitive to oxygen supply as for other microbes. In general, microorganisms were more abundant and diverse, and distributed more evenly in the oxic layers than the anoxic layers. The decrease in abundance with increasing oxygen and substrate limitation, however, was considerably more drastic than the decrease in diversity, suggesting that growth of soil microorganisms is more energy demanding than maintenance. The lower diversity in the anoxic than the oxic soils was attributed primarily to the differences in oxygen availability in these soils. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The sites studied were in healthy eucalypt forest, forest in decline and forest containing dead eucalypts dominated by rainforest, in north-east (Eucalyptus delegatensis forest) and in north-west (Eucalyptus coccifera forest) Tasmania. In both regions bare ground, rock and shrubby species were associated with healthy sites whereas decline sites were associated with moss and a tall understorey with a high percentage cover of rainforest species. Healthy sites had low root biomass in the top 10 cm of the soil profile relative to decline and rainforest sites. Seedlings of high altitude species were grown in rainforest soil (0.314% N and 0.060% P) and healthy eucalypt soil (0.253% N and 0.018% P). The four eucalypt species studied had similar root to shoot ratio in the two soils, but the rainforest species, Nothofagus cunninghamii and Leptospermum lanigerum, had higher root to shoot ratio in the healthy eucalypt than in the rainforest soil. We produced three soil filtrates: (i) fungi and bacteria present; (ii) bacteria only present and; and (iii) sterile, from healthy, decline and rainforest sites in north-east and in north-west Tasmania and used linseed as a germination bioassay. Filtrates from the north-east decline and rainforest sites induced a significantly greater dysplastic germination response than healthy sites in (i) and (ii) filtrates, but this was not found in filtrates from sites in the north-west. We conclude that while the development of a rainforest understorey and elevated soil root biomass in the long absence of fire is generally associated with high altitude eucalypt decline, altered bacterial and/or chemical attributes of soil are not always associated with high altitude eucalypt decline.","[Harvest, T.; Davidson, N.

An ORP is a research program in the sense of modern philosopher of science Lakatos' [1978. The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: philosophical papers, vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge] seminal work, An optimality research program has a lengthy history and record of success in the field of behavioural ecology, but has been seldom employed in fungal ecology. We discuss the ORP and provide some examples of how optimality models may be useful in fungal ecology. we suggest that such an approach may benefit experimental fungal ecologists by: providing a framework for organizing knowledge; generating hypotheses; helping in the planning of experiments; aiding in the interpretation of results; and directing the next steps of an experimental research program. We illustrate these benefits by sketching out how an ORP might be used to answer some fundamental questions about the interactions between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Yet, the interaction of increased N availability with other factors that determine plant community composition, are still poorly understood. Here, we test whether the impact of N addition on plant communities depends on the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF are widespread plant symbionts that facilitate growth of many plant species. We hypothesize that AM fungi reduce the negative impact of N addition on plant communities by supporting growth of species that are sensitive to N enrichment.We established experimental grassland microcosms consisting of 18 plant species. These microcosms were subjected to high and low N supply and were inoculated with AMF or remained nonmycorrhizal. Both N addition and AMF had a big impact on plant community composition, but with opposite effects. N addition induced a 2.8-fold increase in grass biomass and reduced legume biomass. Grasses dominated the microcosms at high N supply, especially when AMF were absent. In contrast, AMF enhanced biomass of all legumes species (on average 6.8-fold) and reduced the relative abundance of grasses. The proportion of legume biomass out of total shoot biomass at high N supply was 19% with AMF and only 3% without AMF. Our results show that responses of plant communities to N enrichment depend on AMF and that AMF can reduce the negative impact of increased N availability on plant community structure by reducing grass dominance.","[van der Heijden, Marcel G.

The response of primary production to climatic change has been examined using well-validated mechanistic models, but the same is not true for decomposition, a primary source of atmospheric CO2. We used the Long-term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) dataset and model-selection techniques to choose and parameterize a model that describes global patterns of litter decomposition. Mass loss was best represented by a three-pool negative exponential model, with a rapidly decomposing labile pool, an intermediate pool representing cellulose, and a recalcitrant pool. The initial litter lignin/nitrogen ratio defined the size of labile and intermediate pools. Lignin content determined the size of the recalcitrant pool. The decomposition rate of all pools was modified by climate, but the intermediate pool's decomposition rate was also controlled by relative amounts of litter cellulose and lignin (indicative of lignin-encrusted cellulose). The effect of climate on decomposition was best represented by a composite variable that multiplied a water-stress function by the Lloyd and Taylor variable Q(10) temperature function. Although our model explained nearly 70% of the variation in LIDET data, we observed systematic deviations from model predictions. Below- and aboveground material decomposed at notably different rates, depending on the decomposition stage. Decomposition in certain ecosystem-specific environmental conditions was not well represented by our model; this included roots in very wet and cold soils, and aboveground litter in N-rich and arid sites. Despite these limitations, our model may still be extremely useful for global modeling efforts, because it accurately (R-2=0.6804) described general patterns of long-term global decomposition for a wide array of litter types, using relatively minimal climatic and litter quality data.","[Adair, E.

Eleven individual sugars, including both aldehyde and alcohol sugars, were identified and quantified with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). There was no change in the number of sugars present between 7 and 27 days, but the exudation of alcohol sugars decreased rapidly at about day 12. Xylose and glucose were present in the largest amounts. Defoliation initially increased the total amount of sugars in the exudates, but continuous defoliation reduced total sugar exudation by 16% and induced changes in the exudation patterns of individual sugars. Defoliation enhanced exudation of erythritol, threitol, and xylitol, reduced exudation of glucose and arabitol, but had little effect on the amounts of other sugars exuded. The more complex 6 C, 5 OH aldehyde sugars, especially glucose, showed changes earlier and to a greater extent (17 days), than the 5 C, 4 OH (xylose and ribose) and 6 C 4 OH (fucose) aldehyde groups. These findings confirm the general finding that repeated defoliation reduces the quantity of total sugars exuded, but the pattern of release of individual sugars is complex and variable.","[Clayton, Stephen J.; Murray, Philip J.] N Wyke Res, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England; [Clayton, Stephen J.; Read, Derek B.; Gregory, Peter J.] Univ Reading, Dept Soil Sci, Sch Human & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6DW, Berks, England","Gregory, PJ (reprint author), SCRI, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",peter.gregory@scri.ac.uk,"; Murray, Phil/B-1246-2009","Gregory, Peter/0000-0002-4118-4833; Murray, Phil/0000-0002-5526-8317",University of Reading; Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER) North Wyke; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the UKBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC),This work was supported and jointly funded by the University of Reading and the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER) North Wyke.

The Enemy Release Hypothesis proposes that exotic species gain an advantage in new regions because their natural enemies are lost during invasion; however, enemy release could also occur as a result of much smaller scale movements within an invasive plant's native range, i.e. if it escapes enemies while colonizing new sites. Few studies have considered this possibility, and none has compared escape from multiple guilds of enemies. 2. We studied an invasive North American weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), to determine whether it escapes above-ground or below-ground enemies at a local scale in its native range. Exotic populations of this plant are known to have escaped above-ground enemies in Europe. 3. Experimental populations of ragweed isolated from existing populations by just 100 m experienced reduced levels of damage by invertebrate folivores and seed predators; however, there was no clear evidence that this escape led to improved performance. 4. Plants inoculated with unsterilized soil grew better than plants in sterile soil, likely reflecting a need for mycorrhizal colonization. Inoculum from ragweed populations was as beneficial as inoculum from nearby ragweed-free sites, suggesting only a small initial role for site-specific pathogens. 5. Performance declined over time when plants were serially inoculated with non-sterile soil, indicating negative feedback with the soil biota. This feedback was stronger for inocula derived from ragweed populations vs. those from nearby ragweed-free sites. 6. Seeds buried in ragweed populations were less likely to germinate subsequently than seeds buried in nearby ragweed-free sites. This difference was not reduced by treatment with fungicide; consequently, the mechanism is unclear. 7. Synthesis. These results indicate that ragweed can escape both above-ground and below-ground enemies by dispersing to new sites, resulting in reduced levels of folivory, seed predation, soil feedback and perhaps losses to seed pathogens. Although consequences often may be small, this demonstrates that enemy release can occur for native as well as exotic populations of this species, linking possible mechanisms of local spread with long-distance invasion.","[MacKay, James; Kotanen, Peter M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Kotanen, PM (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd N, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",peter.kotanen@utoronto.ca,,"Kotanen, Peter/0000-0002-7842-8715",NSERC Research and EquipmentNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; Koffler Scientific Reserve,"This research was supported by NSERC Research and Equipment Grants (PMK), the Ontario Graduate Scholarship program (JM), and the Koffler Scientific Reserve at Jokers Hill.

We carried out two screened growing-house experiments with seedlings of Gustavia superba (Lecythidaceae) to test hypotheses proposed to explain why cotyledons are retained. We grew seedlings from large and small seeds in suit and shade to determine if cotyledon reserves Supplement photosynthetic carbon gain, and in a second experiment applied defoliation and shoot removal treatments to determine if reserves are allocated to resprout tissue. In each experiment we tracked cotyledonary resource use over time and measured the fraction of seedling biomass allocated to roots and shoots. We found no evidence that light environment, seed size or damage treatment affected the rate of cotyledon resource usage; 20% of the cotyledonary mass remained 9 wk after leaves were fully developed in both suit and shade and 25-30%, of the cotyledonary mass remained 6 wk after leaf or shoot removal. Instead, cotyledon reserves appear to be slowly translocated to roots regardless of light environment or seedling damage. Once seedlings are established, lost tissue is replaced using reserves stored in roots: in high light, damaged seedlings had a lower root mass fraction (0.42) than undamaged ones (0.56) when considering the mass of tissue removed and resprout tissue combined. We conclude that cotyledon reserves are important for resprouting during early seedling emergence and establishment. but do not directly contribute to seedling growth or biomass recovery from herbivores at the post-establishment stage. Persistence of cotyledons may ultimately depend on the development of sufficient root mass for reserve reallocation.","[Barberis, Ignacio M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Dalling, James W.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Dalling, James W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Barberis, IM (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Zavalla, Argentina.",ignaciobarberis@yahoo.com,,"Barberis, Ignacio Martin/0000-0002-6605-9270","FOMEC; Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina","I.M.B. acknowledges FOMEC, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina, for financial support for his PhD including the fieldwork and living expenses in Panama.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were identified using molecular methods including seven specific primer pairs for regions of the ribosomal DNA that amplify different subgroups of AMF. Roots of Dichanthelium lanuginosum, a grass only occurring in geothermal areas, were sampled along with thermal and nonthermal Agrostis scabra and control plants growing outside the thermally influenced sites. In addition, root samples of Agrostis stolonifera from geothermal areas of Iceland were analyzed to identify possible common mycosymbionts between these geographically isolated locations. In YNP, 16 ribosomal DNA phylotypes belonging to the genera Archaeospora, Glomus, Paraglomus, Scutellospora, and Acaulospora were detected. Eight of these phylotypes could be assigned to known morphospecies, two others have been reported previously in molecular studies from different environments, and six were new to science. The most diverse and abundant lineage was Glomus group A, with the most frequent phylotype corresponding to Glomus intraradices. Five of the seven phylotypes detected in a preliminary sampling in a geothermal area in Iceland were also found in YNP. Nonthermal vegetation was dominated by a high diversity of Glomus group A phylotypes while nonthermal plants were not. Using multivariate analyses, a subset of three phylotypes were determined to be associated with geothermal conditions in the field sites analyzed. In conclusion, AMF communities in geothermal soils are distinct in their composition, including both unique phylotypes and generalist fungi that occur across a broad range of environmental conditions.","[Appoloni, Susann; Redecker, Dirk] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Lekberg, Ylva; Tercek, Michael T.; Zabinski, Catherine A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Redecker, D (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Hebelstr 1, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",dirk.redecker@unibas.ch,,,"Thermal Biology Institute, Montana State University","This work was funded by a grant from the Thermal Biology Institute, Montana State University, to C.

Investigating stem respiration using CO(2) flux measurements is complicated by uncertainty surrounding the source of CO(2) diffusing from tree stems. Over 2 years we measured the stem efflux from 24 trees exposed to ambient or elevated CO(2). The rate of stem CO(2) efflux increased with annual tree diameter increment and the estimated uptake of dissolved CO(2) from the soil. To determine the source of CO(2) diffusing from tree stems, we used the fumigation gas at the Duke Forest Atmosphere Carbon Transfer and Storage-1 elevated-CO(2) experiment as a (13)C tracer and measured the presence of soil CO(2) in stem efflux on a subset of these trees. The isotopic composition of soil CO(2) explained a considerable portion of the variation in the composition of CO(2) in stem efflux. We also found that direct measurements of the isotopic composition of phloem-respired CO(2), unlike the CO(2) found in stem efflux, was less variable and distinct from the isotopic composition of soil CO(2). Tree growth rates and soil CO(2) concentrations found at the site together explained 56% of the variance in stem CO(2) efflux among trees. These results suggest that the uptake of CO(2) dissolved in soil water and transported through the vascular system can potentially confound efforts to interpret stem efflux measurements in trees exposed to elevated CO(2) and that previous studies may have overestimated the effects of elevated CO(2) on autotrophic respiration in tree stems.","[DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Moore, David J.

Though they often share most recent common ancestors with wood-rotting fungi, it is unclear to what extent EM fungi retain the ability to express enzymes that break down woody substrates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant EM fungus in a pure pine system retains the ability to produce enzymes that break down woody substrates in a natural setting, and that this ability is inducible by reduction of host photosynthetic potential via partial defoliation. To achieve this, pines in replicate blocks were defoliated 50% by needle removal, and enzyme activities were measured in individual EM root tips that had been treated with antibiotics to prevent possible bacterial activity. Results indicate that the dominant EM fungal species (Suillus granulatus) expressed all enzymes tested (endocellulase D-glucosidase, laccase, manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, phosphatase and protease), and that activities of these enzymes increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to defoliation. Thus, this EM fungus (one of the more specialized mutualists of pine) has the potential to play a significant role in C, N and P cycling in this forested ecosystem. Therefore, many above-ground factors that reduce photosynthetic potential or divert fixed C from roots may have wide-reaching ecosystem effects.","[Cullings, Ken; Ishkhanova, Galina] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Henson, Joan] Montana State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Cullings, K (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, MS 239-11, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",cullings1@earthlink.net; jhenson@montana.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0211848],This work was supported by an NSF grant to Henson and Cullings (NSF Ecology 0211848).

To better understand natural plant communities and the ecological processes they control it is important to understand what determines the distribution and diversity of AMF. We tested three putative niche axes: plant species composition, disturbance history, and soil chemistry against AMF species composition to determine which axis correlated most strongly with a changing AMF community. Due to a scale dependency we were not able to absolutely rank their importance, but we did find that each correlated significantly with AMF community change at our site. Among soil properties, pH and NO3 were found to be especially good predictors of AMF community change. In a similar analysis of the plant community we found that time since disturbance had by far the largest impact on community composition.","[Fitzsimons, Michael S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fitzsimons, Michael S.; Miller, R.

Nine traits related to biomass allocation, root topology, morphology, chemical composition and mycorrhizal colonisation were examined for nine C-3 herbaceous species grown in controlled conditions. Poaceae differed from Fabaceae for the whole set of root traits examined except mycorrhizal colonisation, while Asteraceae showed intermediate characteristics. As compared to Fabaceae, Poaceae allocated more biomass to roots; showed a more sparsely branched root system with a small average root diameter, a high root dry matter content and a low nitrogen concentration. Root respiration was weakly related to root mass ratio and root dry matter content; no significant relationship was found between root functions and root architecture or morphology. This study shows that plant classification based on taxonomic affiliation reflects differences in root system traits and functions. Whole root system traits do not allow strong predictions of root respiration and exudation, perhaps because these processes are more linked to fine root than to whole root system traits.","[Roumet, Catherine; Lafont, Francoise; Warembourg, Fernand; Garnier, Eric] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Sari, Muhaymina] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Roumet, C (reprint author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",catherine.roumet@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",,,,60,28,28,1,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2008,312,2-Jan,,,,,69,83,,10.1007/s11104-008-9635-z,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,355XM,WOS:000259742700008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Shah, MA; Reshi, Z; Rashid, I",,,,"Shah, Manzoor A.; Reshi, Zafar; Rashid, Irfan",,,"Mycorrhizosphere mediated Mayweed Chamomile invasion in the Kashmir Himalaya, India",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,2nd International Conference on Rhizosphere,"AUG, 2007","Montpellier, FRANCE",,,Anthemis cotula; arbuscular mycorrhizas; Chamomile invasion; India; Kashmir Himalaya; mycorrhizosphere,ANTHEMIS-COTULA L.; CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; PLANT; GRASSLAND; IDENTITY; ROOTS; COMPETITION; INFECTION; GRASSES,"Recent studies have established the controlling influence of rhizospheric biota, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), on colonization and spread of some alien plants in their introduced range. But how AMF from different geographical sources influence traits that contribute to invasiveness, particularly in presence of neighbouring plants of other species, has been rarely investigated. Thus, we compared the influence of some local (Kashmir Himalayan isolates) and non-local (isolates from Rajasthan, India) AMF isolates of Glomus moseae, G. fasciculatum and Gigaspora margarita on vegetative and reproductive attributes of Mayweed Chamomile (Anthemis cotula L.), a highly invasive species in the Kashmir Himalaya, India. We also examined whether or not the neighbouring plant species, namely Daucus carota L. (Apiaceae) alters the mutualistic interaction between the AMF and A. cotula. Pot experiments revealed greater positive impact of the local than the non-local AMF on vegetative as well as reproductive attributes of A. cotula. Experimental field studies showed that the incidence of highly prevalent Arum-type mycorrhizal colonization in natural populations of A. cotula was reduced in presence of D. carota. Besides, the local AMF significantly promoted growth of A. cotula more than D. carota under mixed-culture conditions. These results suggest that the facilitation of some alien plant invasions by AMF needs to be considered together with plant-plant interactions and invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community.","[Shah, Manzoor A.; Reshi, Zafar; Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India","Shah, MA (reprint author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",mashah75@yahoo.com; zreshi@yahoo.com; ecoirfan@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,37,12,16,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2008,312,2-Jan,,,,,219,225,,10.1007/s11104-008-9706-1,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,355XM,WOS:000259742700020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rowe, HI; Brown, CS",,,,"Rowe, Helen I.; Brown, Cynthia S.",,,Native Plant Growth and Seedling Establishment in Soils Influenced by Bromus tectorum,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; cheatgrass; invasions; native species; Rocky Mountain National Park,ARBUSCULAR-MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ALTERS NITROGEN DYNAMICS; ARID GRASSLAND; GREAT-BASIN; INVASION; ROOTS; AVAILABILITY; COLONIZATION; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM,"The invasion of 40 million hectares Of the American West by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) has caused widespread modifications in the vegetation of semi-arid ecosystems and increased the frequency of fires. In addition to well-understood mechanisms by which cheatgrass gains competitive advantage, it has been implicated in reducing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) abundance and taxa diversity. We evaluated this possibility at a high elevation site in a two-pronged approach. To test whether cheatgrass changed native AMF communities in ways that affected subsequent native plant growth, we grew cheatgrass and native plants in native soils and then planted native plants into these soils in a greenhouse experiment. We found that cheatgrass-influenced soils did not inhibit native plant growth or AMF sporulation or colonization. To test whether soils in cheatgrass-dominated areas inhibited establishment and growth of native plants, cheatgrass was removed and six seeding combinations were applied. We found that 14.02 +/- 1.7 seedlings.m(-2) established and perennial native plant cover increased fourfold over the three years of this study. Glyphosate reduced cheatgrass cover to less than 5% in the year it was applied but did not facilitate native plant establishment or growth compared with no glyphosate. We conclude that cheatgrass influence on the soil community does not appear to contribute to its invasion success in these high elevation soils. It appears the once cheatgrass is controlled on sites with sufficient native plant abundance, there may be few lingering effects to inhibit the natural reestablishment of native plant communities.","[Rowe, Helen I.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Environm, Forestry & Nat Resources Dept, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Rowe, HI (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Ctr Environm, Forestry & Nat Resources Dept, 503 NW Ave, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ivy@purdue.edu,"Brown, Cynthia/K-5814-2012","Rowe, Helen/0000-0002-1545-7658","Dept of the Interior Cooperative Conservation I Initiative; Rocky Mountain National Park; Center for Invasive Plant Management, Bozernan, MT, USA","Research was funded by the Dept of the Interior Cooperative Conservation Initiative, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Center for Invasive Plant Management, Bozernan, MT, USA",,42,9,9,0,18,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Quercus ilex L. seedlings from acorns collected from natural populations in the northern Iberian Peninsula and in a lower elevation and putatively less stressful habitat in the southern Iberian Peninsula were grown in pots under the same conditions. Growth and maintenance respiration were measured by CO, exchange. Young leaves from 5-month-old seedlings of both populations had similar mean specific leaf areas, nitrogen and carbon concentrations and specific growth rates, and almost identical growth costs (1.26 a glucose g(-1)). Leaf maintenance cost was higher in northern than in the Southern Population (27.3 versus 22.4 mg glucose g(-1) day(-1), P < 0.01). In both populations, leaf maintenance cost decreased by 90% as leaves aged, but even in mature leaves, the maintenance cost was higher in the northern population than in the southern population (3.38 versus 2.53 mg glucose g(-1) day(-1), P < 0.01). The growth costs of fine roots < 1 mm in diameter were similar in the two Populations (1.20 g glucose g(-1)), whereas fine root maintenance cost was higher in the northern population than in the southern population (9.86 versus 7.45 mg glucose g(-1) day(-1); P < 0.05). The results Suggest that the cost of organ maintenance is related to the severity of environmental stress in the native habitat.

Besides, influence of different co-occurring plant species on the AMF-mediated invasiveness of alien species, though rarely investigated, is pivotal to the explicit understanding of the feedback between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and alien plant invasions. We therefore examined the influence of local (Kashmir Himalyan isolates) and foreign (isolates from Rajasthan, India) AMF on invasiveness of alien Anthemis cotula vis-a-vis the effect of three common co-occurring neighbours, Conyza canadensis, Galinsoga parviflora and Sisymbrium loeselii. Field studies revealed high incidence of Arum-type mycorrhizal colonization in natural populations of A. cotula and the pot trials confirmed the reliance of its invasiveness on AMF with the more favourable effect of local than foreign AMF. The mycorrhizal colonization intensity in field populations of A. cotula was strongly influenced by neighbour identity with major reduction recorded in the presence of S. loeselii (a cruciferous non-host) in comparison to other con-familial neighbours. Pot experiments confirmed the differential effect of co-occurring species on A. cotula's invasive traits. These results signify that the facilitative role of AMF communities in invasion by some alien plants is contingent upon neighbour identity and the present approach provides not only a framework for further examination of the invasive plant-soil biota feedback, but also many important management implications.

In a laboratory experiment, two forest soils of contrasting characteristics in both pH and clay content were examined for changes in their bacterial communities after lincomycin treatment. The two soils were incubated in beakers and treated with three dosages of lincomycin. Changes in bacterial community were assessed by (i) cultivation of bacteria on two different media, and percentage of resistant colonies at two lincomycin concentrations; (ii) analysis of putative actinomycete isolates for antibiotic activities and resistance; (iii) TRFLP diversity profiles of the 16S rDNA and homologues of the resistance gene lmrB; and (iv) cloning-sequencing of PCR amplicons of both 16S rDNA and lmrB homologues. In cultivation, no increase in percentage of resistant strains in lincomycin-treated versus untreated soils was detected. Similar numbers of bacterial cells were determined by DAPI staining in the two, treated or untreated, soils; but significantly higher numbers of both total bacteria and actinomycetes were cultivated from all treatments of the high pH soil. Significantly higher numbers of antibiotic-producing bacteria as well as resistant bacteria were found in the low pH soil. Significant shifts in bacterial diversity (16S rRNA gene) were demonstrated after lincomycin treatment for the high pH soil, while the low pH soil with a higher percentage of actinomycetes and higher diversity of the lmrB homologue genes did not change after treatment. Finally, sequencing of 157 new clones of lmrB homologues revealed that the antibiotic treatment significantly influenced selection for lmrB homologues in both soils. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We established 662 1 m x 1 m plots, measured the cover of each species and found that there were 33 orchid species distributed mainly in two different habitats, i.e. travertine areas and forest. In the travertine areas, 30 orchid species were found; the six most common ones being Cypripedium bardolphianum, Cypripedium flavum, Cypripedium tibeticum, Galearis diantha, Ponerorchis chusua and Phaius delavayi. However in the forested habitat, we found 21 orchid species; the most common ones being Tipularia szechuanica and Goodyera repens. Travertine areas had a higher number of orchid species as well as higher numbers of orchid species per plot as compared to forest. Light availability seems critical to the performance and distribution of orchid species. Stream flow through the travertine area during the orchids growing season appears to be an important factor in shaping and maintaining stable microenvironments favorable to the growth and reproduction of orchids. The results presented in this study suggest that some orchid species in the travertine area might be threatened if the travertine stream flows were to change or be disrupted.","[Huang, Bao-Qiang; Yang, Xiao-Qin; Luo, Yi-Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bao-Qiang] Nanchang Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bao-Qiang; Yang, Xiao-Qin] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fei-Hai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Res Ctr Plant Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yi-Bo] Natl Orchid Conservat Ctr, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tai, Yun-Dong] Huanglong Adm Natl Scen Spot, Huanglong 624000, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Luo, YB (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",luoyb@ibcas.ac.cn,"Yu, Fei-Hai/O-9395-2016","Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [Key Innovation Plan kzcx2-yw-415]; Co-researching Station of Institute of Botany; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; Huanglong Administration of National Scenic Spots, Sichuan, China","We especially thank Prof Marilyn Light for helpful comments with the manuscript and the kind assistance with the English text.

Any delay in snowpack formation could increase soil freezing in winter and, thereby, alter soil characteristics and processes. We examined the hypothesis that delayed snowpack would disrupt soil structure and change organic matter bioavailability in an experimental snow removal study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, USA. Pairs of reference and snow removal treatment plots were studied in four different sites at HBEF. Snow was removed from November-January of two winters, inducing soil freezing throughout both winters. Size class distribution and organic matter concentration and content of aggregates, and carbon and nitrogen mineralization potential of size fractions were quantified for surface mineral soils in the spring of both years immediately after snowmelt. In the first year of sampling, the only significant effect of snow removal was an increase in the smallest (< 53 mu m) size fraction of mineral soil. In the second year, snow removal increased organic matter concentrations of macroaggregate (250-2,000 mu m) and microaggregate (53-250 mu m) size fractions. This change corresponded to an increase in net N mineralization potential and the ratio of N to C mineralized in the macroaggregate fraction, but there were no effects of snow removal on C mineralization. We propose that soil freezing increases the movement of organic matter from organic to mineral soil horizons and increases the N content of mineralizable substrates in mineral soil following years with delayed snowpack formation.","[Steinweg, J.

This was addressed by measuring the impact of a major component of root exudates, polygalacturonic acid (PGA), on the interparticle bond energy and fracture toughness of clay. Pure kaolinite was mixed with 0, 1.2, 2.4, 4.9 or 12.2 g PGA kg(-1) to form test specimens. Half of the specimens were washed repeatedly to remove unbound PGA and evaluate the persistence of the effects, similar to weathering in natural soils. Fracture toughness, K(IC), increased exponentially with added PGA, with washing increasing this trend. In unwashed specimens K(IC) ranged from 54.3 +/- 2.5 kPa m(-1/2) for 0 g PGA kg(-1) to 86.9 +/- 4.7 kPa m(-1/2) for 12.2 g PGA kg(-1). Washing increased K(IC) to 61.3 +/- 1.2 kPa m(-1/2) for 0 g PGA kg(-1) and 132.1 +/- 4.9 kPa m(-1/2) for 12.2 g PGA kg(-1). The apparent bond energy, gamma, of the fracture surface increased from 5.9 +/- 0.6 J m(-2) for 0 g kg(-1) to 12.0 +/- 1.1 J m(-2) for 12.2 g kg(-1) PGA in the unwashed specimens. The washed specimens had gamma of 13.0 +/- 1.9 J m(-2) for 0 g kg(-1) and 21.3 +/- 2.6 J m(-2) for 12.2 g PGA kg(-1). Thus PGA, a major component of root exudates, has a large impact on the fracture toughness and bond energy of clay, and is likely to be a major determinant in the formation of the rhizosphere. This quantification of the thermodynamics of fracture will be useful for modelling rhizosphere formation and stability.","[Hallett, P.

However, how soil is reinforced on a larger scale and the influence of changes in vegetation over time has rarely been investigated. Therefore we carried out a study on the temporal and spatial changes within stands of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don, growing in the Sichuan province of China, an area where shallow landslides are frequent. Soil cores were taken from three neighbouring stands of C. japonica aged 9, 20 and 30 years old and growing on steep slopes. Cores were taken from around trees and the root (<10 mm in diameter) biomass density (root density (RD)) present in each core was measured at different depths. The spatial position of trees at each site was noted and soil shear strength was measured. The tensile strength of a sample of roots from each stand was measured. Using the RD data, the root area ratio (RAR) could be estimated. RAR and root tensile strength were used as input to a model of root reinforcement which determines the additional cohesion, c, or contribution of vegetation to soil. Data were then incorporated into a two dimensional model of slope stability developed in the finite element (FE) code, Plaxis, which calculates the safety factor (FOS), or likelihood of a slope to fail under certain circumstances. We calculated the FOS of slopes with and without C. japonica, taking into account the spatial position of trees at each stand. Results showed that RD was highest in the 9-year-old stand, but that root tensile strength was lowest. In the 30-year-old stand, RD was low but a higher root tensile strength compensated for the decrease in RAR. The FOS increased by only 15-27% when vegetation was present, with the greatest augmentation in the 9-year-old stand. The older stands had been thinned over the years, resulting in large gaps between trees, which would be prone to local soil slippage. This spatial effect was reflected in the FE analysis, which showed a significant relationship between the number of trees and distance between groups of trees in the 20- and 30-year-old stands only. Therefore, when managing fragile slopes, care should be taken when thinning, so that large gaps do not exist between trees, the influence of which is accrued over time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Slower growth after repetitive browsing of young trees has been attributed to a carbon (C) limitation, but data from long-term studies are lacking. To determine if repeated summer browsing causes a C (source) limitation in trees in the long-term, we analysed the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and pools of Betula pubescens saplings subjected to different clipping treatments (unclipped, 33% and 66% shoot removal) for 7 years. 2. The short-term effect of browsing on C allocation was assessed by clipping trees with different browsing histories and analyzing their C and N responses within the same growing season. 3. Long-term repetitive summer browsing significantly decreased sapling growth and soluble sugar (SS) concentrations in fine roots. However, trees subjected to different browsing histories did not change their C partitioning into starch. Although trees with a different browsing history showed differences in the NSC concentrations and pools of leaves, these differences were not maintained through time. 4. Simulated browsing had no significant short-term effect on root C and N pools of birch trees, but it decreased all C pools in leaves, 1-year and current-year stems and the starch and total NSC pools in main stems. 5. We conclude that although browsing may cause a temporary decrease in C pools, B. pubescens trees are able to compensate for such losses and hence are not C-limited in the long-term.","[Palacio, S.; Hester, A.

Plants can host microbial communities whose integrated functions are often responsible for their success. Understanding mechanisms regulating such functions is thus a major goal in ecology. 2. Fungal endophytes of grasses, particularly of the genus Neotyphodium, have been reported to reduce colonization of their host plant by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, it is unclear which mechanism(s) may explain the effects produced by the endophyte and whether these effects are present in nature. 3. We used Schedonorus phoenix (syn. Lolium arundinaceum) plants that were endophyte-free or infected with one of two strains of Neotyphodium coenophialum known to produce different putative allelochemicals to test the hypotheses that (i) allelopathic effects of the endophyte reduce AM fungal spore germination; and (ii) the allelochemical compound(s) are leached into the soil even after the death of S. phoenix, where they reduce AM fungal colonization of other plants. 4. In a first experiment, aqueous extracts from the shoots of S. phoenix were applied onto spores of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices to test germination effects. Both endophyte strains reduced spore germination by approximately 10% relative to endophyte-free controls. 5. In a second experiment, we placed dried shoot material ('thatch') on the soil surface of pots containing Bromus inermis, which were either inoculated with G. intraradices or not. We watered the plants through the thatch, relying upon leaching to translocate potential allelochemicals to the soil. AM fungal colonization of B. inermis was significantly reduced when thatch was infected with the common strain, but not with AR542, compared to the endophyte-free thatch. Furthermore, the arbuscule : vesicle ratio was 11-fold smaller when thatch was infected with the common strain compared to endophyte-free thatch, suggesting that G. intraradices was stressed by the presence of common strain-leachate. 6. We observed situations whereby two ecologically widespread plant-microbe symbioses interact. Potential mechanisms may include allelopathic effects, although other factors are also possible, and leaching is a mode of entry of putative endophyte-induced AM fungal inhibitors in soil. Understanding these processes is important as they affect AM fungal communities which contribute to plant success and, consequentially, grassland ecosystem dynamics.","[Antunes, P. M.; Carvalho, L.

Three soil moisture treatments (5%. 25% and 60%) and two solar radiation levels (100% exposure = 243 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and 40% = 102 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were used in a factorial design to analyze seedling growth response of three rare cactus species (Mammillaria pectinifera, Obregonia denegrii and Coryphantha werdermannii). The variables evaluated were relative growth rate (RGR), root/shoot ratio (R/S), and K (RGR(roots)/RGR(shoot)), obtained from an initial seedling harvest (6-month-old seedlings) and a final harvest 6 months after treatment application. All three species had slow RGRs (0.002-0.012 gg(-1) day(-1)). O. denegrii had the lowest RGR values, but was the only species for which RIS and K varied with soil moisture. While all seedlings responded markedly to soil moisture, no response was observed to radiation treatments. The latter might have been related to the relatively low solar radiation levels present in the greenhouse. Yet, our results suggest that the main benefit nurse plants offer to seedlings is the increase in soil moisture. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods We compiled an extensive phylogeographic data set from field-collected samples based on mitochondrial ND2 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses combined with estimates of divergence times were used to build a model of major biogeographical events affecting the species. Phylogeographic analyses were used to provide insights into smaller-scale processes acting within each major lineage. Results Phylogenetic analysis recovered three major lineages, with divergence dates coincident with late Miocene-early Pliocene arid cycles. One lineage was confined to geographically isolated populations in the Stirling Ranges (Stirling Ranges Lineage, SRL). The continuous range of M. nichollsi was split into two: the Main Range Lineage (MRL) and the Southern Coastal Lineage (SCL). The SCL displays a strong drainage-based population structure, whereas the MRL displays a strong signature of recent expansion, suggesting that these two lineages have had very different biogeographical histories. Main conclusions Late Miocene-Pliocene aridity appears to have isolated populations in the Stirling Ranges and resulted in the formation of two additional lineages on a north-south gradient that are independent of southward-flowing drainage systems. Our results demonstrate that climatic fluctuations are likely to have generated fine-scale phylogeographic structure within M. nichollsi and that catchment regions are important refugia during arid cycles.","[Keogh, J.

We studied the impact of soil frost on the fine-root dynamics of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) by a replicated snow-removal experiment in a mature forest in SE Germany. Snow removal in the three treatment plots reduced soil temperature significantly with minima <-5.5 degrees C in the O layer while the snow-covered control plots never reached temperatures below the freezing point. Sequential soil coring in the O layer at the beginning and at the end of the soil-frost period as well as after thawing revealed that the soil frost treatment increased fine-root mortality by 29%. However, enhanced fine-root production in the snow-removal plots nearly compensated for the fine-root losses caused by low temperatures. These findings were confirmed by minirhizotron observations in the O layer and the upper 25 cm of the mineral soil showing that relative fine-root loss was by far higher in the snow-removal plots than in the control plots. Compensatory fine-root production in the snow-removal plots exceeded fine-root production in the control plots during a period of 8 weeks after the soil frost application by 39% in the O layer while it was similar in both plot types in the mineral soil. Sequential coring and minirhizotron observations led to substantially different fine root-longevity estimates for the soil frost period. However, in both cases, the snow-removal treatment was characterized by a significant reduction in root longevity indicating a faster fine-root turnover. As a consequence, experimental soil frost enhanced the C input to the soil via root death at our study site by approx. 42 g m(-2) and stimulated the C investment towards the root system of the spruce trees due to a higher sink activity.","[Gaul, Dirk; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Gaul, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",dgaul@gwdg.de,,,,,,60,53,56,1,43,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

These rates were obtained from twelve weighable lysimeters with three different soils and two different lower boundary conditions for the time period from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998. In that period, grass vegetation was grown on all lysimeters. These lysimeters are located in Berlin-Dahlem, Germany. One model calculated the soil water balance using the Richards equation. The other one used a capacitance approach. Both models used the same modified Penman formula for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and the same simple empirical vegetation model for the calculation of transpiration, interception, and evaporation. The comparisons of simulated with measured model outputs were analyzed using the modeling-efficiency index A and the root mean squared error RMSE. At some lysimeters, the uncalibrated application of both models led to an underestimation of cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, despite a good simulation quality in terms of IA and RMSE. A calibration of soil-hydraulic and vegetation parameters such as maximum rooting depth resulted in a better fit between simulated and observed cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, but in some cases also decreased the simulation quality of both models in terms of IA and RMSE. The results of this calibration indicated that, in addition to a precise determination of the soil water-retention functions, vegetation parameters such as rooting depth should also be observed. Without such information, the rooting depth is a calibration parameter. However, in some cases, the uncalibrated application of both models also led to an acceptable fit between measured and simulated model outputs.","[Wegehenkel, Martin] ZALF eV, Inst Landscape Syst Anal, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Zhang, Yongqian] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Zenker, Thomas; Diestel, Heiko] Tech Univ Berlin, Dahlem Working Grp Appl Hydrol & Resource Protect, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Wegehenkel, M (reprint author), ZALF eV, Inst Landscape Syst Anal, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",mwegehenkel@zalf.de,"YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008","YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323","German Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food, and Agriculture; Ministry of Agriculture, Environmental Protection; Federal State of Brandenburg (Germany)","This study was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food, and Agriculture and the Ministry of Agriculture, Environmental Protection, and Regional Planning of the Federal State of Brandenburg (Germany).",,36,9,11,0,23,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

The production of EM mycelia was estimated in four Norway spruce forests in south-western Sweden by incubating sand-filled mesh bags (with or without apatite amendment) in the soil for 8 or 20 months. Fungal biomass in the mesh bags was estimated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Subplots of the forests were fertilized with phosphorus and potassium to alleviate possible deficiencies of these elements. The addition of apatite had a positive influence on the growth of EM mycelia but this effect diminished when the forests were fertilized with PK. The extent of the EM growth response to apatite was strongly correlated to the needle P status which supports the view that the forest trees regulate growth of EM fungi in response to P source in the soil. Rare earth elements originating from the apatite accumulated in ectomycorrhizal root tips surrounding the mesh bags but no differences in concentration were found between root tips from control and PK fertilized plots. The potential of EM fungi to reduce phosphorus deficiency in phosphorus poor forests by increasing weathering rates is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Laws.) trees. At the onset of summer, there was a sharp decrease in stomatal conductance (g(s)) in girdled trees followed by a full recovery after the first major rainfall in September. Eliminating the root as a carbohydrate sink by girdling induced a rapid reversible reduction in g(s). Respiratory potential (a laboratory measure of tissue-level respiration) increased above the girdle (branches and upper trunk) and decreased below the girdle (lower trunk and roots) relative to control trees during the growing season, but the effect was reversed after the first major rainfall. The increase in branch respiratory potential induced by girdling suggests that the decrease in g(s) was caused by the accumulation of carbohydrates above the girdle, which is consistent with an observed increase in leaf mass per area in the girdled trees. Trunk girdling did not affect native xylem embolism or xylem conductivity. Both treated and control trunks experienced loss of xylem conductivity ranging from 10% in spring to 30% in summer. Girdling reduced xylem growth and sapwood to leaf area ratio, which in turn reduced branch leaf specific conductivity (LSC). The girdling-induced reductions in g(s) and transpiration were associated with a decrease in leaf hydraulic conductance. Two years after girdling, when root-to-shoot phloem continuity had been restored, girdled trees had a reduced density of new wood, which increased xylem conductivity and whole-tree LSC, but also vulnerability to embolism.","[Domec, Jean-Christophe] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27795 USA; [Pruyn, Michele L.] Plymouth State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Plymouth, NH 03264 USA","Domec, JC (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27795 USA.",jdomec@ncsu.edu,"domec, jean-christophe/P-9251-2019","domec, jean-christophe/0000-0003-0478-2559","USDA CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [96-35103-3832, 97-35103-5052]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 9632921]","We thank Dr. Jennifer Swenson for useful suggestions, discussion and statistical recommendations and Dr. Barbara Lachenbruch for support and guidance in conducting this project.

The 'fungicide application method' is a common approach used to investigate the indirect effects of mycorrhizal fungi on insects. This approach works by using initially mycorrhizal plants, and then generating a subset of these plants that are free of mycorrhizal fungi by applying fungicide to their roots. When insect feeding-bioassays are conducted using the resulting mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, differences in insect performance are typically attributed to differences in mycorrhizal colonization per se, rather than the application of the fungicide. Thus, the fungicide application method relies on the assumption that there is no direct toxicity of the fungicide on the focal insect species, and no indirect effects on the focal insect resulting from effects of the fungicide on the host plant or on non-target soil micro-organisms. We tested this critical assumption by feeding Zygogramma exclamationis (Chrysomelidae) larvae on non-mycorrhizal Helianthus annuus (Asteraceae) plants whose roots were treated with a solution of the fungicide benomyl or with a distilled water control. Larvae fed on benomyl-treated plants had reduced survival, lower relative growth rate, and lower food conversion efficiency, compared to larvae fed on control plants. Hence, fungicides applied to roots can affect herbivorous insect performance even in the absence of the possibility of mycorrhizal fungi-mediated effects. We recommend caution when using fungicide application and suggest that selective inoculation is a preferable method of generating mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants when studying mycorrhizal fungi-insect indirect effects.

The present review summarizes the published knowledge needed for such exploitation; providing essential information on structure and concentration of flavonols, flavones, condensed tannins, isoflavones, isoflavanones, pterocarpans, coumestans, cyanogenic glucosides, and saponins in healthy and stressed white clover plants. Various stresses and particular cultivars affect the concentrations of several of the compounds. Information on biological effects and the degradation/transformation of these compounds in plants or by microorganisms is available. There is no information on the degradation pathway in soil, the mechanisms of exudation and leaching of compounds from plants, and soil sorption properties of the compounds. The clover soil fatigue problem is increasing in grasslands and causes problems especially in organic farming. Research efforts focused on biological elements of clover soil fatigue have not explained it, and the influence of secondary metabolites has not been investigated.

The Mecplani and Fertil Turfa substracts were the most efficient ones in seedling growing.","[de Mello, Andrea Hentz] Fac Agron Para, BR-68501730 Maraba, PA, Brazil; [Kaminski, Joao; Antoniolli, Zaida Ines] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Ctr Ciencias Rurais, Dept Solos, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [de Souza, Eduardo Lorensi; Schirmer, Guilherme Karsten; Goulart, Rafael Machado] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Ctr Ciencias Rurais, Programa Posgrad Ciencia Solo, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil","de Mello, AH (reprint author), Fac Agron Para, Campus Sul & Sudeste Para, BR-68501730 Maraba, PA, Brazil.",andreahentz@ufpa.br; zaida@smail.ufsm.br,,,,,,30,4,4,0,2,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

For each substrate, the total numbers of soil microarthropods did not positively correlated with soil organic carbon. A positive correlation between fine root biomass and the soil microarthropod numbers was significant only in the M-substrate, but not in the L- and FH-substrates. In M-substrates, strong positive correlations were found between fine root biomass or hyphal length and Mesostigmata or Oribatida numbers, but Collembola numbers were not corelated.

Assuming that such land use conversion influences soil biochemical properties, we used soil chemical and enzyme activities as well as spore density and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of five dominant plant species to evaluate the effects of conversion from rangeland to Poplar devidiana plantations on top soil quality. Planting trees on rangeland significantly decreased soil organic C and N irrespective of the sampling month and soil depth. Afforestation also lowered the soil pH level and reduced electrical conductance. Moreover, dehydrogenase, urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities were all significantly affected. Land use conversion decreased spore density and influenced the mutual relationships between AM fungi and plant species. AM colonization of the dominant plants was lower in forested land than rangeland. Correlation analyses also showed that AM colonization and spore density were positively correlated with N, organic C, and acid phosphatase. These results indicated that spore density and AM colonization as well as organic C and N content and enzyme activities are all sensitive and reliable indicators of biochemical changes generated by land use conversion.

One mechanism explaining the success of invasive weeds may be the production and release of allelopathic compounds by the invader that, due to a lack of co-evolutionary history, have harmful effects on plant neighbours in the introduced range. 2. We partially tested this hypothesis by growing seven competing native European plant species either with the introduced Solidago canadensis s.l., one of the most successful invasive plants in Europe or on soil pre-cultivated with S. canadensis. We added activated carbon to the soil to neutralize organic chemical compounds with putative allelopathic effects. Furthermore, we added unsterilized soil inocula from the introduced (Switzerland) or native (USA) range to the soil to test potential confounding effects of soil microbes on invasion success. Untreated sterilized soil served as control. 3. Five out of the seven native species were more competitive against the invasive species in soils with activated carbon than without, supporting the allelopathy hypothesis. However, competitive outcomes were also influenced by the two sources of soil inoculum and by interactive effects of soil inoculum and Solidago origin suggesting that soil microbes alter allelopathic effects. 4. Achillea millefolium, the species least affected by the presence of S. canadensis and with no response to the activated carbon treatment is the only species used in this experiment reported to grow within Solidago stands in Europe, whereas the other European species tested tend to grow at the periphery of invasive Solidago stands. 5. Chemical analysis by LC-MS of Solidago root extracts revealed four main secondary chemical compounds with potential allelopathic effects. Root exudates of Solidago showed a significant inhibitory effect on growth of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. The magnitude of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of the extract. Synthesis. Levels of the four compounds were lower in Solidago populations from the invasive range than in populations of the same ploidy level from the native range. This suggests lower investment of invasive plants into these secondary compounds, possibly because of a higher susceptibility of plant competitors in the invasive range to these substances.","[Abhilasha, Dipti; Joshi, Jasmin] Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Quintana, Naira; Vivanco, Jorge] Colorado State Univ, Ctr Rhizosphere Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Joshi, J (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",joshi@uwinst.uzh.ch,,"Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465",,,,61,105,126,4,116,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The two AMF species were propagated with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) grown in a mixture of sand and soil. In another experiment, G. margarita was propagated with tobacco or alfalfa (Medicago sativa) grown in vermiculite or a mixture of sand and soil. The bacterial community composition of the new-formed spores and sand/soil substrate was analyzed using PCR of 16S rDNA fragments and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Clustering analysis revealed that the bacterial communities on the surface of G. margarita spores was different form that in the substrate or on the surface of the G. rosea spores, and both the host plant and the substrate could influence the composition of spore-associated bacterial populations of the G. margarita. Sequence analysis of the major DGGE bands of G. margarita spore samples revealed that most of the bacterial sequences were affiliated with the phyla Proteobacteria (Azospirillum, Azovibrio, Polyangium, Ramlibacter, Rubrivivax, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobium) and Actinobacteria (Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, and Pseudonocardia).","[Long, Liangkun; Ai, Yuncan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biochem, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Long, Liangkun; Zhu, Honghui] Guangdong Inst Microbiol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Microbial Culture Collect, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yao, Qing] S China Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Ai, YC (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biochem, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lssayc@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"AI, YUN-CAN/B-1395-2009; Zhu, Honghui/N-2251-2015; Zhu, Hong-Hui/C-3548-2009; YAO, Qing/B-3206-2009","YAO, Qing/0000-0003-3449-6166",,,,29,19,21,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2008,310,2-Jan,,,,,1,9,,10.1007/s11104-008-9611-7,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,337SU,WOS:000258456600001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Man, CX; Wang, H; Chen, WF; Sui, XH; Wang, ET; Chen, WX",,,,"Man, Chao Xin; Wang, Hao; Chen, Wen Feng; Sui, Xin Hua; Wang, En Tao; Chen, Wen Xin",,,Diverse rhizobia associated with soybean grown in the subtropical and tropical regions of China,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,bradyrhizobia; soybean; house-keeping gene sequence; symbiotic gene phylogeny; correlation,BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; ROOT-NODULES; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SP-NOV; SINORHIZOBIUM; STRAINS; FREDII,"Aiming at investigating the species composition and the association between ribosomal/housekeeping genes and symbiotic genes of rhizobia nodulating with soybean grown in the subtropical and tropic regions of China, a total of 252 rhizobial strains isolated from five eco-regions was characterized.

Don) planted at 7 m row spacing and grown with ryegrass/clover or lucerne pastures or with no understorey. SMC was recorded to 1 or 2 m depths for years 2-6 or 4-6, respectively. The predominant rainfall from the south-south-west (SSW) direction created rain shadows (60% of open pasture) on the northern sunny side of the trees. The rain shadows increased as the trees grew but their position were modified by stand pruning and thinning in years 4 and 5. SMC in the top meter showed strong positional effects with the lowest SMC under the tree crowns and on the northern side. There were strong seasonal patterns driven by high spring and summer evapotranspiration, modified by rain shadows and stand age. For the no-understorey treatment, SMC remained high midway between tree rows until the trees were 4 years old and started utilizing this moisture. For the two pasture understoreys, the difference in SMC between the north and south sides decreased with time after trees were thinned and pruned. In the no-understorey there was little difference between the two aspects. Understorey evapotranspiration and fine rooting patterns also helped explain soil moisture use patterns. No difference was detected between two contrasting radiata pine tree types. The effective rooting depth of the ryegrass/clover understorey was < 0.7 m while that of lucerne and trees were deeper. Alternative tree planting practices may reduce some of the negative effects of tree-understory moisture competition.","[Pollock, K.

The objective of this study was to direct nematode community structure and function through the application of organic amendments to the soil of an urban landfill remediation project using native grassland vegetation. We used a 2 x 3 factorial design in which an organic amendment was added to the soil at different locations (incorporated versus surface-applied) and amounts (none, light, heavy). Nematode and plant community structure were monitored over three growing seasons to determine the rate and direction of change. Surface application of organic amendments supported greater grass and total plant densities compared to incorporated amendment treatments, but plant density did not vary with amendment amount. Total nematode density, family diversity and family richness were not affected by the amendment treatments, but both family richness and seasonal nematode density increased over the duration of the experiment. Other descriptors of nematode community development (Structure, Maturity, and Plant Parasite Indexes) were not influenced by either amendment amount or location, but varied significantly over time. Contrary to expectations, the surface amendment treatments significantly increased bacterivorous, plant parasitic, omnivorous and predator nematode densities, but had no influence on fungi/root-tip feeding nematodes. Also contrary to our hypotheses, the surface treatments had smaller Channel Index and greater Enrichment Index values relative to the incorporated treatments during the first 15 month of the experiment. We hypothesize that the surface amendments are indirectly affecting the structure of the nematode community by promoting greater plant density, thus increasing the concentration of high-quality organic matter (such as root exudates) in the soil. This promotes the development of a nematode community dominated by opportunistic groups that respond rapidly to increased resource availability. Future studies should aim to distinguish between the organic amendment's direct function as a potential food source for the soil biota versus their indirect role as an environmental variable, including their capability to alter the availability of plant-derived resources.

Detection of phosphonates in basidiocarps together with our previous evidence from laboratory experiments support the fungal production of natural phosphonates in forest ecosystems.

Although it does not react with humic substances, chlorine dioxide added to water is reduced primarily to chlorite and chlorate ions, compounds that are under investigation for their potential adverse effects on human health. The aim of this research was to study the genotoxicity of chlorite and chlorate and their mixtures. The end-points included two plant tests (chromosomal aberration test in Allium cepa and micronucleus assay in Tradescantia, carried out at different times of exposure) and two genotoxicity tests in human HepG2 cells (comet assay and cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus test). Preliminary toxicity tests were carried out for both plant and HepG2 assays. The results showed that chlorite and chlorate are able to induce chromosomal damage to plant systems, particularly chromosomal aberrations in A. cepa root tip cells, even at concentrations lower than the limit established by Italian normative law and WHO guidelines. In HepG2 cells increased DNA damage was only observed for chlorate at the lowest concentration. No increase in micronuclei frequency was detected in any of the samples tested in human HepG2 cells.

We studied the distribution and recovery of N-15 (4.934 atom% excess)-labelled fertilizer (applied as urea at 200 kg N ha(-1)) 10 years after application to a 38-39-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii (Mirb.) Franco) stand in coastal British Columbia. The urea was applied in the spring (May 1982) or fall (November 1982). Sampling was conducted in October 1992, and we found that after 10 years, there were few differences between the fall and spring fertilizer applications in total N and N-15 distribution within the tree and forest ecosystem. On average total fertilizer-N recovery was 59.4%; about 14.5% of the applied-N was recovered in the trees including coarse roots, with foliage containing 41% of the labelled-N recovered in the aboveground tree biomass. Tissue N-15 remained mobile and could be transferred to new growth. Soil recovery was 39.8%, which had decreased from 57.0% at a previous 1-year sampling, with an average loss of 3.0% per year from the mineral soil and 3.7% from the litter layers. However, it appears that there was little continuing tree uptake. While short-term effects of fall vs. spring urea application were previously reported, there were no long-term effects on either stand productivity or fertilizer use efficiency, suggesting that if fertilization is properly done, timing of fertilization is not a critical issue in terms of maximizing fertilizer use efficiency for the coastal Douglas-fir forest we studied. Our results also highlight the high capacity of this ecosystem to retain externally applied inorganic N over the long-term, the importance of maximizing nitrogen uptake in the first year, and also of the continuing need to develop new approaches to overcome the generally low efficiency of forest N fertilization.

Two outdoor pot experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses that at the recruitment stage the invader perennial tussock grass Cortaderia selloana is a superior competitor, and that it is more resistant to water stress than the two coexisting native species of the same functional group, Festuca arundinacea and Brachypodium phoenicoides. C. selloana reduced aboveground biomass of target native species, but not more than target native species on each other. Moreover, C. selloana did not resist interspecific competition more than target native species. Under control conditions, C. selloana did not have larger specific leaf area (SLA) and root-shoot ratio (R/S) ratio than target native species, contradicting the general statement that these traits are associated to invasiveness. F. arundinacea was the species which performed best but also the one most affected by water stress. Both C. selloana and B. phoenicoides performed in a similar way under water stress conditions. However, the alien species' capacity to adjust to water stress, indicated by the increase in the root-shoot ratio under moderate and severe water stress, was slightly better than that of B. phoenicoides. Overall, at early recruitment stages, C. selloana is not a better competitor than the coexisting native species. However, it seems to be more resistant to water stress because as water becomes scarce C. selloana maximizes water uptake and minimizes water losses more than the native species.","[Vila, Montserrat] CSIC, EDB, Seville 41013, Spain; [Domenech, Roser] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, CREAF, Dept Anim & Plant Biol & Ecol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Domenech, Roser] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Unit Ecol, Dept Anim & Plant Biol & Ecol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain","Vila, M (reprint author), CSIC, EDB, Avda Maria Luisa S-N, Seville 41013, Spain.",montse.vila@ebd.csic.es,"Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013","Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261",,,,46,9,9,0,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

A combination of soil organic matter (SOM) size and density fractionations, (15)N determinations, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses was conducted on soils from a pristine N-limited Nothofagus forest in southern Chile. The purpose of this study was to investigate which SOM fractions mostly reflect the (15)N-enrichment pattern and to link (15)N SOM enrichment with microbial community composition. Nitrogen-15 enrichments were greater for the microaggregate (< 150 mu m) than for the macroaggregate (> 150 mu m) size fraction, with Rayleigh isotope enrichment factors averaging -8.5% and -3.7%, respectively. The macro-organic matter density fractions (> 150 mu m) showed intermediate enrichment factors of -5.1% and -7.3% for the light (< 1.37 g cm-(3)) and heavy (> 1.37 g cm(-3)) fraction, respectively. The abundance of fungal and bacterial PLFAs was significantly higher in the microaggregate compared to the macroaggregate size fraction, but their relative abundance did not change between aggregate size fractions. Our data link differential (15)N enrichment of SOM fractions to ""total"" microbial abundance and, as such, corroborates existing theories of microbial-induced (15)N enrichment. Isotopic fractionation during microbial N decomposition processes alone could not explain the large (15)N enrichment in the microaggregate size fraction (-8.5%) and the heavy density fraction (-7.3%). We therefore suggest that microbial turnover and accretion of (15)N-enriched microbial (especially fungal) compounds was an additional driver for (15)N enrichment of this soil profile.","[Huygens, D.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ingn Agr & Suelos, Fac Ciencias Agr, Valdivia, Chile; [Huygens, D.; Denef, K.; Vandeweyer, R.; Van Cleemput, O.; Boeckx, P.] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Appl Phys Chem ISOFYS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Godoy, R.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Bot, Valdivia, Chile","Huygens, D (reprint author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ingn Agr & Suelos, Fac Ciencias Agr, Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile.",Dries.Huygens@UGent.be,"Boeckx, Pascal/J-3668-2013; Huygens, Dries/A-8395-2008","Boeckx, Pascal/0000-0003-3998-0010; Huygens, Dries/0000-0003-2423-6926",,,,69,24,27,1,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Species identification is therefore largely based on secondary chemistry. We investigated different chemotypes of the morphologically highly similar L. jackii species complex by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. In phylogenetic analyses including all available Lepraria species, samples belonging to different chemotypes of the L. jackii agg. corresponded to four highly divergent clusters. While true L. jackii was genetically uniform, the other three clades represented previously unrecognized species. They originated from different major speciation events, and two of them were not closely related to any other species. Assessment of intraspecific genetic variability revealed four different patterns with respect to geographic scale. ITS sequences proved to be the most reliable and distinctive characters for species recognition in the Lepraria jackii complex and were in accordance with chemical and ecogeographic data. Frequent occurrence of long branches, relatively few resolved relationships despite high genetic variability, and the discovery and description of a considerable part of the Lepraria species within the last 10 years suggest that the genus is probably much larger than currently known. The diversification of this asexual group in the potential absence of recombination is discussed.

We examined how experimental warming and grazing affected species within plant groups of direct importance to Tibetan pastoralists: medicinal plants used by humans and palatable plants consumed by livestock. Warming resulted in species losses from both the medicinal and palatable plant groups; however, differential relative vulnerability to warming occurred. With respect to the percent of warming-induced species losses, the overall plant community lost 27%, medicinal plants lost 21%, and non-medicinal plants lost 40% of species. Losses of palatable and non-palatable species were similar to losses in the overall plant community. The deep-rootedness of medicinal plants resulted in lowered sensitivity to warming, whereas the shallow-rootedness of non-medicinal plants resulted in greater sensitivity to warming; the variable rooting depth of palatable and non-palatable plants resulted in an intermediate response to warming. Predicting the vulnerability of plant groups to human activities can be enhanced by knowledge of plant traits, their response to specific drivers, and their distribution within plant groups. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which a driver operates, and the evolutionary interaction of plants with that driver, will aid predictions. Future steps to protect ecosystem services furnished by medicinal and palatable plants will be required under the novel stress of a warmer climate. Grazing may be an important tool in maintaining some of these services under future warming.","[Klein, Julia A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Harte, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Xin-Quan] Chinese Acad Sci, NW Plateau Inst Biol, Xining Qinghai 810001, Peoples R China","Klein, JA (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, 213 Nat Resources Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",jklein@cnr.colostate.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [INT-9907375]; NOAA Postdoctoral Program in Climate and Global ChangeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; American Alpine Club,"We thank the Haibei Research Station, E.

Resprouting in woody plants is a trait that facilitates persistence in disturbance-prone environments. Patterns of allocation of resources for resprouting may depend on the severity of disturbance to which the plants are adapted. Fire-adapted plants allocate more resources to below-ground structures for resprouting after destruction of above-ground structures. However, plants that resprout in response to disturbances where above-ground structures survive may remobilize above-ground resources for resprouting. 2. In coastal sand dunes, stem leaning and partial uprooting of trees result in high frequency of resprouting (38.9% of individuals; 90.6% of species). We tested whether 'good' and 'poor' resprouters differed in allocation to root biomass and root carbohydrate reserves. Species were assigned to categories of resprouting ability based on the frequency of multi-stemmed individuals in the local population. To control for phylogenetic effects, we contrasted poor and good resprouter species pairs from three families. 3. We tested whether plants stored more reserves in roots or stems and whether above-ground resources were remobilized for resprouting. The latter was measured from the number and dry mass of sprouts produced by trees cut to stump heights of 10 and 150 cm above-ground level. 4. Good resprouters had larger seedling root:shoot ratios and higher stem and root carbohydrate concentrations than poor resprouters. Both good and poor resprouters maintained higher carbohydrate concentrations in stems than in roots. 5. For both good and poor resprouters, 150-cm stumps produced more sprouts than 10-cm stumps. At each stump height, good resprouters produced more sprouts than poor resprouters. 6. Resource allocation in coastal dune trees appears to be a bet-hedging strategy. After low-severity disturbances, resprouting occurs by remobilization of above-ground resources. Below-ground resources may be more costly to remobilize but may allow recovery from occasional more severe disturbances.","[Nzunda, E. F.; Griffiths, M. E.; Lawes, M.

To understand root dynamics of the native, perennial clonal grass Leymus chinensis in Inner Mongolia steppe, we examined spatial and temporal effects of N addition on root survivorship and longevity traits of L. chinensis by studying responses of survivorship of roots distributed in three soil layers (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) and born in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) to N addition with modified rhizotron technique during the growing seasons of 2004-05. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate survival functions and to estimate mean root life spans. 2. Roots in the three soil layers displayed similar life spans with mean overall value of 81 days in the control plots. N addition reduced life span of roots in the soil layers of 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm, but it had no effect on life span of roots in the soil layer of 10-20 cm. 3. Roots born in the three seasons differed in their life spans with the life span values of 21-58, 60-153 and 101-151 days for those roots born in spring, summer and autumn, respectively. N addition markedly reduced life span of roots born in summer in the three soil layers with the greatest reduction occurring in roots present in soil layer of 20-30 cm, but it had marginal effect on life span of the spring-born and autumn-born roots. 4. The differential sensitivity of survivorship and longevity of L. chinensis roots occurred in different soil depths and born in different seasons to N addition highlights the importance of spatial and temporal characteristics of roots in response to soil N availability in Inner Mongolia steppe.","[Bai, W. -M.; Wang, Z. -W.; Chen, Q. -S.; Zhang, W. -H.; Li, L. -H.] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Li, LH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",llinghao@ibcas.ac.cn,"Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011; Zhang, Wen-Hao/B-5805-2009","Zhang, Wen-Hao/0000-0003-2708-2221",,,,32,34,41,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

As a conservative test of the extent to which wind-dispersed mycorrhizal fungi may exhibit phylogeographic structure, we chose to study Amanita muscaria, a host-generalist, widespread, wind-dispersed fungus. In this paper, we document the existence of several distinct phylogenetic species within A. muscaria, based on multilocus DNA sequence data. According to our findings, A. muscarla has strong intercontinental genetic disjunctions, and, more surprisingly, has strong intracontinental phylogeographic structure, particularly within North America, often corresponding to certain habitats and/or biogeographic provinces. Our results indicate that the view of A. muscarla as a common, widespread, easily identifiable, ecologically plastic fungus with a wide niche does not correctly represent the ecological and biological realities. On the contrary, the strong associations between phylogenetic species and different habitats support the developing picture of ecoregional endemisms and relatively narrow to very narrow niches for some lineages.

A transportable and adaptable closed chamber gas exchange system directly measured CO2 efflux of roots from 0.5 to 32 mm in diameter.

Mean fine root respiration rates at the reference temperature varied between 8.5 and 10.8 mu mol CO2 kg(-1) s(-1) depending oil the stand. Coarse root respiration was strongly negatively correlated to root diameter.

In this study, we coupled continuous minirhizotron observations with an array of solid-state CO(2) sensors. We calculated soil respiration using a gradient flux method. Using a Kaplan-Maier survival analysis, we determined a median longevity of 347 d for fine roots and of 400 d for rhizomorphs. Radiocarbon ((14)C) analysis suggested an age of 7 yr for fine roots < 1 mm and 17 yr for roots of 1 mm in diameter. We found rapid changes in root length (maximum of 38.1 cm m(-2) d(-1)) and rhizomorph length ( maximum of 105.4 cm m(-2) d(-1)) during sampling of four consecutive days. Changes in rhizomorph length were more variable than root length, and rhizomorphs were negatively correlated with daily changes in soil moisture. The variation in root length may be associated to prior environmental conditions. Fine root length was correlated with daily CO(2) production, and variation in daily fine root length could contribute up to 4680 g C ha(-1) d(-1). We observed a clockwise diurnal hysteresis effect in soil respiration with soil temperature that changed in amplitude and shape along the year. Our results show the importance of shorter intervals of minirhizotron measurements to understand rapid fine roots and rhizomorphs variation. Furthermore, continuous minirhizotron measurements should be couple with continuous measurements of multiple sensor arrays to explain biophysical factors that regulate belowground carbon dynamics.","[Vargas, Rodrigo; Allen, Michael F.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Vargas, R (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dep Environm Sci Policy & Management, Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rvargas@nature.berkeley.edu,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008","Vargas, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6829-5333",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0410408]; Center for Embedded Networked Sensing [CCR-0120778]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Kearney Foundation,"We thank Hector Estrada, Alisha Glass, Niles Hasselquist, Kuni Kitajima, Laruel Saltzman, Ayesha Sirajuddin, and William Swenson for help acquiring minirhizotron images.

Sequential soil coring and ingrowth core methods were used in a randomized block experiment, from 18 to 32 months after planting Eucalyptus grandis, in Brazil, in order to estimate annual fine root production and turnover under contrasting N fertilization regimes (120 kg N ha(-1) vs. 0 kg N ha(-1)). The response of growth in tree height and basal area to N fertilizer application decreased with stand age and was no longer significant at 36 months of age. The ingrowth core method provided only qualitative information about the seasonal course of fine root production and turnover. Mean fine root biomasses (diameter <2 mm) in the 0-30 cm layer measured by monthly coring amounted to 0.91 and 0.84 t ha(-1) in the 0 N and the 120 N treatments, respectively. Fine root production was significantly higher in the 0 N treatment (1.66 t ha(-1) year(-1)) than in the 120 N treatment (1.12 t ha(-1) year(-1)), probably as a result of the greater tree growth in the control treatment throughout the sampling period. Fine root turnover was 1.8 and 1.3 year(-1) in the 0 N and the 120 N treatments, respectively. However, large fine root biomass (diameter < 1 mm) was found down to a depth of 3 m one year after planting: 1.67 and 1.61 t ha(-1) in the 0 N and the 120 N treatments, respectively. Fine root turnover might not be insubstantial in deep soil layers where large changes in soil water content were observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Variation at these two uniparentally-inherited genetic systems retraces expansions that occurred in the past 60 ky, and shows a clear decrease of expansion ages from east to west Eurasia. To investigate the demographic events at the origin of this westward decrease of expansion ages, the estimated divergence ages between Eurasian populations are compared with the estimated expansion ages within each population. Both markers suggest that the demographic expansion diffused from east to west in Eurasia in a demic way, i.e., through migrations of individuals (and not just through diffusion of new technologies), highlighting the prominent role of eastern regions within Eurasia during Palaeolithic times.

LINK; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL ORGANISMS; GRASS; DEGENERATION; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION; FEEDBACK; DUNES,"The root-feeding nematode community of wild plants may vary throughout their natural range. Little is known about how the variation of wild plants along their range affects their relationship with root-feeding nematodes. In the present study, we examined local and non-local combinations of host plants and root-feeding nematodes to test the hypothesis that nematode reproduction is favoured by local hosts. In two indoor experiments, we exposed populations of the wild dune grass Ammophila arenaria from northern and southern European coastal sand dunes to plant parasitic nematode species (Helicotylenchus spp.) from those same geographical origins. First, we used the southern nematode species to determine whether the effect of a local versus a non-local host may depend on nematode density. Then, in a cross-inoculation experiment we investigated how both nematode species performed with their local, as compared to the non-local hosts. In both experiments, plant biomass and ontogenetic characteristics were not significantly different between the northern and southern populations. The applied nematode densities did not have a negative impact on plant performance. This allowed us to consider the response of the two different nematode species and their host plants without co-varying differences in plant responses. Reproduction of the nematode species differed according to host origin, but contrary to what we expected, nematode species did not perform better on their local hosts. Helicotylenchus n. sp., the southern species originating from Portugal, performed better on the non-local than on the local host. Male to female ratios were significantly different between the two nematode populations and were lowest in Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus from The Netherlands. Female and juveniles percentages were also quite distinct, with more females in the nematode species from The Netherlands and more juveniles in the nematode species from Portugal. We concluded that ectoparasitic root-feeding nematodes Helicotylenchus spp. do not necessarily perform best on their local host population of the foredune grass A. arenaria. Our results imply that the natural distribution of Helicotylenchus spp. along the European coast is determined by other factors than host populations. These other factors that could be abiotic, e.g. water availability, orbiotic, e.g. local natural enemies adapted to Helicotylenchus spp. Introducing plant genotypes from other parts of the natural range will, therefore, not necessarily lead to reduced abundance of semi-endo or ectoparasitic root-feeding nematodes.

The understorey plant Phyllanthus calycinus, has been shown to be extensively mycorrhizal. We examined differences in the capacity of fungi associated with this plant to access a P point source from increasing distances from the root. The methodology simulated ""pockets"" of P in forest soil. Phosphorus sources in root-exclusion mesh bags were inserted 2, 4 and 6 cm from plant roots restrained in separate mesh bags. Acaulospora laevis colonised plants to the greatest extent, producing higher plant biomass and P uptake compared to the other two fungi. Plant biomass and P uptake were enhanced where P sources were closest to the root, as expected, but there were differences among fungi in response to level of inoculum used for each fungus. The capacity of individual AM fungi to access a point source of P at different distances varied in a highly mycorrhizal native forest understorey plant in parallel with plant growth and P uptake.","[Solaiman, Zakaria M.; Abbott, Lynette K.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Earth & Geog Sci M087, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Solaiman, ZM (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Earth & Geog Sci M087, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",solaiman@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Solaiman, Zakaria/C-9645-2010; Abbott, Lynette K/F-7489-2011","Solaiman, Zakaria/0000-0001-7014-7532; Abbott, Lynette K/0000-0001-8586-7858",,,,29,5,7,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Rehd.), following cutting and burning in mature tanoak forests. Tanoak stump sprouts rapidly replaced leaf biomass but did not maintain preexisting root systems. Rather, root biomass declined for several years, with the largest proportional decline in extra-fine roots. Four years after harvest, live root biomasses in diameter classes 0.25-2.00 and 0.25-5.00 mm were 25% and 30% of values in mature tanoak forests, respectively. The proportion of' dead roots was strongly correlated with maximum summer soil temperature. Root/shoot ratios recovered to preharvest values by age 3-4 years, at which time the live biomass of fine roots and leaf biomass was approximately 30%-40% of values in mature forest. From age 4 to 8 years, stable root/shoot ratios were associated with a three- to fourfold reduction in growth rate of leaf biomass and a proportional increase in growth of fine roots. These findings support the general theory of a functional root-shoot balance in tanoak and suggest a possible role for soil temperature in post-harvest root dynamics. Improved understanding of postdisturbance root and shoot dynamics in tanoak will help identify competitive interactions and priorities for vegetation management decisions in establishment of conifers following harvest of mixed conifer-hardwood forests of southwestern Oregon and northern California.","[Ahrens, Glenn R.; Newton, Michael] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Ahrens, GR (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",glenn.ahrens@oregonstate.edu,,,Forestry Intensified Research Program,"We extend our appreciation to Dr. Cathy L.

Relative abundance, richness, and composition of the ECM community were compared among untreated control, mixed, mounded, and scalped site preparation treatments, On >11000 root tips, we observed 16 ECM morphotypes. Those common to the nursery in which the seedlings were raised were most abundant (Thelephora americana, Wilcoxina-like (E-strain), Amphinema byssoides. Phialocephala-like (MRA)). Seedlings in the untreated controls had lower abundances of these, but higher abundances of other ECM, which were not present in the nursery of origin but were indigenous to these forest stands. In terms of ECM composition, the ""mixed"" treatment was most similar to the untreated control, while the ""scalped"" and ""mound"" treatments showed significantly different ECM communities than the controls. Our results suggest that MSP may facilitate continued dominance by ECM that establish on seedlings in the nursery while slowing the natural succession towards the natural forest ECM. MSP treatments that leave some surface organic matter relatively intact may impact ECM less than those that remove or bury the organic layer.","[Lazaruk, Lance W.; Macdonald, S.

Catchment scale water quality models are useful tools for predicting catchment behaviour under various climatic conditions and land use scenarios, but most do not account for the effect of riparian buffer zones. In this paper, we present conceptual models for surface water-groundwater interactions and formulate analytical mathematical functions that describe nitrate removal in the riparian zone. We restrict nitrate attenuation capacity to potential denitrification only and present sample calculations based on the limited field data available. The models are classed into two types according to their applicability to either ephemeral or perennial streams. In ephemeral, low-order streams with the potential to form a perched water table, a simple bucket model is used. During events, stream water flows laterally into the riparian zone and may be denitrified while residing there before discharging back to the surface water system. In perennial middle-order streams, nitrate removal may occur either as base flow intercepts the root zone or when water is temporarily stored in stream banks during flood events. We incorporate these concepts within a GIS modelling framework and investigate the potential of riparian zones to reduce nitrate delivery to streams in the Maroochy catchment located in South East Queensland, Australia. The modelling results for the Maroochy catchment show that the optimum rooting depth is about 4 m and that increasing the riparian buffer width beyond 10 m yields little further reduction in nitrate. The potential nitrate removal capacity per unit length of riparian buffer in each sub-catchment is an attribute that can be used to help to prioritise riparian rehabilitation activities aimed at reducing stream nitrogen loads.

Here, we present the impacts of elevated CO(2) and warming, both in isolation and combination, on seed production, mass, quality, germination success and subsequent seedling growth of Austrodanthonia caespitosa, a dominant temperate C(3) grass from Australia, using seeds collected from the TasFACE experiment. Mean seed production and mass were not significantly affected by either elevated CO(2) or warming, but elevated CO(2) more than doubled the proportion of very light, inviable seeds (P < 0.05) and halved mean seed N concentration (P < 0.04) and N content (P < 0.03). The dependence of seed germination success on seed mass was affected by an elevated CO(2) x warming interaction (P < 0.004), such that maternal exposure to elevated CO(2) or warming reduced germination if applied in isolation, but not when applied in combination. Maternal effects were retained when seedlings were grown in a common environment for 6 weeks, with seedlings descended from warmed plants 20% smaller (P < 0.008) with a higher root : shoot ratio (P < 0.001) than those from unwarmed plants. Given that both elevated CO(2) and warming reduced seed mass, quality, germinability or seedling growth, it is likely that global change will reduce population growth or distribution of this dominant species.","[Hovenden, Mark J.; Wills, Karen E.; Schoor, Jacqueline K.

The ecological importance of host-soil symbiont associations for plant community structure and dynamics has been recently highlighted, particularly with regard to ecological and evolutionary responses along environmental gradients. 2. We used a range of native Australian shrubby legumes (Acacia spp.) and associated root-nodule forming bacteria (rhizobia) in laboratory and glasshouse studies to investigate the ecology of Acacia-rhizobial interactions with respect to soil salinity, a major environmental stressor in many parts of the world. 3. Analysis of laboratory growth data provided clear evidence of a trade-off in that growth rate of individual rhizobial isolates was reduced with increasing salt tolerance in culture. 4. A large replicated glasshouse inoculation trial using 40 strains of rhizobia and nine species of Acacia that varied in their ability to grow in saline soils found strong evidence of host specificity, but neither the average growth promotion of host plants nor the specificity of growth promotion was related to salt tolerance of the isolates. 5. In a second glasshouse experiment, we used a subset of salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rhizobia and six Acacia species to evaluate performance and symbiotic effectiveness across different levels of soil salinity. Overall, we found no evidence of a relationship between rhizobial salt-tolerance (as measured in the laboratory) and impact on host growth performance, either in saline or non-saline soils, and there was no evidence that salt-tolerant rhizobia perform better in more saline environments. 6. Synthesis. More salt tolerant Acacia spp. were less responsive in growth to rhizobial inoculation than salt sensitive hosts, implying that evolution towards reduced dependence on the symbiosis may facilitate adaptation to salt, raising a general question regarding the extent to which shifts in dependence on microbial symbionts underlies plant adaptation to other environmental gradients.","[Thrall, Peter H.; Slattery, Jo F.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Thrall, PH (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",peter.thrall@csiro.au,,,,,,53,34,36,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi play key roles in forest ecosystems, but the potential effects of invasive plants on EM fungal communities have not been assessed. In this study, we tested whether the non-mycorrhizal herbaceous plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) can alter the abundance of EM fungal communities in North America. 2. In three forests in New England, USA, we compared EM root tip abundance in soils where A. petiolata had invaded to adjacent areas without a history of A. petiolata invasion. At one site, we also intensively sampled EM root tip abundance across the edges of A. petiolata patches to determine the spatial pattern of A. petiolata effects on EM fungi. In a glasshouse experiment, we experimentally invaded soils with A. petiolata and Impatiens capensis, a native species and compared EM fungal colonization of white pine (Pinus strobus) seedlings grown in both soils. We also measured the effect of the A. petiolata allelochemical benzyl isothiocyanate on the growth of three species of EM fungi in pure culture. 3. In the field, EM fungal root tip biomass was lower in invaded soils, with the strongest reductions observed in forests dominated by conifers. Alliaria petiolata invasion did not have a significant effect on total root biomass. The influence of A. petiolata on EM fungal abundance in the field was localized, with the strongest inhibition observed within 10 cm of the edge of A. petiolata patches. 4. Pine seedlings growing in soils that were experimentally invaded with A. petiolata also had lower EM fungal root tip biomass compared to uninvaded soils. The native species I. capensis caused similar reductions in EM fungal colonization. Growth of pure cultures of all three species of EM fungi was completely inhibited by benzyl isothiocyanate. 5. Synthesis. Alliaria petiolata inhibits the growth of EM fungi in forests of its introduced range. Changes in EM fungal communities caused by the invasion of A. petiolata may influence tree seedling establishment and biogeochemical cycling.","[Wolfe, Benjamin E.; Pringle, Anne] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rodgers, Vikki L.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stinson, Kristina A.] Harvard Univ, Petersham, MA 01366 USA","Wolfe, BE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bewolfe@fas.harvard.edu,,"Rodgers, Vikki/0000-0001-6949-6268",,,,36,118,129,2,133,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Nonetheless, there is surprisingly little evidence for the spread of exploitation in mutualist populations. In particular mutualisms, non-beneficial partners are commonplace and this raises the question of whether exploitation is invading as an adaptive strategy. Here, we highlight the legume-rhizobium mutualism as a key test case. Rhizobial bacteria fix nitrogen in legume roots in exchange for carbon from their hosts. However, non-beneficial rhizobia are widespread, including non-fixing and non-nodulating strains. Recent research has shown that legumes can punish some uncooperative rhizobia and substantially reduce their fitness, but these sanctions must not be universally effective. Important questions about uncooperative rhizobia remain unresolved. (1) Is it adaptive for rhizobia to be uncooperative with hosts? (2) Do uncooperative rhizobia evolve from cooperative ancestors? (3) What are the mechanisms of rhizobial exploitation? We describe experimental approaches and testable hypotheses that address these gaps in our knowledge.","[Sachs, Joel L.; Simms, Ellen L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, 1208 Spieth Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",joels@ucr.edu,"Sachs, Joel/AAB-9348-2019","Sachs, Joel/0000-0002-0221-9247",,,,61,36,38,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2008,117,7,,,,,961,966,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16606.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,331TB,WOS:000258034400001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Polanco, MC; Zwiazek, JJ; Voicu, MC",,,,"Polanco, Monica Calvo; Zwiazek, Janusz J.; Voicu, Mihaela C.",,,Responses of ectomycorrhizal American elm (Ulmus americana) seedlings to salinity and soil compaction,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,American elm; ectomycorrhizas; gas exchange; root hydraulic conductance; salt; soil compaction,PINUS-BANKSIANA SEEDLINGS; ROOT HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SPRUCE PICEA-GLAUCA; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; WATER CONDUCTANCE; DEICING SALTS; AQUAPORINS; SODIUM; GROWTH,"American elm (Ulmus americana) seedlings were either non-inoculated or inoculated with Hebeloma crustuliniforme, Laccaria bicolor and a mixture of the two fungi to study the effects of ectomycorrhizal associations on seedling responses to soil compaction and salinity. The seedlings were grown in the greenhouse in pots containing non-compacted (0.4 g cm(-3) bulk density) and compacted (0.6 g cm(-3) bulk density) soil and subjected to 60 mM NaCl or 0 mM NaCl (control) treatments for 3 weeks. All three fungal inocula had similar effects on the responses of elm seedlings to soil compaction and salt treatment. In non-compacted soil, ectomycorrhizal fungi reduced plant dry weights, root hydraulic conductance, but did not affect leaf hydraulic conductance and net photosynthesis. When treated with 60 mM NaCl, ectomycorrhizal seedlings had several-fold lower leaf concentrations of Na(+) compared with the non-inoculated plants. Soil compaction reduced Na(+) leaf concentrations in non-ectomycorrhizal plants and decreased dry weights, gas exchange and root hydraulic conductance. However, in ectomycorrhizal plants, soil compaction had little effect on the leaf Na(+) concentrations and on other measured growth and physiological parameters. Our results demonstrated that ECM associations could be highly beneficial to plants growing in sites with compacted soil such as urban areas.","[Polanco, Monica Calvo; Zwiazek, Janusz J.; Voicu, Mihaela C.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Zwiazek, JJ (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 4-42 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",janus.zwaizek@ualberta.ca,"Olivier, Samantha/B-7376-2015","Olivier, Samantha/0000-0002-9051-080X; /0000-0002-0813-0921",,,,41,17,19,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2008,308,2-Jan,,,,,189,200,,10.1007/s11104-008-9619-z,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,310KY,WOS:000256529700014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Huang, G; Zhao, XY; Su, YG; Zhao, HL; Zhang, TH",,,,"Huang, Gang; Zhao, Xue-yong; Su, Yan-gui; Zhao, Ha-lin; Zhang, Tong-hui",,,"Vertical distribution, biomass, production and turnover of fine roots along a topographical gradient in a sandy shrubland",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine root production; root length density; soil available resources; topography; vertical distribution,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; DOUGLAS-FIR; LIFE-SPAN; DYNAMICS; AVAILABILITY; PLANTATIONS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; MODEL; WATER,"In an artificial Salix gordejevii Chang et Skv. plantation of the Horqin sandy land, we investigated vertical distribution (in 0-100 cm depth), biomass (FRD), fine root production (FRP), fine root length density (FRLD) and turnover of fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) at three sites (dune top, midslope and bottom of dune) along leeward slopes. Meanwhile, the correlation between FRP and soil available resources was analyzed. Our results indicate that more than 65% of total fine root biomass is distributed in 0-40 cm depth, and the patterns are different at three sites. The mean monthly FRD ranges from 227 to 324 g.m(-2), and they follows the order: dune top > midslope > bottom of dune. Ingrowth cores were harvested after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 months of installation. At the first five sampling times, FRP and FRLD (0-40 cm) follows the same order with FRD along the topographical gradient, while FRP harvested after 8 months does not follow the same tendency, they are 348, 402 and 356 g.cm(-2) in dune top, midslope and bottom of dune, respectively. Fine root turnover ranges from 1.04-1.92 year(-1), and fine root turnover (20-40 cm) increases from dune top to bottom of dune along the topographical gradient. Correlation analysis between FRP and soil available resources indicates that only mean soil volumetric water content significantly correlates with annual FRP, which suggests that soil water content might be more crucial for shrub growth than fertility along the topographical gradient.","[Huang, Gang; Zhao, Xue-yong; Su, Yan-gui; Zhao, Ha-lin; Zhang, Tong-hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg & Environm & Engn Res Inst, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Huang, G (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg & Environm & Engn Res Inst, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",fishofbeiming@tom.com,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856",,,,45,17,22,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2008,308,2-Jan,,,,,201,212,,10.1007/s11104-008-9620-6,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,310KY,WOS:000256529700015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zornoza, R; Guerrero, C; Mataix-Solera, J; Scow, KM; Arcenegui, V; Mataix-Beneyto, J",,,,"Zornoza, R.; Guerrero, C.; Mataix-Solera, J.; Scow, K.

Soil samples (n = 393) were obtained by sampling 13 locations during three years (2003-2005 period). These samples had a wide range of soil characteristics due to variations in land use, vegetation cover and specific climatic conditions. Biochemical properties also included microbial biomarkers based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Partial least squares (PLS) regression with cross validation was used to establish relationships between the NIR spectra and the reference data from physical, chemical and biochemical analyses. Based on the values of coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the ratio of standard deviation of validation set to root mean square error of cross validation (RPD), predicted results were evaluated as excellent ( r(2) > 0.90 and RPD > 3) for soil organic carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen, soil moisture, cation exchange capacity, microbial biomass carbon, basal soil respiration, acid phosphatase activity, P-glucosidase activity and PLFA biomarkers for total bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, actinomycetes, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and total PLFA biomass. Good predictions (0.81 < r(2) < 0.90 and 2.5 < RPD < 3) were obtained for exchangeable calcium and magnesium, water soluble carbon, water holding capacity and urease activity. Resultant models for protozoa and fungi were not accurate enough to satisfactorily estimate these variables, only permitting approximate predictions (0.66 < r(2) < 0.80 and 2.0 < RPD < 2.5). Electrical conductivity, pH, exchangeable phosphorus and sodium, metabolic quotient and Gram-negative bacteria were poorly predicted (r(2) < 0.66 and RPD < 2). Thus, the results obtained in this study reflect that NIR reflectance spectroscopy could be used as a rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive technique to predict some physical, chemical and biochemical soil properties for Mediterranean soils, including variables related to the composition of the soil microbial community composition.

The development of mono-specific stands of Acacia mangium (100A:0E) and Eucalyptus grandis (0A:100E) was compared with mixed-species plantations, where A. mangium was planted in a mixture at a density of 50% of that of E. grandis (50A:100E). N(2) fixation by A. mangium was quantified in 100A:0E and 50A:100E at age 18 and 30 months by the (15)N natural abundance method and in 50A:100E at age 30 months by the (15)N dilution method. The consistency of results obtained by isotopic methods was checked against observations of nodulation, Specific Acetylene Reduction Activity (SARA), as well as the dynamics of N accumulation within both species. The different tree components (leaves, branches, stems, stumps, coarse roots, medium-sized roots and fine roots) were sampled on 5-10 trees per species for each age. Litter fall was assessed up to 30 months after planting and used to estimate fine root mortality. Higher N concentrations in A. mangium tree components than in E. grandis might be a result of N,, fixation. However, no evidence of N transfer from A. mangium to E. grandis was found. SARA values were not significantly different in 100A:0E and 50A: 100E but the biomass of nodules was 20-30 times higher in 100A:0E than in 50A: 100E. At age 18 months, higher delta(15)N values found in A. mangium tree components than in E. grandis components prevented reliable estimations of the percentage of N derived from atmospheric fixation (%Ndfa). At age 30 months, %Ndfa estimated by natural abundance and by 15N dilution amounted to 10-20 and 60%, respectively. The amount of N derived from N(2) fixation in the standing biomass was estimated at 62 kg N ha(-1) in 100A:0E and 3 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N natural abundance method, and 16 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N dilution method. The total amount of atmospheric N, fixed since planting (including fine root mortality and litter fall) was estimated at 66 kg N ha(-1) in 100A:0E and 7 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N natural abundance method, and 31 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N dilution method. The most reliable estimation of N(2) fixation was likely to be achieved using the (15)N dilution method and sampling the whole plant. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bouillet, J.

To assess the magnitude and distribution of the sinks more precisely, an accurate estimation of forest biomass is required. However, the determinants of large-scale biomass pattern (especially root biomass) are still poorly understood for these forests in China. In this study, we used 515 field measurements of biomass across the northeast part of China, to examine factors affecting large-scale biomass pattern and root-shoot biomass allocation. Our results showed that, Picea & Abies forest and coniferous & broadleaf mixed forest had the highest mean biomass (178-202 Mg/ha), while Pinus sylvestris forest the lowest (78 Mg/ha). The root:shoot (R/S) biomass ratio ranged between 0.09 and 0.67 in northeast China, with an average of 0.27. Forest origin (primary/secondary/planted forest) explained 31-37% of variation in biomass (total, shoot and root), while climate explained only 8-15%, reflecting the strong effect of disturbance on forest biomass. Compared with shoot biomass, root biomass was less limited by precipitation as a result of biomass allocation change. R/S ratio was negatively related to water availability, shoot biomass, stand age, height and volume, suggesting significant effects of climate and ontogeny on biomass allocation. Root-shoot biomass relationships also differed significantly between natural and planted forests, and between broadleaf and coniferous forests. Shoot biomass, climate and forest origin were the most important predictors for root biomass, and together explained 83% of the variation. This model provided a better way for estimating root biomass than the R/S ratio method, which predicted root biomass with a R-2 of 0.71. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The visible effects are dramatic, noticeable over the short-term and relatively well documented in the literature. Invisible effects are less understood as they require well-focused research both in the short- and long-term time scales. This review of the literature on hurricane effects focuses on the Neotropics and the temperate zone of North America. The material is organized according to a heuristic model that distinguishes between immediate effects (0 to 3 years), immediate responses (0 to 20 years), trajectories of responses (0 to 100 years) and long-term legacies (> 100 years). It is suggested that the ecological role of hurricanes involves six principal effects: 1. they change the ecological space available to organisms; 2. they set organisms in motion; 3. they increase the heterogeneity of the landscape and the variability in ecosystem processes; 4. they rejuvenate the landscape and its ecosystems and redirect succession; 5. they shape forest structure, influence their species composition and diversity and regulate their function; and 6. they induce evolutionary change through natural selection and ecological creativity through self-organization. A new approach to hurricane research will study hurricanes at the same scale at which they operate (i.e., across latitudes and longitudes and over disturbed and undisturbed landscapes). This research will require networks of observation platforms located along expected hurricane paths to facilitate forest structure and functioning observations across gradients of hurricane frequency and intensity. This research will also require use of remote sensing and automated wireless technology, hardened to survive hurricane-strength winds and floods to assure real time measurements of the characteristics of hurricanes and ecosystem responses. No progress will be forthcoming in the understanding of hurricane effects if we do not learn to quantify objectively the energy dissipation of hurricanes on the full grid of affected forests as the hurricane passes over a landscape.","USDA Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA","Lugo, AE (reprint author), USDA Forest Serv, Int Inst Trop Forestry, 1201 Calle Ceiba, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA.",alugo@fs.fed.us,,,,,,189,178,185,4,92,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,JUN,2008,33,4,,,,,368,398,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01894.x,,,31,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,297US,WOS:000255643500002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Barbier, N; Couteron, P; Lefever, R; Deblauwe, V; Lejeune, O",,,,"Barbier, Nicolas; Couteron, Pierre; Lefever, Rene; Deblauwe, Vincent; Lejeune, Olivier",,,Spatial decoupling of facilitation and competition at the origin of gapped vegetation patterns,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,allometry; aridity; Niger; root-shoot ratio; self-organization; symmetry-breaking instability; vegetation patterns,ECOLOGICAL FIELD-THEORY; SOUTH-WEST NIGER; TIGER-BUSH; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; SEMIARID VEGETATION; PLANT INTERACTIONS; ARID ECOSYSTEMS; SOIL PROPERTIES; GYPSUM BLOCKS; WATER-BALANCE,"Spatially periodic vegetation patterns, forming gaps, bands, labyrinths, or spots, are characteristic of arid and semiarid landscapes. Self-organization models can explain this variety of structures within a unified conceptual framework. All these models are based on the interplay of positive and negative effects of plants on soil water, but they can be divided according to whether they assume the interactions to be mediated by water redistribution through runoff/diffusion or by plants' organs. We carried out a multi-proxy approach of the processes operating in a gapped pattern in southwest Niger dominated by a shrub species. Soil moisture within the root layer was monitored in time and space over one month of the rainy season. Soil water recharge displayed no spatial variation with respect to vegetation cover, but the stock half-life under cover was twice that of bare areas. A kernel of facilitation by the aboveground parts of shrubs was parameterized, and soil water half-life was significantly correlated to the cumulated facilitative effects of shrubs. The kernel range was found to be smaller than the canopy radius (81%). This effect of plants on soil water dynamics, probably through a reduction of evaporation by shading, is shown to be a better explanatory variable than potentially relevant soil and topography parameters. The root systems of five individuals of Combretum micranthum G. Don were excavated. Root density data were used as a proxy to parameterize a kernel function of interplant competition. The range of this kernel was larger than the canopy radius (125%). The facilitation-to-competition range ratio, reflecting the above-to-belowground ratio of plant lateral extent, was smaller than 1 (0.64), a result supporting models assuming that patterning may emerge from an adaptation of plant morphology to aridity and shallow soils by means of an extended lateral root system. Moreover, observed soil water gradients had directions opposite to those assumed by alternative mathematical models based on underground water diffusion. This study contributes to the growing awareness that combined facilitative and competitive plant interactions can induce landscape-scale patterns and shape the two-way feedback loops between environment and vegetation.","[Barbier, Nicolas] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Bot Systemat & Phytosociol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Barbier, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Ctr Environm, ECI, Oxford OX1 3QP, England; [Couteron, Pierre] Inst Francais Pondichery, Pondicherry 605001, India; [Couteron, Pierre] IRD UMR Bot & Bioinformat Architecture Plantes AM, F-34398 Montpellier 05, France; [Lefever, Rene; Lejeune, Olivier] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Chim Phys & Biol Theor, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Deblauwe, Vincent] Univ Libre Bruxelles, FRIA, Lab Ecol Paysage, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Lejeune, Olivier] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Math Appl, F-75230 Paris 05, France","Barbier, N (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Bot Systemat & Phytosociol, CP 169,50 Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",nbarbier@ulb.ac.be,"Barbier, Nicolas/A-5489-2010; Deblauwe, Vincent/E-5683-2010","Barbier, Nicolas/0000-0002-5323-3866; Deblauwe, Vincent/0000-0001-9881-1052",,,,68,96,98,3,51,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2008,89,6,,,,,1521,1531,,10.1890/07-0365.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,310OZ,WOS:000256540300006,18589517,,,,10/31/19J,"Jessop, B; Brenner, N; Jones, M",,,,"Jessop, Bob; Brenner, Neil; Jones, Martin",,,Theorizing sociospatial relations,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCALE; GLOBALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; POLITICS; SPACES; STATE; SPATIALITIES; REGIONALISM; PLACE,"This essay seeks to reframe recent debates on sociospatial theory through the introduction of an approach that can grasp the inherently polymorphic, multidimensional character of sociospatial relations. As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated 'turns' within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphy-the organization of sociospatial relations in multiple forms-within sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the 'TPSN framework' to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism.","[Jessop, Bob] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England; [Brenner, Neil] NYU, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Jones, Martin] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales","Jessop, B (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England.",b.jessop@lancaster.ac.uk; Neil.Brenner@nyu.edu; msj@aber.ac.uk,"Jessop, Robert/M-9112-2014; Jones, Martin R/C-5752-2013","Jessop, Robert/0000-0001-8134-3926; Jones, Martin/0000-0002-4627-2293",,,,64,460,468,3,118,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-7758,1472-3433,,ENVIRON PLANN D,Environ.

Don) Spach] decline may result from root freezing injury following climate change-induced reductions in protective snow cover. To test this hypothesis, we measured the freezing tolerance and injury expression of yellow-cedar seedlings in three treatments that differed in the insulative protection they provided to soils during winter and spring: (1) full exposure to ambient temperatures (exposed treatment), (2) continuous protection from ambient temperatures via addition of perlite over pots (full protection), and (3) perlite protection only during winter and exposure to ambient temperatures during spring (partial protection). Foliage from all treatments was cold tolerant enough to prevent foliar freezing injury throughout the study period. However, on all sample dates, roots of seedlings from all treatments were only tolerant to about -5 degrees C - a level considerably warmer than the reported maximum cold tolerance for the species and well above the soil temperature recorded in the exposed treatment. As a result of this limited root cold tolerance, visibly uninjured roots of seedlings from the exposed treatment had significantly higher relative electrolyte leakage (REL) throughout the winter and early spring than seedlings in soil protection treatments. Seedlings from the exposed treatment also had significantly higher foliar REL values and greater visual foliar injury than seedlings from the other treatments starting in early spring. For both roots and foliage, REL measurements consistently detected tissue damage before visual injury was evident. Patterns of injury from both REL and visual injury assessments showed the same pattern: damage began with freezing injury to roots and subsequently became evident as foliar browning after spring temperatures increased. All seedlings in the exposed treatment eventually had 100% fine root damage and died. This progression of initial root damage followed by foliar browning and mortality after the onset of warming conditions is consistent with reports of yellow-cedar decline symptom development in the field.","[Schaberg, Paul G.] No Res Stn, USDA, Forest Serv, S Burlington, VT 05403 USA; [Hennon, Paul E.; D'Amore, David V.] Pacific NW Res Stn, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Hawley, Gary J.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Schaberg, PG (reprint author), No Res Stn, USDA, Forest Serv, S Burlington, VT 05403 USA.",pschaberg@fs.fed.us,,,,,,50,58,62,0,34,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Ecological restoration often involves returning ecosystem structure to some predisturbance reference state, but ecosystem function must also recover if restoration efforts are to be self-sustaining over the long term. In the south-western United States, ponderosa pine forest structure was altered by disruption of the fire regime following Euro-American settlement. Forest structure is now being restored to presettlement conditions through the application of thinning and burning treatments. However, the effects of these treatments on below-ground ecosystem processes remain unclear. 2. We conducted a water and nitrogen (N) addition experiment in adjacent restored and unrestored ponderosa pine stands and compared soil CO(2) efflux in response to these treatments over a 13-month period. Our goals were to (i) quantify water and N limitation to below-ground carbon (C) cycling in contemporary high-density ponderosa pine forests; and (ii) determine if restoration alleviates water and N limitations. 3. Restoration thinning and burning increased soil CO(2) efflux, along with surface soil water content, temperature and herbaceous fine root biomass, while total fine root biomass decreased as a result of restoration. 4. Water and N additions increased C flux from soils to a similar degree in both restored and unrestored ponderosa pine stands, but the increase was relatively small when compared to that stimulated by restoration. 5. Synthesis and applications. An understanding of how ecosystem processes respond to treatments designed to restore ecosystem structure is critical in ensuring the long-term success of restoration efforts. Here we show that, although water and N stimulate C flux from soils in these semi-arid forests, restoration treatments have a much greater effect on soil C balance than increased water and N availability by themselves. This suggests that increased quality of C inputs from a recovering understorey herbaceous community is a key component of restoring ecosystem function (e.g. below-ground C cycling) in south-western ponderosa pine forests.","[Selmants, Paul C.; Hart, Stephen C.; Boyle, Sarah I.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Selmants, Paul C.; Hart, Stephen C.; Boyle, Sarah I.; Gehring, Catherine A.; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Gehring, Catherine A.; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Selmants, PC (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",paul.selmants@nau.edu,"Selmants, Paul/B-6240-2013; Hungate, Bruce/F-8991-2011","Hungate, Bruce/0000-0002-7337-1887; Selmants, Paul/0000-0001-6211-3957",,,,47,19,21,0,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

We used repeat digital photography and image analysis, which revealed a change in area of a dominant BSC lichen, Collema tenax. The data generated correlated well with gross photosynthesis (r = 0.57) and carotenoid content (r = 0.53), two variables that would be expected to be positively related to lichen area. We also extracted fatty acids from lichen samples and identified useful phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) indicators for the Collema mycobiont (20:1, 15:0, 23:0), and the Collema photobiont (18:3 omega 3). The 18:3 omega 3 correlated well with chlorophyll a (r = 0.66), a more traditional proxy for cyanobacterial biomass. We also compared total PLFA as a proxy for total Collema biomass with our photographically generated areal change data, and found them to be moderately correlated (r = 0.44). Areal change proved to be responsive on short-time scales, while fatty acid techniques were information-rich, providing data on biomass of lichens, and both photo- and mycobionts separately, in addition to the physiological status of the mycobiont. Both techniques should be refined and tested in field situations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A combination of trench wall observations and destructive root sampling was used to establish whether root distribution and total biomass of fine and small roots varied with stand age. Root density decreased with soil depth in all stands, and variability appeared to be highest in subsoil horizons, especially where compacted soil layers occurred. Roots clustered in patches in the top 0-50 cm of the soil or were present as root channels at greater depths. Cluster number, cluster size and number of root channels were comparable in all stands, and high values of soil exploitation occurred throughout the entire chronosequence. Overall fine root biomass at depths of 0 120 cm ranged from 7.4 Mg ha(-1) to 9.8 Mg ha(-1), being highest in the two youngest stands. Small root biomass ranged from 3.6 Mg ha(-1) to 13.3 Mg ha(-1). Use of trench wall observations combined with destructive root samples reduced the variability of these estimates. These records showed that variability in fine root distribution depended more on soil depth and edaphic conditions than on stand age, and suggest that trench wall studies provide a useful tool to improve estimates of fine root biomass.","[Bakker, M.

However, the potential herbicide translocation to neighboring trees must be evaluated before widespread recommendations for herbicide injections. We assessed the nontarget translocation of imazapyr (Arsenal), an herbicide commonly used to manage woody vegetation in forests, from injected tree-of-heaven to neighboring noninjected stems. Targeted imazapyr injections not only killed all injected tree-of-heaven, but also killed 17.5% of neighboring (within 3 m) noninjected tree-of-heaven and eight other tree species 62 weeks after treatment. Nontarget mortality from herbicide translocation decreased as the distance from injected tree-of-heaven increased (up to 3 m) and as stem diameter of noninjected plants increased. The plausible modes of inter- and intraspecific herbicide translocation include root grafts, mutually shared mycorrhizal fungi, root exudation and absorption, and/or leaf senescence. Because tree-of-heaven is clonal, patch size and vegetation heterogeneity will be an important,2 determinant of herbicide injection protocols. In forest environments with many small patches (i.e., high edge to interior ratio) or mixed species stands, nontarget hardwoods are at an increased risk of mortality. In isolated large patches (with lower edge to interior ratio) or dense monospecific clones, injection risk to nontarget species will be relatively low.","[Lewis, Kevin; McCarthy, Brian] Ohio Univ, Dept Environm & Plant Biol, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Lewis, K (reprint author), Ohio Univ, Dept Environm & Plant Biol, 317 Porter Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",kl118892@ohio.edu; mccarthy@ohio.edu,,,,,,50,7,10,0,15,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0742-6348,1938-3762,,NORTH J APPL FOR,North.

We collected soil (core and composite) samples from 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-70 cm depths, or down to the bed rock, in the soil profile of four types of forest (managed dense Shorea (DS), degraded forest (DF), pine mixed (PS), and Schima-Castanopsis (SC) forest) and two types of cultivated land (irrigated low land (Khet) and rain-fed upland (Bari)) in the Pokhare Khola watershed of Nepal. In addition to other essential properties, soil bulk density and carbon concentration were assessed. Fine roots were also collected from each sampling site. The biomass of standing trees and shrubs was estimated by using allometric relationships after measuring their diameter and height, while the biomass of grasses was estimated by a direct measurement of grass from a defined area. The carbon stocks in all forest vegetation (trees, shrubs, and ground grass) and in the soil profiles under different land uses were estimated. The vegetation carbon pool was largest in DS forest (219 +/- 34 Mg ha(-1)) and least in SC forest (36 +/- 5 Mg ha(-1)), while its order among forest types was DS > DF > PS > SC. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool was largest in Bari land (15.7 +/- 1.5 kg C m(-2)) and least in PS forest (6.2 +/- 0.5 kg C m(-2)) but the overall order among land uses was Bari > DF > Khet > SC > DS > PS.

Intensive measurements were conducted for a period of 12 months. Soil CO2 emissions were also modeled by multiple regression analysis from daily air temperature, dry-bulb saturated vapor pressure, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, soil moisture, and soil temperature. Data was analyzed based on soil moisture levels and air temperature with annual data being grouped into either hot-humid season or relatively cool season based on the precipitation patterns. This was essential in order to acquire simplified exponential models for parameter estimation. Minimum and maximum daily mean soil CO2 efflux rates were observed in November and July, with respective rates of 1.98 +/- 0.66 and 11.04 +/- 0.96 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) being recorded. Annual average soil CO2 emission (FCO2) was 5.92 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Including all the weather variables into the model helped to explain 73.9% of temporal variability in soil CO2 emission during the measurement period. Soil CO2 efflux increased with increasing soil temperature and soil moisture. Preliminary results showed that Q(10), which is defined as the difference in respiration rates over a 10 degrees C interval, was partly explained by fine root biomass. Soil temperature and soil moisture were the dominant factors controlling soil CO2 efflux and were regarded as the driving variables for CO2 production in the soil. Including these two variables,in regression models could provide a useful tool for predicting the variation of CO2 emission in the commercial forest soils of South China.","[Li Yue-Lin; Zhang Yun; Rao Xing-Quan; Lin Yong-Biao] Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li Yue-Lin; Otieno, D.; Owen, K.; Tenhunen, J.] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Zhang Yun] Hubei Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China","Li, YL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yuelin@scbg.ac.cn,"Li, Yuelin/D-7249-2011",,,,,48,15,24,0,28,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,JUN,2008,18,3,,,,,273,283,,10.1016/S1002-0160(08)60017-X,,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,304SB,WOS:000256128300001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Toledo-Aceves, T; Swaine, MD",,,,"Toledo-Aceves, Tarin; Swaine, Michael D.",,,Above- and below-ground competition between the liana Acacia kamerunensis and tree seedlings in contrasting light environments,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,competition; liana; dorest regeneration; irradiance; tree seedling,HOST LIQUIDAMBAR-STYRACIFLUA; TROPICAL WET FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; DRY FOREST; ABOVEGROUND COMPETITION; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; VINE COMPETITION; ROOT COMPETITION,"Proliferation of lianas in canopy gaps can restrict tree regeneration in tropical forests through competition. Liana effects may differ between tree species, depending on tree requirements for above- and below-ground resources. We conducted an experiment in a shade house over 12 months to test the effect of light (7 and 27% external irradiance) on the competitive interactions between seedlings of one liana species and three tree species and the contribution of both above- and below-ground competition. Seedlings of the liana Acacia kamerunensis were grown with tree seedlings differing in shade tolerance: Nauclea diderrichii (Pioneer), Khaya anthotheca (Non-Pioneer Light Demander) and Garcinia afzelii (Non-Pioneer Shade Bearer). Trees were grown in four competition treatments with the liana: no competition, root competition, shoot competition and root and shoot competition. Both root and root-shoot competition significantly reduced relative growth rates in all three tree species. After one year, root-shoot competition reduced growth in biomass to 58% of those (all species) grown in no competition. The root competition treatment had a more important contribution in the effect of the liana on tree growth. Tree seedlings did not respond to competition with the liana by altering their patterns of biomass allocation. Although irradiance had a great effect on tree growth and allocation of biomass, the interaction between competition treatments and irradiance was not significant. Nauclea diderrichii, the tree species which responded most to the effects of competition, showed signs of being pot-bound, the stress of which may have augmented the competition effects. The understanding of the interaction of above- and below-ground competition between lianas and trees and its moderation by the light environment is important for a proper appreciation of the influence of lianas on tropical forest regeneration.","[Toledo-Aceves, Tarin] CONABIO, Mexico City 14010, DF, Mexico; [Swaine, Michael D.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Toledo-Aceves, T (reprint author), CONABIO, Insurgentes Sur 4903 Col Parques Del Pedregal, Mexico City 14010, DF, Mexico.",t.tarin@lycos.com,"Toledo-Aceves, Tarin/K-8718-2017","Toledo-Aceves, Tarin/0000-0001-6069-468X",,,,63,48,53,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2008,196,2,,,,,233,244,,10.1007/s11258-007-9347-0,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,291KY,WOS:000255197400006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Soares, PG; Rodrigues, RR",,,,"Soares, Pablo Guenther; Rodrigues, Ricardo Ribeiro",,,Direct seeding of forest leguminous trees: rhizobia inoculation effect on plantlet emergence and early growth in field conditions,SCIENTIA FORESTALIS,,,Portuguese,Article,,,,,,Restoration of Riparian Forests; Hand-sowing; Indigenous tree species; Fabaceae seed inoculation,BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SOIL-NITROGEN; N-2 FIXATION; PHOSPHORUS; TROPICS; RESTORATION; LEGUMES; LAND,"The aim of this work was to assess rhizobia inoculation effect on establishment and early growth of direct-seeded indigenous leguminous (Fabaceae) trees.

The feature of this symbiotic bacterium is its ability to oxidize methanol, a property based on the presence of a methanol dehydrogenase enzyme. Despite a good knowledge of this property and its implication in symbiosis, the molecular dialogue between M. nodulans and crotalaria podocarpa leading to symbiosis is largely unknown, except the presence of a nodA nodulation gene in the genome of M. nodulans ORS 2060. To investigate if M. nodulans ORS 2060 produces Nod factors, molecules considered as the major bacteria-to-plant signals essential for the establishment of rhizobia-legume symbiosis, we identified and sequenced a nodDABCUIJHQ cluster from a genomic library of ORS 2060. Phylogenetic analyses of nod genes revealed that M. nodulans ORS 2060 form a branch together with Burkholderia tuberum STM678 and a strain of Methylobacterium sp. (4-46) isolated from Lotononis, and distinct from all the other rhizobia. To analyse the regulation of ORS 2060 nod genes, we constructed a nodA-LacZ promoter fusion to monitor the nod gene expression with various flavonoids. The flavone apigenin was found to be the strongest inducer of nod gene expression in M. nodulans ORS 2060. This latter flavonoid was used to induce ORS 2060, and Nod factors were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further characterized by mass spectrometry. One major Nod factor structure was identified as a pentamer of chitin substituted by C18:1 or C16:0 acyl chains on the non-reducing end and 6-O-sulphated on the other end, suggesting a classic symbiotic dialogue between M. nodulans and C podocarpa.

The ability to monitor and then predict the spread Of infectious diseases may depend upon Our knowledge and capabilities of anticipating the behavior of virulent pathogens by Studying related, benign symbioses. For instance, the ability of a symbiotic species to infect, colonize,and proliferate efficiently in a Susceptible host will depend on a number of factors that influence both partners during the infection. Levels of virulence ire not only affected by the genetic and phenotypic composite of the symbiont, but also the life history, mode(s) of transmission, and environmental factors that influence colonization, such as antibiotic treatment. Population dynamics of both host and symbiont, including densities, migration, as well as competition between symbionts will also affect infection rates of the pathogen as well as change the evolutionary dynamics between host and symbiont, It is therefore important to be able to compare the evolution of virulence between a wide range Of mutualistic and pathogenic systems in order to determine when and where new infections might Occur, and what conditions will render the pathogen ineffective. This perspective focuses Oil several symbiotic models that compare mutualistic associations to pathogenic forms and the questions posed regarding their evolution and radiation. A common theme among these systems is the prevailing concept of how heritable Mutations can eventually lead to novel phenotypes and eventually new species.","[Nishiguchi, M.

With these changes, forests are presumed to be unsustainable. Broad-scale treatments are proposed to reduce fuels and promote stand development on trajectories toward more sustainable structures. Yet little research to date has identified the effects of these treatments, especially in low elevation dry ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests. We report initial fuelbed conditions and changes immediately and 4-6 years after fuel reduction treatments in an operational-scale, replicated (N = 4), completely randomized experiment in northeastern Oregon. Treatments included a single entry thin from below conducted in 1998, a late season burn conducted in 2000, a thin followed by burning (thin + burn), and a no action treatment which served as a control. Between 1998 and 2004, litter mass declined about 4.4 Mg ha(-1) in thin units, about 4.1 Mg ha(-1) in thin + burn units, and about 1.5 Mg ha(-1) in burn units. Duff mass did not change with treatment. Mass of woody fuels in the 1 and 10 h timelag classes increased in thin units immediately after treatment, but fell to nearly pre-treatment levels by 2004. Mass of woody fuels in the 100 It timelag class increased about 1.6 Mg ha(-1) in thin units, and decreased about 0.7 Mg ha(-1) in burn units and about 0.1 Mg ha(-1) in thin + burn units. There was no difference in the change in total woody fuel mass among all treatments. About 62% of the residual trees in the burn and the thin + burn units were charred; charring extended up the bole about 1.1 m. About 50% of the residual trees in the burn and thin + burn units had scorched lower crowns. Mean scorch height was 4.3 m. Log density was greater in control units compared to actively treated units and greater in the thin units compared to burn or thin + burn units. We used the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) to construct a representative fuelbed for each unit from inventoried data and to calculate three indices of fire potential as measures of the change in fire hazard resulting from our treatments: surface fire behavior, crown fire behavior, and fuels available for consumption.

The system consists of three major components: an air-flushing unit, a root-chamber and a CO2 sampling apparatus. We tested and measured the reliability and efficiency of the air-flushing unit while it was attached to root-chamber. The results showed that the flushing efficiencies were at least 98% when 41 or more volume of water was used to flush the air out of both the small and medium root-chamber systems. Because the measured values of CO2-C sampled by syringe in gaseous form and measured by gas chromatograph (CC) was comparable to those sampled by NaOH solution trapping apparatus and measured by total organic C (TOC) analyzer, for simplicity we recommend the former approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that the system was reliable for measuring rhizosphere respiration of fine roots. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this research was to characterize the impact of dairy cow grazing intensity on C and N in soil and vegetation on a meadow steppe. The meadow steppe site, located near Hailaer, Inner Mongolia, China, has been grazed by dairy cattle for more than 30 years, with the last 23 years managed by the same herders. The study site never received any form of mineral fertilizer. Grazing intensity was classified as light (LG), moderate (MG) and heavy (HG) according to the vegetation utilization rate. Grazing affected biomass, total N (TN) and N-15 leve Is, but not C-13, of above-ground plants. The above-ground biomass and delta N-15 decreased but TN content increased with the grazing intensity for all nine non-legume species while five legume species were not affected. Coarse root biomass also decreased with grazing intensity while TN or delta N-15 responses to grazing showed no consistent patterns. Soil OC and total N content decreased significantly with grazing intensity for all three sampling depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) while nitrate, ammonium and C-13 levels were not affected by grazing intensity in all sampling depths. The decreases in soil OC suggest carbon storage in the meadow steppe declined as grazing intensity increased. Combined with the decreases in soil TN content, this also means heavy grazing could lead to decreases in soil quality and fertility. Uneven grazing intensity is an inherent feature of a season-long grazing system and there are risks to soil quality and environmental health associated with HG. We need to find the proper balance between light to heavy grazing intensity through proper grazing management and in some cases using judicious herding to distribute livestock. Some combination of HG, MG and LG could be desirable in sustainable rangeland grazing production. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Although plants inoculated with both microsymbionts grew better (height and root collar diameter) than plants from three other inoculation treatments (control, single inoculation with KWN35 or BEG 176), these results were not statistically different except at 1 and 5 months after field transplantation. KWN35 was present in a relatively high percentage of nodules harvested from plants inoculated with this rhizobial strain either alone or with mycorrhiza (approximately 60% and 40% 1 and 2 years after field transplantation respectively). The percentage of mycorrhizal root infections was around 60% in the inoculated plants after 12 months with significantly higher N, P and K foliar contents of trees compared with the non-inoculated controls. However, as for nodulation, by 24 months after transplantation, there were no significant differences between treatments. We conclude that field inoculation of C. calothyrsus with Rhizobium strain KWN35 and arbuscular mycorrhizal isolate BEG 176 did not have a long-lasting effect on the growth of trees, even when a majority of nodules were occupied by the inoculated rhizobia and the roots infected by the mycorrhiza. Several reasons can be postulated for these results, such as a possible effect of soil fertility on the efficiency of the nodules.","[Lesueur, Didier; Sarr, Amadou] CIRAD, PERSYST Dept, UPR Ecosyst Plantat, Lab Commun Microbiol,UCAD,IRD,ISRA, Dakar, Senegal","Lesueur, D (reprint author), CIRAD, PERSYST Dept, UPR Ecosyst Plantat,Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst, CIAT,TSBF,World Agroforestry Ctr, POB 30677, Nairobi, Kenya.",d.lesueur@cgiar.org,,,,,,29,10,11,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

We tested whether species variation in these traits can explain previously reported interspecific differences in performance under shade and drought. Four irradiance levels (1%, 6%, 20% and 100% of full sunlight) and two water regimes (well watered and water-stressed conditions) in 6% and 100% irradiance levels were established. Quercus species exhibited the largest seeds, the highest total dry mass and also the highest root-shoot ratio, but their leaf mass fraction (LMF) and leaf area ratio (LAR) were low. Pistacia terebinthus, and Arbutus unedo exhibited the opposite traits. From those traits that correlated with seed size only LAR resulted significantly linked to survival in deep shade. None of the traits studied correlated with survival under water-stressed conditions. Overall phenotypic plasticity was negatively correlated with survival in deep shade but no correlation was found with survival under water-stressed conditions. Our results highlight the importance of low LAR and low phenotypic plasticity as potential determinants of enhanced performance under shade during the very early seedling stages of Mediterranean woody species. Low LAR was also positively correlated with seed size and consequently, its relationship with enhanced performance under shade might change at later life stages of the plant when seed reserves are no longer available.","[Sanchez-Gomez, David; Zavala, Miguel A.] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Ecol, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, Inst Recursos Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol, Mostoles 28933, Spain","Sanchez-Gomez, D (reprint author), Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, Carretera Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",david.sango@gmail.com,"Sanchez-Gomez, David/K-5653-2014; Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015","Sanchez-Gomez, David/0000-0002-0588-9713; Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682; Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132",,,,53,21,23,1,48,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Experimentation during the last two to three decades using a large variety of approaches has provided sufficient information to conclude that enrichment of atmospheric CO(2) may have severe impact on terrestrial ecosystems. This impact is mainly due to the changes in the organic C dynamics as a result of the effects of elevated CO(2) on the primary source of organic C in soil, i.e., plant photosynthesis. As the majority of life in soil is heterotrophic and dependent on the input of plant-derived organic C, the activity and functioning of soil organisms will greatly be influenced by changes in the atmospheric CO(2) concentration. In this review, we examine the current state of the art with respect to effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) on soil microbial communities, with a focus on microbial community structure. On the basis of the existing information, we conclude that the main effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) on soil microbiota occur via plant metabolism and root secretion, especially in C3 plants, thereby directly affecting the mycorrhizal, bacterial, and fungal communities in the close vicinity of the root. There is little or no direct effect on the microbial community of the bulk soil. In particular, we have explored the impact of these changes on rhizosphere interactions and ecosystem processes, including food web interactions.","[Drigo, Barbara; Kowalchuk, George A.; van Veen, Johannes A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Microbial Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; [Kowalchuk, George A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Veen, Johannes A.] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","van Veen, JA (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Microbial Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",b.drigo@nioo.knaw.nl; g.kowalchuk@nioo.knaw.nl; h.vanveen@nioo.knaw.nl,"Kowalchuk, George/C-4298-2011; van Veen, Johannes A/C-3697-2011",,,,,135,137,143,2,138,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

In this study, we draw a direct link between aboveground/belowground relationships, vegetation structure, and aboveground management. We used ground nesting ants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as an example for quantifying the role of biotic interactions in soil. Although both groups are known to have a major impact on grasslands, the interactive effect of these taxa on vegetation structure and its sensitivity to grassland management is poorly understood. We show that the ant Lasius flavus increases the root arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization (AMC) of grasses by modifying biotic and abiotic soil properties. As a possible consequence, the shoot length of grass growing on ant mounds was shorter and shoot N and P concentrations were higher than in grass growing off of the mounds. In addition, management affected ant nest architecture and soil and, in turn, AMC. These results emphasize the need to consider the interactions between plants, soil microorganisms, soil fauna, and aboveground management to increase the understanding of the drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands both aboveground and belowground.","[Baltruschat, Helmut] Univ Giessen, Dept Phytopathol & Appl Zool IFZ, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Dauber, Jens; Niechoj, Robin; Wolters, Volkmar] Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol IFZ, D-35392 Giessen, Germany","Dauber, J (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",fbsjda@leeds.ac.uk,"Wolters, Volkmar/B-4635-2010",,,,,34,16,18,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

To address this gap, we reanalyzed data from a study originally designed to examine the effects of soil aluminum/calcium (Al/Ca) ratios on the vitality of red spruce fine roots over a regional acid and N deposition gradient in the northeastern USA. We used root N as an indicator of stand N availability and examined its relationship with the abundance of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes. The dominant morphotypes changed in relative abundance as a function of stand N availability. As root N concentrations increased, Piloderma spp. - like, Cenococcum geophilum Fr., and other unidentified mycorrhizal morphotypes declined in abundance, while other smooth-mantled morphotypes increased. Root N concentration in the 1-2 mm diameter class was the best predictor of the abundance of multiple morphotypes. The morphotype responses were consistent with those found in experimental and small-scale studies, suggesting that N availability is altering ectomycorrhizal communities over broad spatial scales in this region.

The average proportion of R-h to R-s across all sites and sampling dates was 0.63+/-0.026 (mean+/-standard error), indicating that heterotrophic respiration dominated total soil respiration in the studied hybrid poplar plantations.

Associated changes in soil labile C fractions, enzyme activities and aggregate stability were also observed. One year after planting, the combined treatment of fermented DryOC addition and inoculation with AM fungi, particularly with G. mosseae (on average 328% greater than control plants), had the strongest effect on the shoot biomass of D. pentaphyllum. Only the fermented DryOC addition increased assimilable P, total N and aggregate stability, the greatest increase being in the soil available P content (about four-fold higher than in the non-amended soil). Both the addition of fermented DryOC and the mycorrhizal inoculation treatments significantly increased enzyme activities of rhizosphere soil (dehydrogenase, protease-BAA, acid phosphatase and P-glucosidase). The microbially-treated DryOC proved to be an effective amendment for improving the soil quality which, in turn, enhanced the success of revegetation with mycorrhizal D. pentaphyllum seedlings.

Our climate vs. %C-4 results agreed well with North American field studies on %C-4, but showed bias with respect to %C-4 from a US vegetation database (STATSGO) and weak agreement with a physiologically based prediction that depends on crossover temperature. Although monthly average temperatures have been used in many studies to predict %C-4, our analysis shows that high temperatures are better predictors of %C-4. In particular, we found that July climate (average of daily high temperature and month's total rainfall) predicted %C-4 better than other months, seasons or annual averages, suggesting that the outcome of competition between C-3 and C-4 plants in North American grasslands was particularly sensitive to climate during this narrow window of time. Root delta C-13 increased about 1 parts per thousand between the A and B horizon, suggesting that C-4 roots become relatively more common than C-3 roots with depth. These differences in depth distribution likely contribute to the isotopic enrichment with depth in SOM where both C-3 and C-4 grasses are present.","[von Fischer, Joseph C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Tieszen, Larry L.] US Geol Survey, Ctr Earth Resources Observat & Sci EROS, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA; [Schimel, David S.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","von Fischer, JC (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",jcvf@mail.colostate.edu,"von Fischer, Joe/AAC-6977-2019; von Fischer, Joseph/B-5443-2008","von Fischer, Joseph/0000-0001-5508-6073",,,,55,58,60,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Some plants have the ability to acclimate to temperature such that long-term exposure to warmer conditions slows respiration at a given measurement temperature and long-term exposure to cooler conditions increases respiration at a given measurement temperature. We examined acclimation to temperature and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of respiration by ECM fungi by incubating them for a week at one of three temperatures and measuring respiration over a range of temperatures. Among the 12 ECM fungal isolates that were tested, Suillus intermedius, Cenococcum geophilum, and Lactarius cf. pubescens exhibited significant acclimation to temperature, exhibiting an average reduction in respiration of 20-45% when incubated at 23 degrees C compared with when incubated at 11 or 17 degrees C. The isolates differed significantly in their Q(10) values, which ranged from 1.67 to 2.56. We also found that half of the isolates significantly increased Q(10) with an increase in incubator temperature by an average of 15%. We conclude that substantial variation exists among ECM fungal isolates in their ability to acclimate to temperature and in their sensitivity to temperature. As soil temperatures increase, ECM fungi that acclimate may require less carbon from their host plants than fungi that do not acclimate. The ability of some ECM fungi to acclimate may partially ameliorate the anticipated positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature.","[Malcolm, Glenna M.; Koide, Roger T.; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Koide, Roger T.; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lopez-Gutierrez, Juan C.] Holden Aboretum Case Western Univ, Kirtland, OH 44094 USA","Malcolm, GM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",gmm193@psu.edu,"Koide, Roger T/I-4033-2012; Koide, Roger/C-6354-2014","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422",,,,60,65,71,5,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The relative contribution of positive and negative interactions to the organization of ecological communities is an important area, though poorly understood because of the complexity inherent to long-term interactions. For example, positive interactions like plant facilitation turn into negative interactions (competition) along the ontogeny of a plant or in response to temporal fluctuations in the environment. Furthermore, when many plants grow together indirect effects are usually positive and alleviate direct competitive effects. 2. The large number of direct and indirect interactions potentially occurring in natural communities and the temporal scale necessary to account for the ontogenetic shifts in the sign of the interaction makes a fully experimental approach prohibitive. Here, we propose that the phylogenetic distance among co-occurring species is a good proxy to detect competition as a long-term force assembling community composition. Our proposal is based on the observation that closely related species tend to be phenotypically similar and therefore compete for the same niche. 3. We test the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness and the persistence of pairwise (nurse-facilitated) interactions occurring between 102 woody species in three Mexican semi-arid communities in order to quantify the balance between competition and facilitation at the community level. 4. Our results indicate that facilitation turns into competition with increasing taxa relatedness. After validating the association between competition and phylogenetic relatedness, we estimate that 57% of the interactions remain with time while 43% become competitive. [Correction added after publication, 4 March 2008: in the preceding sentence, values corrected from 53% and 47%, respectively.] The preponderance of positive interactions may be explained if facilitation is considered as a mutualism in which both species benefit leading to vegetation clumps in communities. 5. Synthesis. We provide a new perspective on the balance between positive and negative interactions based on a phylogenetically structured network of interactions. This approach promises to contribute to our understanding of long standing issues in plant ecology and to reveal new areas of future research by testing the existence and the nature of the mutualisms as well as their complexity-stability properties on communities as a whole.","[Valiente-Banuet, Alfonso] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Biodiversidad, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Verdu, Miguel] CSIC UV, CIDE, Valencia 46470, Spain","Valiente-Banuet, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Biodiversidad, AP 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",avali@servidor.unam.mx,"Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Verdu, Miguel/Q-3550-2019","Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692",,,,48,111,113,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Soil samples were analyzed from 11 sites located in three mountain areas: NW Caucasus (Russia), the Khibiny Mountains (NW Russia) and Abisko region (N Sweden). Despite differences in the profile patterns of organic matter, nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen availability, we found consistent patterns of N-15 distribution through all studied soil profiles. The delta N-15 values of total N were in general about zero or positive in the surface horizon and increased with soil depth. In contrast with total N, the delta N-15 values of exchangeable NH4+-N were in general about zero or negative in the surface horizons and decreased with soil depth. NH4+-N was significantly N-15-depleted compared with total N in all mineral horizons, while in the surface organic horizons differences between isotopic composition of total N and NH4+-N were mostly not significant. We do not know the exact mechanism responsible for N-15 depletion of NH4+-N with soil depth and further research needs to evaluate the contributions of natural processes (higher nitrification activity and biological immobilization of ""lighter"" NH4+-N near the soil surface) or artifacts of methodological procedure (contribution of the N-15-enriched microbial N and dissolved organic N near the soil surface). Nevertheless, our finding gives a new possibility to interpret variability in foliar delta N-15 values of plant species with different rooting depth in alpine and tundra ecosystems, because plants with deeper root systems can probably consume ""lighter"" rather than ""heavier"" NH4+-N.

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was determined by hemispheric photography, and estimates of fine root biomass of the overstory trees were used as an inverse proportional surrogate for belowground resource availability. For recently germinated seedlings growing under the canopy of Picea abies (L.) Karst., belowground resource availability affected height growth more than light. During subsequent stages of seedling development, apart from initial seedling size, PAR increasingly determined seedling growth. Besides initial size, seedling age determined the effects of above- and belowground resources on seedling height growth. In seedlings identical in initial size but differing in age, the increase in height growth with increasing PAR was greater in older seedlings than in younger seedlings. The ranking of seedling height by year showed that small differences in size at the end of the first growing season resulted in continuously increasing differences during the following years. Mortality data indicated that the chances of a seedling surviving intraspecific competition was strongly determined by its dominance ranking within the first 5 years after establishment.","[Ammer, Christian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Stimm, Bernd; Mosandl, Reinhard] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Silviculture, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Ammer, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",christian.ammer@forst.uni-goettingen.de,"Stimm, Bernd/O-7865-2014","Stimm, Bernd/0000-0003-4808-1893; Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135",,,,57,28,29,0,21,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2008,28,5,,,,,721,728,,10.1093/treephys/28.5.721,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,305LN,WOS:000256180000006,18316304,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Feng, Z; Brumme, R; Xu, YJ; Lamersdorf, N",,,,"Feng, Z.; Brumme, R.; Xu, Y-J.; Lamersdorf, N.",,,Tracing the fate of mineral N compounds under high ambient N deposition in a Norway spruce forest at Solling/Germany,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,high N deposition; (15)NH(4)(+); (15)NO(3)(-); N saturation; spruce forest ecosystem,PICEA-ABIES FOREST; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; SOIL-NITROGEN; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; REACTIVE NITROGEN; EUROPEAN FORESTS; PINE PLANTATION; CLEAN RAIN; N-15; SATURATION,"The fate of high and equally distributed ammonium and nitrate deposition was followed in a 72-year-old roofed Norway spruce forest at Solling in central Germany by separately adding (15)NH(4)(+) and (15)NO(3)(-) to throughfall water since November 2001.

For both (15)N tracers, 15% of added (15)N was found in needles, followed by woody tissues (twigs, branches and boles, 7-13%) and live fine roots (7%). The recovery of (15)NH(4)(+) and (15)NO(3)(-) in the live fine roots differed with soil depth. The recovery of (15)NH(4)(+) tended to be higher in the live fine roots in the organic layer than in the upper mineral soil. In the live fine roots in deeper soil, the recovery of (15)NO(3)(-) tended to be higher than that of (15)NH(4)(+). Soil retained the largest proportion of (15)N, accounting for 71% of (15)NH(4)(+) and 42% of (15)NO(3)(-). Most of (15)NH(4)(+) was recovered in the organic layer (65%) and the recovery decreased with soil depth. Conversely, only 8% of (15)NO(3)(-) was found in the organic layer and 34% of (15)NO(3)(-) was evenly distributed throughout the mineral soil layers. Nitrate leaching accounted for 3% of (15)NH(4)(+) and 19% of (15)NO(3)(-). Only less than 1% of the both added (15)N was leached as DON. These results suggested that trees had a high contribution to the retention of atmospheric N and soil retention capacity determined the loss of atmospheric N by nitrate leaching.

Direct seeding has been ineffective, thus planting high quality seedlings may be a viable alternative. In this study, we examined the stock quality of two valuable Sudanian savanna species, Acacia macrostachya and Pterocarpus erinaceus. Different nursery production periods were tested as well as the species' field performance under well-watered and stressed conditions. The results showed that older seedlings (9-month) were morphologically distinct from younger ones (3-month), particularly in the case of P. erinaceus. Eighteen months after planting out, survival and growth of seedlings were not affected by initial seedling size; this was the result of the high root to shoot ratio of seedlings in all age groups at the time of planting. Seedling mortality as high as 30% was observed and attributed to both drought stress and other factors such as herbivory. Regression analyses revealed that initial shoot height was a poor predictor of field performance for both species, but initial root collar diameter accounted for 25% of the variation in diameter of P. erinaceus in the field. We conclude that initial seedling size does not affect survival and growth in the field provided that all sizes of seedling have a high root to shoot ratio at the time of planting. The prediction of field performance could be improved by developing a model that incorporates a wide range of root collar diameter. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration. The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 12-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil. Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 CM (C] 70) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree(-1)) (r(2) = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C(170) depended both on components and sites. Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha(-1)) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r(2) = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha(-1)) than in MG (41.7 t C ha(-1)), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the around, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools. For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha(-1), in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, these results could be useful when drafting a Project Design Document (PDD) for Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (AR-CDM).

Soil acidification rate and net proton generation were quantified based on the theory of proton budget for the respective soil horizon compartments (mainly the O, A and B horizons) by measuring fluxes of solutes entering and leaving the soil horizon compartment and vegetation uptake. Protons were produced by the dissociation of organic acids and nitrification in the O horizon and then consumed by adsorption and decomposition of organic acids and nitrate uptake by vegetation in deeper soil horizons at all plots. Excess uptake of cation over anion by vegetation was highest among proton sources in the whole soil compartment at all plots. Pedogenetic soil acidification was considered to include cation leaching from surface soil horizons due to proton generation by the dissociation of organic acids and nitrification and subsequent cation excess accumulation in wood in the growth stage of forests. In ando soil, andosolization resulted from the low contribution of net proton generation by the dissociation of organic acids as well as a lower soil acidification rate and complete acid neutralization. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in ando soil were lower than those in podzolic soil and brown forest soil due to high adsorption capacity of amorphous materials. In podzolic soil, podzolization resulted from intensive acidification in the O horizon, which derived from net proton generation by the dissociation of organic acids and nitrification as well as cation excess uptake by vegetation due to concentrated fine root biomass in the O horizon, and subsequent high proton efflux to subsoil. The high fluxes of DOC and Al leached from surface soil horizons were considered to contribute to eluviation of Al from surface soil and illuviation in subsoil in podzolic soil. In brown forest soil, brunification resulted from a lower DOC flux from the O horizon due to high decomposition and adsorption by oxides, where podzolization was weakened by high acid neutralization. Thus, the three representative processes involved in the pedogenesis of Japanese forest soils were well characterized by quantification of the respective proton-generating and consuming processes in each soil horizon.

To quantify this potential C sink and understand its implication to the regional carbon budget and future forest management, we estimated the changes in forest biomass carbon storage in the South Carolina (SC) Piedmont between 1936 and 2005. Based on the nine periods of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data obtained for the Piedmont of South Carolina (18 counties, about 2.8 x 10(6) ha I and area), we used allometric biomass regression equations, directly developed from recent FIA data, and biomass expansion factors to estimate the forest biomass carbon pool for each inventory year. Since 1936, the SC Piedmont forests have accumulated 81.84 Tg C.due to forest expansion and regrowth, increasing from 57.36 Tg C in 1936 to 139.20 Tg C in 2005. Hardwood and softwood forests accounted for 74% (60.38 Ta C) and 26% (21.45 Tg C) of carbon accumulation during this period, respectively. The aboveground forest biomass carbon pool represented 80% or 65.17 Tg C of the total carbon accumulation while the belowground fine and coarse roots only accounted for 20% or 16.67 Ta C. From 1936 through 2005, forest carbon accumulated at a rate of 1.19 Tg C yr(-1), offsetting 5.7% of CO2 emission (20.94 Tg C in 2003) of the entire state of South Carolina. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Symptoms of loblolly pine decline (fine root deterioration, short chlorotic needles, sparse crowns, reduced radial growth) begin in the 30-40 year age class, resulting in premature death at ages 35-50. Loblolly pine decline occurs on sandy, well-drained soils and is associated with Leptographium spp., as well as with root-feeding bark beetles and weevils. The present article discusses the results of a comparison of biological factors associated with pine decline and topographical features, using the analysis of tree health at the Talladega National Forest and Westervelt (formerly Gulf State Paper) Company in central Alabama. Results of this study suggest that an ecological pattern of tree decline and mortality exists. Loblolly stands were more prone to develop symptoms at sites with increased slope and south/southwest orientation. This report indicates that the dominant determinants, or predictors, of loblolly decline are identifiable topographical features. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, several studies have indicated that soil C stocks decrease after planting conifer (mainly pine) trees into pasture. This loss of soil C detracts from the role that plantation forests can play in net C sequestration. Here, we used a paired site (a grazed native pasture with the C-4 grass Themeda triandra dominant, and an adjacent 16-year-old Pinus radiata plantation) to compare all C and nitrogen (N) pools (including soil, litter on the floor, below-ground and above-ground biomass) in the two ecosystems and to estimate the rate of C sequestration after the land use change from the native pasture to the pine plantation. Soil C and N stocks from soil surface down to 1 m under the pine plantation were significantly less than under the native pasture by 20% (57.3 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 71.6 Mg C ha(-1)) and 15% (5.6 Mg N ha(-1) vs. 6.7 Mg N ha(-1)), respectively. Much more C and N was stored in litter on the floor in the pine plantation than in the native pasture (8.0 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 0.03 Mg C ha(-1), and 119.0 kg N ha(-1) vs. 0.9 kg N ha(-1)), and in biomass (95.0 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 2.5 Mg C ha(-1) and 411.5 kg N ha(-1) vs. 62.8 kg N ha(-1)). Carbon stored in coarse tree roots was alone sufficient to compensate the C loss from soil after the land use change. Much more C and N was deposited annually to above-ground litter in the pine plantation than in the native pasture (2.18MgCha(-1) year(-1) vs. 0.22 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), and 32.8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) vs. 5.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), but less to below-ground litter (through fine root death) (2.71 Mg C ha-1 year(-1) vs. 3.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 38.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) vs. 81.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The shift in net primary production from below-ground dominance to above-ground dominance after planting trees onto the pasture, and the slower turnover of litter in the plantation, played a key role in the reduction in soil C in the plantation ecosystem. In conclusion, planting pine trees onto a native temperate Australian pasture sequestered a significant amount of C (net 86 Mg C ha(-1), averaging 5.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) from the atmosphere in 16 years despite the loss of 14 Mg C ha(-1) from the soil organic matter.

With the objective of finding the most suitable legume-rhizobia associations for revegetation trials, we surveyed grasslands and shrublands in an altitudinal transect up to 1302 m in Mediterranean subhumid and humid regions. For comparison, two abandoned quarries on hard limestone were studied as well. Based on a number of criteria, the level of degradation of each site was estimated as: high, medium, or low. Sites submitted to a high degradation pressure presented a smaller number of species and lower ground coverage. The emphasis was put on the legume species encountered on these sites: 52 species were identified and separated according to their frequency. Of these, 18 target species were studied in the second season in terms of their habitat, frequency, and ground coverage. Ten common legume species were found regardless of the level of degradation. As the level of degradation increased, the number of annual legume species significantly decreased as well as their coverage coefficient, to the contrary of perennials. Spontaneous nodulation was encountered in individuals belonging to the genera Alhagi, Astragalus, Bituminaria, Calicotome, Cicer, Hippocrepis, Hymenocarpos, Lathyrus, Lotus, Lupinus, Medicago, Melilotus, Onobrychis, Ononis, Physanthyllis, Scorpiurus, Securigera, Spartium, Trifolium, and Vicia.

Thus, it is imperative to understand which factors determine where a particular interspecific interaction falls along the continuum. Over the past 20 years research on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis has resulted in sufficient independent studies to now generalize about the factors and mechanisms that affect host response to ectomycorrhizas. Using meta-analysis we quantitatively evaluated the role of biotic (partner identity and colonization levels of ectomycorrhizal fungi) and abiotic (phosphorus levels) factors in determining host biomass, height, and shoot : root responses to ectomycorrhizal associations. On average, seedlings across multiple host genera increased in total biomass when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi regardless of the identity of the fungal associate; host genera differed in the magnitude of response for both total biomass and shoot : root ratio. Association with different fungal genera modified only host allocation of biomass to shoots and roots. Neither level of colonization on inoculated seedlings nor the level of contamination on control seedlings relative to colonization levels by target fungi on inoculated seedlings was important in explaining variation in effect sizes for any growth response. None of our proposed factors (identity of partners, colonization level, magnitude of contamination, or duration of association) explained variation in effect sizes for shoot height, although in general seedlings were taller when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Phosphorus additions did not influence effect sizes. Although the general trend across studies was for a positive response of hosts to ectomycorrhizal inoculation, publication bias and methodological issues effectively reduce and distort the spectrum on which we evaluate host responses to ectomycorrhizal inoculation. Our results indicate that the variation in ectomycorrhizal fungi perceived by the host may be of a discrete (presence/absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi) rather than continuous nature (variation in identity or abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi).","[Karst, Justine; Turkington, Roy] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Marczak, Laurie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Jones, Melanie D.] Univ British Columbia, Biol & Phys Geog Unit, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Turkington, Roy] Univ British Columbia, Biodiversity Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Karst, J (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",justine@karst.ca,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184; Karst, Justine/0000-0003-0497-1552",,,,78,69,74,2,78,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2008,89,4,,,,,1032,1042,,10.1890/07-0823.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,296XW,WOS:000255580200018,18481528,,,,10/31/19J,"Callaway, RM; Cipollini, D; Barto, K; Thelen, GC; Hallett, SG; Prati, D; Stinson, K; Klironomos, J",,,,"Callaway, Ragan M.; Cipollini, Don; Barto, Kathryn; Thelen, Giles C.; Hallett, Steven G.; Prati, Daniel; Stinson, Kristina; Klironomos, John",,,Novel weapons: Invasive plant suppresses fungal mutualists in America but not in its native Europe,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,allelopathy; anti-fungal compounds; arbuscular mycorrhizae; biochemistry; biogeographical comparisons; exotic invasion; fungi; indirect interactions; novel weapons,MUSTARD ALLIARIA-PETIOLATA; INCREASED COMPETITIVE ABILITY; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NONINDIGENOUS FOREST HERB; GARLIC MUSTARD; SOIL BIOTA; AMMOPHILA-ARENARIA; ENEMY RELEASE; EXOTIC INVASION; SUCCESS,"Why some invasive plant species transmogrify from weak competitors at home to strong competitors abroad remains one of the most elusive questions in ecology. Some evidence suggests that disproportionately high densities of some invaders are due to the release of biochemicals that are novel, and therefore harmful, to naive organisms in their new range. So far, such evidence has been restricted to the direct phytotoxic effects of plants on other plants. Here we found that one of North America's most aggressive invaders of undisturbed forest understories, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and a plant that inhibits mycorrhizal fungal mutualists of North American native plants, has far stronger inhibitory effects on mycorrhizas in invaded North American soils than on mycorrhizas in European soils where A. petiolata is native. This antifungal effect appears to be due to specific flavonoid fractions in A. petiolata extracts. Furthermore, we found that suppression of North American mycorrhizal fungi by A. petiolata corresponds with severe inhibition of North American plant species that rely on these fungi, whereas congeneric European plants are weakly affected. These results indicate that phytochemicals, benign to resistant mycorrhizal symbionts in the home range, may be lethal to naive native mutualists in the introduced range and indirectly suppress the plants that rely on them.","[Callaway, Ragan M.; Thelen, Giles C.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Cipollini, Don; Barto, Kathryn] Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Hallett, Steven G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Prati, Daniel] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Stinson, Kristina] Harvard Univ, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Klironomos, John] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ray.callaway@mso.umt.edu,"Morris, Kathryn/I-4701-2014; Barto, Kathryn/A-3624-2009","Morris, Kathryn/0000-0003-3548-444X; ",,,,63,293,311,8,329,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2008,89,4,,,,,1043,1055,,10.1890/07-0370.1,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,296XW,WOS:000255580200019,18481529,,,,10/31/19J,"Weigelt, A; Schumacher, J; Roscher, C; Schmid, B",,,,"Weigelt, Alexandra; Schumacher, Jens; Roscher, Christiane; Schmid, Bernhard",,,Does biodiversity increase spatial stability in plant community biomass?,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,biodiversity experiment; environmental heterogeneity; functional diversity; Rao's Q; spatial variability; species richness,EXPERIMENTAL GRASSLAND; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; INTEGRATION; RICHNESS; SYSTEMS; SOIL,"We tested the hypothesis that biodiversity decreases the spatial variability of biomass production between subplots taken within experimental grassland plots. Our findings supported this hypothesis if functional diversity (weighted Rao's Q) was considered. Further analyses revealed that diversity in rooting depth and clonal growth form were the most important components of functional diversity stabilizing productivity. Using species or functional group richness as diversity measures there was no significant effect on spatial variability of biomass production, demonstrating the importance of the biodiversity component considered. Moreover, we found a significant increase in spatial variability of productivity with decreasing size of harvested area, suggesting small-scale heterogeneity as an important driver. The ability of diverse communities to stabilize biomass production across spatial heterogeneity may be due to complementary use of spatial niches. Nevertheless, the positive effect of functional diversity on spatial stability appears to be less pronounced than previously reported effects on temporal stability.","[Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Weigelt, A (reprint author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",alexandra.weigelt@uni-jena.de,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214",,,,48,70,77,5,91,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), the dominant overstory tree in northern hardwood forests of the Lake States region, has a limited capacity to take up and assimilate NO3- . However, it is uncertain whether long-term exposure to NO3- deposition might induce NO3- uptake by this ecologically important overstory tree. Here, we investigate whether 10 years of experimental NO3- deposition (30 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) could induce NO3- uptake and assimilation in overstory sugar maple (approximately 90 years old), which would enable this species to function as a direct sink for atmospheric NO3- deposition. Kinetic parameters for NH4+ and NO3- uptake in fine roots, as well as leaf and root NO3- reductase activity, were measured under conditions of ambient and experimental NO3- deposition in four sugar maple-dominated stands spanning the geographic distribution of northern hardwood forests in the Upper Lake States. Chronic NO3- deposition did not alter the V-max or K-m for NO3- and NH4+ uptake nor did it influence NO3- reductase activity in leaves and fine roots. Moreover, the mean V-max for NH4+ uptake (5.15 mu mol N-15 g(-1) h(-1)) was eight times greater than the V-max for NO3- uptake (0.63 mu mol N-15 g(-1) h(-1)), indicating a much greater physiological capacity for NH4+ uptake in this species. Additionally, NO3- reductase activity was lower than most values for woody plants previously reported in the literature, further indicating a low physiological potential for NO3- assimilation in sugar maple. Our results demonstrate that chronic NO3- deposition has not induced the physiological capacity for NO3- uptake and assimilation by sugar maple, making this dominant species an unlikely direct sink for anthropogenic NO3- deposition.","[Eddy, William C.; Zak, Donald R.; Holmes, William E.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pregitzer, Kurt S.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",drzak@umich.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,46,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2008,11,3,,,,,469,477,,10.1007/s10021-008-9134-3,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,296IT,WOS:000255537400009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Allen, AP; Pockman, WT; Restrepo, C; Milne, BT",,,,"Allen, A.

Quantifying the effects of individual- and population-level processes on plant-community structure is of fundamental importance for understanding how biota contribute to the flux, storage and turnover of matter and energy in ecosystems. 2. Here we synthesize plant-allometry theory with empirical data to evaluate the roles of individual metabolism and competition in structuring populations of the creosote Larrea tridentata, a dominant shrub in deserts of southwestern North America. 3. At the individual level, creosote data support theoretical predictions with regard to the size dependence of total leaf mass, short-term growth rates of leaves and long-term growth rates of entire plants. Data also support the prediction that root-shoot biomass allocation is independent of plant size. 4. At the population level, size-abundance relationships within creosote stands deviate strongly from patterns observed for steady-state closed-canopy forests due to episodic recruitment events. This finding highlights that carbon storage and turnover in water-limited ecosystems can be inherently less predictable than in mesic environments due to pronounced environmental forcing on demographic variables. 5. Nevertheless, broad-scale comparative analyses across ecosystems indicate that the relationship of total abundance to average size for creosote populations adhere to the thinning rule observed and predicted by allometry theory. This finding indicates that primary production in water-limited ecosystems can be independent of standing biomass due to competition among plants for resources. 6. Our synthesis of theory with empirical data quantifies the primary roles of individual-level metabolism and competition in controlling the dynamics of matter and energy in water-limited ecosystems.","[Allen, A.

We quantified the effect of a non-native C-4 grass invasion on soil C pools and fluxes in a Hawaiian tropical dry forest over 2 years in which annual precipitation was average (Year 1) and similar to 60% higher than average (Year 2). Work was conducted in a series of forested plots where the grass understory was completely removed (removal plots) or left intact (grass plots) for 3 years before experiment initiation. We hypothesized that grass invasion would: (i) not change total soil C pools, (ii) increase the flux of C into and out of soils, and (iii) increase the sensitivity of soil C flux to variability in precipitation. In grass plots, grasses accounted for 25-34% of litter layer C and similar to 70% of fine root C. However, no differences were observed between treatments in the size of any soil C pools. Moreover, grass-derived C constituted a negligible fraction of the large mineral soil C pool (< 3%) despite being present in the system for >= 50 years. Tree litterfall was similar to 45% lower in grass plots, but grass-derived litterfall more than compensated for this reduction in both years. Annual cumulative soil-surface CO2 efflux (R-soil) was similar to 40% higher in grass plots in both years, and increased in both treatments by similar to 36% in the wetter Year 2. Despite minimal grass-derived mineral soil C, > 75% of R-soil in grass plots was of C-4 (i.e. grass) origin. These results demonstrate that grass invasion in forest ecosystems can increase the flux of C into and out of soils without changing total C pools, at least over the short term and as long as the native tree canopy remains intact, and that invasion-mediated changes in belowground C cycling are sensitive to precipitation.","[Litton, Creighton M.; Sandquist, Darren R.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Biol Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Cordell, Susan] USDA, Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Litton, CM (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, 1910 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",litton@hawaii.edu,,,,,,70,31,32,4,85,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Big sagebrush shrubs dominate North American rangelands and are critical components of habitat for threatened species such as sage grouse. There were no differences in regression relationships estimating biomass over space and time, which reduces the need to destructively sample sagebrush for local studies and supports regional carbon modeling and biomass estimates. Crown volume (CV) explained the most variability (R-2 > 0.75) in aboveground biomass, and crown area (CA) explained the most variability for coarse roots (R-2 >0.87). Analyses supported both the 2/3 power universal scaling rules between leaf and stem biomass, but did not support global models of seed plant and reproductive part biomass. This study provides compelling evidence that simple field measurements may be used to estimate biomass over large regions and that universal scaling rules are valid for semiarid shrubs.

Despite the vast expansion of grasslands and the alarming extent of land degradation associated with overgrazing, our understanding of the effects of heavy grazing on root fungal symbiosis and the sizes of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks is still limited. This research was conducted in the shortgrass steppe in Los Llanos de Ojuelos, Jalisco, Mexico, where Bouteloua gracilis is a keystone species. We examined soil C and N storage and root colonization of B. gracilis by fungal symbionts (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE)) along a grazing gradient. Roots of B. gracilis were examined for root colonization of AM F and DSE. Soil samples were analyzed for total C and N content. Under moderate grazing, soil C and N were 20% higher than under no-grazing and extremely heavy grazing. Grazing intensity did not differently affect root fungal colonization. However, while the two fungal symbionts coexisted on Bouteloua plant roots, a four times higher root colonization by DSE than by AMF suggests that competition for resources may control symbiont abundance. Considering total root fungal colonization by both symbionts (for DSE 37% and for AMF 10%), and a slightly higher colonization in the less fertile sites, we suggest this fungal symbiosis may play an important role linking the aboveground and belowground C cycle in these semiarid grasslands in Central Mexico.

The objective of this study was to compare streambank root distributions for herbaceous and woody vegetation and to develop empirical models to predict root density. Root length density, root volume ratio, soil physical and chemical properties, and above-ground vegetation densities were measured at 25 sites on six streams in southwestern Virginia. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine differences in root density along stream segments dominated by either woody or herbaceous vegetation. Multiple linear regression was used to develop relationships between root density and site characteristics. Study results showed that roots were evenly distributed across the bank face with the majority of roots having diameters less than 2 mm. Soil bulk density and above-ground vegetation were key factors influencing root density. While significant relationships were developed to predict root density, the predictive capabilities of the equations was low. Because of the highly variable nature of soil and vegetation properties, it is recommended at this time that soil erodibility and root density be measured in the field for design and modeling purposes, rather than estimated based on empirical relationships.","[Piercy, Candice; Wynn, Theresa] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Piercy, C (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",cpiercy@vt.edu,,,,,,42,3,5,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1093-474X,,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

However, it is unclear if there is a general relationship between plant height and R: S ratio across grassland ecosystems. Such knowledge would be helpful for root biomass estimation in grasslands. Location: An altitudinal transect in the Gonghe Basin ( 2880-4040 m a.s.l.), northeast Tibetan plateau. Methods: We measured standing biomass both above-ground and below-ground, maximum plant height (MPH) and soil variables across 43 plots. Results: Climatic variables explained the variations in MPH and R: S ratio of undegraded grasslands better than soil variables (46-50% vs < 19%), while those of degraded grasslands generally showed insignificant correlations with climatic and soil variables. There was a general relationship between R: S ratio and MPH ( negative, R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.001) across degraded and undegraded grasslands. The relationship was used to predict R: S ratio in 13 additional plots in steppe grasslands of Inner Mongolia, and good agreement of expected and observed values has been found ( R-2 = 0.87, P < 0.001). Conclusions: MPH, that is relatively easy to measure, can be used to predict R: S ratio at plot to regional scales. It is promising to develop a new method for large-scale estimation of root biomass in grasslands using MPH and shoot biomass avoiding tedious procedures of physical measuring of above and below-ground biomass.","[Li, Yonghua; Luo, Tiangxing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qi] Chinese Acad Forestry, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Luo, T (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",luotx@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,30,23,32,0,50,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-770 13 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

In numerous lineages across the eukaryotic tree of life, DNA content varies within individuals throughout life cycles and among individuals within species. Discovery of examples of genome dynamism is accelerating as genome sequences are completed from diverse eukaryotes. Though much is known about genomes in animals, fungi, and plants, these lineages represent only 3 of the 60-200 lineages of eukaryotes. Here, we discuss diverse genomic strategies in exemplar eukaryotic lineages, including numerous microbial eukaryotes, to reveal dramatic variation that challenges established views of genome evolution. For example, in the life cycle of some members of the ""radiolaria,"" ploidy increases from haploid (N) to approximately 1,000N, whereas intrapopulation variability of the enteric parasite Entamoeba ranges from 4N to 40N. Variation has also been found within our own species, with substantial differences in both gene content and chromosome lengths between individuals. Data on the dynamic nature of genomes shift the perception of the genome from being fixed and characteristic of a species (typological) to plastic due to variation within and between species.","[Parfrey, Laura Wegener; Lahr, Daniel J.

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses may facilitate plant competition for the specific N pools available in various arctic ecosystems. We report here our study on the N uptake patterns of coexisting plants and microbes at two tundra sites with contrasting dominance of the circumpolar ECM shrub Betula nana. We added equimolar mixtures of glycine-N, NH4+-N and NO3--N, with one N form labelled with N-15 at a time, and in the case of glycine, also labelled with C-13, either directly to the soil or to ECM fungal ingrowth bags. After 2 days, the vegetation contained 5.6, 7.7 and 9.1% (heath tundra) and 7.1, 14.3 and 12.5% (shrub tundra) of the glycine-, NH4+- and NO3--N-15, respectively, recovered in the plant-soil system, and the major part of N-15 in the soil was immobilized by microbes (chloroform fumigation-extraction). In the subsequent 24 days, microbial N turnover transferred about half of the immobilized N-15 to the non-extractable soil organic N pool, demonstrating that soil microbes played a major role in N turnover and retention in both tundra types. The ECM mycelial communities at the two tundras differed in N-form preferences, with a higher contribution of glycine to total N uptake at the heath tundra; however, the ECM mycelial communities at both sites strongly discriminated against NO3-. Betula nana did not directly reflect ECM mycelial N uptake, and we conclude that N uptake by ECM plants is modulated by the N uptake patterns of both fungal and plant components of the symbiosis and by competitive interactions in the soil. Our field study furthermore showed that intact free amino acids are potentially important N sources for arctic ECM fungi and plants as well as for soil microorganisms.","[Clemmensen, Karina Engelbrecht; Sorensen, Pernille Laerkedal; Michelsen, Anders; Jonasson, Sven] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Biol, Dept Terr Ecol, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Stroem, Lena] Lund Univ, GeoBiosphere Sci Ctr, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Clemmensen, KE (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Inst Biol, Dept Terr Ecol, Oster Farimagsgade 2D, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",karinac@bi.ku.dk,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Clemmensen, Karina/C-9555-2014","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Clemmensen, Karina/0000-0002-9627-6428",,,,55,54,54,2,67,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2008,155,4,,,,,771,783,,10.1007/s00442-008-0962-9,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,277TX,WOS:000254238700011,18246373,,,,10/31/19J,"Cermak, J; Nadezhdina, N; Meiresonne, L; Ceulemans, R",,,,"Cermak, Jan; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda; Meiresonne, Linda; Ceulemans, Reinhart",,,Scots pine root distribution derived from radial sap flow patterns in stems of large leaning trees,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,sap flow patterns in stems; leaning trees; fine root distribution; non-destructive methods,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; EARTH IMPEDANCE METHOD; FINE ROOTS; ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENT; MARITIME PINE; NORWAY SPRUCE; WATER-CONTENT; SCALING-UP; SYSTEMS; FOREST,"This study characterizes whole tree root system distribution in a non-destructive way based on its functional parameters, particularly the sap flow patterns in stems. This approach particularly considers sap flow variation across stems, both radial and circumferential patterns of flow that are usually used for a better integration of sap flow density at the whole tree level. We focused at: (1) Showing examples of sap flow variation across stems at a defined situation (high midday values at the period of non-limiting water supply; (2) Analyzing radial flow patterns in terms of root distribution; (3) Validating these results at the stand level (mean data of series of individual trees) using results of classical biometric methods used at the same site; and (4) Applying the results for evaluation of root distribution around leaning trees. Sap flow rate was measured by the heat deformation method on a set of 14 trees at an experimental pine forest stand in Brasschaat (Belgium) during the growing season of 2000. Sap flow variation across stems was measured at a total of 700 points. Amounts of water supplied by superficial (horizontally oriented) and sinker (vertically oriented) roots were estimated from sap flow patterns. The vertical distribution of absorbing roots as derived from the analysis of sap flow patterns in stem sapwood was very similar to the distribution determined by the classical biometric analysis of fine roots. Trees leaning to the East had stem radii at the stump level and crown radii enhanced in the leaning direction. Sinker roots showed higher absorption activities in the leaning direction, but superficial roots were more absorbing in the opposite direction. The application of the above-described method allows for a better evaluation of the whole-tree behavior and facilitates the evaluation of tree and stand properties in traditional forest stands, which are not equipped for detailed scientific research. This may also facilitate practical applications in landscape-level studies.","[Cermak, Jan; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda] Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry Brno, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Meiresonne, Linda] Minist Flemish Community, INBO, Geraaredsbergen, Belgium; [Ceulemans, Reinhart] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Antwerp, Belgium","Cermak, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry Brno, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",cermak@mendelu.cz,"Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda/E-6075-2014","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; ",,,,74,28,28,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2008,305,2-Jan,,,,,61,75,,10.1007/s11104-007-9433-z,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,277IE,WOS:000254205100007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zeppel, M; Macinnis-Ng, CMO; Ford, CR; Eamus, D",,,,"Zeppel, Melanie; Macinnis-Ng, Catriona M.

However, the timing and size of the physiological response can vary depending on plant and environmental characteristics, such as rooting depth, plant size, rainfall amount, or antecedent soil moisture. We investigated the influence of pulses of rainfall on the response of sap flow of two dominant evergreen tree species, Eucalyptus crebra (a broadleaf) and Callitris glaucophylla (a needle leaved tree), in a remnant open woodland in eastern Australia. Sap flow data were collected using heat-pulse sensors installed in six trees of each species over a 2 year period which encompassed the tail-end of a widespread drought. Our objectives were to estimate the magnitude that a rainfall pulse had to exceed to increase tree water use (i.e., define the threshold response), and to determine how tree and environmental factors influenced the increase in tree water use following a rainfall pulse. We used data filtering techniques to isolate rainfall pulses, and analysed the resulting data with multivariate statistical analysis. We found that rainfall pulses less than 20 mm did not significantly increase tree water use (P > 0.05). Using partial regression analysis to hold all other variables constant, we determined that the size of the rain event (P<0.05, R-2 = 0.59), antecedent soil moisture (P<0.05, R-2 = 0.29), and tree size (DBH, cm, P<0.05, R-2 = 0.15), all significantly affected the response to rainfall. Our results suggest that the conceptual Threshold-Delay model describing physiological responses to rainfall pulses could be modified to include these factors. We further conclude that modelling of stand water use over an annual cycle could be improved by incorporating the T-D behaviour of tree transpiration.","[Zeppel, Melanie; Macinnis-Ng, Catriona M.

It has since long been recognized that slopes under vegetation are much more resistant to soil erosion processes compared to bare soils and improve slope stability. Planting or preserving vegetation in areas vulnerable to erosion is therefore considered to be a very effective soil erosion control measure. Re-vegetation strategies for erosion control rely in most cases on the effects of the above-ground biomass in reducing water erosion rates, whereas the role of the below-ground biomass is often neglected or underestimated. While the above-ground biomass can temporally disappear in semi-arid environments, roots may still be present underground and play an important role in protecting the topsoil from being eroded. In order to evaluate the potential of plant species growing in Mediterranean environments to prevent shallow mass movements on gully or terrace walls, the root reinforcement effect of 25 typical Mediterranean matorral species (i.e. shrubs, grasses herbs, small trees) was assessed, using the simple perpendicular model of Wu et al. (Can Geotech J 16:19-33, 1979). As little information is available on Mediterranean plant root characteristics, root distribution data were collected in SE-Spain and root tensile strength tests were conducted in the laboratory. The power root tensile strength-root diameter relationships depend on plant species. The results show that the shrubs Salsola genistoides Juss. Ex Poir. and Atriplex halimus L. have the strongest roots, followed by the grass Brachypodium retusum (Pers.) Beauv. The shrubs Nerium oleander L. and the grass Avenula bromoides (Gouan) H. Scholz have the weakest roots in tension. Root area ratio for the 0-0.1 m topsoil ranges from 0.08% for the grass Piptatherum miliaceum (L.) Coss to 0.8% for the tree Tamarix canariensis Willd. The rush Juncus acutus L. provides the maximum soil reinforcement to the topsoil by its roots (i.e. 304 kPa). Grasses also increase soil shear strength significantly (up to 244 kPa in the 0-0.1 m topsoil for Brachypodium retusum (Pers.) Beauv.). The shrubs Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss. and Anthyllis cytisoides L. are increasing soil shear strength to a large extent as well (up to 134 and 160 kPa respectively in the 0-0.10 m topsoil). Whereas grasses and the rush Juncus acutus L. increase soil shear strength in the topsoil (0-0.10 m) to a large extent, the shrubs Anthyllis cytisoides (L.), Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss., Salsola genistoides Juss. Ex Poir. and Atriplex halimus L. strongly reinforce the soil to a greater depth (0-0.5 m). As other studies reported that Wu's model overestimates root cohesion values, reported root cohesion values in this study are maximum values. Nevertheless, the calculated cohesion values are used to rank species according to their potential to reinforce the soil.","[De Baets, S.; Poesen, J.; Wemans, K.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Phys & Reg Geog Res Grp, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Reubens, B.; Muys, B.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [De Baerdemaeker, J.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Mech & Biostat & Sensors, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Poesen, J (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Phys & Reg Geog Res Grp, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium.",jean.poesen@geo.kuleuven.be,"Reubens, Bert/A-6481-2009","Reubens, Bert/0000-0003-0951-5206; De Baets, Sarah/0000-0001-8245-8960",,,,45,175,183,3,115,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2008,305,2-Jan,,,,,207,226,,10.1007/s11104-008-9553-0,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,277IE,WOS:000254205100017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Turnau, K; Anielska, T; Ryszka, P; Gawronski, S; Ostachowicz, B; Jurkiewicz, A",,,,"Turnau, K.; Anielska, T.; Ryszka, P.; Gawronski, S.; Ostachowicz, B.; Jurkiewicz, A.",,,Establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants originating from xerothermic grasslands on heavy metal rich industrial wastes-new solution for waste revegetation,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,phytostabilisation; heavy metals; dry calcareous grasslands; arbuscular mycorrhiza,FUNGAL AMF STRAINS; ZINC WASTES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DETERMINANT; DIVERSITY; POLAND,"Industrial waste substrata, rich in heavy metals, are poorly suited for plant growth. Efforts are made to establish an appropriate plant cover to reduce erosion and further contamination. Grasses are the usual solution, as they grow fast, thrive on poor substrata and have well-developed root systems. Some of them are also highly dependent on mycorrhizal symbiosis that supports their growth especially on poor and polluted soils. However, the commercially available grasses often meet a lack of well established mycorrhiza on the site and the introduced plant populations dramatically decrease with time, despite large financial input including covering the substratum with soil and intensive watering. The aim of this paper was to select proper plants together with mycorrhizal fungi that could accelerate the establishment of the vegetation and improve its diversity under these extreme conditions, minimizing the financial costs of the reclamation (no use of soil layering and watering). The experiments were carried out under field and laboratory conditions. The plant seeds used originated from dry calcareous grasslands. The seeds were germinated under field conditions or in pots filled with soil supplemented with substratum from the industrial wastes. The seedlings were inoculated with AM fungi and introduced on the field plots a few weeks after germination. The inoculum consisted of either crude inoculum harvested from the dry calcareous grasslands or strains originating from polluted areas. Plants colonized by mycorrhizal fungi established well in the experimental plots. The results suggest that inocula from dry calcareous grasslands are potentially useful in revegetation of industrial wastes. Although in several cases the photosynthetic activity of plants was lower than at the natural sites, almost all plants survived and formed seeds. In all experiments the plant vitality was estimated on the basis of chlorophyll a fluorescence and was useful to show differences between waste substrata, inocula and coexisting plant species. The interactions between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants were studied under greenhouse conditions and at least no negative effect of this coexistence was found.","[Turnau, K.; Anielska, T.; Ryszka, P.] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Gawronski, S.] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Ostachowicz, B.] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Phys & Appl Comp Sci, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Jurkiewicz, A.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Turnau, K (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ul Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",katarzyna.turnau@uj.edu.pl,"Ryszka, Przemyslaw/C-8360-2012","Ryszka, Przemyslaw/0000-0003-1108-3190; Anielska, Teresa/0000-0002-5328-8496; Turnau, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8875-0978",,,,31,28,32,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2008,305,2-Jan,,,,,267,280,,10.1007/s11104-008-9563-y,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,277IE,WOS:000254205100021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rodriguez-Calcerrada, J; Pardos, JA; Gil, L; Reich, PB; Aranda, I",,,,"Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Alberto Pardos, Jose; Gil, Luis; Reich, Peter B.; Aranda, Ismael",,,Light response in seedlings of a temperate (Quercus petraea) and a sub-Mediterranean species (Quercus pyrenaica): contrasting ecological strategies as potential keys to regeneration performance in mixed marginal populations,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,acclimation to light; ecological requirements; competitive ability; marginal populations,TREE SEEDLINGS; GROWTH-RATE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; TRAIT RELATIONSHIPS; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; SHADE TOLERANCE; WATER RELATIONS; WOODY-PLANTS; LEAF SIZE; ACCLIMATION,"In order to understand better the ecology of the temperate species Quercus petraea and the sub-Mediterranean species Quercus pyrenaica, two deciduous oaks, seedlings were raised in two contrasting light environments (SH, 5.3% full sunlight vs. HL, 70% full sunlight) for 2 years, and a subset of the SH seedlings were transferred to HL (SH-HL) in the summer of the second year. We predicted that Q. pyrenaica would behave more as a stress-tolerant species, with lower specific leaf area (SLA), allocation to leaf mass, and growth rate and less responsiveness to light in these metrics, than Q. petraea, presumed to be more competitive when resources, especially light and water, are abundant. Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL. They also displayed a higher proportion of biomass in stems (SMF), and a lower root to shoot ratio (R/S) in HL than those of Q. pyrenaica, which sprouted profusely, and had higher rates of photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(wv)), but lower whole-plant net assimilation rate (NAR). On exposure to a sudden increase in light, SH-HL seedlings of both species showed a short period of photoinhibition, but fully acclimated photosynthetic features within 46 days after transference; height, main stem diameter, RGR and NAR all increased at the end of the experiment compared to SH seedlings, with these increases more pronounced in Q. petraea. Observed differences in traits and responses to light confirmed a contrasting ecology at the seedling stage in Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica in consonance with differences in their overall distribution. We discuss how the characteristics of Q. petraea may limit the availability of suitable regeneration niches to microsites of high-resource availability in marginal populations of Mediterranean climate, with potential negative consequences for its recruitment under predicted climatic changes.","[Aranda, Ismael] Centro Nacl Invest Forestal CIFOR, INIA, Madrid 28080, Spain; [Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Alberto Pardos, Jose; Gil, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Montes, Unidad Anat Fisiol & Genet Forestal, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Alberto Pardos, Jose; Gil, Luis; Aranda, Ismael] Unidad Mixta INA UPM, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Aranda, I (reprint author), Centro Nacl Invest Forestal CIFOR, INIA, Apdo 8111, Madrid 28080, Spain.",aranda@inia.es,"Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014; Aranda, Ismael/B-7050-2008; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus/P-6716-2014","Gil, Luis/0000-0002-5252-2607; Aranda, Ismael/0000-0001-9086-7940; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus/0000-0001-7408-7653; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,51,27,27,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2008,195,2,,,,,273,285,,10.1007/s11258-007-9329-2,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,274IU,WOS:000253995800009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bolliger, A; Nalla, A; Magid, J; de Neergaard, A; Nalla, AD; Bog-Hansen, TC",,,,"Bolliger, Adrian; Nalla, Amarnadh; Magid, Jakob; de Neergaard, Andreas; Nalla, Anita Dole; Bog-Hansen, Thorkild C.",,,"Re-examining the glomalin-purity of glomalin-related soil protein fractions through immunochemical, lectin-affinity and soil labelling experiments",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomalin; GRSP; western and lectin blot; crossed immuno- and lectin affinity electrophoresis; polyclonal antibody; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; C-14 soil labeling,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; AGGREGATION; EXTRACTION,"Due to analytical similarities with the mycorrhizal glycoprotein glomalin, ubiquitous citrate and heat-extractable soil protein fractions have been assumed to be predominantly glomalin-stabilised within soil. Often termed glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), little however is actually known of the ""glomalin-purity"" of these soil fractions. We undertook western and lectin blots and crossed immuno/lectin affinity electrophoresis (CIE/CLAE) analysis of ""easily extractible"" GRSP fractions, as well as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of ""total"" GRSP fractions. To further test whether soil saprobes contribute to GRSP production, we amended soil with C-14-sucrose and examined whether C-14 could be traced in the GRSP pool over a 500-day incubation period. While only four of six bands on SDS-PAGE profiles of easily extracted GRSP reacted with anti-glomalin MAb32B11 and the lectin Con A under Our blotting conditions, CIE/CLAE indicated the presence of a single protein moiety in the easily extractible GRSP pool. LC-MS/MS analysis of total GRSP pooled from various soils also showed that although traces of protein tentatively assignable to soil bacteria were present in GRSP, their concentrations were low. Additionally, specific activity of total GRSP in C-14-labelled soil was relatively depleted compared to the bulk soil and soil microbial biomass. This suggests that little GRSP of heterotrophic origin was laid down over the incubation period, although the potential presence of a pre-existing C-14-free GRSP background, as well as of low microbial dynamics in the absence of any further substrate inputs to the soil warrant caution with this inference.

In this study, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were combined with cloning of fungal 18S ribosomal gene fragments for the rapid comparison of AM F community structure in soil. Reference AMF isolates, representing four major genera of AMF, were used to develop the method. Sequential amplification of 18S rDNA fragments by nested PCR using primer pairs AMI-NS31 and Glo1-NS31GC followed by DGGE analysis yielded a high-resolution band profile. In parallel, 18S rDNA fragment clone libraries were constructed and clones screened by DGGE. Sequence identity was inferred by matching the electrophoretic mobility of the sample fingerprint bands to that of bands from individual clones. The effectiveness of this approach was tested on soil samples from different ecosystems, yielding reproducible, complex DGGE band patterns specific to each site. The coupling of PCR-DGGE with clone library analysis provides a robust, reliable, and precise means to characterize AM F community structure in soils. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The decline in dominant tree species may lead to cascading effects on other tree and microbial species and their interactions, affecting forest recovery following the decline. In the eastern USA, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr) is declining because of infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae Annand). Northern red oak (Quercits rubra L.) is a common replacement species in declining hemlock stands, but reduced mycorrhizal inoculum potential in infested hemlock stands may cause oak to grow more slowly compared with oak in oak stands. We grew red oak seedlings for one growing season in declining hemlock-dominated stands infested with HWA and in adjacent oak-dominated stands. Ectomycorrhizal root tip density and morphotype richness in soil cores were 63 and 27% less, respectively, in declining hemlock stands than in oak stands. Similarly, ectomycorrhizal percent colonization and morphotype richness On oak seedlings were 33 and 30% less, respectively, in declining hemlock stands than in oak stands. In addition, oak seedlings in declining hemlock stands had 29% less dry mass than oak seedlings in oak stands. Analysis of covariance indicated that morphotype richness could account for differences in oak seedling dry mass between declining hemlock stands and oak stands. Additionally, oak seedling dry mass in declining hemlock stands significantly decreased with decreasing ectomycorrhizal percent colonization and morphotype richness. These results suggest that oak seedling growth in declining hemlock stands is affected by reduced ectomycorrhizal inoculum potential. Further, the rate of forest recovery following hemlock decline associated with HWA infestation may be slowed by indirect effects of HWA on the growth of replacement species, through effects on ectomycorrhizal colonization and morphotype richness.","[Lewis, James D.; Licitra, Jeff; Tuininga, Amy R.; Sirulnik, Abby; Turner, Gregory D.; Johnson, Jacqui] Fordham Univ, Louis Calder Ctr, Biol Field Stn, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Lewis, James D.; Licitra, Jeff; Tuininga, Amy R.; Sirulnik, Abby; Turner, Gregory D.; Johnson, Jacqui] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Licitra, Jeff] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Math, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Turner, Gregory D.] W Chester Univ, Dept Biol, W Chester, PA 19383 USA","Lewis, JD (reprint author), Fordham Univ, Louis Calder Ctr, Biol Field Stn, Armonk, NY 10504 USA.",jdlewis@fordham.edu,,,,,,63,20,20,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2008,28,4,,,,,629,636,,10.1093/treephys/28.4.629,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,290LB,WOS:000255123200015,18244948,,,,10/31/19J,"Chandra, R; Yadav, S; Mohan, D",,,,"Chandra, Ram; Yadav, Sangeeta; Mohan, Dinesh",,,Effect of distillery sludge on seed germination and growth parameters of green gram (Phaseolus mungo L.),JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,,,English,Article,,,,,,distillery sludge; antioxidants; growth parameters; Phaseolus mungo L.; heavy metals; soil amendments,SEWAGE-SLUDGE; NITROGEN-FIXATION; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HEAVY-METALS; ANTIOXIDANTS; WASTE; SOILS; SURVIVAL; EFFLUENT; COMPOST,"Experiments were carried out to study the effect of distillery sludge amendments with garden soil (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%) on seed germination and growth parameters of Phaseolus mungo L.

SEEDLINGS; TRADE-OFFS; DROUGHT; SHADE,"The ecophysiological response to summer drought in seedlings of two co-occurring oak species (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica) outplanted below a dense Pinus sylvestris stand and a medium canopy gap was examined in two experiments carried out in central mountains of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). Leaf water relations and gas exchange were studied in the first experiment. For both species, lower pre-dawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) evidenced a higher degree of water stress in the understory seedlings, even though soil moisture was similar in both sites. Rates of photosynthesis (A(sat)) and stomatal conductance (g(sat)) at saturating light were higher in the gap seedlings in all measuring dates, but the earlier and more pronounced stress imposed in the understory precluded the comparison of tolerance responses between sites. Q. pyrenaica showed always higher A(sat) and g(sat) than Q. petraea, independently of psi(pd), which did not differ significantly between species. At the end of summer, values of A(sat)/g(sat) and leaf carbon isotopic composition reflected a less efficient water use in Q. pyrenaica. In the second experiment, growth and root development were examined in a different set of seedlings planted in the same sites. Q. petraea allocated less biomass to roots, and attained 20% higher total plant dry mass than Q. pyrenaica at the end of the second growing season in the field. For both species total plant dry mass and coarse plus fine root dry mass reached at this time were approximately three-fold higher in the gap than in the understory. Poor root development could explain the more limited access to water of seedlings outplanted in the understory. This study reveals that seedlings of Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica planted under a dense, mature pine stand are more susceptible to summer drought and present a delay in growth with respect to a medium canopy gap.

We found that only 73% of soil volume was filled with theoretical ""pots"" enveloping root system and only 13% of soil volume was inhabited with roots of second and lower order in the conditions of floodplain forest. Dry root biomass (including stumps) represented 13% of total tree biomass and thus played an important role in the carbon budget. Maximal amount of roots (and also maximum volume of root-inhabited soil) was found in depth from 40 to 100 cm. The scatter of root-inhabited soil parameters was significantly higher in ash, than in oak. Clump technique allows to assess utilization of soil by tree roots that may be further used for comparison of different tree species and different sites with focus on ecological limitation of growth.

The species studied exhibited extensive, dense rooting and depth of penetration. These aspects, to some extent, could provide surficial as well as deep-seated erosion control. A high water absorption capacity would increase suction, thus potentially extracting water at the greater depth. The soil-root matrix significantly affects cohesion factor but not the angle of friction. The effect varies with increasing depth and age of plant depending on the root length density. After 6 months of growth, the cohesion factor had tremendously increased by two- to five-fold (0.1-0.5 m soil depth). This range almost reached the values of those in the 12-month treatment, indicating a high contribution of the root system to soil-root reinforcement. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that (i) vegetation zonation along roadsides is a function of the different microtopography and substrate types (microhabitats) created by road construction and (ii) plant colonization in these microhabitats is dependant upon the presence of suitable regeneration traits adapted to the specific microhabitats. We identified four distinct microhabitats namely shoulder, side slope, ditch and back slope from the edge of the road to the edge of the forest. We conducted vegetation and soil analyses in these microhabitats along 34 random transects running perpendicular to the road to the edge of forest in a 14 km section of the Trans Canada Highway (TCH) in Terra Nova National Park (TNNP), Newfoundland, Canada. The multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) confirmed that the plant communities of the four roadside microhabitats were significantly different from each other. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that composition of roadside plant communities was related to gradients of soil moisture content, bulk density, organic matter depth and pH. Several indicator plants, determined by indicator species analysis (ISA), were abundant in their respective microhabitats, indicating their affinity to particular sets of environmental conditions. The root-shoot analysis of selected dominant plants across the roadside habitats revealed that plants of a particular microhabitat had similar above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns. We found that floristic zonation along roadsides is a function of roadside microtopography, substrate type and environmental gradients created by the road building process. The similarities in above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns of dominant plants of respective microhabitats could be used as a basis of interpreting the role of autecological attributes of the species that enable them to establish in specific microhabitats. Several native plants, such as Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, Vaccinium angustifolium, Trifolium repens, and Anaphalis margaritaceae are naturally abundant in side slopes and possess autecological attributes such as low stature, widespread above- and below-ground parts, and drought tolerance. Presence of these desirable properties and their perennial habit make them excellent candidates for roadside revegetation. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Karim, M.

The Daofu population was from a wetter upland climate region, whereas the Dingxi populations was from a drier lowland climate region. A completely randomized design with two factors, two populations and two watering regimes (100% and 25% of the soil water holding capacity), was used. In both populations, drought significantly decreased growth and the net photosynthesis rate (A), and significantly increased the root/shoot ratio (RS), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, and abscisic acid (ABA) and proline contents. Compared with the Daofu population, drought induced a greater RS value, higher CAT, GPX, and APX activities, and a higher ABA content in the Dingxi population, whereas the gas exchange traits, for example, the stomatal limitation value (L-S) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), were less responsive to drought in the Dingxi population. The two populations may have developed different strategies to tolerate drought, such as different pathways to dissipate excess absorbed light energy, to resist oxidative stress, and to keep water status. Such factors enable the Dingxi population to tolerate drought better than the Daofu population.","[Xu, Gang; Duan, Baoli; Li, Chunyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Bioln Chem, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Xu, Gang] Guizhou Univ, Ctr Res & Dev Fine Chem, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China","Li, CY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Bioln Chem, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",licy@cib.ac.cn,"Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013",,,,,46,4,4,0,9,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

For immature seeds collected 65 days after pollination, high germination rate (av. 50%) was achieved on Hyponex agar medium plates. Root development occurred in about 10% of the protocorms 5 months after seed sowing. Rooted protocorms were transferred to a culture bottle containing 100 ml of the Hyponex agar medium and incubated continually. In about 30% of the transferred individuals, shoot height reached 1.5-2 cm 8 months after the transfer. After acclimatization in wet vermiculite at 4 degrees C for 6 months, 135 individuals were planted in a natural stand of C. falcata in mid February 2001. Shoot appearance rate was 44.4% at the first year and flowering was noted in some plants. At the fifth year, shoots with an average height of 21.6 cm still appeared in four plants, and flowering was noted in three of them. Colonization of mycorrhizal fungi was examined in two of them as well as one wild plant, in which the mycorrhizal fungi were identified to be in Thelephoraceae or Russulaceae. These fungi are known to form ectomycorrhiza with trees, and thus a tripartnership symbiosis consisting of C. falcata, mycorrhizal fungi and trees was suggested. The involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi might be the reason for the low survival rate in the field experiment, because the distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi relevant to this orchid is assumed to be uneven. The possibility of introducing artificially propagated orchids into natural habitats was discussed.","[Yamato, Masahide] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd, Dept Res & Dev, Biol Environm Inst, Kyoto 6110021, Japan; [Iwase, Koji] Tottori Univ, Fungus Mushroom Resource & Res Ctr, Fac Agr, Tottori 6808553, Japan","Yamato, M (reprint author), Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd, Dept Res & Dev, Biol Environm Inst, 8-4 Ujimatafuri, Kyoto 6110021, Japan.",yamato_masahide@kanso.co.jp,,,,,,39,18,20,0,18,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

B.S.P.]. In 2004 and 2005, we grew black spruce at either 22 degrees C/16 degrees C day/night temperatures [low temperature (LT)] or 30 degrees/24 degrees C [high temperature (HT)] and determined how temperature affected growth, leaf morphology, photosynthesis, respiration and thermotolerance. HT spruce were 20% shorter, 58% lighter, and had a 58% lower root : shoot ratio than LT trees. Mortality was negligible in the LT treatment, but up to 14% of HT seedlings died by the end of the growing season. HT seedlings had a higher photosynthetic temperature optimum, but net photosynthesis at growth temperatures was 19-35% lower in HT than LT trees. HT seedlings had both a lower apparent maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) and a lower apparent maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) than LT trees, indicating reduced allocation to photosynthetic components. Consistently, HT needles had 26% lower leaf nitrogen content than LT needles. At each measurement temperature, HT seedlings had 20-25% lower respiration rates than LT trees; however, this did not compensate for reduced photosynthetic rates at growth temperature, leading to a greater ratio of dark respiration to net carbon dioxide assimilation rate in HT trees. HT needles had 16% lower concentrations of soluble sugars than LT needles, but similar starch content. Growth at high temperatures increased the thermotolerance of black spruce. HT trees showed less PSII inhibition than LT seedlings and no increase in electrolyte leakage when briefly exposed to 40-57 degrees C. While trees that develop at high temperatures have enhanced tolerance for brief, extreme heat events, the reduction in root allocation indicates that seedlings will be more susceptible to episodic soil drying and less competitive for belowground resources in future climates of the boreal region.","[Way, Danielle A.; Sage, Rowan F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Way, DA (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",way@eeb.utoronto.ca,"Way, Danielle/N-1867-2014","Way, Danielle/0000-0003-4801-5319",,,,66,95,97,4,55,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Patterns of change in the above-ground community were also identified along this transect. Rooting depth increased, and the centre of mass of the root profile shifted towards the maximum rooting depth as a function of distance up the catena. The data also suggest that interspecific variation in rooting depth may increase up the catena.

The most commonly used protocols for extracting glomalin require autoclaving of soil in citrate solution, followed by centrifugation to separate the supernatant, and then measurement by either Bradford protein assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that lengthening the time of autoclaving increased easily extractable glomalin extraction. Delay of centrifugation after autoclaving, however, diminished Bradford-reactive substances in the supernatant, suggesting that extracted substances might be reversibly immobilized on soil particles. Surprisingly, increasing the volume of extraction solution did not accelerate extraction of ""total glomalin"", but instead, substantially increased the amount extracted. Multiple autoclave cycles nevertheless denature glomalin, which may not be as heat-resistant as thought. Repeated 1-h autoclaving of supernatant diminished both its Brad ford-reactive substances (7.3% h(-1)) and immunoreactive protein (22% during the first hour and 9.5% h(-1) of the remainder thereafter), although a large initial volume of extractant could reduce the loss of immunoreactive protein. Proteins and polyphenols that survive the extraction process are measured non-specifically by the Bradford assay. When we added other glycoproteins to dry soils, we recovered a maximum 34% bovine serum albumin and 22% bovine mucin, primarily in the first two, 1-h extraction cycles. These added proteins may adhere to soil organic matter and thereby be protected from denaturation. In addressing the endpoint of glomalin extraction, we found that the Michaelis-Menten equation closely fits cumulative glomalin per extraction cycle such that its asymptote provides an objective estimate of total extractable glomalin for a given set of extraction conditions. Additionally, the equation provides a curvature parameter that reflects the soil-specific efficiency of an extraction protocol. Although the soils that we investigated with 7.6% or more soil organic matter had the most asymptotic total glomalin, they were extracted the least efficiently. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, we have shown that an effective symbiosis between strains of R. l. trifolii and clover was established despite the soil harbouring ineffective R. L trifolii capable of nodulating the host. We termed this ""selection"" for effective symbiosis. This paper reports glasshouse-based experiments to validate and further explore this in situ selection phenomenon. The effect of cell density and strain ratio at the time of inoculation, as well as soil pH, were investigated on two hosts (Trifolium purpureum and Trifolium polymorphum) that were each exposed to one microsymbiont capable and one incapable of N-2 fixation. In co-inoculation experiments at a cell density of 10(4) cells/mL, each host nodulated solely with its effective strain, even when this strain was outnumbered 100-fold by the ineffective strain. However, the selection process ceased when the effective strain was outnumbered 1000-fold. At higher basal cell concentrations of 10(5)-10(8) cells/mL, selection for WSM 1325 to form effective nodulation on T purpureum was evident, but was significantly reduced as the ratio of ineffective cells in the inoculum increased above 4-fold. The results indicate that the selection mechanism is highly dependent on the basal rhizobial cell density. Soil pH did not significantly alter the process, and both strains grew at similar rates and formed nodules at similar rates. A preliminary investigation into the genetic backgrounds of WSM1325 and WSM2304 revealed that although their 16S rRNA sequences were identical, they have considerable differences in their symbiotic and chromosomal replicons through examination of atpD, GSII and nodD sequences.

The effects of both symbioses on plant growth were studied in a greenhouse experiment with four treatments: two single inoculations, one double inoculation, and no inoculation, in a nonsterilized substrate from a desurfaced soil. A synergic effect was observed because double inoculation produced significantly higher shoot biomass, nodule biomass, and N-2 fixation, as measured by the acetylene reduction assay (at least 93%, 50%, and 192%, respectively) than any single inoculation treatment and than noninoculated controls, which were nodulated by soil-born rhizobia. Mycorrhizal colonization did not improve the growth of control plants, but it did significantly improve the specific nitrogenase activity of plants inoculated also with Rhizobiuln species RpI1 by 77%.

Kirk ex J. Leonard) trees growing near Maun, Botswana on a Kalahari sandveld overlying an impermeable calcrete duricrust. We sought to determine if differences between the two physicgnomic types are attributable to the way they exploit available soil water. The tall form, which was located on deeper soil than the short form (5.5 versus 1.6 m), had a lower leaf:fine root biomass ratio (1:20 versus 1:6), but a similar leaf area index (0.9-1.0). Leaf nitrogen concentrations varied between 18 and 27 mg g(-1) and were about 20% higher in the tall form than in the short form. Maximum net assimilation rates (A(sat)) occurred during the rainy seasons (March-April 2000 and January-February 200 1) and were similar in the tall and short forms (15-22 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) before declining to less than 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the end of the rainy season in late April. As the dry season progressed, A(sat), soil water content, predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) and leaf nitrogen concentration declined rapidly. Before leaf abscission, Psi(pd) was more negative in the short form (-3.4 MPa) than in the tall form (-2.7 MPa) despite the greater availability of soil water beneath the short form trees. This difference appeared attributable to differences in root depth and density between the physiognomic types. Stomatal regulation of water use and carbon assimilation differed between years, with the tall form having a consistently more conservative water-use strategy as the dry season progressed than the short form.","[Veenendaal, Elmar M.; Mantlana, Khanyisa B.; Weber, Piet; Huntsman-Mapila, Phillipa] Univ Botswana, Harry Oppenheimer Okavango Res Ctr, Maun, Botswana; [Veenendaal, Elmar M.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol Grp, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Mantlana, Khanyisa B.] Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, Global Change Res Grp, S African Natl Biodivers Inst, Cape Town, South Africa; [Pammenter, Norman W.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life & Environm Sci, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa; [Lloyd, Jon] Univ Leeds, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Veenendaal, EM (reprint author), Univ Botswana, Harry Oppenheimer Okavango Res Ctr, Private Bag 285, Maun, Botswana.",elmar.veenendaal@wur.nl,"Pammenter, Norman/E-9357-2010; Lloyd, Jonathan/F-8893-2010; Veenendaal, Elmar/B-4628-2009","Lloyd, Jonathan/0000-0002-5458-9960; ",,,,42,15,15,1,16,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2008,28,3,,,,,417,424,,10.1093/treephys/28.3.417,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,274ZF,WOS:000254040600011,18171665,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"San Jose, J; Montes, R; Grace, J; Nikonova, N",,,,"San Jose, Jose; Montes, Ruben; Grace, John; Nikonova, Nina",,,Land-use changes alter CO2 flux patterns of a tall-grass Andropogon field and a savanna-woodland continuum in the Orinoco lowlands,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Meeting on Tropical Savannas and Seasonally Dry Forests,"SEP 14-20, 2003","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND",,,carbon budget; eddy covariance; energy balance; land-use changes; soil CO2 efflux,CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST; WATER-VAPOR EXCHANGE; SOIL RESPIRATION; SEASONAL PATTERNS; TEMPERATE GRASSLAND; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; PRAIRIE ECOSYSTEM; TROPICAL SAVANNA,"Land use changes in the savannas of the Orinoco lowlands have resulted in a mosaic of vegetation. To elucidate how these changes have affected carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, we measured CO2 fluxes by eddy covariance and soil CO2 efflux systems along a disturbance gradient beginning with a cultivated tall-grass Andropogon field (S1) and extending over three savanna sites with increasing woody cover growing above native herbaceous vegetation. The savanna sites included a herbaceous savanna (S2), a tree savanna (S3) and a woodland savanna (S4). During the wet season, maximum diurnal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over the S1-S4 sites was 6.6-9.3, 6.6-7.9, 10.6-11.3 and 9.3-10.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The rate of CO2 uptake over S1 was lower than that for C-4 grasses elsewhere because of pasture degradation. Soil respiration and temperature were exponentially related when soil water content (theta) was above 0.083 m(3) m(-3); however, soil respiration declined markedly as theta decreased from 0.083-0.090 to 0.033-0.056 m(3) m(-3). There were bursts of CO2 emission when dry soils were rewetted by rainfall. During the wet season, all sites constituted carbon sinks with maximum net daily ecosystem production (NEP) of 2.1, 1.7, 2.1 and 2.1 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. During the dry season, the savanna sites (S2-S4) became carbon sources with maximum emission fluxes of -0.5, -1.4 and -1.6 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively, whereas the tall-grass field (S1) remained a carbon sink with a maximum NEP of 0.3 g C m(-2) day(-1) at the end of the season. For all measurement periods, annual NEP of sites S1-S4 was 366, 6, 116 and 139 g C m(-2), respectively. Comparisons of carbon source/sink dynamics across a wide range of savannas indicate that savanna carbon budgets can change in sign and magnitude. On an annual basis, gross primary production over the S1-S4 stands was 797, 803, 136 and 1230 g C m(-2), respectively. Net primary productivity (NPP) of the S1-S4 stands, calculated from eddy covariance measurements as the daily sum of NEE and day and night heterotrophic respiration was 498, 169, 181 and 402 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. These values were slightly higher than NPP based on harvest measurements (432, 162, 176 and 386 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively), presumably because fine roots were incompletely harvested. Soil water content limited carbon uptake at all sites, and water-use efficiency (WUE) was related to rainfall dynamics. During the dry season, all sites except the cultivated tall-grass Andropogon field (S1) had a negative WUE. Although our results are specific to the Orinoco vegetational mosaic, the effects of land-use practices on the controls and physiological functions of the studied ecosystems may be generalized to other savannas.","[San Jose, Jose; Nikonova, Nina] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Ecol, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela; [Montes, Ruben] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Estudios Ambientales, Caracas 1080A, Venezuela; [Grace, John] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","San Jose, J (reprint author), Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Ctr Ecol, Apartado 21827, Caracas 1020A, Venezuela.",jsanjose@ivic.ve,"Grace, John/N-9280-2013; de Sanjose, Jose Juan/Y-6264-2019",,,,,99,14,14,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2008,28,3,,,,,437,450,,10.1093/treephys/28.3.437,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,274ZF,WOS:000254040600013,18171667,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Glen, M; Bougher, NL; Colquhoun, IJ; Vlahos, S; Loneragan, WA; O'Brien, PA; Hardy, GESJ",,,,"Glen, M.; Bougher, N.

Such unidentified sequences belonging to the widely distributed ectomycorrhizal fungal genus Inocybe (Basidiomycota) were retrieved from GenBank and divided into species that were identified in a phylogenetic context using a reference dataset from an ongoing study of the genus. The sequence metadata of the unidentified Inocybe sequences stored in GenBank, as well as data from the corresponding original papers, were compiled and used to explore the ecology and distribution of the genus. In addition, the relative occurrence of Inocybe was contrasted to that of other mycorrhizal genera. Results: Most species of Inocybe were found to have less than 3% intraspecific variability in the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. This cut-off value was used jointly with phylogenetic analysis to delimit and identify unidentified Inocybe sequences to species level. A total of 177 unidentified Inocybe ITS sequences corresponding to 98 species were recovered, 32% of which were successfully identified to species level in this study. These sequences account for an unexpectedly large proportion of the publicly available unidentified fungal ITS sequences when compared with other mycorrhizal genera. Eight Inocybe species were reported from multiple hosts and some even from hosts forming arbutoid or orchid mycorrhizae. Furthermore, Inocybe sequences have been reported from four continents and in climate zones ranging from cold temperate to equatorial climate. Out of the 19 species found in more than one study, six were found in both Europe and North America and one was found in both Europe and Japan, indicating that at least many north temperate species have a wide distribution. Conclusion: Although DNA-based species identification and circumscription are associated with practical and conceptual difficulties, they also offer new possibilities and avenues for research. Metadata assembly holds great potential to synthesize valuable information from community studies for use in a species and taxonomy-oriented framework.","[Ryberg, Martin; Nilsson, R.

Measurements of the annual production of above- and below-ground live and dead mass, foliar herbivory, and soil respiration were used to develop biometric estimates of NEP (NEPB). Eddy-covariance measurements made above the canopy were used to construct meteorological estimates of NEP (NEPM). Over the 5-year study period, C stored annually in live mass (above- and below-ground wood) averaged 2.13 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), while annual detritus production (fine roots, leaf litter, woody debris) averaged 4.35 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Fine root inputs were the largest component (41%) of annual net primary production. The forest was a consistent C sink, with annual NEP ranging from 0.80 to 1.98 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), comparable in magnitude to other eastern North American forests. When annual NEPB and NEPm were compared in a given year, they differed from each other by 13-148%. However, when compared over 5 years, these independent estimates of C storage converged to within 1% of each other. Differences between same-year biometric and meteorological NEP estimates were explained in part by a lag between late-season net canopy photosynthesis and C allocated to tree growth the following spring. Weekly assessments of bole radial growth in 2001 and 2002 indicated that woody mass growth began prior to positive net canopy photosynthesis in the spring and that >25% of annual photosynthetic C assimilation occurred after growth had stopped in the autumn. Thus, while the temporal separation between photosynthesis and growth reduced agreement between annual NEPB and NEPM estimates, these metrics converged over several years. These results suggest that the allocation of recent photosynthate to storage carbohydrates, rather than to immediate growth, may obscure the relationship between shorter term, annual biometric and meteorological C storage estimates. Moreover, the 5-year convergence of biometric and meteorological NEP estimates serves as an important cross-validation, demonstrating that both approaches can yield accurate forest C storage assessments.

To test this hypothesis, we established a laboratory experiment investigating effects of shoot cutting of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) on soil microorganisms and juvenile endogeic earthworms of the species Octolasion tyrtaeum (Savigny), and Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny). Plants were grown in microcosms for 4 weeks, cut 5 cm above the soil surface and left to regrow until microcosms were destructively sampled after another 4 weeks. Defoliation decreased total shoot biomass of T. repens but had no significant effect on shoot biomass of L. perenne. Root biomass of L. perenne significantly exceeded that of T. repens, but defoliation reduced root biomass of L. perenne and T. repens by 48.6 and 67.3%, respectively. Microbial biomass per gram of soil in treatments with L. perenne exceeded that in treatments with T. repens, but when calculated per gram of roots, microbial biomass in treatments with T. repens exceeded that in treatments with L. perenne. Defoliation of both plant species significantly increased microbial biomass. Microbial activity differed between treatments and was higher in the grass than in the clover treatment in the beginning, but the reverse was the case later. The biomass of both earthworm species decreased and was only slightly affected by the treatments. In addition, neither earthworm species affected plant growth, microbial biomass or the production of CO2. Our results suggest that defoliation of perennial ryegrass and white clover increased the availability of carbon in the rhizosphere as indicated by the increase in microbial biomass, but that quality and quantity of rhizodeposits differed over time and between plant species. Furthermore, endogeic earthworms were unable to exploit the microbial biomass pool in soil, rather, rhizosphere microorganisms appeared to have effectively competed with endogeic earthworms and exploited root exudates.

O. Kuntze] growing under 'Cynatural' as well as 'Cycultivated' conditions in the Kumaun region of Uttaranchal Himalaya (India), during the periods of active growth and dormancy were investigated. Root and rhizosphere soil samples, collected from both the ecosites (natural and cultivated), were monitored for root colonization. While the percent root colonization was quite high (77.66 +/- 4.40 and 86.40 +/- 3.02%, in the natural and cultivated tea, respectively) during the period of active growth in both the ecosites, relatively higher colonization (97.33 +/- 0.78 and 98.13 +/- 0.80%, in the natural and cultivated tea, respectively) was recorded during the period of dormancy. The rhizosphere of cultivated tea bushes was found to be dominated by Glomus morhpotypes (88.89% of the total isolates) along with three morphotypes of Acaulospora; occurrence of 35 morphotypes belonging to four genera viz. Acaulospora (11.43%), Gigaspora (11.43%), Glomus (68.57%) and Scutellospora (8.57%) was recorded in the rhizosphere of tea plants from the natural ecosite. A total of 51 AMF morphotypes were detected. Shannon-Weaver index of diversity was higher (1.80 +/- 0.13 and 2.05 +/- 0.10 during periods of active growth and dormancy, respectively) at the species level for the natural ecosite over its counterparts from the cultivated ecosite. Values for the diversity indices of natural and cultivated ecosites did not show much variation in the period of dormancy. These data suggest that collectively, various cultural practices negatively affect AMF diversity at the genus level in tea plantations of the colder regions.","[Singh, Shipra; Pandey, Anita; Chaurasia, Bhaskar; Palni, Lok Man S.] GB Pant Inst Himalaya Environm & Dev, Almora 263643, Uttaranchal, India","Pandey, A (reprint author), GB Pant Inst Himalaya Environm & Dev, Almora 263643, Uttaranchal, India.",anita@gbpihed.nic.in,,,,,,44,25,32,2,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

By counting annuli in the cementum of incisor root tips from 51 known-age moose (Alces alces) between 1 and 12 years old, we examined the variation in accuracy and repeatability of age estimates provided by three research technicians with different experiences of aging moose. The most experienced technician estimated the moose age correctly in up to 90% of the cases, while the technician with no prior experience estimated age correctly in up to 73% of the cases. The medium-experienced technician achieved a lower accuracy (up to 53%), indicating that experience alone is not sufficient if the basic training or lack of routine checks against other colleagues or a known-age material are not undertaken. The percentage moose aged within +/- 1 year from correct age was significantly higher in all technicians (94-98%). After the generally high accuracy, we also found high repeatability (0.980-0.994) within technicians. We conclude that this method of age-determination provides reliable estimates that can be used by management and research to gain information about age-specific patterns in moose populations. However, to obtain estimates of high accuracy the technicians should be well trained, have gained the necessary experience, and most preferably, have access to a sample of teeth from known-age moose.","[Rolandsen, Christer M.; Solberg, Erling J.; Heim, Morten; Holmstrom, Frode; Solem, May I.; Saether, Bernt-Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Saether, Bernt-Erik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Rolandsen, CM (reprint author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Tungasletta 2, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",christer.rolandsen@nina.no,,,,,,39,25,25,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

The objective was to test the hypothesis that N addition would reduce soil respiration in N saturated tropical forests. Static chamber and gas chromatography techniques were used to quantify the soil respiration, following four-levels of N treatments (Control, no N addition; Low-N, 5gN m(-2) yr(-1); Medium-N, 10gN m(-2) yr(-1); and High-N, 15 g N m(-2) yr(-1) experimental inputs), which had been applied for 26 months before and continued throughout the respiration measurement period. Results showed that soil respiration exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with the highest rates found in the warm and wet growing season (April-September) and the lowest rates in the dry dormant season (December-February). Soil respiration rates showed a significant positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, whereas soil moisture only affect soil respiration at dry conditions in the dormant season. Annual accumulative soil respiration was 601 +/- 30 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Controls. Annual mean soil respiration rate in the Control, Low-N and Medium-N treatments (69 +/- 3, 72 +/- 3 and 63 +/- 1 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), respectively) did not differ significantly, whereas it was 14% lower in the High-N treatment (58 +/- 3 Mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1)) compared with the Control treatment, also the temperature sensitivity of respiration, Q(10) was reduced from 2.6 in the Control with 2.2 in the High-N treatment. The decrease in soil respiration occurred in the warm and wet growing season and were correlated with a decrease in soil microbial activities and in fine root biomass in the N-treated plots. Our results suggest that response of soil respiration to atmospheric N deposition in tropical forests is a decline, but it may vary depending on the rate of N deposition.","[Mo, Jiangming; Zhang, Wei; Fang, Yunting; Li, Dejun; Wang, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 526070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Weixing] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Gundersen, Per] Univ Copenhagen, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","Mo, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 526070, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mojm@scib.ac.cn,"Mo, Jiangming/M-2104-2014; Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012; Gundersen, Per/B-2192-2008","Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X; Gundersen, Per/0000-0002-9199-4033",,,,54,227,328,25,263,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Do pine seedlings in estuarine environments display discrete or continuous ranges of physiological tolerance to flooding and salinity? 2. What is the tolerance of Pinus taeda and P. serotina to low salinity and varying hydrologic conditions? 3. Are the assumptions for ecological equilibrium met for modeling plant community migration in response to sea-level rise? Location: Albemarle Peninsula, North Carolina, USA. Methods: In situ observations were made to quantify natural pine regeneration and grass cover along a salinity stress gradient ( from marsh, dying or dead forest, to healthy forest). A full-factorial greenhouse experiment was set up to investigate mortality and carbon allocation of Pinus taeda and P. serotina to low-salinity conditions and two hydrology treatments over 6 months. Treatments consisted of freshwater and two salinity levels ( 4 ppt and 8 ppt) under either permanently flooded or periodically flushed hydrologic conditions. Results: Natural pine regeneration was common (5-12 seedlings per m(2)) in moderate to well-drained soils where salinity concentrations were below ca. 3.5 ppt. Pine regeneration was generally absent in flooded soils, and cumulative mortality was 100% for 4 and 8 ppt salinity levels under flooded conditions in the greenhouse study. Under weekly flushing conditions, mortality was not significantly different between 0 and 4 ppt, confirming field observations. Biomass accumulation was higher for P. taeda, but for both pine species, the root to shoot ratio was suppressed under the 8 ppt drained treatment, reflecting increased below-ground stress. Conclusions: While Pinus taeda and P. serotina are commonly found in estuarine ecosystems, these species display a range of physiological tolerance to low-salinity conditions. Our results suggest that the rate of forest migration may lag relative to gradual sea-level rise and concomitant alterations in hydrology and salinity. Current bioclimate or landscape simulation models assume discrete thresholds in the range of plant tolerance to stress, especially in coastal environments, and consequently, they may overestimate the rate, extent, and timing of plant community response to sea-level rise.","[Poulter, Benjamin; Christensen, Norman L.; Qian, Song S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Poulter, Benjamin] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Dept Global Change & Nat Syst, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany","Poulter, B (reprint author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, POB 90238, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ben.poulter@pik-potsdam.de,,"Poulter, Benjamin/0000-0002-9493-8600; Qian, Song/0000-0002-2346-4903",,,,52,6,6,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Can functional traits measured on pot grown plants be reliably applied to natural communities? Alternatively, can below-ground plant traits be predicted from above-ground traits? Location: Southeastern Australia. Methods: We compared 17 shoot, root and whole-plant morphological traits measured on 14 plant species in a native grassland community to those measured under two different pot conditions: unfertilised and fertilised. Results: The majority of trait values for pot grown plants differed to plants in the field, however, species ranking remained consistent for most leaf traits between the field and the two pot growing conditions. In contrast, species ranking was not consistent for most whole plant traits when comparing field plants to fertilised pot grown plants, providing a caution against the tendency to grow plants in controlled conditions at 'optimal' ( high) resource levels. Moderate to strong correlations were found between below-ground and above-ground plant traits, including between root dry matter content and leaf dry matter content, and between specific root area and specific leaf area. Conclusions: The utility of pot grown plants to quantify traits for field plants is highly dependent on the selection of the growing conditions in the controlled environment. The consistency we observed between above-ground and below-ground trait strategies suggests that below-ground traits may be predictable based on above-ground traits, reducing the need to quantify root traits on cultured plants.","[Mokany, Karel; Ash, Julian] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Mokany, K (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",karel.mokany@anu.edu.au; julian.ash@anu.edu.au,"Johnstone, Audra/C-8158-2009; Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009",,,,,34,42,44,0,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

This greenhouse experiment tested whether soil microbial communities specific to the rhizospheres of an invasive grass (Aegilops triuncialis) and two native plants (Lasthenia californica and Plantago erecta) affected invasive and/or native plant performance. Each of these species were grown in separate pots for 2 months to prime the soils with plant-specific rhizosphere microbial communities. Each plant species was then planted in native- and invasive-primed soil, and effects on plant performance were monitored. At 5 months, differences in microbial biomarker fatty acids between invaded and native soils mirrored previous differences found in field-collected soil. L. californica performance was significantly reduced when grown in invaded soil compared to native soil (flowering date was delayed, aboveground biomass decreased, specific root length increased, and root mass ratio increased). In contrast, P. erecta and A. triuncialis performance were unaffected when grown in invaded vs native soil. These results suggest that in some cases, invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community may contribute to a positive feedback loop, leading to the increased dominance of invasive species in an ecosystem.","[Batten, Katharine M.] Ctr Amer Progress, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Scow, Kate M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Espeland, Erin K.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Ecol Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Batten, KM (reprint author), Ctr Amer Progress, 1333 H St NW,10th Floor, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",kbatten@americanprogress.org,,"Espeland, Erin/0000-0001-8541-3610",,,,39,56,64,1,79,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

During the twentieth century, several manual measurement methods were used, depending on the objectives of study. Due to the difficulties in accessing the roots and the duration of measurements, the studies generally involved a low number of root systems, were often qualitative and focused only on one specific application. Quantitative methods in plant architecture were largely developed in the last 40 years for aerial architecture. However, root systems have particular features and often need specific procedures. Since the end of the 1990s, new devices and techniques have been available for coarse root architecture measurements including volume location techniques (non-invasive or destructive) and manual or semi-automatic 3D digitising. Full 3D root system architecture dynamics was also reconstructed from partial measurements using modelling procedures. On the one hand, non-invasive and automatic techniques need more development to obtain full 3D architecture, i.e. geometry and topology. On the other hand, both one inexpensive manual and one semi-automatic digitizing procedure are now available to measure precisely and rapidly the full 3D architecture of uprooted and excavated coarse root systems. Specific software and a large number of functions are also available for an in-depth analysis of root architecture and have already been used in a dozen of research papers including a fairly large sample of mature trees. A comprehensive analysis of root architecture can be achieved by classifying individual roots in several root types through architectural analysis. The objective of this paper is both to give a detailed overview of the state of the art techniques for 3D root system architecture measurement and analysis and to give examples of applications in this field. Practical details are also given so that this paper can be used as a sort of manual for people who want to improve their practice or to enter this quite new research field.","[Danjon, Frederic] INRA, UMR 1202 BioGeCo, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Reubens, Bert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium","Danjon, F (reprint author), INRA, UMR 1202 BioGeCo, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33612 Cestas, France.",fred@pierroton.inra.fr,"Danjon, Frederic/F-1557-2011; Reubens, Bert/A-6481-2009","Danjon, Frederic/0000-0002-9104-9808; Reubens, Bert/0000-0003-0951-5206",,,,198,99,107,2,80,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2008,303,2-Jan,,,,,1,34,,10.1007/s11104-007-9470-7,,,34,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,257LG,WOS:000252800000001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Schindlbacher, A; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, S; Kitzler, B; Jandl, R",,,,"Schindlbacher, Andreas; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie; Kitzler, Barbara; Jandl, Robert",,,Experimental forest soil warming: response of autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration to a short-term 10 degrees C temperature rise,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,autotrophic respiration; heterotrophic respiration; Q(10); soil respiration; soil warming,ORGANIC-MATTER POOLS; ROOT RESPIRATION; RHIZOSPHERE RESPIRATION; WATER-CONTENT; BEECH FOREST; CARBON; SENSITIVITY; Q(10); DEPENDENCE; DECOMPOSITION,"We warmed the top soil of a mature coniferous forest stand by means of heating cables on control and trenched plots within 24 h by 10 degrees C at 1 cm soil depth (9 degrees C at 5 cm depth) and measured the effect on the autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) component of total soil CO2 efflux (R-S). The short time frame of warming enabled us to exclude confounding fluctuations in soil moisture and carbon (C) flow from the canopy. The results of the field study were backed up by a lab soil incubation experiment. During the first 12 h of warming, R-A strongly responded to soil warming; The Q(10) values were 5.61 and 6.29 for 1 and 5 cm soil depth temperature. The Q(10) values for R-A were almost twice as high as the Q(10) values of R-H (3.04 and 3.53). Q(10) values above 5 are above reasonable plant physiological values for root respiration. We see interactions of roots, mycorrhizae and heterotrophic microbes, combined with fast substrate supply to the rhizosphere as an explanation for the high short-term temperature response of R-A. When calculated over the whole duration (24 h) of the field soil-warming experiment, temperature sensitivities of R-A and R-H were similar (no significant difference at P < 0.05); Q(10) values were 3.16 and 3.96 for R-A and 2.94 and 3.35 for R-H calculated with soil temperatures at 1 and 5 cm soil depth, respectively. Laboratory incubation showed that different soil moisture contents of trenched and control plots affected rates of R-H, but did not affect the temperature sensitivity of R-H. We conclude that a single parameter is sufficient to describe the temperature sensitivity of R-S in soil C models which operate on larger temporal and spatial scales. The strong short-term response of R-A may be of relevance in soils suspected to experience increasingly strong diurnal temperature variations.","[Schindlbacher, Andreas] Univ Natl Resources & Appl Life Sci, BOKU, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Schindlbacher, Andreas; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie; Kitzler, Barbara; Jandl, Robert] Fed Off & Res Ctr Forests BFW, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1131 Vienna, Austria","Schindlbacher, A (reprint author), Univ Natl Resources & Appl Life Sci, BOKU, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.schindlbacher@bfw.gv.at,,,,,,46,32,41,2,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2008,303,2-Jan,,,,,323,330,,10.1007/s11104-007-9511-2,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,257LG,WOS:000252800000026,,,,,10/31/19J,"Larsen, J; Johansen, A; Larsen, SE; Heckmann, LH; Jakobsen, I; Krogh, PH",,,,"Larsen, John; Johansen, Anders; Larsen, Soren Erik; Heckmann, Lars Henrik; Jakobsen, Iver; Krogh, Paul Henning",,,Population performance of collembolans feeding on soil fungi from different ecological niches,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,mycorrhizal fungi; root pathogens; biocontrol; collembola; food quality,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS; SPRINGTAIL FOLSOMIA-FIMETARIA; NEMATODE APHELENCHUS-AVENAE; PLANT-PATHOGENIC FUNGI; MYCOPHAGOUS COLLEMBOLA; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; ONYCHIURUS-ARMATUS; FOOD PREFERENCE; LIFE-HISTORY,"The potential reproductive value of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Gloinus intraradices and Glomus invermaium), root pathogenic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium culmorum) and saprotrophic fungi (Penicillium hordei and Trichoderma harzianum) were examined for the collembolans Folsomia candida Willem and Folsomia fimetaria L. Dried baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was used as a reference standard food in laboratory cultures. Collembolan performance was determined as final size, fecundity and population growth rate after when fed the fungal food sources for 31 days. The mycorrhizal fungi gave the least growth and fecundity compared with the other fungi, but G. intraradices gave good fecundity for F. candida. In terms of growth, Baker's yeast was a high-quality food for both adults and juveniles of both species, but it was a poorer food in terms of fecundity of F. candida. Preference of the fungi in all possible pairwise combinations showed that although F. fimetaria did not perform well on Glomus spp. and F. candida did not grow well on Glomus spp. their preference for these fungi did not reflect this. The highest fecundity was seen with the root pathogen F. culmorum.

Two abundant late-successional species typically co-occurring in rainforests in French Guiana, namely Eperua falcata and Dicorynia guianensis, were chosen as representative of each group. Stable isotope techniques and measurements of potentials of microbial N transformation were performed to assess to what extent leaf N-15 natural abundance of these species could be related to (i) delta N-15 signatures of soil mineral N sources and (ii) the capacity of soil to express nitrification and denitrification (both processes being directly involved in the balance between NH4+ and NO3-). Soil delta N-15-NH4+ was roughly similar to leaf delta N-15 of D. guianensis (around 3.5 parts per thousand), suggesting a preferential use of NH4+, whereas in E. falcata, leaf delta N-15 values were closer to root delta N-15-NO3- values (0.2 and -2.0 parts per thousand, respectively), suggesting a preferential use of NO3-. These differences in N source utilization were not accompanied by differences in availability in soil NO3- or in intensity of microbial functions responsible for soil N mineral evolution. However, (i) under both tree species, these functions showed clear spatial partitioning, with denitrification occurring potentially in soil and nitrification in the litter layer, and (ii) E falcata fine roots colonized the litter layer much more strongly than D. guianensis fine roots. This strongly suggests that (i) the contrasted leaf delta N-15 values found in the two late-successional species reveal distinct N acquisition strategies and (ii) the ability of roots to predominantly exploit the litter layer (E falcata) or the soil (D. guianensis) may constitute an important explanation of the observed differences. A complementarity between tree species, based on mineral N resource partitioning (itself resulting from a spatially structured location of the microbial functions responsible for the balance between NH4+ and NO3-), n thus be supposed.

Flavonoids enter rhizosphere soil as a result of root exudation and senescence but little is known about their subsequent fate or impacts on microbial activity. Therefore, the present study examined the sorptive behaviour, biodegradation and impact on dehydrogenase activity (as determined by iodonitrotetrazolium chloride reduction) of the flavonoids naringenin and formononetin in soil. Organic carbon normalised partition coefficients, log K-oc, of 3.12 (formononetin) and 3.19 (naringenin) were estimated from sorption isotherms and, after comparison with literature log K-oc values for compounds whose soil behaviour is better characterised, the test flavonoids were deemed to be moderately sorbed. Naringenin (spiked at 50 mu g g(-1)) was biodegraded without a detectable lag phase with concentrations reduced to 0.13 +/- 0.01 mu g g(-1) at the end of the 96 h time course. Biodegradation of formononetin proceeded after a lag phase of similar to 24 with concentrations reduced to 4.5 +/- 1% of the sterile control after 72 h. Most probable number (MPN) analysis revealed that prior to the addition of flavonoids, the soil contained 5.4 x 10(6) MPNg(-1) (naringenin) and 7.9 x 10(5) MPNg(-1) (formononetin) catabolic microbes. Formononetin concentration had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on soil dehydrogenase activity, whereas naringenin concentration had an overall but non-systematic impact (p = 0.045). These results are discussed with reference to likely total and bioavailable concentrations of flavonoids experienced by microbes in the rhizosphere. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the characters of the new species are shared by P. chiangmaiensis, some others shared by Cladopus, and the remaining differ from those of the two. The ensiform leaf may be plesiomorphic in the subfamily Podostemoideae. The leaves are borne both at the sinuses of root branching and between successive branches, possibly due to leaf development within and proximal to the root meristem.

We investigated the importance of the genetic constitution for the belowground drought response of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), in four populations from regions differing in precipitation (520-970 mm year(-1)). Saplings were grown at ample (10 vol.%; well-watered) or reduced (5 vol.%; drought treatment) soil water content in the Gottingen Rhizolab Facility for two consecutive summers, and the responses of fine root biomass, root morphology, root depth distribution, and fine root production and turnover were investigated by a combined mini-rhizotron and harvest technique approach. In the drought treatment, total root mass per plant was reduced by 30-40% as a result of: (1) a reduction in median fine root lifespan by roughly 50% and hence an increase in fine root turnover; and (2) a 10-fold reduction in relative fine root growth rate (productivity per standing root biomass). The root: shoot ratio did not increase with drought. Although beech plants originating from drier climates tended to reduce their root biomass in response to drought less than those from wetter climates, analyses of variance revealed no significant influence of genotype on root mass, morphology, growth rate or turnover. However, most fine root traits showed marked differences between the well-watered and drought treatments. We conclude that beech saplings respond to summer drought primarily by shortening root lifespan, whereas root system structure and root: shoot carbon partitioning pattern are unaltered. Beech fine root growth and turnover exhibited high phenotypic plasticity, but genotypic variation was of minor importance. In contrast, genotype had a strong influence on leaf and shoot morphogenesis and growth.","[Meier, Ina C.; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Meier, IC (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",imeier1@uni-goettingen.de,,"Meier, Ina Christin/0000-0001-6500-7519",,,,98,86,91,3,81,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2008,28,2,,,,,297,309,,10.1093/treephys/28.2.297,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,261CH,WOS:000253056200014,18055440,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Scattolin, L; Montecchio, L; Agerer, R",,,,"Scattolin, Linda; Montecchio, Lucio; Agerer, Reinhard",,,The ectomycorrhizal community structure in high mountain Norway spruce stands,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhizal community; soil; bedrock; exposure; Norway spruce,CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; OLD-GROWTH; FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; FOREST; GRADIENT; SOIL; MYCORRHIZAS; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION,"The species composition of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities can be strongly influenced by abiotic and biotic factors, which determine interactions among the species such as resource partitioning, disturbance, competition, or relationships with other organisms. To verify whether ectomycorrhization of the root tips and composition of the ECM community in Norway spruce vary according to site features and if ECM species peculiar to these environmental variables can be detected, ten comparable stands differing in bedrock pH and exposure were selected and studied. The results demonstrated that tips vitality and ectomycorrhization degree do not change significantly either on the same tree, or among trees growing in the same stand, whereas they differ greatly with bedrock pH and exposure, even if no spatial or temporal trend were found.

Seedlings grown for 3 weeks were treated at five burial depths for three burial times in pot experiments. Species from the habitats with little burial had smaller survival rate, dry weight and stem elongation speed than those from the habitats with intensive burial when buried. Furthermore, when buried, the former tended to adjust biomass allocation between shoot and root and produce adventitious buds, while the latter tended to maintain a constant root:shoot ratio and produce adventitious roots. We conclude that (1) seedlings of species with a long evolutionary history of exposure to sand burial (from the active sand dune), show quicker stem growth when buried than do seedlings of species from the habitats with little or no sand burial; (2) seedlings of species which do not change root:shoot ratio might be more tolerant of sand burial than those do; (3) seedlings of species from the habitats with intensive sand burial is prone to produce adventitious roots and seedlings of species from the habitats with little or no sand burial tend to produce adventitious buds when buried.","[Liu, Zhimin; Guan, Dexin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Liu, ZM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",liuzhimin6555@yahoo.com.cn,,,,,,27,23,32,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to estimate the effective soil water retention theta(h) and hydraulic conductivity K( h) functions of an effective modeling domain by minimizing errors between observed near-surface soil moisture and values simulated with the Richards-based Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant ( SWAP) model. The parameter estimation approach considered uncertainties in the initial and bottom boundary conditions, rooting depth, and root density by creating simulation ensembles based on combinations of several modeling conditions and a multipopulation approach in the GA to estimate uncertainties in the derived soil hydraulic properties. The results showed that theta(h) is not very sensitive to variations in the initial and boundary conditions, rooting depth, and root density applied on the modeling domain. The value of K( h) was found to be more sensitive to variations in rooting depth and root density than to variations in the initial and boundary conditions. With the modeling domain better represented, the estimated theta( h) and K( h) functions were found to be satisfactory in most of the locations studied. They were validated using laboratory-measured theta(h) and K-sat, observed soil moisture in the field, and soil hydraulic properties from the UNSODA database. Our study indicates, however, that the homogeneous-medium assumption commonly used to effectively describe a heterogeneous system may fail to closely represent a highly heterogeneous ( layered) soil pro. le if only the near-surface soil moisture data are used to de. ne the subsurface soil hydraulic properties. Additional soil moisture data from deeper depths may be needed to better estimate the effective soil hydraulic properties of highly heterogeneous systems.","[Ines, Amor V.

The AMF community functions to both improve plant growth and soil conditions and is thus an important component to the restoration of this forest type to disturbed areas. The study areas included mature rainforests that were converted to pine forests, milpas, pastures and shrub/herbaceous plant communities via burning and logging. Seasonal patterns in AMF spore species richness and sporulation significantly differed across disturbance types at two of the three sites surveyed. Contrasting patterns of sporulation among AMF families across different disturbance types helped to explain how species richness and composition were maintained despite dramatic changes to the host plant community. Meaning, in most cases, disturbance induced changes in when different AMF taxa sporulated but not what taxa sporulated. Only conversion from mature pine-oak-Liquidambar-Persea forests to pine-dominated stands severely reduced AMF spore richness and total sporulation. Surprisingly, in pine-dominant stands no concomitant negative impacts on soil glomalin (MAb32B11 immunoreactive soil protein) concentrations were detected. However, soils of mature forests containing no pines had the highest concentration of glomalin. Conversion to pasture and milpa (diverse cornfield) had a strong negative impact on the concentration of soil glomalin concentrations. In sharp contrast, the same disturbance types improved AMF sporulation and AMF spore richness. It appears that disturbance type, and not AMF community measures used herein, best predicts changes in soil glomalin concentration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The signal intensity of the O-alkyl region, primarily representing carbohydrates, decreased, and alkyl C, attributed to recalcitrant waxy compounds and microbially resynthesized lipids, increased from plant litter to soil organic matter and with incorporation into soil aggregates. The alkyl/O-alkyl ratio, a common index of humification, was higher in the occluded than in the free light fraction. Greater variability in the chemical makeup of the occluded light fraction suggests that it represents material in varied stages of decomposition. Mean residence times (14 C-based) of the free light fraction were significantly shorter (4 I years) than for the heavy fraction. We report two scenarios for the occluded light fraction, one fast-cycling in which the occluded and free light fractions have similar turnover rates, and one slow-cycling, in which the occluded light fraction resembles the heavy fraction. Mean residence times of the occluded light fraction and heavy fraction in active pastures and 10-year old secondary forests in the earliest stage of succession were longer than in older secondary forests and primary forests. This is likely due to a preferential loss of physically unprotected C of more labile composition in the pastures and in the youngest successional forests, resulting in an increase in the dominance of slow-cycling C pools. Soil carbon turnover rates of the mineral-associated C in secondary forests recovering from abandoned pasture resembled those of primary forests in as little as 20 years of succession.

Mechanical reinforcement by poplar root systems aids slope stabilisation. Root mass and distribution were determined for three Populus deltoides x nigra 'Veronese' trees aged 5, 7 and 9.5 year planted as 3 m poles at 8 m x 8 m spacing on a hillslope near Palmerston North in the southern North Island. Most of the structural roots (>= 2 mm diameter) were distributed in the top 40 cm of soil. Vertical roots penetrated to about 1.0 m, being the depth of the soil above a fragipan. Total structural root dry masses (excluding root crown) were 0.57, 7.8 and 17.90 kg for the trees aged 5, 7 and 9.5 year, respectively. Total structural root length was 79.4 m for the 5 year tree and 663.5 m for the 9.5 year tree. Surrounding trees were estimated to increase root mass density to 3 times and root length density to 4-5 times the contribution of the single tree at 9.5 year. The study indicated that root development of wide-spaced poplar trees on hillslopes was minimal in the first 5 years but then increased rapidly. These results suggest that poplar trees established from poles may take at least 5 years to develop a structural root network that will effectively bind soil.","HortRes, Palmerston North, New Zealand; AgRes, Palmerston North, New Zealand; Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand","McIvor, IR (reprint author), HortRes, Private Bag 11030, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",imcivor@hortresearch.co.nz,,,,,,26,16,19,4,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Plant populations in tallgrass prairie likely experience, or historically experienced, high risks of damage and therefore might be expected to have evolved significant compensation ability. We investigated shoot damage and subsequent growth compensation in Iowa populations of the annuals Linum rigidum and L. sulcatum. To estimate damage rate and responses to damage under natural conditions, we collected two data sets. The first consisted of over 200 herbarium specimens collected over a 113-y period and the second consisted of field data for four populations in the same growing season. A companion experiment investigated damage responses under controlled greenhouse conditions and identified possible mechanisms of compensation. The study species frequently experience apical meristem removal in nature, Per-individual damage-rate estimates ranged from 33-54% in L. rigidum and from 12-24% in L. sulcatum. Both species compensate substantially in mature height, branch number and biomass under field conditions. Compensation in the greenhouse tended to be incomplete, perhaps because the greenhouse experiment may have failed to simulate natural conditions and ended before maximum sizes had been reached. The major mechanism of compensation appears to be rapid activation of axillary meristems, without contributions from altered root-shoot partitioning. Shoot damage and subsequent growth compensation appear to be significant features of individual and population biology in these annual forbs.","[King, Elizabeth G.; Eckhart, Vincent M.; Mohl, Emily C.] Grinnell Coll, Dept Biol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA","King, EG (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",eking001@student.ucr.edu,,"King, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9393-4720",,,,56,2,2,0,19,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Typically, all individual plant associates with multiple microbial genotypes varying in mutualistic benefit. This creates a potential tragedy of the commons where less-mutualistic strains potentially share in the collective benefits, while paying less of the costs. Therefore, maintaining cooperation over the course of evolution requires specific mechanisms that reduce the fitness benefits from ""cheating."" Sanctions that discriminate among partners based on actual symbiotic performance are a key mechanism in rhizobia and may exist in many rhizosphere mutualisms, including rhizobia, mycorrhizal fungi, root endophytes, and perhaps free-living rhizosphere microbes. Where they exist, sanctions May take different forms depending on the system. Despite sanctions, less-effective symbionts still persist. We suggest this is because of mixed infection at spatial scales that limit the effects of sanctions, variation among plants in the strength of sanctions, and conflicting selection regimes.","[Kiers, E.

Forty-one soil samples (0.5kg each) were collected at 10-15cm depth in the rhizosphere of Acacia in the two protected forests of Diarra and Lam Nadie (26 and 15 samples, respectively). Soil extracts were used to test rhizobial nodulation of in-vitro growing seedlings of two varieties of A. nilotica, var. tomentosa and var. adansonii. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi soil infectivity was estimated by the most probable number (MPN) method using Acacia nilotica var. tomentosa as test plant. In the Diarra forest, eight soil samples of the 26 tested contained indigenous rhizobial strains nodulating both A. nilotica var. adansonii and A. nilotica var. tomentosa, whereas only one from Lam Nadie contained rhizobial strains. Fifty-six strains were isolated, purified, and their infectivity and efficiency tested on Acacia nilotica var. tomentosa after 60 days of culture under controlled conditions. Strains ND37 from Diarra and NL2 from Lam Nadie are the more effective in terms of shoot and root dry weight. The estimation of the number of viable propagules using the MPN method showed some significant differences between the populations of AMF of Diarra, which was high, and that of Lam Nadie, which was very low. The percentage of colonization of Acacia nilotica var. tomentosa was correlated with the MPN values.

The tropical mountain rain forest area of the Reserva Biologica San Francisco in South Ecuador situated on the eastern slope of the Cordillera El Consuelo is exceptionally rich in tree species, ericads and orchids, but also in liverworts. Previous light and electron microscopical studies revealed that tree roots are well colonized by structurally diverse Glomeromycota, and that epiphytic, pleurothallid orchids form mycorrhizas with members of the Tulasnellales and the Sebacinales (Basidiomycota). Sebacinales also occurred in mycorrhizas of hemiepiphytic ericads and Tulasnellales were found in liverworts belonging to the Aneuraceae. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that symbiotic fungi with a broad host range created shared guilds or even fungal networks between different plant species and plant families. To test this hypothesis, molecular phylogenetic studies of the fungi associated with roots and thalli were carried out using sequences of the nuclear rDNA coding for the small subunit rRNA (nucSSU) of Glomeromycota and the large subunit rRNA (nucLSU) of Basidiomycota. Sequence analyses showed that Sebacinales and Tulasnellales were only shared within but not between ericads and orchids or between liverworts and orchids, respectively. Regarding arbuscular-mycorrhiza-forming trees, however, 18 out of 33 Glomus sequence types were shared by two to four tree species belonging to distinct families. Nearly all investigated trees shared one sequence type with another tree individual. Host range and potential shared guilds appeared to be restricted to the plant family level for Basidiomycota, but were covering diverse plant families in case of Glomeromycota. Given that the sequence types as defined here correspond to fungal species, our findings indicate potential fungal networks between trees. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

These below-ground living herbivores may orient to the source of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), an ubiquitous volatile released by respiring plant roots. Here, we studied the interaction of CO(2) and other plant root-derived chemical stimuli with regard to the chemical orientation of the polyphagous larvae of Melolontha melolontha L. (Scarabaeidae). A soil arena was developed that enabled both determination of the actual soil CO(2) concentration and the behavioural response of an insect to (a) CO(2) gradients per se, (b) chemical stimuli released from respiring, Undamaged roots of plants potted into vermiculite in this arena and (c) combinations of CO(2) gradients and root-derived stimuli. In a root-free arena. larvae of M. melolontha oriented to the source of synthetic CO(2). However, similar CO(2) gradients generated by host plant roots did not attract the larvae. Neither did a synthetic CO(2), gradient combined with aqueous extracts from rhizospheres With Undamaged plant roots elicit an attractive effect. Our data suggest that orientation of cockchafer larvae within CO(2) gradients generated by respiring roots is 'masked' by all aqueous extract from a rhizosphere with undamaged roots. The results emphasise that effects of behaviour modifying plant-derived compounds need to be investigated against the background of naturally co-occurring chemicals. The significance of our results for Orientation of soil living insects is discussed with respect to abiotic conditions in natural soil and the role of soil microorganisms for the attractiveness of plant roots.

Three lines of evidence suggested that direct cellular damage, rather than physical damage associated with frost heaving, was the principal mechanism of root injury: (i) decreases in root vitality were not greater on sites with more frost heaving, (ii) in situ freezing damage was confined to first- and second-order roots in the organic horizons rather than entire root systems, and (iii) tensile strength of fine roots was not significantly compromised by experimental stretching to simulate ice lens formation. Although significant differences in the intensity of soil freezing (depth, rate, and minimum temperature) were observed across the plots, no clear effects of soil freezing intensity on root injury were observed. Snow manipulation had no effect on mycorrhizal colonization of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) roots. A significant increase in root growth was observed in the second summer after treatments, coincident with a significant pulse of soil nitrate leaching. Through their effects on fine roots, soil freezing events could play an important role in forest ecosystem dynamics in a changing climate.","[Cleavitt, Natalie L.; Fahey, Timothy J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Groffman, Peter M.] Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Hardy, Janet P.; Henry, Karen S.] USA, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Driscoll, Charles T.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Fahey, TJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjf5@cornell.edu,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255",,,,37,72,78,0,45,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Litter quality, fine root turnover, microbial biomass, root growth, and root biomass were not significantly affected by elevated CO2, except during some periods.

Nevertheless, despite their importance in maintaining plant population viability, woody plants in suppressed growth forms have received little attention in ecological studies. We measured a set of morpho-functional traits and investigated plant density variation in suppressed growth forms (hereafter we refer to them as saplings) of two common species, Acacia nigrescens and Acacia tortilis, across sites that had undergone very different histories of attack from large herbivores while fire had been absent for at least 13 y. We show that heavily browsed saplings have higher regrowth abilities, twice the number of stems produced by the main root crown and twice the root diameter at 5 cm soil depth, than lightly browsed saplings. This suggests that Acacia saplings are resilient to chronic herbivory and show high morphological plasticity. However, we show that mammalian herbivores can strongly limit sapling recruitment to mature size classes and possibly affect variation in sapling density between heavily and lightly browsed sites. Further studies should investigate whether the persistence of the sapling bank can be ascribed to the ""storage effect"" by which a plant's reproductive potential is ""stored"" in a suppressed growth form until a window of opportunity allows rapid maturity.","[Fornara, Dario.

Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are known to contribute essentially to the tolerance of plants against abiotic stress. We investigated the EM associations of S. caprea at three former silver-mining sites around Freiberg (Saxonia, Germany) after 33 years of revegetation. The EM colonisation ranged from 3 to 36% of the fine root tips. We found 14 different EM types and characterised them morphologically as well as anatomically. The fungal partners were identified using LSU and ITS sequences. They belonged to four families: Thelephoraceae, Cortinariaceae, Tricholomataceae and Tuberaceae. Thelephoraceae, with 53-91%, comprised the largest portion of the total EM colonisation at all test sites and sampling dates. Thelephoraceae produced mainly contact exploration types of ectomycorrhiza. Tricholoma cingulatum was the only EM fungus which was found as ectomycorrhiza and sporocarp. We suppose that the low exploration of the majority of EM associations of S. caprea, in combination with high portions of metal-chelating organic acids containing fungal partners, contributes essentially to the high tolerance of this tree species against high metal concentrations in the soil.

Plants can have beneficial effects on the biological activity of soils mainly through their root exudates. in this study we investigated the impact of various plant species with different Cu tolerance levels on the microbial activity in two soils with low (10 mg/kg) and high (180 mg/kg) copper concentrations. The soil was a Kahangi Sandy Loam. Three different plants, Agrostis capillaris 'Parys' tolerant for Cu, Agrostis capillaris 'Highland' non-tolerant and Helianthus annuus tolerant and a hyper-accumulator for Cu were used. To increase the Cu availability to plants, EDTA was added to some of the pots 20 days after sowing. The effect of Cu contamination on the biological activity of soil in the presence and absence of plant growth was evaluated by measuring the dehydrogenase activity, the microbial biomass, the basal respiration, and the potential nitrification. Results show that plants increased the microbial activity in the low Cu soil. In the high Cu soil the microbial activity seemed to be related to the plant health. With the Cu-tolerant Agrostis capillaris 'Parys', the microbial activity increased faster than with the other plant species. Up to 50 days after sowing, the tolerant grass Agrostis capillaris 'Parys' had a higher plant biomass and was much healthier than the non-tolerant grass. Later on the growth of the non-tolerant Agrostis capillaris 'Highland' recovered, and the microbial activity of the soil reached close to those recorded for the soil treatments with the Cu-tolerant plant species. The addition of EDTA delayed the increase in microbial activity even further. The proportion of microbial biomass carbon in the organic fraction was higher in the low Cu soil than in the high Cu soil, with ratios ranging from 1.3 to 3.3 and from 0.5 to 1.7 respectively. The basal respiration rate in the original soil was significantly lower in the high Cu soil than in the low Cu soil, and was generally increased by the presence of plants.

Studies from the temperate zone have demonstrated greater soil heterogeneity beneath woody vegetation than beneath grasslands. Woody species have a more widespread and coarser root system than herbaceous species, and may have a competitive advantage in relatively heterogeneous soils. We tested the global generality of greater soil heterogeneity beneath woody vegetation. Location Global. Methods We used data from published literature for soil nitrogen and carbon heterogeneity from paired woodland and grassland sites around the world. Results Woodland and grassland soil heterogeneities from paired observations were strongly correlated. There was, however, significant geographical variability in the relationship. Soils were more heterogeneous in woodlands than grasslands in temperate areas, but the opposite was true for tropical habitats. Grassland soils were more heterogeneous at lower than higher latitudes. Woodland soil heterogeneity did not vary with latitude. Main conclusions The previously described high soil heterogeneity in woody vegetation compared to grasslands holds only for temperate regions. Consequently, the relationship between soil resource heterogeneity and vegetation type is dependent on the study region. Macroecological studies should test the generality of relationships between soil and vegetation at the global scale.","Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Partel, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",meelis.partel@ut.ee,"Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012; Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011; Laanisto, Lauri/H-2202-2012","Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Laanisto, Lauri/0000-0003-2215-7298",,,,47,14,14,0,29,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Fine roots were extracted from soil cores within root traps several times over 12 months; biomass and metal concentrations were measured. Live roots were collected from 30-cm soil cores, separated into three depths. Elevated soil metal concentrations did not necessarily reduce fine root decomposition, and effects on decomposition were similar to those previously reported for surface foliar litter at the same sites. Decomposing roots at only the high metal sites demonstrated increased metal concentrations with time. Root tissue concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Zn, but not Pb, at lower soil depths were generally higher than expected from soil metal concentrations. This could be explained by reallocation of essential metals, although these metals were likely also more available for uptake at depth due to lower DOC concentrations. This study means that for risk assessment, separate determinations of altered decomposition for roots and leaf litter are likely not necessary for predicting ecosystem effects, a pragmatically useful conclusion given the labor intensity of the fine root studies. This study also suggests that for risk assessment of plant community exposure to metals, prediction of exposure to metals should probably consider soil layers that do not have substantially elevated metal concentrations, as their soil characteristics, or plant processes, may result in unexpected exposure.","[Hale, Beverley] Univ Guelph, Dept Land Resource Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Johnson, Dallas] Alberta Environm, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Hale, B (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Land Resource Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",bhale@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,25,3,4,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

The change in genotype density in the warmed plots was associated with an increase in PCR amplification efficiency, suggesting that increased C allocation belowground is increasing the overall biomass of the fungal community.","[Fujimura, Kei E.; Egger, Keith N.] Univ No British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Henry, Gregory Hr] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Egger, KN (reprint author), Univ No British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, BC 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",egger@unbc.ca,,,,,,55,32,34,3,68,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK STREET, 9TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1751-7362,,,ISME J,ISME J.,JAN,2008,2,1,,,,,105,114,,10.1038/ismej.2007.89,,,10,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,254NA,WOS:000252592100012,18180749,,,,10/31/19J,"Schamp, BS; Chau, J; Aarssen, LW",,,,"Schamp, Brandon S.; Chau, Joyce; Aarssen, Lonnie W.",,,Dispersion of traits related to competitive ability in an old-field plant community,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,coexistence; competitive asymmetry; competition; convergence; divergence; limiting similarity; niche separation; over-dispersion; physical space niche; under-dispersion,COMPETITION/COLONIZATION TRADE-OFF; DIFFERENT ROOTING DEPTHS; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SEED MASS; GRASSLAND COMMUNITY; LIMITING SIMILARITY; HABITAT TEMPLET; ASSEMBLY RULES,"1. We investigated patterns in the dispersion (i.e. spread and spacing) of plant species traits that are frequently associated with competitive ability, in an old-field plant community. In contrast with previous studies, we found no evidence for significant over- or under-dispersion of maximum plant height, maximum plant biomass, or seed mass. 2. These findings hold across three plot sizes (10 x 10 cm, 30 x 30 em, 50 x 50 cm), and when plot size is measured in terms of number of ramets (50 ramets, 250 ramets or 500 ramets) rather than per unit area. Plot size, however, significantly affected the direction of dispersion observed across test statistics, supporting previous studies that have observed that trait dispersion patterns are sensitive to plot size. 3. While no significant dispersion was detected, dispersion direction, measured as the tendency for a two-tailed test to indicate trends for a given trait, was more frequently observed when analyses were weighted by abundance. Abundance weighted analyses had significantly different dispersion directions compared with presence/absence analyses for one of three traits considered. These findings suggest that abundance weighted analyses may yield more consistent trait dispersion patterns. 4. Synthesis. Our results may be interpreted as evidence for limited, if any, functional niche partitioning between co-occurring species via size-mediated differences in rooting depth or physical space niches (i.e. limiting similarity). Alternatively, some species with large differences in competitive traits may avoid competition through niche separation, while others may simply compete asymmetrically, leading to overall patterns of dispersion that cannot be distinguished from random. This interpretation supports recent perspectives that niche and neutral theoretical concepts are not mutually exclusive; both, working together, can be applied to the interpretation of plant community assembly and structure.","[Schamp, Brandon S.; Aarssen, Lonnie W.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Chau, Joyce] Citizens Environm Watch, Toronto, ON M5V 2L7, Canada","Schamp, BS (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",schampb@biology.queensu.ca,"Aarssen, Lonnie/K-5778-2012",,,,,73,73,74,1,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The adsorption-desorption isotherms demonstrated that the inorganic surfaces were able to bind the pollutant, although to a lesser extent than the organo-mineral complex. The capacity of different aqueous solutions to desorb phenanthrene after 1, 7, and 30 days' contact with the model colloids was tested in order to assess their efficacy with respect to the aging effect. The solutions used were 0.01 N CaCl2, dissolved soil organic matter (DOM), a model root exudates solution (aqueous solution of saccharose, fructose, glucose, fumaric acid, ferrulic acid, and leucine), and three commercial surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, Tween 20, and didecyldimethylammonium bromide). The desorptive capacity of these solutions were compared with that of organic solutions (water-ethanol and n-hexane-ethanol). More than 85% phenanthrene was desorbed after 30 days aging by organic solutions. Among the aqueous solutions, the best results were obtained with dissolved soil organic matter solution and the model root exudates solution which were able to desorb up to 50% phenanthrene after 30 days aging. Such naturally occurring aqueous solutions should be preferred to synthetic compounds to mobilize phenanthrene in contaminated sites without further contaminating the environment.","[Negre, Michele; Boursier, Carlotta] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Valorizzaz & Protez Risorse Agrofore, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Abbate, Cristina; Baglieri, Andrea; Gennari, Mara] Univ Catania, Sez Sci Agrochim, Dipartimento Sci Agronom Agrochim & Prod Anim, Catania, Italy","Negre, M (reprint author), Univ Turin, Dipartimento Valorizzaz & Protez Risorse Agrofore, Via Leonardo Vinci 44, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",michele.negre@unito.it,,,,,,43,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1093-4529,,,J ENVIRON SCI HEAL A,J.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to improve plant tolerance to abiotic environmental factors such as salinity, but they can be themselves negatively affected by salinity. In this study, the first in vitro experiment analyzed the effects of 0, 50, or 100 mM NaCl on the development and sporulation of Glomus intraradices. In the second experiment, the effects of mycorrhization on the expression of key plant genes expected to be affected by salinity was evaluated. Results showed that the assayed isolate G. intraradices DAOM 197198 can be regarded as a moderately salt-tolerant AMF because it did not significantly decrease hyphal development or formation of branching absorbing structures at 50 mM NaCl. Results also showed that plants colonized by G. intraradices grew more than nonmycorrhizal plants. This effect was concomitant with a higher relative water content in AM plants, lower proline content, and expression of Lsp5cs gene (mainly at 50 mM NaCl), lower expression of the stress marker gene Lslea gene, and lower content of abscisic acid in roots of mycorrhizal plants as compared to nonmycorrhizal plants, which suggest that the AM fungus decreased salt stress injury. In addition, under salinity, AM symbiosis enhanced the expression of LsPIP1. Such enhanced gene expression could contribute to regulating root water permeability to better tolerate the osmotic stress generated by salinity.","[Jahromi, Farzad; Aroca, Ricardo; Porcel, Rosa; Ruiz-Lozano, Juan Manuel] CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sist Simbiot, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Jahromi, Farzad] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr & Vet Sci, EH Graham Ctr Agr Innovat, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia","Ruiz-Lozano, JM (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sist Simbiot, Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",juanmanuel.ruiz@eez.csic.es,"Porcel, Rosa/H-5686-2019; Aroca, Ricardo/K-5268-2014","Porcel, Rosa/0000-0001-8068-741X; Aroca, Ricardo/0000-0003-2402-2063; Ruiz Lozano, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-4473-5434",,,,54,142,164,3,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Quantification of AM and pathogenic fungi in the roots showed that the AM symbiosis significantly reduced P. ultimum biomass and in some cases prevented infection. The flavonoid productions in clover roots varied depending on the presence of beneficial and/or pathogenic fungi, fungal isolate or plant cultivar. Only plants colonized with G. claroideum showed detectable concentrations of either coumestrol or kaempferol (cultivar-dependant). In addition, inoculation with G. claroideum resulted in significantly higher concentrations of coumestrol in cv. Sonja and medicarpin in cv. Milo. A low production of coumestrol and kaempferol in mycorrhizal plants may be G. mosseae-specific. Only the concentrations of formononetin and daidzein increased in clover roots in response to infection with P. ultimum. These flavonoids are supposedly stress metabolites, synthesized or produced from glycosides in response to pathogen infection. However, the presence of one or both AMF significantly lowered the formononetin and daidzein concentrations, and overruled the inductive effect of P. ultimum. Therefore the antagonistic action of AM against the pathogen must take place through another mechanism.","[Carlsen, S. C. K.; Understrup, A.; Fomsgaard, I. S.; Mortensen, A.

The amounts of ligands secreted from roots and contained in root tips of these species were compared with those of an Al-sensitive species, Melaleuca bracteata F. Muell., after the roots were exposed to 0 or 1 mM AlCl3 solution. Secretion of well-known ligands (citrate, oxalate, and malate) from roots under Al treatment was low in all species. However, in E. camaldulensis, the Al-binding capacity of root exudates under Al treatment was considerable and was higher than that in M. bracteata. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that a low-molecular-weight Al-binding ligand was secreted from roots in response to Al only in E. camaldulensis. On the other hand, the Al-binding capacity of cell sap in root tips under Al treatment was similar for the resistant and sensitive species. These results suggest that Al exclusion by secretion of the unknown low-molecular-weight Al-binding ligand from roots contributes to the Al resistance of E. camaldulensis, whereas M. cajuputi has developed Al-resistance mechanisms other than secretion of ligands from roots or concentration of internal ligands in root tips.","[Tahara, Ko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Tahara, Ko; Norisada, Mariko; Yamanoshita, Takashi; Kojima, Katsumi] Univ Tokyo, Asian Nat Environm Sci Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Tahara, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",taharako@affrc.go.jp,"Tahara, Ko/B-4761-2008","Tahara, Ko/0000-0002-9219-7191",,,,40,25,31,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2008,302,2-Jan,,,,,175,187,,10.1007/s11104-007-9464-5,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,245XG,WOS:000251971500014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Knohl, A; Soe, ARB; Kutsch, WL; Gockede, M; Buchmann, N",,,,"Knohl, Alexander; Soe, Astrid R.

However, the choice of experimental design strongly affects estimates of annual respiration and of the contribution of soil respiration to total ecosystem respiration. In a detailed study of ecosystem and soil respiration fluxes in an old unmanaged deciduous forest in Central Germany over 3 years (2000-2002), we combined soil chamber and eddy covariance measurements to obtain a comprehensive picture of respiration in this forest. The closed portable chambers offered to investigate spatial variability of soil respiration and its controls while the eddy covariance system offered continuous measurements of ecosystem respiration. Over the year, both fluxes were mainly correlated with temperature. However, when soil moisture sank below 23 vol.% in the upper 6 cm, water limitations also became apparent. The temporal resolution of the eddy covariance system revealed that relatively high respiration rates occurred during budbreak due to increased metabolic activity and after leaf fall because of increased decomposition. Spatial variability in soil respiration rates was large and correlated with fine root biomass (r(2)=0.56) resulting in estimates of annual efflux varying across plots from 730 to 1,258 (mean 898) g C m(-2) year(-1). Power function calculations showed that achieving a precision in the soil respiration estimate of 20% of the full population mean at a confidence level of 95%, requires about eight sampling locations. Our results can be used as guidelines to improve the representativeness of soil respiration measurements by nested sampling designs, being applied in long-term and large-scale carbon sequestration projects such as FLUXNET and CarboEurope.","[Knohl, Alexander; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Knohl, Alexander; Soe, Astrid R.

A 3-year trial was conducted on the freshly created spoil bank Vrsany, North-Bohemian coal basin, the Czech Republic. Three plant species - non-mycotrophic annual Atriplex sagittata, highly mycotrophic annual Tripleurospermum inodorum (both dominants of early stages of succession) and facultatively mycotrophic Arrhenatherum elatius (a perennial grass species of the later stage of succession) - were planted on 1 m(2) plots over 3 years in different sequences that simulated the progress of succession on spoil banks. The development of AMF populations was monitored by evaluation of mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots and by measurement of the mycorrhizal inoculation potential (MIP) of soil. These two parameters were compared between plots inoculated with the mixture of three AMF isolates - Glomus mosseae BEG95, G. claroideum BEG96 and G. intraradices BEG140 - (""inoculated plots"") and plots exposed only to natural dispersal of AMF propagules (""uninoculated plots""). Highly colonized roots of plants together with a high MIP of soil in uninoculated plots were already found at the end of the first season, indicating rapid natural dispersal of AMF propagules. Root colonization of facultatively mycotrophic and non-mycotrophic plants in later years was affected by the mycorrhizal status of the previous plant species. The MIP of soil continuously increased throughout the experiment; in uninoculated plots, the MIP was temporarily decreased if plant species of higher mycotrophy were replaced by species of lower mycotrophy. The results lead to the conclusion that AMF colonize freshly formed sites very quickly and reproduce or accumulate in the soil, which leads to increasing MIP values. However, this infective potential can be decreased if non-mycotrophic plants predominate on the site.","[Pueschel, David; Rydlova, Jana; Vosatka, Miroslav] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Mycorrhizal Symbioses, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Puschel, D (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Mycorrhizal Symbioses, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",puschel@ibot.cas.cz,"Rydlova, Jana/G-3094-2014; Puschel, David/G-3085-2014","Vosatka, Miroslav/0000-0002-1378-3185",,,,30,14,14,0,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2008,302,2-Jan,,,,,273,282,,10.1007/s11104-007-9480-5,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,245XG,WOS:000251971500022,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sun, P; Zhu, WY; Zhao, XQ",,,,"Sun, Ping; Zhu, Wenyan; Zhao, Xinquan",,,"OPPOSITE-SEX SIBLING RECOGNITION IN ADULT ROOT VOLE, MICROTUS OECONOMUS PALLAS: PHENOTYPE MATCHING OR ASSOCIATION",POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,root vole (Microtus oeconomus Pallas); kin recognition; phenotype match; association,BELDING GROUND-SQUIRRELS; KIN-RECOGNITION; INBREEDING AVOIDANCE; SOCIAL RECOGNITION; GOLDEN-HAMSTERS; SPACE-USE; MECHANISMS; RODENTS; FIELD; CONNECTIVITY,"Hypothesis of phenotype matching and association are the most likely mechanisms in kin recognition.

Loamy soil (more productivity site) was classified as a Typic Hapludox (RED) and sandy soil (less productivity site) as a Typic Quartzipsamment (QTZ). Biomass inventory was carried out using ten sample-trees in each site including shoot (stem, bark, leaves and branches) and root system (fine and coarse roots) tree components. Two logarithmic regression equations were adjusted to estimate tree biomass, with diameter at breast height (DBH) and height (H) or (DBHH)-H-2 being used as independent variables. The adjusted models were significant at 95% of probability by the t Student test. The best-fit equations were found with (DBHH)-H-2. Validation of common equations for the two sites was based in the combined analyses of coefficient of determination (R-2), stand error of estimate (S-y.x) and graphic analysis of residues. Adjusted equations had highest precision for estimate of stem biomass (R-2 = 0.99; S-y.x = 0.12) and bark biomass (R-2 = 0.97; S-y.x = 0.24). In spite of R-2 > 0.70, equation for leaf and branch biomass had low accuracy. Thus, it was suggested the inclusion of other variables related to size of trees. Specific equations for biomass estimation by each site for fine [RED (R-2 = 0.97; S-y.x = 0.30); QTZ (R-2 = 0.96; S-y.x = 0.15)] and coarse roots [LVd (R-2 = 0.98; S-y.x = 0.19); RQ (R-2 = 0.99; S-y.x = 0.15)] were more accurate than common equations, since that there was more root biomass allocation in sandy soil (QTZ).","[de Miranda Mello, Sergio Luis; de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Escola Super Agr Luiz Queiroz, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Mello, SLD (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Escola Super Agr Luiz Queiroz, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",slmello@yahoo.com.br; jlmgonca@esalq.usp.br,"Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo/G-4979-2013","Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo/0000-0003-1068-5448",,,,30,13,13,0,6,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

Symbiotic efficiency is related to AMF genotypes and plant species, as well as to environmental conditions that may affect the expression of symbiotic relationships. Thus, the first step to an efficient AMF symbiosis management is to study fungal variability regarding the efficiency with different host species. In this study root colonization and efficiency of several AMF isolates, obtained from bauxite minespoil areas from two distinct environments (""serra"" and ""campo""), were evaluated for seedling growth of pioneer species [aroeira (Schinus terebenthifolius) and trema (Trerna micrantha)], and secondary species [acoita-cavalo (Luehea grandiflora) and sesbania (Sesbania virgata)], in a low fertility soil. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, for 120 days. Each plant species, was treated with ten AMF inoculation types (AMF isolates or their mixtures): Acaulospora longula, Paraglornus occulturn, Glornus sp., Gigaspora sp., Acaulospora spinosa, and the mixture of all ""campo"" species; Acaulospora scrobiculata, Paraglomus occultum, Glomus sp. and the mixture of all ""serra"" species. For a comparison two additional treatments were included: one inoculated with efficient Glornus etunicatum, as reference, and an uninoculated treatment, as control. The growth of all plant species was lower in the absence of AMF whereas AMF inoculation enhanced plant growth. Benefits varied according to isolates and plant species. All tested isolates or their mixtures were efficient in sesbania, while only one Glornus sp. was inefficient for trema and aroeira and - both Glornus sp. isolates were inefficient for acoita-cavalo. It was found that no isolate from bauxite mine spoil was more efficient than Glornus etunicaturn. However, several isolates from campo (Gigaspora sp., Paraglornus occulturn and Acaulospora spinosa) were as efficient as G. etunicaturn for all hosts. These results show that degraded land, i.e., bauxite mine spoils can have efficient ""Fpopulations which may contribute to land rehabilitation.","[Donizetti Santos, Jose Geraldo] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Ciencia Solo, Bolsista CNPq, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil","Santos, JGD (reprint author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Ciencia Solo, Bolsista CNPq, Caixa Postal 37, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",jgsanttos@yahoo.com.br; siqueira@ufla.br; fmoreira@ufla.br,"Moreira, Fatima M.S./A-1732-2014","Moreira, Fatima M.S./0000-0003-0159-5811",,,,32,14,16,0,20,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

The shoot:root ratio is determined through the allocation of resources. Studies on below-ground architectural elements in boreal mixed forests are relatively scarce despite the fact that knowledge on below-ground interactions and allocation changes in relation to stand developmental stage and soil fertility is needed both in ecological and silvicultural research. In this study, sixty tree root systems of three different tree species, Betula pendula, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris, were excavated in five mixed forest stands in order to quantify differences between the species and sites in terms of rooting behaviour. Root architecture differed greatly between the species, implying different solutions for the functions of root systems. Half of the R sylvestris had developed a taproot as a response to anchorage needs, while P. abies correspondingly had pronounced secondary growth of proximal roots. Betula pendula had the most extensive root system, illustrating the greater demand of deciduous trees for water. Betula pendula was also the most sensitive to Soil fertility: it favoured exploration on the poorest site, as illustrated by the high total root length, whereas on the most fertile site its strategy was to efficiently exploit soil resources through increased branching intensity. The results obtained in this study provide basic knowledge on the architectural characteristics of boreal tree root systems for use by forestry professionals and modellers.","[Kalliokoski, Tuomo; Sievanen, Risto] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Kalliokoski, T (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, POB 18, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",tuomo.kalliokoski@metla.fi,,,,,,52,54,59,1,16,FINNISH SOC FOREST SCIENCE-NATURAL RESOURCES INST FINLAND,VANTAA,"PO BOX 18, FI-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND",0037-5330,2242-4075,,SILVA FENN,Silva.

ECM colonisation degree of 1-year-old spruce seedlings was below 20% in all studied Finnish forest nurseries. In 2-year-old spruce seedlings the ECM colonisation degree was ca. 50-60% in three of the nurseries, but negligible in others. The ECM fungal species richness varied from 0.1 to 3.8 types per seedling. Altogether seven ECM morphotypes were distinguished. The clearest factors associated with ECM colonisation patterns were nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisation. Particularly fertilisation in the early stage of seedling development appeared to diminish the degree of colonisation and species richness of ECM fungi. Root/shoot ratio was positively correlated with high colonisation degree and species richness of ECM fungi. Higher fertilisation inputs in these overall fertilisation levels did not increase the size of the seedlings. According to these results moderate fertilisation levels particularly in the beginning of seedling cultivation are critical for generating higher root/shoot ratios and sufficient ECM colonisation degree of the roots.","[Flykt, Enni; Timonen, Sari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pennanen, Taina] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Flykt, E (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Timonen, Sari/0000-0001-9039-5648",Finnish Forester Foundation,Finnish Forester Foundation is thanked for financial support.

Our hypothesis was that root restriction imposed by the container might hinder or rule out genetic differences in biomass allocation. We grew seedlings of two contrasted provenances of Canary Islands pine in mini-rhizotrons, 60 and 90 cm deep, and alternatively in standard bottom-open 200 cc forest containers. In the mini-rhizotrons, plants from the drier provenance allocated more biomass to roots, especially to the tap root and invested less in needles, both in a biomass and leaf area basis, and this morphological divergence increased between two harvests, undertaken at 57 and 115 days after planting. By contrast, confirming our hypothesis, at the 115 days harvest, the plants grown in standard containers did not exhibited significant differences between provenances for Leaf Mass Fraction, Root Mass Fraction and Leaf Area Ratio. We conclude that the physical constraint for root development imposed by small containers increases the probability of dismissing the genetic effect in biomass allocation when assessing forest reproductive materials at the short term, even when the whole plant growth (total dry weight) might be unaffected.","[Climent, J.] INIA, Unidad Genet Forestal, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Alonso, J.; Gil, L.] UPM, Unidad Docente Anat Fisiol & Genet Forestales, ETSIM, Madrid 28040, Spain","Climent, J (reprint author), Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Unidad Genet Forestal, Ctra Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",climent@inia.es,"Climent, Jose/B-9090-2009; Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014","Climent, Jose/0000-0002-0815-2645; Gil, Luis/0000-0002-5252-2607","Island Administrations (Cabildos); Spanish Ministry for Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Spain",This research was funded by the Island Administrations (Cabildos) of Tenerife and Gran Canaria.

The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA identified these strains as Pantoea, Serratia, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Agrobacterium, and Burkholderia. Limited genetic diversity was revealed among these bacteria since most of the strains (85.7%) were found in three very similar rDNA types corresponding to Pantoea agglomerans, and many strains shared the same BOX-PCR patterns. The inoculation of nodule endophytes had no significant effects on the growth and nodulation of soybean, but most of the strains produced indoleacetic acid (IAA), could solubilize mineral phosphate, and could fix nitrogen, implying that they are a valuable pool for discovering plant growth promoting bacteria. Our results demonstrated that the nodule endophytes were common in soybean and their diversity was affected by the plant's character and the soil conditions. The 99% similarities found in the nifH genes of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and of the endophytic Bacillus strains strongly indicated that horizontal transfer of symbiotic genes happened between the symbiotic bacteria and the endophytes.

In a tropical mountain rain forest in southern Ecuador, we measured the apparent diurnal gas exchange of stems and coarse roots (diameter 1-4 cm) of trees from representative families along an elevational transect with plots at 1050, 1890 and 3050 m a.s.1. Mean air temperatures were 20.8, 17.2 and 10.6 degrees C, respectively. Stem and root CO2 efflux of 13 to 21 trees per stand from dominant families were investigated with an open gas exchange system while stand microclimate was continuously monitored. Substantial variation in respiratory activity among and within species was found at all sites. Mean daily CO2 release rates from stems declined 6.6-fold from 1.38 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 1050 m to 0.21 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 3050 m. Mean daily CO2 release from coarse roots decreased from 0.35 to 0.20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) with attitude, but the differences were not significant. There was, thus, a remarkable shift from a high ratio of stem to coarse root respiration rates at the lowest elevation to an apparent equivalence of stem and coarse root CO2 efflux rates at the highest elevation. We conclude that stem respiration, but not root respiration, greatly decreases with elevation in this transect, coinciding with a substantial decrease in relative stem diameter increment and a large increase in fine and coarse root biomass production with elevation.","[Zach, Alexandra; Horna, Viviana; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albercht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Zach, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albercht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",alzac@gnix.de,,,,,,34,12,13,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2008,28,1,,,,,67,74,,10.1093/treephys/28.1.67,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,254FM,WOS:000252571800008,17938115,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Peichl, M; Arain, MA",,,,"Peichl, Matthias; Arain, M.

Biomass in each tree component, i.e. foliage, branch (live and dead), bark, stem and root was quantified by destructive tree harvesting. Allometric biomass equations were developed for each tree component within each stand (age class) and across the entire age-sequence. Mean above- and belowground tree biomass was 0.3, 54, 105, and 529 kg tree-(1) and 0. 1, 13. 17, and 99 ka tree(-1) in the 2, 15-, 30-, and 65-year-old stands, respectively. The relative portion of stem biomass to total tree biomass increased from 25% for the 2-year-old stand to 69% for the 65-year-old stand, whereas the relative contribution of canopy biomass components (foliage and branches) decreased with stand age. Root to shoot biomass ratio decreased from 0.32 in the 2-year-old stand to 0.24, 0.16, and 0.22 in the 15, 30-, and 65-year-old stands, respectively, indicating a decrease during the first few decades after stand establishment. Allometric relationships between biomass of individual aboveground tree components and tree diameter changed with stand age and thus resulted in age-specific allometric equations. In contrast, a single allometric equation could predict total aboveground and belowground, and total tree biomass from tree diameter only across the entire age-sequence. The relationship between tree component biomass and stem volume, expressed as biomass expansion factor (BEF), decreased for all above- and belowground tree components and total tree biomass with increasing stand age. Changes in tree biomass allocation and allometry throughout different stages of forest stand development need to be considered in order to improve forest biomass and carbon sequestration accounting on regional and national scale.

The effects of low RT on growth, gas exchange, and root respiration following winter dormancy were studied in 1-year-old northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) container seedlings grown in solution culture at uniform air temperatures, but exposed to three different root zone temperat ures (10, 15, and 25 degrees C After 14 days of treatment, net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration (E) were significantly affected by RT; however, these treatment effects did not persist for the remaining measurement period (days 21 and 28) despite growth reductions. After 28 days, new shoot length, leaf area, and number of new roots were reduced with decreasing RT. Shoot dry mass was higher in seedlings exposed to 25 degrees C compared with those in 10 degrees C, while an opposite trend occurred for root-to-shoot ratio. Leaf water potential (psi(w)) at day 28 and days to budbreak were not significantly altered by RT treatments. Root O-2 uptake in seedlings exposed to 10 degrees C was 65% lower than for those seedlings at 25 degrees C.

In frequent-fire, old-growth landscapes, there is a symbiotic relationship between the trees, the understory graminoids, and fire that results in a healthy ecosystem. Patches of old growth interspersed with younger growth and open, grassy areas provide a wide variety of habitats for animals, and have a higher level of biodiversity. Fire suppression is detrimental to these forests, and eventually destroys all old growth. The reintroduction of fire into degraded frequent-fire, old-growth forests, accompanied by appropriate thinning, can restore a balance to these ecosystems. Several areas require further research and study: 1) the ability of the understory to respond to restoration treatments, 2) the rate of ecosystem recovery following wildfires whose level of severity is beyond the historic or natural range of variation, 3) the effects of climate change, and 4) the role of the microbial community. In addition, it is important to recognize that much of our knowledge about these old-growth systems comes from a few frequent-fire forest types.","[Sisk, Tom; Chambers, Carol] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",,,,,,,,79,6,7,0,0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

AMF colonization increased the growth of the legumes, indicating that AMF colonization increased the plant's resistance to heavy metals. It also significantly stimulated the formation of root nodules and increased the N and P uptake of all of the tested leguminous plants, which might be one of the tolerance mechanisms conferred by AMF. Compared with the control, colonization by G. mosseae decreased the concentration of metals, such as Cu, in the shoots of the three legumes, indicating that the decreased heavy metals uptake and growth dilution were induced by AMF treatment, thereby reducing the heavy metal toxicity to the plants. The root/shoot ratios of Cu in the three legumes and Zn in M. sativa were significantly increased (P < 0.05) with AMF colonization, indicating that heavy metals were immobilized by the mycorrhiza and the heavy metal translocations to the shoot were decreased.","Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; Beijing City Univ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Bio Control, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; Beijing Acad Agr & Forest, Inst Plant Nutr & Res, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China","Wong, MH (reprint author), Hong Kong Baptist Coll, Croucher Inst Environm Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mhwong@hkbu.edu.hk; ygzhu@rcees.ac.cn,"Zhu, Yong-Guan/A-1412-2009","Zhu, Yong-Guan/0000-0003-3861-8482",,,,28,35,40,3,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-4042,1573-2983,,ENVIRON GEOCHEM HLTH,Environ.

Soil cores were sampled from the surface soils of six plots in a successional series of vegetation, and ectomycorrhizal root tips were classified into morphotypes by macroscopic observation and measurement of the internal transcribed spacer 3-4 length of rDNA. The inoculum potential of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the soils was also investigated by germinating and growing Japanese red pine seedlings in pots. The species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi on tree roots increased along the successional gradient from the pioneer tree stage (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. stands) to the middle stage (deciduous Quercus serrata Thunb. and Castanea crenata Sieb. stands) and then slightly decreased in the climax stage (evergreen Quercus myrsinaefolia B1. stands). The increase in the number of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was strongly correlated with the increase in the biomass of ectomycorrhizal trees along the succession. Ectomycorrhizal propagule banks were found in the soil of pioneer grass- and shrublands where ectomycorrhizal trees were not present. Unlike the diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes on tree roots, the morphotype richness and diversity of ectomycoffhizal inocula in the soil infective to pine seedlings increased only from the grassland to the pine successional stage and not in the deciduous and evergreen-oak stages. The composition of ectomycorrhizal communities on mature trees and ectomycorrhizal propagule banks in soils showed a successional gradient along the secondary vegetation gradient, but many common morphotypes were present among the different vegetation stages.","[Yamashita, Satsuki; Fukuda, Kenji; Ugawa, Shin] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Nat Environm Studies, Lab Evaluat Nat Environm, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778063, Japan","Yamashita, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Nat Environm Studies, Lab Evaluat Nat Environm, Kashiwanoha 5-1-5, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778063, Japan.",sayamashi@hotmail.com; fukuda@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ushin@ffpri.affrc.so.jp,"Fukuda, Kenji/Q-4216-2019; Fukuda, Kenji/F-9355-2017","Fukuda, Kenji/0000-0002-9980-3107; Fukuda, Kenji/0000-0002-9980-3107",,,,46,4,4,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0015-749X,1938-3738,,FOREST SCI,For.

Variations in water tension in a transpiring tree cause elastic changes in stem diameter. To better understand the dynamics of these variations, stem diameter changes and sap flow rates were monitored simultaneously in trees from two Scots pine chronosequences in Scotland. 2. Tree below-ground hydraulic conductance (k(bg)) was estimated from the relationship between leaf-specific sap flow rates and the difference between stem and soil water potentials estimated from diameter variations in the stem. 3. In a given tree, k(bg) varied both within and among days, with conductance increasing as a function of sap flow and evaporative demand. These patterns could be explained in terms of a composite model of root water transport and possible changes in the gating of aquaporins. 4. We interpreted these trends of increasing k(bg) with evaporative demand as a mechanism to enhance the ability of trees to control leaf water potential and keep it within physiologically acceptable limits, with potential implications for our general understanding of plant water relations, and for the estimation and modelling of ecosystem water fluxes. 5. Across trees, k(bg) declined with increasing tree age/size, but the proportional contribution of below-ground to whole-tree hydraulic resistance also declined. This is consistent with an increase in below-ground carbon allocation in old/tall trees and a partial acclimation of tall trees to hydraulic limitations. It is argued that these trends have to be considered when discussing the importance of tree height for water transport and growth.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol & Mol Biol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA","Martinez-Vilalta, J (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland.",jordi.martinez.vilalta@uab.es,"Mencuccini, Maurizio/B-9052-2011; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/D-3385-2014","Mencuccini, Maurizio/0000-0003-0840-1477; Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi/0000-0002-2332-7298",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/A/S/2001/01193],,,53,17,19,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Root elongation measurements were obtained in nanometers for very short (sub-second) time intervals by using the optical interference method called statistical interferometry, developed by the authors. Three categories of P. densiflora seedlings were investigated; two categories were infected with ectomycorrhiza of Pisolithus sp. (Ps) and Cenococcum geophilum (Cg), while the third was without any fungal infection. In experiments, two points on a root with a separation of 3 mm were illuminated by laser beams and the elongation was measured continuously by analyzing speckle patterns successively taken by a CCD camera. The ectomycorrhizal fungi-infected and uninfected seedlings were exposed to ozone at concentrations of 120 and 240 ppb for periods of 1, 3, or 5 h in separate treatments. The root elongations of P. densiflora seedlings were measured before and immediately after the each ozone treatment and then the root elongation rates (RER) were determined for growth-measurement periods of 5.5 s and 9.5 min. From the measurements obtained for 9.5 min, we found that the RERs of uninfected and Cg-infected seedlings were reduced by 42 and 18%, respectively, after 5 h of exposure to 120 ppb ozone compared with that before exposure, while the reduction in RER of Ps-infected seedlings was not significant. When the concentration of ozone was increased to 240 ppb, the RERs of Ps-infected and Cg-infected seedlings were reduced by 32 and 44%, respectively, after exposure for 5 h, while the reduction in RER of uninfected seedlings was 59%. These observations prove that the non-mycorrhizal seedling roots are more sensitive to ozone stress. From this study, we found that the RERs of both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal seedlings apparently fluctuated throughout the measurements, even within a few minutes.","Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Sakura Ku, Saitama 3388570, Japan; Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, Kisai, Saitama, Japan","Rathnayake, AP (reprint author), Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Sakura Ku, 255 Shimo Okubo, Saitama 3388570, Japan.",anura@env.gse.saitama-u.ac.jp,"Rathnayake, Anura/R-1358-2019",,,,,34,10,11,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Natural abundance of N-15 was used as a tool to elucidate differences in N cycling along an altitudinal transect ranging from 2,906 to 3,079 m, corresponding to a gradient in mean annual temperature of 2.4 degrees C. The amount of total soil N, of plant available N and soil C/N ratio decreased significantly with increasing altitude, whereas soil pH increased. Soil delta N-15 decreased with increasing altitude from +2.2 to -2.1 parts per thousand and delta N-15 of plant tissues (roots and leaves) decreased from -3.7 to -5.5 parts per thousand. The large shift in soil delta N-15 of 4.3 parts per thousand from the lowest to the highest site suggested substantial differences in N cycling in alpine and nival ecosystems in the alpine nival ecotone investigated. We concluded that N cycling at the alpine-nival ecotone is likely to be controlled by various factors: temperature, soil age and development, atmospheric N deposition and plant competition. Our results furthermore demonstrate that the alpine-nival ecotone may serve as a sensitive indicator of global change.","[Huber, Edith; Wanek, Wolfgang; Richter, Andreas] Univ Vienna, Dept Chem Ecol & Ecosyst Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Edith; Arndt, Stefan K.; Richter, Andreas] Univ Melbourne, Sch Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia; [Gottfried, Michael; Pauli, Harald; Reiter, Karl] Univ Vienna, Dept Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Schweiger, Peter] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Richter, A (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Chem Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",Andreas.Richter@univie.ac.at,"Arndt, Stefan/G-5021-2013; Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012; Gottfried, Michael/C-2923-2011; Richter, Andreas/D-8483-2012","Arndt, Stefan/0000-0001-7086-9375; Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3282-4808; Schweiger, Peter/0000-0003-2967-7835",,,,66,48,53,3,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2007,301,2-Jan,,,,,65,76,,10.1007/s11104-007-9422-2,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,252VX,WOS:000252476000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Metcalfe, DB; Meir, P; Williams, M",,,,"Metcalfe, D.

These measurement units are not easily comparable to above-ground plant growth. To address this deficiency, several techniques have been developed to convert rhizotron measurement units into root mass production per unit ground area. In this study, four different conversion methods were applied to the same dataset of rhizotron measurements. This data was used to reveal the effect of conversion method upon estimates of the temporal variation in, and annual magnitude of, gross root mass production. Application of four different conversion methods resulted in gross root production estimates ranging between 2.1 and 11.4 t ha(-1) year(-1). Temporal variation in gross root mass production also varied between methods. All current methods for quantifying root production are likely to cause some disturbance and bias. Based upon a comparison of the sources of error present in each conversion method, we assess which methods are likely to produce the most reliable estimates of root biomass production per unit ground area, and propose additional measurements which could further improve accuracy.","[Metcalfe, D.

Excavations in an area with small trees (low-quality site) revealed that deep ripping equipment failed to penetrate the cemented lateritic subsoil, restricting coarse roots (roots > 5 nun in diameter) to the top 0.5 m of the soil profile, resulting in fewer (1,344 stems/ha) and smaller (mean height 4.5 m) Jarrah trees. An adjacent area within the same pit (high-quality site), with a stand density of 3,256 stems/ha and a mean height of 8.0 m, had a kaolinitic clay subsoil which coarse roots penetrated to the average ripping depth (1.5 m). Trees at the low-quality site did not penetrate the subsoil with their taproot, relying instead on a large number of lateral (5.3-8.0/tree) and sinker (12.0-16.5/tree) roots. Taproots of trees on crests at the high-quality site also did not penetrate the subsoil, and in contrast to trees at the low-quality site, they produced fewer lateral and sinker roots (2.3 and 2.0/tree, respectively). Taproots of trees in riplines at the high-quality site directly penetrated the ripline and these trees also produced fewer lateral and sinker roots (5.0 and 3.7/ tree, respectively) than those at the low-quality site.

The occurrence of numerous amino acid changes driven by directional selection has been reported in this gene, using a limited number of messenger RNA sequences, but the functional reason of these changes remains obscure. The Medicago genus, where changes in rhizobial associations have been previously examined, is a good model to test whether the evolution of NORK is influenced by rhizobial interactions. Results: We sequenced a region of 3610 nucleotides (encoding a 392 amino acid-long region of the NORK protein) in 32 Medicago species. We confirm that positive selection in NORK has occurred within the Medicago genus and find that the amino acid positions targeted by selection occur in sites outside of solvent-exposed regions in LRRs, and other sites in the N-terminal region of the protein. We tested if branches of the Medicago phylogeny where changes of rhizobial symbionts occurred displayed accelerated rates of amino acid substitutions. Only one branch out of five tested, leading to M. noeana, displays such a pattern. Among other branches, the most likely for having undergone positive selection is not associated with documented shift of rhizobial specificity. Conclusion: Adaptive changes in the sequence of the NORK receptor have involved the LRRs, but targeted different sites than in most previous studies of LRR proteins evolution. The fact that positive selection in NORK tends not to be associated to changes in rhizobial specificity indicates that this gene was probably not involved in evolving rhizobial preferences. Other explanations ( e. g. coevolutionary arms race) must be tested to explain the adaptive evolution of NORK.","[De Mita, Stephane; Bataillon, Thomas] INRA, UMR 1097 Divers Adaptat Plantes Cultivees, Montpellier, France; [Santoni, Sylvain; Ronfort, Joelle; Bataillon, Thomas] Univ Aarhus, Inst Biol, Bioinformat Ctr, Sect Genet & Ecol, Aarhus, Denmark; [De Mita, Stephane] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Mol Biol Lab, NL-6700 ET Wageningen, Netherlands","De Mita, S (reprint author), INRA, UMR 1097 Divers Adaptat Plantes Cultivees, Montpellier, France.",demita@gmail.com; santoni@supagro.inra.fr; ronfort@supagro.inra.fr; tbata@daimi.au.dk,,"Bataillon, Thomas/0000-0002-4730-2538",,,,36,11,11,0,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2148,,,BMC EVOL BIOL,BMC Evol.

As a result, any alteration in AMF community structure following soil nitrogen (N) enrichment may impact plant community function and contribute to widespread changes in grassland productivity. We evaluated the responses of AMF communities to N fertilization (>= 100 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) in five perennial grasslands within the Long-Term Ecological Research network to generate a broader understanding of the drivers contributing to AMF species richness and diversity with increasing soil N fertility, and subsequent effects to host-plant communities. AMF spore and hyphal community data at three mesic sites (Cedar Creek, Kellogg Biological Station, Konza Prairie) and two semiarid sites (Sevilleta, Shortgrass Steppe) were collected over two consecutive years and used to test four hypotheses about AMF responses to N fertilization. Under ambient soil N, plant annual net primary productivity and soil phosphorus (P) were strongly related to climatic differences in AMF communities (semiarid vs. mesic). Following N fertilization, the drivers of AMF community structure were soil N availability, N:P supply ratio, and host-plant photosynthetic strategy (C-3 vs. C-4) but not climate. In P-rich soils (low N:P), N fertilization reduced AMF productivity, species richness, and diversity and intensified AMF community convergence due to the loss of rare AMF species and the increased abundance of Glomus species. In P-limited soils (high N:P), AMF productivity, species richness, and diversity increased with N fertilization; the most responsive AMF taxa were Acaulospora, Scutellospora, and Gigaspora. Soil N or N:P x host-plant (C-3, C-4) interactions further modified these responses: AMF hyphae (primarily Gigasporaceae) associated with C-3 plants increased in abundance with N fertilization, whereas C-4 plants hosted nitrophilous Glomus species. Such responses were independent of the duration or quantity of N fertilization, or the time since cessation of N fertilization. This synthesis provides a new understanding of AMF community patterns and processes, and it identifies three key drivers (soil N, N:P, host plant) of AMF community structure that may be tested in other communities.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; Northwestern Univ, Weinberg Coll Arts & Sci, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Egerton-Warburton, LM (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",l-egerton@northwestern.edu,,,,,,70,155,159,6,161,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",15-Dec,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

In terms of biomass, both elfin and the Pterocarpus forests had the highest values. The number of earthworm species significantly increased as elevation and annual rainfall increased and air temperature decreased. We conclude that differences in earthworm species richness along this elevation gradient may be due to a combination of biotic and soil physical and chemical factors.

Ericaceous shrubs were once thought to form ericoid mycorrhizal associations with a relatively narrow range of ascomycetous fungi closely related to, and including, Rhizoscyphus ericae. However, perceptions have recently changed since the realization that a broader range of ascomycete fungi, and in some cases basidiomycete fungi, can also form associations with the roots of ericaceous plants. We used a combination of molecular approaches, including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, to investigate the diversity of fungi associated with C. vulgaris roots collected across a heathland/native Scots pine forest vegetation gradient. We also determined differences in fungal community composition between roots of co-occurring C. vulgaris and Vaccinium myrtillus in the forest understorey. Collectively, the data show that a large diversity of potentially ericoid mycorrhizal fungal taxa associate with roots of C. vulgaris and V. myrtillus, and that ascomycetes were about 2.5 times more frequent than basidiomycetes. The assemblages of fungi associated with C. vulgaris and V. myrtillus were different. In addition, the community of fungi associated with C. vulgaris hair roots was different for samples collected from the forest, open heathland and a transition zone between the two. This separation was partly, but not entirely, due to the occurrence of typical ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes associated with the hair roots of C. vulgaris in the forest understorey. These data demonstrate that forest understorey ericaceous shrubs associate with a diverse range of ascomycete and basidiomycete taxa, including typical ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes.","Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Plant & Food Sci, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Anderson, IC (reprint author), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",i.anderson@macaulay.ac.uk,"Anderson, Ian/G-4129-2014","Anderson, Ian/0000-0002-3507-163X",,,,48,61,63,2,52,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The main objective of this study was to identify germplasm sources of A. senegal that have a good seed germination capacity and seedling traits suitable for reforestation in the clay-soil part of the dryland gum belt in the Blue Nile region in Sudan. A specific objective was to tentatively explore the adaptive strategy of A. senegal populations. Seventeen-week-old seedlings were planted in the field at spacing of 3 m x 3 m, giving 100 trees per plot and replication; within a randomized complete block design with four replications. The experimental site was in the clay plain region. Seed variables showed significant differences. Clay plain provenances showed considerable variation in seed weight and seed number. They had the smallest seed weight but the highest seed number, while the sand (western) provenances had the largest seed weight but lowest seed number. Seedling branch number, root length, root to shoot ratio and shoot dry weight differed significantly among the provenances 12 weeks after germination. Clay provenances had the highest branch number and shoot dry weight but the shortest roots and lowest root to shoot ratio. This was interpreted as showing better adaptation to the site in these local provenances in comparison to those originating from the western sandy soil regions. High positive correlations were observed between seedling variables, such as root nodule and branch numbers; this could be used for early selection. The variation was greater between provenance groups than within them, suggesting that especially selection among groups would yield genetic gain.","Univ Helsinki, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Raddad, EAY (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Viikki Trop Resources Inst, POB 27,Latokartanonkaari 9, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,47,11,12,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,NOV,2007,34,3,,,,,207,222,,10.1007/s11056-007-9049-4,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,215IO,WOS:000249802100001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Velez, DAT; Del Valle, JI",,,,"Velez, Danny Alexander Torres; Del Valle, Jorge Ignacio",,,Growth and yield modelling of Acacia mangium in Colombia,NEW FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia mangium; growth; carbon sequestration; site quality,PREDICTING STAND DEVELOPMENT; SOUTH SUMATRA; PLANTATIONS; INDONESIA; GRANDIS; SOIL,"To study the growth and yield of Acacia mangium in the Caribbean region of Colombia, allometric equations of total volume and aboveground plus coarse roots biomass were fitted as a function of the tree's diameter at breast height (dbh).

Then, using the state-space approach, stand growth and yield models were developed for basal area, volume and biomass. The results show that A. mangium is a very promising species for timber production, atmospheric carbon removal and soil restoration because it grows very fast even in mining degraded soils. On average sites it reaches 15 m in height in 3 years. However, early and reiterated thinning coupled with initial mortality by cattle invasion of the very young understocked plantations are producing relatively low yields.","Univ Nacl Colombia Medellin, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin, Colombia","Velez, DAT (reprint author), Univ Nacl Colombia Medellin, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Apartado Aereo 1027, Medellin, Colombia.",datorres@unalmed.edu.co; jidvalle@unalmed.edu.co,,,,,,34,11,13,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,NOV,2007,34,3,,,,,293,305,,10.1007/s11056-007-9056-5,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,215IO,WOS:000249802100007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Warnock, DD; Lehmann, J; Kuyper, TW; Rillig, MC",,,,"Warnock, Daniel D.; Lehmann, Johannes; Kuyper, Thomas W.; Rillig, Matthias C.",,,Mycorrhizal responses to biochar in soil - concepts and mechanisms,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,biochar; arbuscular mycorrhiza; ectomycorrhiza; carbon storage; restoration; terra preta,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; HELPER BACTERIA; ECTOMYCORRHIZA FORMATION; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CHARCOAL PRODUCTION; ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; WESTERN MONTANA; PONDEROSA PINE; BLACK CARBON,"Experiments suggest that biomass-derived black carbon (biochar) affects microbial populations and soil biogeochemistry. Both biochar and mycorrhizal associations, ubiquitous symbioses in terrestrial ecosystems, are potentially important in various ecosystem services provided by soils, contributing to sustainable plant production, ecosystem restoration, and soil carbon sequestration and hence mitigation of global climate change. As both biochar and mycorrhizal associations are subject to management, understanding and exploiting interactions between them could be advantageous. Here we focus on biochar effects on mycorrhizal associations. After reviewing the experimental evidence for such effects, we critically examine hypotheses pertaining to four mechanisms by which biochar could influence mycorrhizal abundance and/or functioning. These mechanisms are (in decreasing order of currently available evidence supporting them): (a) alteration of soil physico-chemical properties; (b) indirect effects on mycorrhizae through effects on other soil microbes; (c) plant-fungus signaling interference and detoxification of allelochemicals on biochar; and (d) provision of refugia from fungal grazers. We provide a roadmap for research aimed at testing these mechanistic hypotheses.","Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Microbial Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Soil Qual, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",rillig@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Lehmann, Johannes/H-2682-2014","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Lehmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4701-2936",,,,83,475,601,27,692,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2007,300,2-Jan,,,,,9,20,,10.1007/s11104-007-9391-5,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,226IK,WOS:000250582500002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rider, DE; O'Dell, RE; Claassen, VP",,,,"Rider, D.

Recently-fixed NH4+ release from the DG substrate was quantified by extracting diffused NH4+ with H-resin, as well as a native, annual grass Vulpia microstachys. The NH4+ release data varied with via the method of extraction, which included H-resin pretreatments (Na+ or H+) and V. microstachys uptake (mycorrhizal inoculated or uninoculated). After 6 weeks (1008 h), more NH4+ was recovered from fixed interlayer positions by the H-resins as compared to uptake by V. microstachys. The H+ treated H-resins recovered more released NH4+ (approximate to 94 mg NH4+ - N kg(1) or (12%) of total fixed NH4+ in two of the three DG samples as compared to the Na+ treated resins, (which recovered approximate to 70-78 mg NH4+ - N kg(-1) (or 9-10%) of the total fixed NH4+. The V. microstachys assimilated 8-9% of the total fixed NH4+ with mycorrhizal inoculum as compared to only 2% without a mycorrhizal inoculum, over the same time period.The fixed NH4+ release kinetics from the H-resin experiments were most accurately described by first order and power function models, and can be characterized as biphasic using a heterogeneous diffusion model. Uptake of both the N-15 and ambient, unlabelled N from the soils was closely related to plant biomass. There was no significant difference in percent of N per unit of biomass between the control and mycorrhizal treatments. The findings presented here indicate that observed, long-term NH4+ release rates from DG in studies utilizing resins, may overestimate the levels of fixed NH4+ made available to plants and microorganisms. Additionally, the study suggested that mycorrhizae facilitate the acquisition and plant uptake of fixed NH4+, resulting in markedly increased plant biomass production.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Rider, DE (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, 1110 Plant & Environm Sci,1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",derider@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2007,300,2-Jan,,,,,83,94,,10.1007/s11104-007-9390-6,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,226IK,WOS:000250582500008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Vieira, RF; Silva, CMMS; Silveira, APD",,,,"Vieira, Rosana F.; Silva, Celia Maria M.

We assessed the biomass, regrowth, and activity of fine roots (diameter < 1.4 mm) of each species in the upper soil (50 cm depth) of each patch type at 3-month intervals. We also measured the N concentration in fine roots to estimate the relative contribution of each species to fine-root biomass of mixed patches. We injected Li+ in the soil as a chemical tracer to detect fine-root activity of each species in the upper soil. Fine-root biomass was higher in mixed patches than in grass patches while fine-root biomass in shrub patches did not differ from the two former. We did not find differences in fine-root regrowth among patch types. Li+ injection provided evidence of active fine roots of both species in the upper soil when it was wet.

Knowledge of additional biogeochemical processes that promote the movement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into and throughout soil aggregates and soil aggregate stabilization are essential before we can more accurately predict maximum carbon (C) sequestration by soils subjected to best management practices. We investigated the spatial distribution of C-13-glucose supplied to individual soil macroaggregate surfaces and subjected to multiple drying and wetting (DW) cycles. Subsequent distribution of added glucose-C, CO2 respiration, increased microbial community activity and concomitant changes in soil aggregate stabilization were monitored. Moist macroaggregates were treated with no DW cycles and zero glucose C (Control), 5 DW cycles and zero glucose (DW0G), and 5 DW cycles with additions of 250 mu g glucose- C-13/g soil during each cycle (DW + G). Repeated additions of glucose-C to aggregate surfaces reduced the mineralization of pre-existing soil C by an average of 45% and established concentric gradients of glucose-derived C. It is concluded these increasing gradients promoted the diffusion of soluble C into interior regions and became less available to microbial respiration. Spatial gradients of glucose-derived C within aggregates influenced a shift in the abundance of unique ribotypes spatially distributed within aggregates. Rapid decreases in the mineralization rates of glucose-C during repeated DW cycles suggested greater C sequestration by either physical restriction of microbes or chemical sorption of new C that diffused into aggregates. Aggregate stability decreased significantly following 2-3 DW cycles, when glucose-C was not added. Additions of glucose-C with each DW cycle maintained soil aggregate stability equal to the moist but not cycled control throughout the 5 DW cycles of this study. These data simulate the strengthening of soil aggregates in no tillage agroecosystems which provides continuous additions of DOC compounds generated by decomposing plant residues on the soil surface, and root exudates and decomposition, as well as the mineralization of POM materials within nondisturbed soil profiles.

The optimal locations for monitoring wells are determined as the points where maximal decreases are expected in the quantified uncertainty about contaminant existence after well installation. In this study, hydraulic conductivity is considered to be the factor that causes uncertainty. The successive random addition (SRA) method is used to generate random fields of hydraulic conductivity. The expected value of information criterion for the existence of a contaminant plume is evaluated based on how much the uncertainty of plume distribution reduces with increases in the size of the monitoring network. The minimum array of monitoring wells that yields the maximum information is selected as the optimal monitoring network. In order to quantify the uncertainty of the plume distribution, the probability map of contaminant existence is made for all generated contaminant plume realizations on the domain field. The uncertainty is defined as the sum of the areas where the probability of contaminant existence or nonexistence is uncertain.

Silver birch and Scots pine were present in three stands and Norway spruce was present in all stands. For three fertile Norway spruce stands, fine root biomass and number of root Lips per stand area or unit basal area were assessed from north to south. Principal component analysis indicated that short root morphology was significantly affected by tree species and site, which together explained 34.7% of the total variability. The range of variation in mean specific root area (SRA) was 51-74, 60-70 and 84-124 m(2) kg(-1) for Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch, respectively, and the corresponding ranges for specific root length were 37-47, 40-48 and 87-97 m g(-1). The range of variation in root tissue density of Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch was 113-182, 127-158 and 81-156 kg m(-3), respectively. Sensitivity of short root morphology to site conditions decreased in the order: Norway spruce > silver birch > Scots pine. Short root SRA increased with site fertility in all species. In Norway spruce, fine root biomass and number of root tips per m(2) decreased from north to south. The differences in morphological parameters among sites were significant but smaller than the site differences in fine root biomass and number of root tips.","Univ Tartu, Inst Geog, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; Univ Tartu, Inst Mol & Cell Biol, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Ostonen, I (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Geog, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",ivika.ostonen@ut.ee,"Ostonen, Ivika/G-9874-2015; Truu, Jaak/H-1323-2015","Ostonen, Ivika/0000-0001-9043-6083; Truu, Jaak/0000-0003-1818-6678; Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko/0000-0002-3056-7820",,,,31,83,97,0,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2007,27,11,,,,,1627,1634,,10.1093/treephys/27.11.1627,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,230AF,WOS:000250847000013,17669752,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Kumar, P; Hallgren, SW; Enstone, DE; Peterson, CA",,,,"Kumar, Prem; Hallgren, Stephen W.; Enstone, Daryl E.; Peterson, Carol A.",,,Root anatomy of Pinus taeda L.: seasonal and environmental effects on development in seedlings,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,condensed tannin zone; cortical plasmalemma surface area; mycorrhizal roots; passage cells; suberin lamellae,EUCALYPTUS-PILULARIS SM; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PISOLITHUS-TINCTORIUS; FUNGAL SHEATH; BANKSIANA LAMB; WOODY ROOTS; WATER-USE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAE; PERMEABILITY; ABSORPTION,"The environmental and seasonal effects on anatomical traits of Pinus taeda L. seedling roots were studied in the laboratory in three contrasting root growth media and also in typical outdoor nursery culture. Growth media with lower water regimen and high penetration resistance caused a reduction in lengths of the white and condensed tannin (CT) zones and acceleration of development of suberin lamellae in the endodermis. As a possible counter to this reduction in zone lengths, second-order laterals were produced closer to the tips of first-order laterals. This suggested there may be an advantage to producing more shorter roots under stressful conditions. Under outdoor nursery conditions (June to mid-December) the white zone was always a rather small part of the root system surface area (4.5% in December), but it dominated as a provider of cortical plasmalemma surface area (CPSA) in contact with modified soil solution (65% in December) because of its live cortex and capacity to increase nearly three fold the amount of CPSA per unit root length. The CT zone always provided most of the total root surface area (80% in December). Although it had no live cortex, a few cells of the CT zone endodermis remained non-suberized passage cells, perhaps giving this major part of the root system some capacity for ion and water absorption. A late summer increase in CPSA was due largely to the rapid production of mycorrhizae. Root systems were capable of very rapid replacement of roots lost due to undercutting and lateral root pruning. The great variation in CPSA per unit root length contained in the white, mycorrhizal and CT zones suggested a capacity to adapt rapidly to changing conditions.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; Miami Univ, Dept Bot, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Hallgren, SW (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 022 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",steve.hallgren@okstate.edu,"Hallgren, Stephen/A-2131-2013",,,,,48,9,11,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Plant-soil feedbacks occur when plants change soil community composition such that interactions with that soil community in turn may positively or negatively affect the performance of conspecifics. Theories predict and studies show that invasions may be promoted by stronger negative soil feedbacks for native compared with exotic species. We present a counter-example of a successful invader with strong negative soil feedbacks apparently caused by host-specific, pathogenic soil fungi. Using a feedback experiment in pots, we investigated whether the relative strength of plant-soil feedbacks experienced by a non-native woody invader, Sapium sebiferum, differed from several native tree species by examining their performance in soils collected near conspecifics ('home soils') or heterospecifics ('away soils') in the introduced range. Sapium seedlings, but no native seedlings, had lower survival and biomass in its home soils compared with soils of other species ('negative feedback'). To investigate biotic agents potentially responsible for the observed negative feedbacks, we conducted two additional experiments designed to eliminate different soil taxa ('rescue experiments'). We found that soil sterilization (pot experiment) or soil fungicide applications (pot and field experiments) restored Sapium performance in home soil thereby eliminating the negative feedbacks we observed in the original experiment. Such negative feedbacks apparently mediated by soil fungi could have important effects on persistence of this invader by limiting Sapium seedling success in Sapium dominated forests ( home soils) though their weak effects in heterospecific (away) soils suggest a weak role in limiting initial establishment.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Siemann, E (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,,,,,,34,69,73,3,90,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P R SOC B,Proc.

Where oak regeneration occurs, inadequate vertical height and depleted root carbohydrate stores impede the ability of regenerating oaks to respond when light does become available. A variety of silvicultural techniques have been developed to increase the penetration of diffuse light, enhancing the light environment on the forest floor, and thereby increasing the likelihood of regenerating oaks to successfully respond to increased light transmittance. We measured shoot and root characteristics, and root soluble non-structural carbohydrate concentrations of white oak (Q. alba L.) advance regeneration exposed to enhanced light intensities associated with a mid-story removal and a clearcut, and compared white oak regeneration vigor to untreated controls. Root diameter and soluble non-structural carbohydrates increased with increasing light availability. Our data suggest that white oak responds to increases in light transmittance by building below-ground biomass and carbohydrates in the root system prior to an above-ground response. Our study shows that white oak regeneration vigor increases with only modest increases in light. In the absence of other pressures, enhancing the light environment to the forest floor should contribute to successful regeneration of this species. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Forty-three morphospecies of AMF were identified. Among them, 28 were in the genus Glomus, 7 in Acaulospora, 4 in Scutellospora, 2 in Entrophospora and 2 in Gigaspora. The most common and frequent genus was Glomus, and several species of Glomus and Gigaspora were the most common and frequent among the 43 species present in this hot-dry ecosystem. Although Sorenson's coefficient (C-s = 0.83) revealed considerable overlap in AM fungal species composition, AMF community structure varied considerably between the two sites. Non-random associations between AMF and host plants were commonly observed in this study and suggest some degree of host preference at the species level. AMF spore density (SD) was positively correlated with species richness (SR), and both were differed significantly between the undisturbed Pudu River site and the disturbed Xiao River site. We suggest that the hot-dry valley of Jinsha River appeared to harbor a high diversity of AMF with an uneven distribution, and that natural disturbance (mud-rock flow and landslides) is important in determining the diversity, density, and distribution of AMF.

The area irrigated with sewage water in the Mezquital Valley in central Mexico has steadily expanded during the last 100 years, and it provides the opportunity to assess the effects of the practice on the mycorrhiza in particular. We sampled the topsoil of the two main kinds of soil, Vertisol and Leptosol, in fields irrigated for 5, 35, 65 and 95 years in the Valley. We measured the concentrations of zinc, lead, copper and cadmium, all of which appeared to have increased linearly with time. We also determined the abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal morphotypes in the soil both at the time of sampling and after incubation in association with Allium cepa L. in the greenhouse. Spores decreased in abundance with increasing duration of irrigation in the Vertisol, whereas in the Leptosol the numbers after only 5 years of irrigation were small, increased after 35 years of irrigation and decreased again thereafter. In the greenhouse the production of spores and sporocarps was maximal in soil irrigated for between 35 and 65 years, as were the intraradical hyphae, spores and vesicles. Glomus species dominate the morphotypes, and the spores of Glomus mosseae were the most abundant in both soils and after all times. The total root colonization potential seemed unaffected by duration of irrigation, and was substantially greater in the Leptosol than in the Vertisol. However, species of the Glomus genus tend to dominate over other genera as irrigation proceeds, since Glomus species spread not only by spores, but also by roots. We conclude that irrigation with sewage water in the Mezquital Valley is decreasing the mycorrhizas' diversity in the long term, (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Total fine detritus production ranged from 0.69 to 1.21 kg C center dot m(-2 center dot)year(-1) with significant differences among species but with no correlation between litterfall and fine-root growth.

Estimates of root + rhizosphere respiration comprised 52% of total soil respiration on average, and there was no evidence that rhizosphere respiration was associated with fine-root growth rates among species.

Presently, it is uncertain how increasing atmospheric CO2 and O-3 will alter plant N demand and the acquisition of soil N by plants as well as the microbial supply of N from soil organic matter. To address this uncertainty, we initiated an ecosystem-level N-15 tracer experiment at the Rhinelander (Wisconsin, USA) free air CO2-O-3 enrichment (FACE) facility to understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and O-3 alter the distribution and flow of N in developing northern temperate forests. Tracer amounts of (NH4+)-N-15 were applied to the forest floor of developing Populus tremuloides and P. tremuloides - Betula papyrifera communities that have been exposed to factorial CO2 and O-3 treatments for seven years. One year after isotope addition, both forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 obtained greater amounts of N-15 (29%) and N (40%) from soil, despite no change in soil N availability or plant N-use efficiency. As such, elevated CO2 increased the ability of plants to exploit soil for N, through the development of a larger root system. Conversely, elevated O-3 decreased the amount of N-15 (-15%) and N (-29%) in both communities, a response resulting from lower rates of photosynthesis, decreases in growth, and smaller root systems that acquired less soil N. Neither CO2 nor O-3 altered the amount of N or N-15 recovery in the forest floor, microbial biomass, or soil organic matter. Moreover, we observed no interaction between CO2 and O-3 on the amount of N or N-15 in any ecosystem pool, suggesting that O-3 could exert a negative effect regardless of CO2 concentration. In a CO2-enriched atmosphere, greater belowground growth and a more thorough exploitation of soil for growth-limiting N is an important mechanism sustaining the enhancement of NPP in developing forests (0-8 years following establishment). However, as CO2 accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, future O-3 concentrations threaten to diminish the enhancement of plant growth, decrease plant N acquisition, and lessen the storage of anthropogenic C in temperate forests.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",drzak@umich.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,36,34,36,1,47,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2007,88,10,,,,,2630,2639,,10.1890/06-1819.1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228FY,WOS:000250714200023,18027765,,,,10/31/19J,"Daleo, P; Fanjul, E; Casariego, AM; Silliman, BR; Bertness, MD; Iribarne, O",,,,"Daleo, Pedro; Fanjul, Eugenia; Casariego, Agustina Mendez; Silliman, Brian R.; Bertness, Mark D.; Iribarne, Oscar",,,Ecosystem engineers activate mycorrhizal mutualism in salt marshes,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,bioturbation; ecosystem engineers; facilitation; mycorrhizal fungi; salt marshes; soil invertebrates-mycorrhizae interactions,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; SOIL FUNGI; PLANT; CRABS; AVAILABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; ORGANISMS; DIVERSITY; NEIGHBORS,"Theory predicts that ecosystem engineers should have their most dramatic effects when they enable species, through habitat amelioration, to live in zones where physical and biological conditions would otherwise suppress or limit them. Mutualisms between mycorrhizal fungi and plants are key determinants of productivity and biodiversity in most terrestrial systems, but are thought to be unimportant in wetlands because anoxic sediments exclude fungal symbionts. Our field surveys revealed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations on salt marsh plant roots, but only in the presence of crabs that oxygenate soils as a by-product of burrowing. Field experiments demonstrate that fungal colonization is dependent on crab burrowing and responsible for nearly 35% of plant growth. These results highlight ecosystem engineers as ecological linchpins that can activate and maintain key mutualisms between species. Our findings align salt marshes with other important biogenic habitats whose productivity is reliant on mutualisms between the primary foundation species and micro-organisms.","UNMdP, Dept Biol, FCEyN, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Daleo, P (reprint author), UNMdP, Dept Biol, FCEyN, CC 573 Correo Cent,B7600WAG,Mar del Plata,Rivadav, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pdaleo@mdp.edu.ar,"Daleo, Pedro/A-4694-2008","Daleo, Pedro/0000-0001-9759-1203; Silliman, Brian/0000-0001-6360-650X",,,,47,50,51,49,432,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Although allelopathy has been considered as a possible displacing mechanism in P. australis, there has been minimal success in characterizing the responsible allelochemical. We tested the occurrence of root-derived allelopathy in the invasiveness of P. australis. To this end, root exudates of two P. australis genotypes, BB (native) and P38 (an exotic) were tested for phytotoxicity on different plant species. The treatment of the susceptible plants with P. australis root exudates resulted in acute rhizotoxicity. It is interesting to note that the root exudates of P38 were more effective in causing root death in susceptible plants compared to the native BB exudates. The active ingredient in the P. australis exudates was identified as 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid). We tested the phytotoxic efficacy of gallic acid on various plant systems, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Most tested plants succumbed to the gallic acid treatment with the exception of P. australis itself. Mechanistically, gallic acid treatment generated elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the treated plant roots. Furthermore, the triggered ROS mediated the disruption of the root architecture of the susceptible plants by damaging the microtubule assembly. The study also highlights the persistence of the exuded gallic acid in P. australis's rhizosphere and its inhibitory effects against A. thaliana in the soil. In addition, gallic acid demonstrated an inhibitory effect on Spartina alterniflora, one of the salt marsh species it successfully invades.","Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19711 USA; Delaware Biotechnol Inst, Newark, DE 19711 USA; Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Marine & Earth Studies, Lewes, DE 19958 USA","Bais, HP (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19711 USA.",hbais@udel.edu,"Rechsteiner, Cynthia/C-5894-2011",,,,,52,82,93,0,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Oxalate was exuded in far higher amounts than any other organic acid anion, with a maximum rate of 1.7 nmol (mg root DW)(-1) d(-1). Mycorrhizal roots exuded significantly more oxalate than nonmycorrhizal roots. The presence of Al did not enhance oxalate exudation.

The results indicated that mycorrhizal colonization of Scots pine roots substantially influence the archaeal community of pine rhizospheres. Colonization of short roots by most mycorrhizal fungi tested increased both archaeal frequency and diversity. Most of the archaeal sequences encountered in mycorrhizas belonged to the phylum Euryarchaeota, order of Halobacteriales. The difference in archaeal diversity between the mycorrhizospheric compartments and humus was profound.

The diversity of rhizobial genotypes, as characterized by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S-23S rDNA, performed on DNA extracted from 138 nodules resulted in 15 clusters. Results indicated the widespread occurrence of compatible rhizobia associated to A. seyal in various ecogeographic areas. However, the clustering of rhizobial populations based on intergenic spacer (IGS) RFLP profiles did not reflect their geographic origin. Four genera were discriminated on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the strains representative for the IGS-RFLP profiles. The majority of rhizobia associated to A. seyal were affiliated to Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium 64 and 29%, respectively, of the different IGS-RFLP profiles. Our results demonstrate the coexistence inside the nodule of plant-pathogenic non-N-2-fixing Agrobacterium and Burkholderia strains, which induced the formation of ineffective nodules, with symbiotic rhizobia. Nodulation was recorded in saline soils and/or at low pH values or in alkaline soils, suggesting adaptability of natural rhizobial populations to major ecological environmental stress and their ability to establish symbiotic associations within these soil environments. These results contribute to the progressing research efforts to uncover the biodiversity of rhizobia and to improve nitrogen fixation in agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa.","Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dept Biol Vegetale, Dakar, Senegal; UCAD, Ctr Rech Bel Air, IRD ISRA, Lab Commun Microbiol, Dakar, Senegal; World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, CIAT, CIRAD Foret,UPR 80, ETP TSBF, Nairobi, Kenya; USC, UMR 113,IRD,CIRAD,AGRO M,UM2, INRA 1242, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France","Diouf, D (reprint author), Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dept Biol Vegetale, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.",diegane.diouf@ird.sn,"de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008","de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352",,,,60,39,41,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

In most grasslands, herbivory by both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores is common and thus in order to assess herbivore effects on multitrophic-level interactions both should be considered. This study investigated the effects of grazing by rabbit and insect herbivores on root-colonization of grasses by AMF in two lowland grasslands in southern England, UK. A long-term exclosure site was used to provide a temporal assessment in order to elucidate whether any short-term responses to herbivore removal were sustained. Root samples from three grass species at each site were analysed in terms of total mycorrhizal colonization and proportional colonization by individual mycorrhizal structures. Colonization levels were up to 1.6 times greater under moderate levels of rabbit grazing (with summer maxima of 25% and winter minima of 11%) than in intensely grazed swards or fenced plots at both sites. The change was fast (within 8 weeks), consistent throughout the sampled field plots, and temporally sustainable over a 19-year period. There was no significant effect of insect herbivory on total colonization but proportional colonization by different AM structures was affected on some sample dates where vertebrate herbivores had been removed, indicating a slight effect on fungal structure allocation. The results suggest that the type of herbivore and perhaps more importantly the intensity of grazing are key determinants of below-ground effects upon mycorrhizal-host plant symbiosis. The data suggest that the extent of mycorrhizal colonization within grass host plants is strongly influenced by C assimilation and allocation.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Wearn, JA (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",j.a.wearn@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,66,39,47,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2007,153,4,,,,,959,971,,10.1007/s00442-007-0789-9,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,209RZ,WOS:000249407000017,17594116,,,,10/31/19J,"Macdonald, CA; Singh, BK; Peck, JA; van Schaik, AP; Hunter, LC; Horswell, J; Campbell, CD; Speir, TW",,,,"Macdonald, C.

The microbial community structure was evaluated using a combination of multiplex-terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) and T-RFLP fingerprinting approaches. Soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzymatic activities were measured as indicators of soil microbial processes. Changes in the microbial community structure, with Zn additions were evident in all the microbial groups investigated (bacteria, fungi, archaea, actinobacteria and rhizobia/ agrobacteria). The fungal community showed the greatest response to Zn additions compared to the other microbial communities measured. The relative abundance of several fungal terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) significantly increased in high Zn treated treatments, at the expense of others, some of which were lost from T-RFLP profiles completely. These results indicate that metal-spiked sludge application can have long-lasting impacts on the composition of the microbial community in pasture soils. Despite notable changes in community structure there was no significant long-term impact of Zn-spiked sludge applications on microbial respiration, biomass or enzyme activities.

Therefore, a microscale diffusion technique was applied to determine the diffusive mass transfer of 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through water, air, surfactant solutions, humic acid solutions, aqueous soil and horse manure extracts, digestive fluid of a deposit-feeding worm, and root exudates from willow plants. In most cases the diffusive mass transfer of PAHs was much higher through the tested media than through water, and the enhancement factors increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the PAHs. The diffusive flux of benzo[a]pyrene was for instance enhanced 74 times through gut fluid of a deposit-feeding worm when compared to water. These findings demonstrate that a wide variety of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at environmental levels can enhance diffusive mass transfer in various transport scenarios. The diffusive uptake of PAHs into sediment dwelling organisms is particularly efficient within the gut and at direct contract with the sediment matrix. Bioremediation might be enhanced by the addition of auxiliary agents that enhance diffusive mass transfer. Enhanced diffusion needs also to be considered in dynamic transport models and for the operation and calibration of passive sampling techniques.","Univ Aarhus, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Roskilde Univ Ctr, Dept Chem & Life Sci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Tech Univ Denmark, Inst Environm & Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Mayer, P (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Natl Environm Res Inst, POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",phm@dmu.dk,"Mayer, Philipp/D-8474-2011; Trapp, Stefan/G-7159-2011","Mayer, Philipp/0000-0001-5138-7506; Trapp, Stefan/0000-0001-8968-6296",,,,37,97,102,2,99,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

We examined how long this legacy of disturbance constrains forest carbon (C) storage rates by quantifying C pools and fluxes after harvest and fire in a mixed deciduous forest chronosequence in northern lower Michigan, USA. Study plots ranged in age from 6 to 68 years and were created following experimental clear-cut harvesting and fire disturbance. Annual C storage was estimated biometrically from measurements of wood, leaf, fine root, and woody debris mass, mass losses to herbivory, soil C content, and soil respiration. Maximum annual C storage in stands that were disturbed by harvest and fire twice was 26% less than a reference stand receiving the same disturbance only once. The mechanism for this reduction in annual C storage was a long-lasting decrease in site quality that endured over the 62-year timeframe examined. However, during regrowth the harvested and burned forest rapidly became a net C sink, storing 0.53 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) after 6 years. Maximum net ecosystem production (1.35 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and annual C increment (0.95 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were recorded in the 24- and 50-year-old stands, respectively. Net primary production averaged 5.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in experimental stands, increasing by < 10% from 6 to 50 years. Soil heterotrophic respiration was more variable across stand ages, ranging from 3.85 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 6-year-old stand to 4.56 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 68-year-old stand. These results suggest that harvesting and fire disturbances broadly distributed across the region decades ago caused changes in site quality and successional status that continue to limit forest C storage rates.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Pellston, MI 49769 USA","Gough, CM (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",gough.21@osu.edu,,,,,,88,125,133,3,83,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Because elevated atmospheric CO2 does not increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency in many forest tree species, additional N inputs will be required to sustain increased net primary productivity (NPP) under elevated atmospheric CO2. We investigated the importance of free amino acids (AAs) as a source for forest N uptake at the Duke Forest Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site, comparing its importance with that of better-studied inorganic N sources. Potential proteolytic enzyme activity was monitored seasonally, and individual AA concentrations were measured in organic horizon extracts. Potential free AA production in soils ranged from 190 to 690 nmol N g(-1) h(-1) and was greater than potential rates of soil NH4+ production. Because of this high potential rate of organic N production, we determined (1) whether intact AA uptake occurs by Pinus taeda L., the dominant tree species at the FACE site, (2) if the rate of cycling of AAs is comparable with that of ammonium (NH4+), and (3) if atmospheric CO2 concentration alters the aforementioned N cycling processes. A field experiment using universally labeled ammonium ((NH4+)-N-15) and alanine ((C3H7NO2)-C-13-N-15) demonstrated that N-15 is more readily taken up by plants and heterotrophic microorganisms as NH4+. Pine roots and microbes take up on average 2.4 and two times as much NH4+ 15N compared with alanine N-15 1 week after tracer application. N cycling through soil pools was similar for alanine and NH4+, with the greatest N-15 tracer recovery in soil organic matter, followed by microbial biomass, dissolved organic N, extractable NH4+, and fine roots. Stoichiometric analyses of C-13 and N-15 uptake demonstrated that both plants and soil microorganisms take up alanine directly, with a C-13 : N-15 ratio of 3.3 : 1 in fine roots and 1.5 : 1 in microbial biomass. Our results suggest that intact AA (alanine) uptake contributes substantially to plant N uptake in loblolly pine forests. However, we found no evidence supporting increased recovery of free AAs in fine roots under elevated CO2, suggesting plants will need to acquire additional N via other mechanisms, such as increased root exploration or increased N use efficiency.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Hofmockel, KS (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Dana Bldg,Room G450,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",khof@umich.edu,,"Hofmockel, Kirsten/0000-0003-1586-2167",,,,42,29,31,1,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

As a result of global warming, species may spread into previously cool regions. Species that disperse faster than their natural enemies may become released from top-down control. We investigated whether plants originating from southern Europe and recently established in north-western Europe experience less soil pathogen effects than native species. 2. We selected three plant species originating from southern Europe that have immigrated into the Netherlands and three similar native Dutch species. All six plant species were grown in sterilized soils with a soil inoculum collected from the rhizospheres of field populations. As a control we grew a series of all six plant species with a sterilized rhizosphere inoculum. 3. We harvested the plants, added the conditioned soil to sterilized soil and grew a second generation of all six plant species in order to test for each plant pair feedback effects from the conditioned soil communities to conspecifics and heterospecifics. 4. The effect of the soil community is dependent on plant species, and is dependent on soil fertility in only one of the three pairs. 5. Soil conditioning caused less biomass reduction to exotic plant species than to native species, suggesting that exotic immigrants are less exposed to soil pathogens than similar native plant species. 6. Our results suggest that plant species that expand their range as a result of climate change may become released from soil pathogenic activity. Whether the exotics are released from soil pathogens, or whether they experience enhanced benefit from mutualistic symbionts remains to be studied. We conclude that range expansion may result in enemy release patterns that are similar to artificially introduced invasive exotic plant species. 7. The escape from enemies through range shifts changes key biotic interactions and complicates predictions of future distribution and dominance.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; Ctr Terr Ecol, KNAW, NIOO, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Natl Herbarium Nederland Leiden Univ Branch, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","van Grunsven, RHA (reprint author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nat Conservat & Plant Ecol Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",royvangrunsven@gmail.com,"Veenendaal, Elmar/B-4628-2009; van Grunsven, Roy/G-7029-2011; Bezemer, Martijn/A-4068-2009; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van Grunsven, Roy/0000-0001-8873-1024; Bezemer, Martijn/0000-0002-2878-3479; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Veenendaal, Elmar/0000-0001-8230-2501",,,,64,92,92,2,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The importance of plant-soil interactions in land reclamation, and the management and restoration of functioning native ecosystems, is becoming widely recognized. However, relatively little is known about broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in wild plant-soil symbiotic interactions. 2. The current study is part of a larger project examining patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in host and symbiont populations across their geographical ranges using two widespread native Australian Acacia spp. (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and associated populations of rhizobial bacteria. 3. A total of 58 sites were characterized with regard to symbiont population sizes, soil chemistry and environmental parameters. Rhizobial abundance was negatively correlated with a small number of soil factors, including nitrogen, and positively correlated with organic carbon and cation exchange capacity. 4. There were clear differences between host species in seedling growth responses in glasshouse trials using pots inoculated with native soils. While A. salicina grew equally well with soils from A. stenophylla and A. salicina sites, A. stenophylla grew best when inoculated with its own soils, indicating broad-scale adaptation to its own rhizobia. 5. Rhizobial abundance in these soils was also strongly correlated to variation in nodulation and host growth, indicating that abundance may be a good indicator of the relative effectiveness of rhizobial populations. 6. The clear differences in specificity and effectiveness of host-symbiont associations, even among related species, suggests that better knowledge of these systems at multiple spatial scales is central to understanding the factors that influence the ecology and evolution of plant and soil communities, and has potential to increase the cost-effectiveness of restoration programs.","CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Thrall, PH (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",peter.thrall@csiro.au,"Broadhurst, Linda/J-6907-2012","Broadhurst, Linda/0000-0002-9853-3328",,,,54,41,41,1,20,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Rising sea level will cause changes in the hydro-period. surface water salinity and salt-water intrusion in coastal areas. which will reduce the distribution of forests in these areas. We studied the dynamics of a Pterocarpus officinalis stand in Puerto Rico over a 9-y period. We observed differences in plant growth, recruitment and mortality across a salinity gradient within a 1-ha plot. In areas of high salinity. recruitment, juvenile density and growth rates of juveniles and adults were lower. The detrimental effect of salinity was also observed in a growth experiment: seedlings in 5%o and 10%o salinity treatments had higher mortality, slower growth and less above- and below-ground biomass than control seedlings (0%o). In addition. an increase from 0 to 1%o in salinity resulted in approximately 50% less nodulation in seedlings. Low recruitment in high salinity areas and lack of recruitment in adjacent grasslands will further reduce the distribution of this forest type. Although some ecosystems can respond to changing conditions by migration to more favourable areas. this is not the case with P. officinalis. and thus, restoration efforts are needed to re-establish this species where it occurred historically.","Univ Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Rivera-Ocasio, E (reprint author), Univ Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR 00931 USA.",elsierivecra@yahoo.com,,,,,,37,10,11,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

Root litter is an important input to SOC pools, although little is known about fine root demography in tussock tundra. In this study, we examined the response of fine root production and live standing fine root biomass to short- and long-term fertilization, as changes in fine root demography may contribute to observed declines in SOC. Live standing fine root biomass increased with long-term fertilization, while fine root production declined, reflecting replacement of the annual fine root system of Eriophorum vaginatum, with the long-lived fine roots of Betula nana. Fine root production increased in fertilized plots during an unusually warm growing season, but remained unchanged in control plots, consistent with observations that B. nana shows a positive response to climate warming. Calculations based on a few simple assumptions suggest changes in fine root demography with long-term fertilization and species replacement could account for between 20 and 39% of the observed declines in SOC stocks.","Univ Alaska, Environm & Nat Resources Inst, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; Univ Alaska, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 AQH, Scotland; Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Biol, Allendale, MI 49401 USA; Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Sullivan, PF (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Environm & Nat Resources Inst, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",paddy@uaa.alaska.edu,"Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013",,,,,51,63,65,0,72,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2007,153,3,,,,,643,652,,10.1007/s00442-007-0753-8,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,201DP,WOS:000248812000016,17497180,,,,10/31/19J,"Stobrawa, K; Lorenc-Plucinska, G",,,,"Stobrawa, Krzysztof; Lorenc-Plucinska, Gabriela",,,Changes in antioxidant enzyme activity in the fine roots of black poplar (Populus nigra L.) and cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsch) in a heavy-metal-polluted environment,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,heavy metals; copper works; antioxidant enzymes; fine roots; Populus nigra; Populus deltoides,SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; CARBOHYDRATE-METABOLISM; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COPPER SMELTER; PLANTS; CADMIUM; RESPONSES; DAMAGE; TREES,"The effect of heavy metal deposition onto soil from a copper smelter on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity in the fine roots of two poplars (Populus nigra L. and Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsch) was analyzed.

In both analyzed species, heavy metals stimulated the overproduction of free radicals in fine roots (measured as malondialdehyde level), which was directly proportional to advancing senescence.

Water and nitrogen were added in a factorial design to plots and root exclusion tubes and netting were used to isolate root and shoot competition on two focal species (Artemisia firigida and Chenopodium leptophyllum). Both water and nitrogen were limiting to plant growth, and focal plant survival rates increased with nitrogen but not water addition. Relative allocation to root biomass increased with water addition. Competition was almost entirely belowground, with focal plants larger when released from root but not shoot competition. There were no significant relationships between productivity and root, shoot, or total competition intensity, likely because in this system shoot biomass was too low to cause strong shoot competition and root biomass was above the levels at which root competition saturates. Water addition had few effects on the intensity of root competition suggesting that root competition intensity is invariant along soil moisture gradients. Contrary to general expectation, the strength of root competition increased with nitrogen addition demonstrating that the relationship between root competition intensity and nitrogen is more complex than a simple monotonic decline as nitrogen increases. Finally, there were few interactions between nitrogen and water affecting competition. Together these results indicate that the mechanisms of competition for water and nitrogen likely differ.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Lamb, EG (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol, CW405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",elamb@ualberta.ca,"Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015; Lamb, Eric G/D-9319-2011","Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516; Lamb, Eric G/0000-0001-5201-4541",,,,60,45,48,1,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,SEP,2007,192,1,,,,,21,33,,10.1007/s11258-006-9222-4,,,13,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,206SV,WOS:000249204100002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dijkstra, FA; Cheng, WX",,,,"Dijkstra, Feike A.; Cheng, Weixin",,,Moisture modulates rhizosphere effects on C decomposition in two different soil types,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,continuous C-13 labeling; decomposition; diffusion; plant species; priming; rhizosphere effects; root exudates; soil moisture; soil organic matter; soil texture,ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; AGGREGATE STABILITY; LIVING ROOTS; ELEVATED CO2; PLANT-ROOTS; NITROGEN; MINERALIZATION; COMPETITION,"While it is well known that soil moisture directly affects microbial activity and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, it is unclear if the presence of plants alters these effects through rhizosphere processes. We studied soil moisture effects on SOM decomposition with and without sunflower and soybean. Plants were grown in two different soil types with soil moisture contents of 45% and 85% of field capacity in a greenhouse experiment. We continuously labeled plants with depleted C-13, which allowed us to separate plant-derived CO2-C from original soil-derived CO2-C in soil respiration measurements. We observed an overall increase in soil-derived CO2-C efflux in the presence of plants (priming effect) in both soils. On average a greater priming effect was found in the high soil moisture treatment (up to 76% increase in soil-derived CO2-C compared to control) than in the low soil moisture treatment (up to 52% increase). Greater plant-derived CO2-C and plant biomass in the high soil moisture treatment contributed to greater priming effects, but priming effects remained significantly higher in the high moisture treatment than in the low moisture treatment after correcting for the effects of plant-derived CO2-C and plant biomass. The response to soil moisture particularly occurred in the sandy loam soil by the end of the experiment. Possibly, production of root exudates increased with increased soil moisture content. Root exudation of labile C may also have become more effective in stimulating microbial decomposition in the higher soil moisture treatment and sandy loam soil. Our results indicate that moisture conditions significantly modulate rhizosphere effects on SOM decomposition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

P. Beauv., hereafter referred to as bluejoint] is poorly understood. Bluejoint is a widespread grass species in boreal forests and competes with tree species such as white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] for belowground resources (e.g., soil N and water) when their supply is limited. In this green house-based study, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) bluejoint competition reduces white spruce growth when belowground resource availabilities are limited; (ii) greater N and water availabilities may increase bluejoint competition and its adverse effects on white spruce growth; and (iii) white spruce foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 are affected by soil N and water availabilities and bluejoint competition. A 2 x 2 x 2 (competition x N availability x water availability) factorial experiment was conducted using pots of planted white spruce seedlings with or without bluejoint. Bluejoint competition reduced the volume index (diameter(2) x height) of white spruce by 50%. The competitiveness of bluejoint appeared to be independent of resource availabilities, but bluejoint had greater growth response to increased N availability than white spruce. Bluejoint competition depleted white spruce foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 by 1.2 and 1.2%o, respectively, even under adequate water supply, indicating that N deficiency caused by bluejoint competition had a C-13 discrimination during photosynthesis) compared with the potential effect of drought stress on foliar delta C-13, and that strong NH4 uptake by bluejoint may have prevented significant soil N losses and N-15 enrichment through nitrification and subsequent denitrification.","Univ Alberta, Dep Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dep Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Chang, SX (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dep Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",scott.chang@ualberta.ca,"Chang, Scott X/G-2029-2011","Chang, Scott/0000-0002-7624-439X",,,,40,16,16,1,20,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

To investigate whether N(2) fixation by A. mearnsii could account for the mixed-species growth responses, we assessed N(2) fixation by the accretion method and the 15 N natural abundance method. Nitrogen gained by E. globulus and A. mearnsii mixtures and monocultures was calculated by the accretion method with plant and soil samples collected 10 years after plantation establishment. Nitrogen in biomass and soil confirmed that A. meamsii influenced N dynamics. Assuming that the differences in soil, forest floor litter and biomass N of plots containing A. mearnsii compared with E. globulus monocultures were due to N(2) fixation, the 10-year annual mean rates of N(2) fixation were 38 and 86 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in 1: 1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures, respectively. Nitrogen fixation by A. mearnsii could not be quantified on the basis of the natural abundance of 15 N because such factors as mycorrhization type and fractionation of N isotopes during N cycling within the plant confounded the effect of the N source on the N isotopic signature of plants. This study shows that A. mearnsii fixed significant quantities of N(2) when mixed with E. globulus. A decline in delta(15)N values of E. globulus and A. mearnsii with time, from 2 to 10 years, is further evidence that N(2) was fixed and cycled through the stands. The increased aboveground biomass production of E. globutus trees in mixtures when compared with monocultures can be attributed to increases in N availability.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Resources Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Cooperat Res Ctr Greenhouse Accounting, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Sch Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Ecosyst Dynam Grp, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Management, Churchlands, WA 6027, Australia; Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; NSW Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia","Forrester, DI (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Resources Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",davidif@unhnelb.edu.au,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013; Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013; Stock, William/B-8858-2008","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986; Stock, William/0000-0003-2475-2963",,,,59,39,41,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,2007,27,9,,,,,1319,1328,,10.1093/treephys/27.9.1319,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,213PG,WOS:000249679000010,17545131,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Heath, KD; Tiffin, P",,,,"Heath, Katy D.; Tiffin, Peter",,,Context dependence in the coevolution of plant and rhizobial mutualists,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,genotype by environment; coevolution; cheating; symbiosis; cooperation; partner choice,MEDICAGO-TRUNCATULA; BRADYRHIZOBIUM MUTUALISM; SINORHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENCE; NITROGEN-FIXATION; PARTNER CHOICE; LEGUME; EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; SANCTIONS,"Several mechanisms are expected to rapidly rid mutualisms of genetic variation in partner quality. Variation for mutualist quality, however, appears to be widespread. We used a model legume-rhizobium mutualism to test for evidence that context-dependent selection may maintain variation in partner quality. In a greenhouse experiment using 10 natural populations of Medicago truncatula and two strains of Sinorhizobium medicae, we detected significant genotype x genotype (GxG) interactions for plant fitness, indicating that the most beneficial rhizobium strain depends on the host genotype. In a second experiment using a subset of the plant populations used in the first experiment, we detected significant GxG interactions for both plant and rhizobium fitness. Moreover, the plant population with which rhizobium strains gained the greatest benefit depended on the nitrogen environment. Finally, we found that in a high nitrogen environment, all plant populations had lower fitness when inoculated with a 1 : 1 mixture of strains than with the worse single strain alone, suggesting that nitrogen shifts the exchange of benefits in favour of rhizobia. Our data suggest that genotype, nitrogen and biotic dependency might contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in mutualist quality when coupled with spatial or temporal heterogeneity in the environment.","Univ Minnesota, Biol Sci Ctr 250, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Heath, KD (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Biol Sci Ctr 250, Dept Plant Biol, 1445 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",heat0059@umn.edu,,,,,,42,135,136,3,76,ROYAL SOCIETY,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P R SOC B,Proc.

Both soils were amended with Cd- or Zn-enriched sewage sludge, to produce soils with total Cd concentrations at four times (12 mg Cd g(-1) soil), and total Zn concentrations (300 mg Zn kg(-1) soil) at the EU upper permitted limit. The additive effects of Cd plus Zn at these soil concentrations were also investigated. There were no significant differences in microbial biomass C (B-C), biomass ninhydrin N (BN), ATP, or microbial respiration between the different treatments. Microbial metabolic quotient (defined as qCO(2)= units of CO2-C evolved unit(-1) biomass C unit(-1) time) also did not differ significantly between treatments. However, the microbial maintenance energy (in this study defined as qCO(2)-to-mu ratio value, where mu is the growth rate) indicated that more energy was required for microbial synthesis in metal-rich sludge-treated soils (especially Zn) than in control sludge-treated soils. Indigenous R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii numbers were not significantly different between untreated and sludge-treated grassland soils after 24 weeks regardless of metal or metal concentrations. However, rhizobial numbers in the arable soils treated with metal-contaminated sludges decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared to the untreated control and uncontaminated sludge-treated soils after 24 weeks. The order of decreasing toxicity to rhizobia in the arable soils was Zn > Cd > Cd+Zn.","Agriculture & Environm Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Chaudri, AM (reprint author), Agriculture & Environm Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",amar.chaudri@bbsrc.ac.uk,,"NANNIPIERI, PAOLO/0000-0002-5488-2593",,,,31,27,27,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Overall, it was estimated that there was 63.45 kg N ha(-1) fixed N accumulated in red alder trees, and the rate of N fixation was estimated at 30.95 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the silvopasture treatment. The total amount of N that could potentially be added to the soil in the silvopasture treatment as a result of decomposition of senescent leaves, roots, and dead nodules was estimated at 40.56 kg ha(-1) year(-1).

To better understand this phenomenon, we subjected 16 fire-excluded (ca. 40 years since fire) 10 ha longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) stands to one of four replicated burning treatments based on volumetric duff moisture content (VDMC): wet (115% VDMQ; moist (85% VDMQ; dry (55% VDMQ; and a no-burn control. During the first 2 years postfire, overstory pines in the dry burns suffered the greatest mortality (mean 20.5%); pine mortality in the wet and moist treatments did not differ from the control treatment. Duff reduction was greatest in the dry burns (mean 46.5%), with minimal reduction in the moist and wet burns (14.5% and 5%, respectively). Nested logistic regression using trees from all treatments revealed that the best predictors of individual pine mortality were duff consumption and crown scorch (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.34). Crown scorch was significant only in dry burns, whereas duff consumption was significant across all treatments. Duff consumption was related to moisture content in lower duff (Oa; R-2 = 0.78, P < 0.001). Restoring fire to long-unburned forests will require development of burn prescriptions that include the effects of duff consumption, an often overlooked fire effect.","Humboldt State Univ, Dept Forestry & Watershed Management, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; Eglin Air Force Base, Niceville, FL 32570 USA; Pacific Wildland Fire Sci Lab, USDA Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; Nature Conservancy, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Bot, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL USA; USDA Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; JW Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 31770 USA","Varner, JM (reprint author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Forestry & Watershed Management, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",jmvarner@humboldt.edu,,,,,,60,56,57,1,22,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Three experiments were carried out in a controlled environment to elucidate the reasons for the failure and to develop possible cultivation strategies. In experiment I, T alpinum was grown in an autochthonous soil from the Alps (high elevation) and in two allochthonous soils, a grassland soil from the Hercynian mountains (medium elevation), and an arable soil (low elevation), in which the seed propagation of T. alpinum had failed previously The two allochthonous soils had lower contents of soil organic C and ergosterol, an indicator for fungal biomass, than the autochthonous high-elevation soil, but higher levels of exchangeable Ca and extractable P. Plants grown in the allochthonous soils achieved higher biomass and total N amounts per plant than those from the high elevation soil if inoculated with this autochthonous material to establish rhizobial infection. in the allochthonous high elevation soil, the growth of T alpinum was P-limited as shown in experiment II. In experiment I, plants grown in the low elevation soil had a lower biomass and smaller number of active leaves at 120 days after emergence than those grown on the medium elevation soil. This difference can be explained by strong colonization with the phytophagous nematode Pratylenchus sp., as demonstrated in experiment III by comparing plant growth either in untreated or in autoclaved low-elevation soil. Successful propagation of T alpinum at low elevation may be achieved through suitable inoculation with autochthonous soil biota, especially Rhizobia, and avoidance of soils infested by Pratylenchus species by choosing sites with acidic soil and ensuring adequate P-availability.

We examined patterns of fine root production, aboveground litterfall, and forest floor accumulation during forest primary succession at the Mt. Shasta Mudflows ecosystem chronosequence. Fine root production was measured using the root ingrowth cores method over 1 year, and aboveground litterfall was collected over 2 years. Fine root production increased significantly with ecosystem age, but only the youngest ecosystem was significantly different from all of the older ecosystems. Root production was 44.5 +/- 13.3, 168.3 +/- 20.6, 190.5 +/- 33.8, and 236.3 +/- 65.4 g m(-2) y(-1) in the 77, 255, 616, and > 850-year-old ecosystems, respectively. Generally, aboveground litterfall and forest floor accumulation did not follow the same pattern as root production. The relative contribution of fine root production to total fine detrital production increased significantly with ecosystem age, from 14 to 49%, but only the youngest ecosystem was significantly different from all of the older ecosystems. Fine root production was significantly correlated with some measures of soil fertility but was not correlated with leaf or total litterfall, or forest floor accumulation. It was best predicted by soil N concentration alone, but this relationship may not be causal, as soil N concentration was also correlated with ecosystem age. For the oldest ecosystem, fine root production was also measured using the sequential intact cores/compartment-flow model method, and the difference between the two estimates was not significant. Our study suggests that the relative contribution of fine roots to fine detrital production, and hence to soil organic matter accumulation, may increase during forest primary succession.","Univ Nevada, Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol Program, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Univ Nevada, Nat Resources & Environmental Sci Dept, Reno, NV 89557 USA; USDA ARS, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, Reno, NV 89512 USA; Synergy Resource Solut Inc, Belgrade, MT 59714 USA","Uselman, SM (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol Program, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",uselman@unr.nevada.edu,,,,,,52,17,18,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,AUG,2007,10,5,,,,,703,717,,10.1007/s10021-007-9045-8,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,217TC,WOS:000249969200003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kozdroj, J; Piotrowska-Seget, Z; Krupa, P",,,,"Kozdroj, Jacek; Piotrowska-Seget, Zofia; Krupa, Piotr",,,Mycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhiza associated bacteria isolated from an industrial desert soil protect pine seedlings against Cd(II) impact,ECOTOXICOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhizae; associated bacteria; pine inoculation; cadmium accumulation,HELPER PSEUDOMONAS-FLUORESCENS; COLONIZATION PATTERNS; SYLVESTRIS SEEDLINGS; LACCARIA-BICOLOR; BREVIBACILLUS SP; HEAVY-METALS; TOXICITY; CADMIUM; INOCULATION; TOLERANCE,"Effects of mycorrhization with Amanita rubescens or Hebeloma sinapizans and dual inoculation with the fungi and ectomycorrhiza associated bacteria (EMAB) Pseudomonas putida or Bacillus cereus on seedling growth and accumulation of Cd(II) in Pinus sylvestris were studied. Both fungal and bacterial species were isolated from roots of pines growing in an industrial area polluted with high concentrations of heavy metals. During mycorrhization, A. rubescens colonized higher number of pine seedlings than H. sinapizans, especially when EMAB were co-inoculated. In addition, the seedling biometric characteristics (i.e. root and shoot lengths and biomass) were stimulated by treatment with the fungal species alone and dual inoculation with the fungi and EMAB. Amanita rubescens was more efficient in this stimulation than H. sinapizans. The increased growth of pine seedlings was especially seen for co-inoculation with P. putida. Furthermore, elevated accumulation of Cd(II), ranging from 56 mu g g(-1) to 72 mu g g(-1) dry weight, in underground parts of the inoculated seedlings was found. The seedlings treated with A. rubescens accumulated higher concentrations of the metal than those inoculated with H. sinapizans. Additional treatment of pine seedlings with P. putida resulted in the higher accumulation of Cd(II) in the roots as compared with those inoculated with B. cereus. The results suggest that the growth of pine seedlings in Cd(II)-polluted soil may depend on fungal species forming ectomycorrhizae, species-specific co-inoculation with EMAB and specificity of fungal-EMAB interactions.","Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Microbiol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; Univ Silesia, Dept Microbiol, PL-40032 Katowice, Poland; Jan Dlugosz Univ, Inst Chem & Environm Protect, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland","Kozdroj, J (reprint author), Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Microbiol, Mickiewicza 24-28, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",jkozdroj@ar.krakow.pl,"Kozdroj, Jacek/J-6984-2016","Kozdroj, Jacek/0000-0003-2976-8331; Piotrowska-Seget, Zofia/0000-0002-9039-2268",,,,45,32,37,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,AUG,2007,16,6,,,,,449,456,,10.1007/s10646-007-0149-x,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,189PI,WOS:000248000600003,17541824,,,,10/31/19J,"Maron, JL; Elmendorf, SC; Vila, M",,,,"Maron, John L.; Elmendorf, Sarah C.; Vila, Montserrat",,,Contrasting plant physiological adaptation to climate in the native and introduced range of Hypericum perforatum,EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,common gardens; exotic plants; Hypericum perforatum; latitudinal clines; phenotypic plasticity; rapid evolution,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; LATITUDINAL POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; RAPID EVOLUTION; LIFE-HISTORY; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; DIFFERING SELECTION; WATER AVAILABILITY; LOCAL ADAPTATION,"How introduced plants, which may be locally adapted to specific climatic conditions in their native range, cope with the new abiotic conditions that they encounter as exotics is not well understood. In particular, it is unclear what role plasticity versus adaptive evolution plays in enabling exotics to persist under new environmental circumstances in the introduced range. We determined the extent to which native and introduced populations of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) are genetically differentiated with respect to leaf-level morphological and physiological traits that allow plants to tolerate different climatic conditions. In common gardens in Washington and Spain, and in a greenhouse, we examined clinal variation in percent leaf nitrogen and carbon, leaf delta C-13 values (as an integrative measure of water use efficiency), specific leaf area (SLA), root and shoot biomass, root/shoot ratio, total leaf area, and leaf area ratio (LAR). As well, we determined whether native European H. perforatum experienced directional selection on leaf-level traits in the introduced range and we compared, across gardens, levels of plasticity in these traits. In field gardens in both Washington and Spain, native populations formed latitudinal clines in percent leaf N. In the greenhouse, native populations formed latitudinal clines in root and shoot biomass and total leaf area, and in the Washington garden only, native populations also exhibited latitudinal clines in percent leaf C and leaf delta C-13. Traits that failed to show consistent latitudinal clines instead exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity. Introduced St. John's Wort populations also formed significant or marginally significant latitudinal clines in percent leaf N in Washington and Spain, percent leaf C in Washington, and in root biomass and total leaf area in the greenhouse. In the Washington common garden, there was strong directional selection among European populations for higher percent leaf N and leaf delta C-13, but no selection on any other measured trait. The presence of convergent, genetically based latitudinal clines between native and introduced H. perforatum, together with previously published molecular data, suggest that native and exotic genotypes have independently adapted to a broad-scale variation in climate that varies with latitude.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Anim Biol Plant Biol & Ecol, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","Maron, JL (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu; scelmendorf@.ucdavis.edu; montse.vila@ebd.csic.es,"Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013","Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261",,,,64,87,92,0,55,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,2007,61,8,,,,,1912,1924,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00153.x,,,13,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,198AV,WOS:000248600300011,17683433,,,,10/31/19J,"Zou, J; Rogers, WE; Siemann, E",,,,"Zou, J.; Rogers, W.

We tested the hypothesis that genetic shifts in morphological and physiological traits have occurred between native and invasive populations of Sapium sebiferum. 2. Sapium sebiferum seedlings were grown in a greenhouse using seed collected from four populations of its introduced range (US) and four from native Chinese populations that are thought to be genetic candidates of the introduced populations. We examined plant biomass production, relative growth rate (RGR), relative stem height growth rate (RHR), root : shoot ratio (RSR), total number of leaves (TLN) and leaf area (TLA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net CO2 assimilation (A) and shoot specific respiration rate (R-D). 3. US populations of S. sebiferum differed from Chinese populations for most plant variables. Final shoot and total biomass, as well as, RGRs of invasive (US) populations were significantly greater than those of native (Chinese) populations, although RHR and TLN per seedling did not differ between them. Root : shoot ratios (RSR) were significantly lower, while leaf traits including TLA, LAR and SLA were generally greater for invasive populations compared to native populations. Net CO2 A was significantly higher for invasive populations than for native populations, but no significant difference in R-D was found between two population types. 4. Of 13 measured plant variables, RSRs, TLA and CO2 A were identified as traits that contributed the most to differences observed between native Chinese and invasive US populations. The suite of morphological and physiological traits functioning together may result in different growth strategies for native versus invasive populations. By virtue of these traits, invasive populations of S. sebiferum may use soil resources and light more efficiently than native populations, which may have given rise to their competitive superiority in the introduced range.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Zou, J (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",jwzou@rice.edu,"ZOU, JIANWEN/B-3059-2012",,,,,64,69,77,2,47,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, the response of carbon sequestration in forests to global climate change remains a major uncertainty, with a particularly poor understanding of the origins and environmental responses of soil CO2 efflux. For example, despite their large biomass, the contribution of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to forest soil CO2 efflux and responses to changes in environmental drivers has, to date, not been quantified in the field. Their activity is often simplistically included in the 'autotrophic' root respiration term. We set up a multiplexed continuous soil respiration measurement system in a young Lodgepole pine forest, using a mycorrhizal mesh collar design, to monitor the three main soil CO2 efflux components: root, extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal, and soil heterotrophic respiration. Mycorrhizal hyphal respiration increased during the first month after collar insertion and thereafter remained remarkably stable. During autumn the soil CO2 flux components could be divided into similar to 60% soil heterotrophic, similar to 25% EM hyphal, and similar to 15% root fluxes. Thus the extraradical EM mycelium can contribute substantially more to soil CO2 flux than do roots. While EM hyphal respiration responded strongly to reductions in soil moisture and appeared to be highly dependent on assimilate supply, it did not responded directly to changes in soil temperature. It was mainly the soil heterotrophic flux component that caused the commonly observed exponential relationship with temperature. Our results strongly suggest that accurate modelling of soil respiration, particularly in forest ecosystems, needs to explicitly consider the mycorrhizal mycelium and its dynamic response to specific environmental factors. Moreover, we propose that in forest ecosystems the mycorrhizal CO2 flux component represents an overflow 'CO2 tap' through which surplus plant carbon may be returned directly to the atmosphere, thus limiting expected carbon sequestration from trees under elevated CO2.","Univ York, Dept Biol, Stockholm Environm Inst, SEI York Ctr, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Biometr Survey & Stat Div, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; Univ Jaen, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Jaen 23071, Spain","Heinemeyer, A (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, Stockholm Environm Inst, SEI York Ctr, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ah126@york.ac.uk,"Hartley, Iain P/J-7892-2016; CARREIRA, JOSE A./A-7484-2011","Hartley, Iain P/0000-0002-9183-6617; CARREIRA, JOSE A./0000-0002-5995-076X; Heinemeyer, Andreas/0000-0003-3151-2466",,,,55,155,161,2,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Currently, there is no information available on whether these past mining disturbances have affected the distribution, diversity, and survival of beneficial soil microorganisms in the sand dunes of the island. This in turn could deleteriously affect the success of the natural regeneration, plant growth, and establishment on the sand dunes. To support ongoing restoration efforts at sites like these mesophilic actinomycetes were isolated using conventional techniques, with particular emphasis on the taxa previously reported to produce plant-growth-promoting substances and providing support to mycorrhizal fungi, were studied at disturbed sites and compared with natural sites. In the natural sites, foredunes contained higher densities of micromonosporae replaced by increasing numbers of streptomycete species in the successional dune and finally leading to complex actinomycete communities in the mature hind dunes. Whereas in the disturbed zones affected by previous mining activities, which are currently being rehabilitated, no culturable actinomycete communities were detected. These findings suggest that the paucity of beneficial microflora in the rehabilitated sand dunes may be limiting the successful colonization by pioneer plant species. Failure to establish a cover of plant species would result in the mature hind dune plants being exposed to harsh salt and climatic conditions. This could exacerbate the incidence of wind erosion, resulting in the destabilization of well-defined and vegetated successional dunal zones.","Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth & Educ, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; Alcan Engn Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Kurtboke, DI (reprint author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth & Educ, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",ikurtbok@usc.edu.au,,,,,,37,8,8,2,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

To determine if C-13 discrimination during respiration could contribute to this pattern, we compared delta C-13 signatures of respired CO2 from sieved mineral soil, litter layer and litterfall with measurements of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of mineral soil, litter layer, litterfall, roots and fungal mycelia sampled from a 68-year-old Norway spruce forest stand planted on previously cultivated land. Because the land was subjected to ploughing before establishment of the forest stand, shifts in delta C-13 in the top 20 cm reflect processes that have been active since the beginning of the reforestation process. As C-13-depleted organic matter accumulated in the upper soil, a 1.0 parts per thousand delta C-13 gradient from -28.5 parts per thousand in the litter layer to -27.6 parts per thousand at a depth of 2-6 cm was formed. This can be explained by the 1 parts per thousand drop in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 since the beginning of reforestation together with the mixing of new C (forest) and old C (farmland). However, the isotopic change of the atmospheric CO2 explains only a portion of the additional 1.0 parts per thousand increase in delta C-13 below a depth of 20 cm. The delta C-13 of the respired CO2 was similar to that of the organic matter in the upper soil layers but became increasingly C-13 enriched with depth, up to 2.5 parts per thousand relative to the organic matter. We hypothesise that this C-13 enrichment of the CO2 as well as the residual increase in delta C-13 of the organic matter below a soil depth of 20 cm results from the increased contribution of C-13-enriched microbially derived C with depth. Our results suggest that C-13 discrimination during microbial respiration does not contribute to the C-13 enrichment of organic matter in soils. We therefore recommend that these results should be taken into consideration when natural variations in delta C-13 of respired CO2 are used to separate different components of soil respiration or ecosystem respiration.","Univ Orebro, Dept Nat Sci, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden","Bostrom, B (reprint author), Univ Orebro, Dept Nat Sci, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden.",Bjorn.Bostrom@nat.oru.se,,,,,,50,158,161,5,131,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2007,153,1,,,,,89,98,,10.1007/s00442-007-0700-8,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192AJ,WOS:000248172800010,17401582,,,,10/31/19J,"Nippert, JB; Knapp, AK",,,,"Nippert, Jesse B.; Knapp, Alan K.",,,Linking water uptake with rooting patterns in grassland species,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,C-3 plants; C-4 plants; stable oxygen isotope ratio; tallgrass prairie; mixing model,TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; TOPOGRAPHIC POSITION; DELTA-O-18 VALUES; STABLE-ISOTOPES; C-4 GRASS; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; NITROGEN; PLANTS; DEPTH,"Water availability strongly governs grassland primary productivity, yet this resource varies dramatically in time (seasonally) and space (with soil depth and topography). It has long been assumed that co-occurring species differ in their partitioning of water use by depth, but direct evidence is lacking. We report data from two growing seasons (2004-2005) in which we measured the isotopic signature of plant xylem water from seven species (including C-3 forbs and shrubs and C-4 grasses) growing along a topographic gradient at the Konza Prairie Biological Station. Plant xylem stable oxygen isotope ratio (6 180) values were compared to soil water 6180 profiles, recent rainfall events, and groundwater. Species varied in both their temporal patterns of water use and their responses to seasonal droughts in both years. During wet periods, species differences in water use were minimal, with common dependency on recent rainfall events stored in the upper soil layers. However, during dry periods, Most C-3 species used proportionally more water from deeper portions of the soil profile relative to the C-4 grasses. Plants in uplands used more shallow soil water compared to those in lowlands, with the greatest differences across the topographic gradient occurring during dry periods. While the documented vertical root distribution varies by species and growth form in this grassland, each of the species we measured appeared to compete for the same surface layer soil moisture when water was not limiting. Thus, our results suggest that variation in precipitation history and landscape positions are greater determinants of water-use patterns than would be expected based on absolute rooting depth.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Nippert, JB (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gostate@ku.edu,"Knapp, Alan/A-2931-2008","Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",,,,44,91,96,6,102,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2007,153,2,,,,,261,272,,10.1007/s00442-007-0745-8,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,205YD,WOS:000249150200006,17479294,,,,10/31/19J,"Nilsson, LO; Baath, E; Falkengren-Grerup, U; Wallander, H",,,,"Nilsson, Lars Ola; Baath, Erland; Falkengren-Grerup, Ursula; Wallander, Hakan",,,Growth of ectomycorrhizal mycelia and composition of soil microbial communities in oak forest soils along a nitrogen deposition gradient,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,nitrogen deposition; deciduous forests; mycorrhizal fungi; mycelia; nitrate leaching,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; DECIDUOUS FORESTS; EXTERNAL MYCELIUM; BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS; FIELD; PH; CARBON; AVAILABILITY,"Deciduous forests may respond differently from coniferous forests to the anthropogenic deposition of nitrogen (N). Since fungi, especially ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, are known to be negatively affected by N deposition, the effects of N deposition on the soil microbial community, total fungal biomass and mycelial growth of EM fungi were studied in oak-dominated deciduous forests along a nitrogen deposition gradient in southern Sweden. In-growth mesh bags were used to estimate the production of mycelia by EM fungi in 19 oak stands in the N deposition gradient, and the results were compared with nitrate leaching data obtained previously. Soil samples from 154 oak forest sites were analysed regarding the content of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Thirty PLFAs associated with microbes were analysed and the PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9 was used as an indicator to estimate the total fungal biomass. Higher N deposition (20 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) compared with 10 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) tended to reduce EM mycelial growth. The total soil fungal biomass was not affected by N deposition or soil pH, while the PLFA 16:1 omega 5, a biomarker for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, was negatively affected by N deposition, but also positively correlated to soil pH. Other PLFAs positively affected by soil pH were, e.g., i14:0, a15:0, 16:1 omega 9, a17:0 and 18:1 omega 7, while some were negatively affected by pH, such as i15:0, 16:1 omega 7t, 10Me17:0 and cy 19:0. In addition, N deposition had an effect on the PLFAs 16: 1 omega 7c and 16:1 omega 9 (negatively) and cy 19:0 (positively). The production of EM mycelia is probably more sensitive to N deposition than total fungal biomass according to the fungal biomarker PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9. Low amounts of EM mycelia covaried with increased nitrate leaching, suggesting that EM mycelia possibly play an important role in forest soil N retention at increased N input.","Univ Copenhagen, Danish Ctr Forest Landscape & Planning, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden","Nilsson, LO (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Danish Ctr Forest Landscape & Planning, Horsholm Kongevej 11, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",LON@life.ku.dk,,"Nilsson, Lars Ola/0000-0003-4514-3657; Baath, Erland/0000-0002-2616-1342",,,,48,106,115,4,107,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2007,153,2,,,,,375,384,,10.1007/s00442-007-0735-x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,205YD,WOS:000249150200017,17453252,,,,10/31/19J,"Templer, PH; Arthur, MA; Lovett, GM; Weathers, KC",,,,"Templer, Pamela H.; Arthur, Mary A.; Lovett, Gary M.; Weathers, Kathleen C.",,,Plant and soil natural abundance delta N-15: indicators of relative rates of nitrogen cycling in temperate forest ecosystems,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,above and belowground nitrogen cycling; tree species; natural abundance N-15; Forest nitrogen retention,N-15 ABUNDANCE; CATSKILL MOUNTAINS; NEW-YORK; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; HARDWOOD FOREST; STABLE ISOTOPES; SATURATION; NITRATE; GRADIENT,"Watersheds within the Catskill Mountains, New York, receive among the highest rates of nitrogen (N) deposition in the northeastern United States and are beginning to show signs of N saturation. Despite similar amounts of N deposition across watersheds within the Catskill Mountains, rates of soil N cycling and N retention vary significantly among stands of different tree species. We examined the potential use of 615 N of plants and soils as an indicator of relative forest soil N cycling rates. We analyzed the 615 N of foliage, litterfall, bole wood, surface litter layer, fine roots and organic soil from single-species stands of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Fine root and organic Soil 615 N values were highest within sugar maple stands, which correlated significantly with higher rates of net mineralization and nitrification. Results from this study suggest that fine root and organic Soil 615 N can be used as an indicator of relative rates of soil N cycling. Although not statistically significant, 615 N was highest within foliage, wood and litterfall of beech stands, a tree species associated with intermediate levels of soil N cycling rates and forest N retention.

An analysis of the standing biomass data after 5 years of growth indicated that the yearly runoff floods contributed significantly to increase the total above ground biomass. The data collected during the 1999 season, indicated however that during this season flooding had no significant effect on any of the measured growth parameters, while application frequency had a significant effect on the growth rates, water use efficiency and leaf and stem production of shrubs. Below ground, two periods of root growth were observed for the higher irrigation frequency treatments: an initial moderate increase followed by a rapid reduction. The period of rapid reduction in root biomass matched well with the period of rapid increments in above ground biomass production. Furthermore, increased irrigation frequencies resulted in bigger root systems but for lower irrigation frequencies rooting depth increased.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Zegada-Lizarazu, W (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",zegada@bgu.ac.il,"EPHRATH, JHONATHAN/F-1768-2012","ZEGADA LIZARAZU, WALTER/0000-0001-9115-2322",,,,36,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2007,297,2-Jan,,,,,157,169,,10.1007/s11104-007-9329-y,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,201TX,WOS:000248856600014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Menon, M; Hermle, S; Gunthardt-Goerg, MS; Schulin, R",,,,"Menon, Manoj; Hermle, Sandra; Guenthardt-Goerg, Madeleine S.; Schulin, Rainer",,,Effects of heavy metal soil pollution and acid rain on growth and water use efficiency of a young model forest ecosystem,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,acid rain; acidic subsoil; biomass; calcareous subsoil; forest ecosystem; heavy metals; lysimeters; soil pollution; water use efficiency,OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGES; SCOTS PINE-SEEDLINGS; ROOT-GROWTH; BETULA-PENDULA; KOLA-PENINSULA; LEAD; CADMIUM; COPPER; CONTAMINATION; CU,"In a 4-year lysimeter experiment, we investigated the effects of topsoil heavy metal pollution (3,000 mg kg(-1) Zn, 640 mg kg(-1) Cu, 90 mg kg(-1) Pb and 10 mg kg(-1) Cd) and (synthetic) acid rain (pH 3.5) on tree growth and water use efficiency of young forest ecosystems consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies), willow (Salix viminalis), poplar (Populus tremula) and birch (Betula pendula) trees and a variety of understorey plants. The treatments were applied in a Latin square factorial design (contaminated vs uncontaminated topsoil, acidified rain vs ambient rain) to 16 open-top chambers, with 4 replicates each. Each open-top chamber contained two lysimeters, one with a calcareous, and the other with acidic subsoil. The four tree species responded quite differently to heavy metal pollution and type of subsoil. The fine root mass, which was only sampled at the end of the experiment in 2003, was significantly reduced by heavy metal pollution in P. abies, P. tremula and B. pendula, but not in S. viminalis. The metal treatment responses of above-ground biomass and leaf area varied between years. In 2002, the heavy metal treatment reduced above-ground biomass and leaf area in P. tremula, but not in the other species. In 2003, metals did not reduce above-ground growth in P. tremula, but did so in the other species. It appears that the responses in above-ground biomass and leaf area, which paralleled each other, were related to changes in the relative competitive strength of the various species in the two experimental years. S. viminalis gained relative to P. tremula in absence of metal stress, in particular on calcareous subsoil, while P. abies showed the largest increases in growth rates in all treatments. Above- and below-ground growth was strongly inhibited by acidic subsoil in S. viminalis and to a lesser degree also in P. abies. In P. abies, this subsoil effect was enhanced by metal stress. Acid rain was not found to have any substantial effect. Whole-system water use efficiency was reduced by metal stress and higher on calcareous than on acidic subsoil.","Univ Nevada, Dept Geol Sci & Engn, Reno, NV 89557 USA; ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Menon, M (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Geol Sci & Engn, MS-175, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",mmenon@unr.edu,"Gunthardt-Goerg, Madeleine/L-6461-2013; Menon, Manoj/B-1169-2016","Menon, Manoj/0000-0001-5665-7464",,,,48,30,39,1,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2007,297,2-Jan,,,,,171,183,,10.1007/s11104-007-9331-4,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,201TX,WOS:000248856600015,,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Ruess, L; Schutz, K; Migge-Kleian, S; Haggblom, MM; Kandeler, E; Scheu, S",,,,"Ruess, Liliane; Schuetz, Kirsten; Migge-Kleian, Sonja; Haeggblom, Max M.; Kandeler, Ellen; Scheu, Stefan",,,Lipid composition of Collembola and their food resources in deciduous forest stands - Implications for feeding strategies,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,fatty acids; trophic biomarker; soil fauna; microorganisms; plant litter,PHOSPHOLIPID FATTY-ACID; SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; BEECH FORESTS; PREFERENCES; BIOMARKERS; BACTERIAL; BIOMASS,"The lipid composition of Collembola and their potential food resources was assessed in three deciduous forest stands, in order to gain insight into food web linkages under field conditions. Fatty acids (FAs) previously assigned as trophic markers in laboratory experiments were used to investigate feeding strategies in situ. As potential food sources soil microbiota and plant debris were characterised by their phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition. Both the amount and the pattern of PLFAs differed between sites and soil depth, in particular the bacterial and plant marker FAs in the upper soil layer. Thus, the availability of resources for micro-detritivores varied due to forest and soil layer. The lipid composition of vital and senescent beech leaves was predominantly influenced by metabolic status and represented a quite homogenous FA resource across forest stands. Comparing Folsomia quadrioculata, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Neanura muscorum and Pogonognathellus longicornis between the different forests revealed FA profiles to be predominantly affected by site, suggesting a diet shift depending on resources at hand. However, species-specific differences in individual FAs occurred, likely related to feeding strategy and physiological activity. Lipids of Collembola comprised low amounts of bacterial marker FAs, and bacterial consumption may occur to some extent, particularly on Gram-positives. The marker FA for predatory feeding, 20: 1 omega 9, was found in several species, although in low amounts. This contradicts known feeding habits and caution is advisable in using 20: 1 omega 9 as trophic marker. Overall, as indicated by high proportions of oleic (18: 1 omega 9) or linoleic (18: 2 omega 6, 9) acid, most species were either plant litter or fungal feeders, with some transitions. The ratio 18: 1 omega 9/18: 2 omega 6,9 is proposed as a tool to distinguish between these two major feeding strategies in Collembola. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Leaf specific hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange were monitored during the progressive summer drought to establish how changes along the hydraulic pathway influence shoot responses. As soil water became limiting, leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration declined significantly. Predawn leaf water potential reflected soil water potential measured at 1-m depth in the rhizospheres of most trees. The lowest predawn leaf water potential recorded during this period was -1.8 MPa. Mean maximum stomata] conductance declined from 300 to 50 mine] m(-2) s(-1), reducing transpiration from 6 to 2 mmol m(-2) S-1. Changes in leaf gas exchange were attributed to reduced soil water availability, increased resistances along the hydraulic pathway and, hence, reduced leaf water supply. There was a strong coupling between changes in soil water content and stomata] conductance as well as between stomata] conductance and leaf specific hydraulic conductance. Despite significant seasonal differences among trees in predawn leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, leaf transpiration and leaf specific hydraulic conductance, there were no differences in midday leaf water potentials. The strong regulation of changes in leaf water potential in Q. suber both diurnally and seasonally is achieved through stomatal closure, which is sensitive to changes in both liquid and vapor phase conductance. This sensitivity allows for optimization of carbon and water resource use without compromising the root-shoot hydraulic link.","Maseno Univ, Dept Bot, Maseno, Kenya; Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany; Tapoda Ajuda, Inst Super Agronomia, P-1394017 Lisbon, Portugal","Otieno, DO (reprint author), Maseno Univ, Dept Bot, POB 333, Maseno, Kenya.",denotieno@yahoo.com,"Kurz-Besson, Cathy/A-5762-2013; Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/D-4570-2013","Kurz-Besson, Cathy/0000-0003-3685-0923; Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel/0000-0003-4566-5420; Pereira, Joao/0000-0002-3658-5587",,,,34,25,25,0,14,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2007,27,8,,,,,1179,1187,,10.1093/treephys/27.8.1179,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,200CF,WOS:000248740800010,17472943,,,,10/31/19J,"Snyder, KA; Williams, DG",,,,"Snyder, Keirith A.; Williams, David G.",,,Root allocation and water uptake patterns in riparian tree saplings: Responses to irrigation and defoliation,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Populus fremontii; root respiration; stable hydrogen isotope ratios; water-source use; rhizopods,TABLE DECLINE; GROWTH; RESPIRATION; PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT; COTTONWOODS; MORPHOLOGY; VEGETATION,"The genus Populus relies on shallow groundwater for successful recruitment and is often the focus of riparian restoration efforts. Under some circumstances mature trees take up a substantial proportion of their water from unsaturated soil water derived from growing season rainfall, but it is unknown how Populus saplings may alter root allocation patterns and water use in response to water availability and carbon limitations. Although it has been inferred that root allocation differs with changes in water uptake patterns as determined with stable isotope studies, this notion has rarely been tested. We conducted a glasshouse experiment with Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) saplings to determine how allocation to fine and coarse roots, leaf gas exchange, root respiration and water uptake from hydrologically isolated upper and lower soil compartments would be altered by above- and belowground resource limitations. Aboveground carbon limitations were imposed with defoliation. Belowground resource limitations were imposed by maintaining high or low soil water availability in lower soil compartment. Isotopically labeled water was supplied in pulses to upper soil compartments to determine the proportion of transpiration water derived from each compartment. Above- and belowground resource limitations differentially altered use of surface water pulses and affected patterns of fine root allocation. Proportional use of water sources was plastic and changed in response to water availability and defoliation. Changes in fine root biomass allocation were associated with changes in water-source use for water-stressed plants. Defoliated plants in both watering treatments used proportionally less of the surface pulse than undefoliated plants. In contrast, plants that were water limited, but not carbon limited had a higher ratio of shallow fine roots to deep fine roots and took up proportionally more water from the surface pulse. These data suggest that carbon limited saplings take up less water with shallow roots. Thus, P. fremontii exhibited belowground allocation tradeoffs in response to spatial heterogeneity of soil water and carbon limitations. Furthermore, our data suggest that successful recruitment events may be influenced by the occurrence of summer rainfall, and by factors affecting canopy carbon gain.

Modeled soil solution chemistry and properties were compared to a 10-year-long time series of monthly measurements of soil solution data at 5,15, 20 and 80 cm depths. Historically high deposition of S and N compounds caused a significant decrease in soil base saturation and caused severe changes in the soil solution chemistry. Since year 1990 deposition of S and N compounds decreased substantially due to improved control on S emissions. SAFE predicted an increase in base saturation at Lysina in the Oi + Oe and Oa layers, from 36% and 18% in 1994 to 50% and 22% in 2004, respectively. on the other hand, base saturation of the deeper soil horizons B and C, which represent the main mass of the soil at the Lysina catchment, has decreased even further (in B horizon from 4% in 1994 to 3% in 2004 and from 4% to 2% in horizon C). The measured values of base saturation from year 2004 fit the modeled results of base saturation development at the Lysina catchment. if atmospheric deposition remains at the 2006 level, the predicted base saturation in the B and C horizons for the year 2100 will increase by approximately 2%, to reach only 4.6% and 3.8%, respectively. The increasing molar ratio Bc/Al [(Ca + Mg + K)/All in soil solution of Oi + Oe, Oa and E horizons during the first half of the 21st century represents recovery in the top 20 cm of the soil profile, only This change may have a positive effect on the health status of shallow rooting spruce trees. The Bc/Al ratio in soil solutions in the main mass of the soil (horizons B and C), however, will remain below the critical value (<1) in the first half of 21st century. At the Lysina catchment, the values of the Bc/Al ratio are predicted to increase over the critical value (<1) in solutions of the B and C horizons in the years 2050 and 2060, respectively.

We review principles and our ecological research that can be used to design stand- and landscape-level fuel treatments in dry coniferous forests of western North America. The focus of ecological values is on the ecological web that includes the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), its two primary prey species the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) and bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea). and the vegetation (live and dead), mycorrhizal fungi, and arboreal lichens that support those prey species. For the landscape level, we describe an ongoing project to develop the FuelSolve computer tool that optimizes the area and location of a fuel treatment by minimizing p potential fire behavior and minimizing loss of spotted owl habitat from treatment and potential fire. Some species will gain and some species will lose habitat when stand structure or composition is changed during fuel reduction treatments. Stand-level prescriptions might be altered to maintain or create patchiness of closed-canopy habitat elements, such as snags, down wood, mistletoe-infected trees, and large old trees, and open-canopy habitats can be tailored to ensure creation of suitable composition and structure for wildlife. Allocation of treatments across the landscape might be managed to minimize cumulative effects and impacts on target species populations. General approaches to landscape-level planning of ecologically sound fuel treatments include coarse- and fine-filter approaches. A coarse-filter approach would use some definition of the historical or natural range of variability to define the composition and pattern that might reasonably be expected to sustain the forest ecosystem. Three general approaches can inform fine-filter analysis and development of fuel reduction treatments at the landscape level. Population viability analysis provides sound principles based on attributes of the species population structure, life history and behavior, and environment (habitat) for guiding fine-filter analysis. Fine-filter analysis can be informed by operational modeling of treatment alternatives. Research publications can guide dry forest landscape management. Our FuelSolve optimization model described in this paper differs from other fuel planning models in this class by equally considering multiple optimization objectives for fuel treatment and ecologically important resources. We describe the results of FuelSolve prototype development, an evaluation of outputs for field use, and future development efforts.

Merr. (sesbania) is a fast growing N-2-fixing widely used as an improved fallow species by smallholder farmers in eastern and southern Africa to restore fertility of their N-deficient soils. In order to establish the need for inoculation, the population of sesbania rhizobia in soil collected from a site where the species is intended for introduction was assessed using the most probable number (MPN) plant infection assay. The MPN of sesbania rhizobia was low (21, 6-81 fiducial limits at P=0.05 g(-1) oil) but with N-2-fixation potential comparable to sesbania inoculant strain KFR 651. Evaluation of an indigenous sesbania rhizobial isolate GSS 1 from the MPN assay in potted field soil showed that it was more effective than strain KFR 651 in terms of plant growth and shoot dry matter (DM) accumulation at 9 and 12 weeks after planting, respectively. Total shoot N content was also higher for plants inoculated with isolate GSS 1 than inoculant strain KFR 651 and uninoculated control treatments 12 weeks after planting. These results demonstrate that it is better to inoculate with effective indigenous than exogenous rhizobia where the need for inoculation has been established.","Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Biotechnol Lab, Nairobi, Kenya","Odee, DW (reprint author), Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Biotechnol Lab, POB 20412-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.",dodee@africaonline.co.ke,,,,,,17,7,7,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

The influence of a fungal endophyte alkaloid on the toxicity of a plant has been documented in Oxytropis sericea. Oxytropis sericea is a perennial legume responsible for livestock poisoning in western North America. Livestock poisoning is attributed to the alkaloid swainsonine, which is synthesized inside the plant by the fungal endophyte Embellisia sp. In this study, the ability of Oxytropis sericea to form a dinitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium and the effects of this symbiosis on the production of swainsonine by Embellisia sp. were evaluated in a greenhouse environment. Seeds of O. sericea were grown in plastic containers. Twenty-week-old O. sericea seedlings were inoculated with four strains of Rhizobium. Twenty weeks after inoculation, plant growth and root nodulation by Rhizobium were measured. Dinitrogen fixation was confirmed using an acetylene reduction assay (ARA) on excised root nodules. Dry leaves were analyzed for swainsonine content. A second set of plants was treated with fungicide to evaluate the effect of reduced fungal endophyte infection on plant growth and swainsonine production. All inoculated plants produced indeterminate nodules. The ARA indicated that 98% of the excised nodules were fixing dinitrogen. Rhizobium-treated plants had greater swainsonine concentrations than the non-inoculated controls. Plants that established from seeds treated with fungicide had lower biomass than non-fungicide-treated controls and plants treated with foliar fungicide. Plants treated with foliar fungicide and the controls had greater swainsonine concentrations than the plants that received seed fungicide. This greenhouse study is the first report of nodulation and dinitrogen fixation in O. sericea. It also demonstrates that dinitrogen fixation increases the production of swainsonine in O. sericea plants infected with Embellisia sp. Results from this study suggest that dinitrogen fixation affects swainsonine production and has the potential to support the symbiosis between Embellisia sp. and O. sericea when soil nitrogen is limited. Oxytropis sericea competitiveness appears to be facilitated by an ability to simultaneously associate with Rhizohium and a fungal symbiont.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; USDA ARS, Poisonous Plant Res Lab, Logan, UT 84341 USA","Child, RD (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dennisc@warnercnr.colostate.edu,"Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013","Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905",,,,37,5,5,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2007,88,7,,,,,1850,1856,,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185SN,WOS:000247730800025,17645031,,,,10/31/19J,"Barrett, LG; Thrall, PH; Burdon, JJ",,,,"Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.; Burdon, Jeremy J.",,,Evolutionary diversification through hybridization in a wild host-pathogen interaction,EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,coevolution; ecological specialization; geographic mosaic; red queen hypothesis; resistance; sex; virulence,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MELAMPSORA-LINI; FLAX RUST; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; GENETIC-VARIATION; AVIRULENCE GENES; LOCAL ADAPTATION; RESISTANCE; MARGINALE,"Coevolutionary outcomes between interacting species are predicted to vary across landscapes, as environmental conditions, gene flow, and the strength of selection vary among populations.

We show that two genetically and geographically divergent pathogen lineages dominate interactions with the host across Australia, and demonstrate a hybrid origin for one of the lineages. We further demonstrate that the geographic divergence of the two lineages of M. lini in Australia is related to variation among lineages in virulence, life-history characteristics, and response to environmental conditions. When correlated with data describing regional patterns of variation in host resistance diversity and mating system these observations highlight the potential for gene flow and geographic selection mosaics to generate and maintain coevolutionary diversification in long-standing host-pathogen interactions.","CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Barrett, LG (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Luke.Barrett@csiro.au,"Burdon, Jeremy/B-9913-2009; Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731",,,,54,24,24,0,19,SOC STUDY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUL,2007,61,7,,,,,1613,1621,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00141.x,,,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,183MH,WOS:000247576400009,17598744,,,,10/31/19J,"St Clair, JB; Howe, GT",,,,"St Clair, J.

The risk of maladaptation was large for most traits when compared with the risk associated with current transfers within seed zones, particularly for the more drastic climate change scenario. For example, the proportion of nonoverlap for a composite trait representing bud set, emergence, growth, and root: shoot ratio was as high as 0.90. We recommend augmenting within-population variation by mixing local populations with some proportion of populations from lower elevations and further south.

We analysed the spatial distribution of fine-, intermediate-, and thick-root biomass and the N and total phenolics concentrations in fine roots in sites with different aboveground-plant cover induced by grazing disturbance in the Patagonian Monte. We selected sampling sites varying in the distance to the watering point, the time since sheep grazing exclusion, and historical sheep stocking rates/paddock characteristics. Sites excluded from grazing and those far to the watering point showed the highest perennial-grass cover. Tall- and dwarf-shrub cover did not differ among sites. Fine-, intermediate-, and thick-root biomass and the chemistry of fine roots did not strongly differ among sites. At all sites, N concentration in fine roots was similar to that measured in tall shrubs while total phenolics concentration in fine roots fell within the range of that assessed for perennial grasses and tall shrubs. Results on N concentration would indicate that fine roots of tall shrubs are a main component of the bulk fine-root pool supporting previous evidence that life form shifts resulting from grazing has little effect on the root biomass and chemistry in the upper soil of rangelands.

The composition of communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can have a large effect on the performance of their plant hosts. The role of individual fungal species in shaping this response is as yet unresolved. 2. We have used the fungicide benomyl to alter the community of AM fungi in undisturbed monoliths of soil in a natural community. Changes in the community were characterized by root colonization (%RLC), cloning, sequencing and tRFLP of a partial SSUrDNA fragment. Eleven plant species were sufficiently abundant in the monoliths to be examined. 3. In the highly mycorrhiza-dependent perennial herb Ajuga reptans, phosphate concentration was significantly reduced after benomyl treatment over a full growing season. The other plant species showed low colonization and no significant difference in phosphate concentration after benomyl treatment. 4. Although colonization in A. reptans was reduced, many mycorrhizal fungi survived in the roots. Some became more abundant following fungicide treatment, suggesting competitive release. Fungi that increased were generalists that have been identified in field samples from published studies colonizing a wide range of plant species. Those that declined were specialists with a narrow host range; five types had not been recorded previously in field samples. 5. AM fungi in this study differed greatly in their response to perturbation, independent of the identity of the host plant. If such functional diversity is widespread, then elucidating the part played by AM fungal diversity in regulating plant community structure will be key to our understanding and management of ecosystems.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Helgason, T (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",th7@york.ac.uk,"Young, Peter/C-1446-2012; Helgason, Thorunn/P-6435-2019","Young, Peter/0000-0001-5259-4830; Helgason, Thorunn/0000-0003-3639-1499",,,,53,104,107,2,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

If invasives out-compete natives, global changes that elevate resource availability may interact with invasives to exacerbate impacts on native communities. Indeed, evidence is accumulating that elevated CO2 and N deposition decrease native biomass and simultaneously increase invasive biomass. However, superior competitive ability, and a relative increase in the magnitude of invasive impacts under elevated resource availability, remain to be definitively proven. Using model, multi-species, multi-individual riparian plant communities, where planting density was maintained by replacement of native with exotic individuals, we conducted a greenhouse, competition experiment using native (to the UK) and invaded communities exposed to ambient and elevated CO2 (CO2 experiment) or N availability (N experiment). We tested two hypotheses: (1) invasives are superior competitors to natives at ambient atmospheric CO2 and N deposition; (2) negative effects of invasives on natives are exacerbated under elevated CO2 or N availability. Our results provide some support for the first hypothesis: in the CO2 experiment native biomass was significantly lower in invaded communities. In the N experiment, native biomass was unaffected by the presence of exotics but other characteristics (e.g. root:shoot ratios) were altered. Differences in light availability between the experiments may have modified the effects of the invasives on the native assemblages but our design did not permit us to determine this definitively. The hypothesis that elevated CO2 and N availability benefit invasives at the expense of natives was not supported by our results. This may be explained either because the invasives showed minor responses to the resource manipulations or because native and exotic species were differentially limited by CO2 and N. Our results confirm the expectation that invasives alter the characteristics of native assemblages but lead us to question whether elevated resource availability will magnify these effects.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Osnabruck, Inst Ecol, Dept Biol & Chem, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany; Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, Wales","Bradford, MA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, 517 BioSci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",markb@uga.edu,"Tordoff, George/E-6365-2012; Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012","Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331",,,,46,18,19,1,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2007,152,4,,,,,791,803,,10.1007/s00442-007-0697-z,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TO,WOS:000248226100020,17372770,,,,10/31/19J,"Porras-Alfaro, A; Herrera, J; Natvig, DO; Sinsabaugh, RL",,,,"Porras-Alfaro, Andrea; Herrera, Jose; Natvig, Donald O.; Sinsabaugh, Robert L.",,,Effect of long-term nitrogen fertilization on mycorrhizal fungi associated with a dominant grass in a semiarid grassland,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,blue grama; Bouteloua gracilis; Glomus; mycorrhizal fungi; nitrogen; semiarid grassland,PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; UNDISTURBED VEGETATION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SPECIES RICHNESS; DEPOSITION,"We studied the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in semiarid grassland and the effect of long-term nitrogen (N) fertilization on this fungal community. Root samples of Bouteloua gracilis were collected at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (New Mexico, USA) from control and N-amended plots that have been fertilized since 1995. Small subunit rDNA was amplified using AMF specific primers NS31 and AM1. The diversity of AMF was low in comparison with other ecosystems, only seven operational taxonomic units (OTU) were found in B. gracilis and all belong to the genus Glomus. The dominant OTU was closely related to the ubiquitous G. intraradices/G. fasciculatum group. N-amended plots showed a reduction in the abundance of the dominant OTU and an increase in AMF diversity. The greater AMF diversity in roots from N-amended plots may have been the result of displacement of the dominant OTU, which facilitated detection of uncommon AMF. The long-term implications of AMF responses to N enrichment for plant carbon allocation and plant community structure remain unclear.","1 Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Truman State Univ, Div Sci, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA","Porras-Alfaro, A (reprint author), 1 Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC03 2020, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",aporras@unm.edu,"Porras-Alfaro, Andrea/B-6258-2013","Porras-Alfaro, Andrea/0000-0002-9053-7973",,,,65,65,68,3,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2007,296,2-Jan,,,,,65,75,,10.1007/s11104-007-9290-9,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,189EG,WOS:000247971600006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Padilla, FM; Miranda, JD; Pugnaire, FI",,,,"Padilla, Francisco M.; Miranda, Juan de Dios; Pugnaire, Francisco I.",,,Early root growth plasticity in seedlings of three Mediterranean woody species,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,cotyledons; drought; Mediterranean ecosystems; recruitment; root growth; seedlings,SHRUB RETAMA-SPHAEROCARPA; SEED SIZE; WATER AVAILABILITY; PLANT-GROWTH; SOIL; SURVIVAL; RESPONSES; ESTABLISHMENT; DEPTH; MAINTENANCE,"Since very young seedlings are sensitive to dehydration, soil desiccation is often responsible for seedling death in water-stressed environments. Roots play a major role in overcoming water stress and plant establishment, thus early root development in response to limited water availability becomes a strategy that may ensure seedling recruitment. We explored whether different water availabilities altered growth patterns of very young seedlings, focussing on root elongation, and hypothesized that seedling responses would depend on species-specific drought tolerance and seed size. We carried out a greenhouse experiment exposing 2-week-old seedlings of three Mediterranean shrubland species, the drought-tolerant and small-seeded Genista umbellata (L'Her.) Dum. Cours. and Lycium intricatum Boiss., and the drought-sensitive, large-seeded Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss., to two watering quantities and monitored plant and root growth weekly in glass cases for 5 weeks. We found that at such early stages, reduced water quantity enhanced root growth in all three species, regardless of drought tolerance and seed size, although root plasticity was the highest in the small-seeded and drought-tolerant Genista. In contrast, shoot elongation and mass allocation, root-to-shoot mass (R:S) ratio, was unaffected by watering. Seedlings responded to lower water availability with faster root elongation rate and greater absorptive root surface, which can account for the enhanced relative growth rate (RGR) of the small-seeded Genista and Lycium under reduced watering. By contrast, a larger root absorptive surface did not lead to higher RGR in the large-seeded Retama probably because of its greater independence from external mineral resources. Our data evidence the importance of water availability on the initial developmental stages of these three species regardless of seed size and drought tolerance. Root growth can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to deal with drying soils and decreasing soil moisture since larger roots enable to exploit unexplored soil areas of soil, which may ensure recruitment success.","CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria 04001, Spain","Padilla, FM (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, C Gen Segura 1, Almeria 04001, Spain.",fpadilla@eeza.csic.es,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Miranda, Juande/C-4485-2011; Padilla, Francisco M./C-5204-2009","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Padilla, Francisco M./0000-0003-1021-0258",,,,64,54,55,0,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2007,296,2-Jan,,,,,103,113,,10.1007/s11104-007-9294-5,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,189EG,WOS:000247971600010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Vargas, LK; Lisboa, BB; Scholles, D; Silveira, JRP; Jung, GC; Granada, CE; Neves, AG; Braga, MM; Negreiros, T",,,,"Vargas, Luciano Kayser; Lisboa, Bruno Brito; Scholles, Dercio; Pfeifer Silveira, Jose Ricardo; Jung, Gabriela Cardoso; Granada, Camille Eichelberger; Neves, Andrei Gibbon; Braga, Marcos Martins; Negreiros, Tatiana",,,"Genetic diversity and symbiotic efficiency of black wattle-nodulating rhizobia in soils of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil",REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,,,English,Article,,,,,,biological nitrogen fixation; PCR; rhizobium; Acacia mearnsii,ACID TOLERANCE; MELILOTI; ACACIA; PCR; PH,"Black wattle is the third most cultivated forest species in Brazil.

DNA band patterns of the isolates were used to construct a dendrogram by which the Shannon diversity index was calculated. Ten isolates were further tested for low pH tolerance and Al presence. Eight isolates were selected for a nitrogen-fixing greenhouse trial. High genetic diversity was observed among the isolates. Ten clusters were formed based on a 70 % similarity cut-off level and a diversity index of 4.3. The presence of Al did not affect the tested isolates, while growth decreased at pH 4.5.

We therefore investigated the transfer of C from established plants to plant seedlings through fungal mycelia. C allocation by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, from 'donor' plants to mycelia in soil and two different species of introduced 'receiver' seedlings, was investigated in a pot experiment using C-13 labelling and fatty acid analysis. After (CO2)-C-13 application to the shoots of Trifolium subterraneum or Plantago lanceolata, used as donor plants, T subterraneum and P. lanceolata receiver seedlings were introduced. Samples were collected 4-20 days after (CO2)-C-13 application and analysed regarding C-13 and the fatty acid 16:1 omega 5, the signature of AM fungi. C-13 transfer from T subterraneum donor plants was demonstrated by C-13 enrichment of the roots of the receiver seedlings, but not from the P. lanceolata donor plants. C-13 allocation to the neutral lipid fatty acid 16:1 omega 5 was only 1 ng in each receiver seedling, but 2 mu g of the fatty acid in whole soil. The results indicate that C allocation through mycelial networks is influenced by the donor plant species, but is not directed towards receiver seedlings to any higher degree than towards other directions. The importanice of the extraradical AM fungal mycelium as a C sink was demonstrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, major controls over the distribution of this compound in ecosystems are little understood. We reviewed shifts in the production, decomposition, and standing stocks of soil glomalin in response to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) communities, plant dynamics, inorganic resources (e.g., N, P, and atmospheric CO2), and land use regimes. We also conducted a literature survey of glomalin concentrations from 22 ecosystems to test for relationships between standing stocks of glomalin and net primary productivity (NPP) and AM abundance. Globally, glomalin stocks were positively correlated with NPP but not with AM abundance. Rates of NPP may impose an upper bound for C available to AM fungi for glomalin construction. Availability of C to AM fungi appears to consistently influence glomalin dynamics in individual studies as well. Glomalin stocks are often greater where AM host plants are more abundant or are more effective hosts for the fungi (implying that more C is allocated to the fungi). In addition, elevated CO2 frequently increases glomalin concentrations in soil. Other inorganic resources and land use change produce inconsistent effects on glomalin stocks. Overall, glomalin dynamics appear to be linked to C dynamics, and this relationship may allow us to better predict the contribution of glomalin to ecosystem feedbacks on global change.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Treseder, KK (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",treseder@uci.edu,"Treseder, Kathleen/E-5148-2011","Treseder, Kathleen/0000-0003-2847-6935",,,,91,112,127,7,126,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Contrary to expectations, SOC declined with increasing fine-root lignin concentrations, indicating that lignin-derived C did not dominate refractory SOC pools.

Overall, the height, shoot and root biomass, and shoot phosphorus of pioneer species were highly responsive to mycorrhizal inoculation regardless of P addition but such differences were not observed in the late secondary plants. Mycorrhizal plant responses were inversely related to seed mass. Pioneer species were classified as highly to very highly responsive while late secondary species ranged from independent to moderately responsive to mycorrhizas. These results suggest that inoculating seedlings with AMF and supplementing with P should be considered a management strategy, for both pioneer species when revegetating riparian areas or for late secondary species when planting secondary forests for enrichment.

Sixteen dominant oak trees were chosen as representative of two decline classes (eight per class). Fine root status, ectomycorrhizal community composition and structure were analysed before and after drastically altering tree density by felling all the neighbouring trees of four selected trees in each decline class. The ectomycorrhizal community was found to be extremely rich, with numerous infrequent species: of the 64 anatornotypes found, only 23 were present both before and after the thinning treatment, demonstrating that community structure changes rapidly after disturbance. Following an initial reduction, 10 months after removing competition and independently of health status, the biodiversity had recovered its previous level, demonstrating the high resilience of the ectomycorrhizal community to disturbance.

Although the genetic transformation did not lead to expected changes in wood chemistry, it had significant influence on root biomass and morphology. The transgenic lines had less root biomass and lower numbers of root tips than the wild-type birch. However, the transgenic lines formed normal ectomycorrhizas with Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and no differences between the transgenic lines and the wildtype birch were detected in the colonization by mycorrhizas in vitro. In a field trial, the decomposition of the transgenic and wild-type birch litter was equally rapid, and no marked differences were found between the transgenic lines and wild-type birch in total microbial biomass (SIR) or activity (basal respiration). The effects of the genetic transformation on the ergosterol content of the leaf litter were contradictory; the litter from one transgenic line had significantly higher ergosterol content and the litters from two other transgenic lines had significantly lower ergosterol content than the litter from wild-type birch. This study shows that the 4CL antisense transformation and the pleiotropic effects of the transformation on growth characteristics of birch did not disturb the formation of ectomycorrhizas with P. involutus and had no clear influence on the biodegradability of the leaf litter.

Incubation units reproducing the rhizosphere environment were used, allowing additions and precise sampling of soil. All LMWOC stimulated respiration in both soils although the degree of LMWOC mineralization was different in the two soils. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content increased significantly in the rhizosphere layer of the clayey soil treated with glucose or glutamate, but not with citrate or oxalate. In the sandy soil, a significant increase in the dsDNA content was only observed in the rhizosphere layer upon release of oxalate, whereas differences of the other treatments over the control were not significant. Hydrolase activity in the rhizosphere soil layer was generally stimulated. The alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly stimulated by glucose, glutamate and citrate in both the clayey and sandy soils, whereas the acid phosphatase activity was significantly stimulated by citrate in the clayey soil and by glutamate, citrate and oxalate in the sandy soil. Phosphodiesterase activity was significantly stimulated by glutamate and citrate in the clayey soil and by citrate only in the sandy soil. Urease activity was significantly stimulated by glucose and citrate in the clayey soil, whereas, the stimulation of urease activity in the sandy soil upon release of glucose, citrate and oxalate was not significant. No response to LMWOC release was observed for proatease activity in the rizosphere or bulk soil layer of both soils. It was concluded that in the rhizosphere, different LMWOC commonly released in the root exudates stimulate soil microbial activity and hydrolase activity differently depending on the compound released and soil type.

It is hypothesised that plants influence microbial community structure in the rhizosphere through rhizodeposition. We examined to what extent the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of grasses is determined by the plant species and different soil types. Three grass species were planted in soil from one site, to identify plant-specific influences on rhizosphere microbial communities. To quantify the soil-specific effects on rhizosphere microbial community structure, we planted one grass species (Lolium perenne L.) into soils from three contrasting sites. Rhizosphere, non-rhizosphere (bulk) and control (non-planted) soil samples were collected at regular intervals, to examine the temporal changes in soil microbial communities. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from both root bases and root tips, to investigate root associated spatial influences. Both fungal and bacterial communities were analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). Both bacterial and fungal communities were influenced by the plant growth but there was no evidence for plant species selection of the soil microbial communities in the rhizosphere of the different grass species. For both fungal and bacterial communities, the major determinant of community structure in rhizospheres was soil type. This observation was confirmed by cloning and sequencing analysis of bacterial communities. in control soils, bacterial composition was dominated by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria but in the rhizosphere samples, the majority of bacteria belonged to Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Bacterial community compositions of rhizosphere soils from different plants were similar, indicating only a weak influence of plant species on rhizosphere microbial community structure.

Coarse root biomass per hectare ranged from 3 to 30 Mg center dot ha(-1) among studied sites. Coarse root biomass in the smaller root diameter classes was similar at all sites, but biomass in diameter classes > 50 mm increased with stand age. Precommercial thinning added 3 Mg coarse root biomass center dot ha(-1) to the detrital pool. The ratio of coarse root biomass to stem biomass averaged 0.36 (+/- 0.02 SE).

Mycorrhizal plants are thought to be too generalist to coevolve with their symbiotic fungi; yet some plants, including some orchids, exhibit strikingly narrow mycorrhizal specificity. Here, we assess the evolutionary history of mycorrhizal specificity in the lady's slipper orchid genus, Cypripedium. We sampled 90 populations of 15 taxa across three continents, using DNA methods to identify fungal symbionts and quantify mycorrhizal specificity. We assessed phylogenetic relationships among sampled Cypripedium taxa, onto which we mapped mycorrhizal specificity. Cypripedium taxa associated almost exclusively with fungi within family Tulasnellaceae. Ancestral specificity appears to have been narrow, followed by a broadening after the divergence of C. debile. Specificity then narrowed, resulting in strikingly narrow specificity in most of the taxa in this study, with no taxon rewidening to the same extant as basal members of the genus. Sympatric taxa generally associated with different sets of fungi, and most clades of Cypripedium-mycorrhizal fungi were found throughout much of the northern hemisphere, suggesting that these evolutionary patterns in specificity are not the result of biogeographic lack of opportunity to associate with potential partners. Mycorrhizal specificity in genus Cypripedium appears to be an evolvable trait, and associations with particular fungi are phylogenetically conserved.","Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Tubingen, Germany; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; Estonian Agr Univ, Inst Zool & Bot, Tartu, Estonia; Museum Nat Sci, Tsukuba Bot Garden, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Hokkaido Res Ctr, Forest Dynam & Diver Grp, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; Akita Prefectural Univ, Crop Sci Lab, Akita, Japan; Acad Sinica, Inst Plant & Microbial Biol, Taipei 115, Taiwan","Shefferson, RP (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan.",dormancy@gmail.com; lee.taylor@iab.alaska.edu; michael.weiss@uni-tuebingen.de; michael.weiss@uni-tuebingen.de; mccormickm@si.edu; lee.taylor@iab.alaska.edu; lee.taylor@iab.alaska.edu; lee.taylor@iab.alaska.edu; mccormickm@si.edu; tiiu@zbi.ee; yukawa@kahaku.go.jp; kaba@ffpri.go.jp; mi_orchids@akita-pu.ac.jp; leeyungi@hotmail.com,"Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019; Shefferson, Richard/M-7115-2015; Tali, Kadri/Q-7096-2019; Sigisfredo, Garnica/P-6506-2014; WeiSS, Michael/F-6206-2012; Kull, Tiiu/C-5771-2017","Shefferson, Richard/0000-0002-5234-3131; WeiSS, Michael/0000-0002-4869-9186; Kull, Tiiu/0000-0003-2841-7361; Taylor, Donald/0000-0002-5985-9210",,,,73,89,96,3,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,2007,61,6,,,,,1380,1390,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00112.x,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,177AD,WOS:000247125100011,17542847,,,,10/31/19J,"Padilla, FM; Pugnaire, FI",,,,"Padilla, F.

Seedling survival is one of the most critical stages in a plant's life history, and is often reduced by drought and soil desiccation. It has been hypothesized that root systems accessing moist soil layers are critical for establishment, but very little is known about seedling root growth and traits in the field. 2. We related seedling mortality to the presence of deep roots in a field experiment in which we monitored soil moisture, root growth and seedling survival in five Mediterranean woody species from the beginning of the growing season until the end of the drought season. 3. We found strong positive relationships between survival and maximum rooting depth, as well as between survival and soil moisture. Species with roots in moist soil layers withstood prolonged drought better, whereas species with shallow roots died more frequently. In contrast, biomass allocation to roots was not related to establishment success. 4. Access to moist soil horizons accounted for species-specific survival rates, whereas large root : shoot (R:S) ratios did not. The existence of soil moisture thresholds that control establishment provides insights into plant population dynamics in dry environments.","CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Padilla, FM (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, C Gen Segura 1, E-04001 Almeria, Spain.",fpadilla@eeza.csic.es,"Padilla, Francisco M./C-5204-2009; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008","Padilla, Francisco M./0000-0003-1021-0258; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827",,,,44,220,225,5,84,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Until now, relatively few studies have investigated which factors may control the abundance of belowground herbivores. In Dutch coastal foredunes, the root-feeding nematode Tylenchorhynchus ventralis is capable of reducing the performance of the dominant grass Ammophila arenaria (Marram grass). However, field surveys show that populations of this nematode usually are controlled to nondamaging densities, but the control mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we first established that T. ventralis populations are top-down controlled by soil biota. Then, selective removal of soil fauna suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in controlling T. ventralis. This result was confirmed by an experiment where selective inoculation of microarthropods, nematodes and microbes together with T. ventralis into sterilized dune soil resulted in nematode control when microbes were present. Adding nematodes had some effect, whereas microarthropods did not have a significant effect on T. ventralis. Our results have important implications for the appreciation of herbivore controls in natural soils. Soil food web models assume that herbivorous nematodes are controlled by predaceous invertebrates, whereas many biological control studies focus on managing nematode abundance by soil microorganisms. We propose that soil microorganisms play a more important role than do carnivorous soil invertebrates in the top-down control of herbivorous ectoparasitic nematodes in natural ecosystems. This is opposite to many studies on factors controlling root-feeding insects, which are supposed to be controlled by carnivorous invertebrates, parasitoids, or entomopathogenic nematodes. Our conclusion is that the ectoparasitic nematode T. ventralis is potentially able to limit productivity of the dune grass A. arenaria but that soil organisms, mostly microorganisms, usually prevent the development of growth-reducing population densities.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, Ctr Terr Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Anim Biol, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Rothamsted Res, Nematode Interact Unit, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nematol Lab, NL-6709 PD Wageningen, Netherlands","Piskiewicz, AM (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, Ctr Terr Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",a.piskiewicz@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Costa, Sofia R/E-8028-2017","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Costa, Sofia R/0000-0003-0100-1518; Berg, Matty P./0000-0001-8442-8503",,,,50,30,30,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2007,152,3,,,,,505,514,,10.1007/s00442-007-0678-2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,169TN,WOS:000246614700011,17345102,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Laird, RA; Addicott, JF",,,,"Laird, Robert A.; Addicott, John F.",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reduce the construction of extrafloral nectaries in Vicia faba,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,ant-plant interactions; cost of symbiosis; extrafloral nectar; indirect defence; trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs),FOLIAR-FEEDING INSECTS; EXTRA-FLORAL NECTARIES; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; ANTIHERBIVORE DEFENSES; MYRMECOPHYTIC CECROPIA; INDUCED RESPONSES; CARBON FLOW; PLANT; HERBIVORY; GROWTH,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can alter the physiology and morphology of their host plant, and therefore may have indirect effects on insect herbivores and pollinators. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis that AMF can also affect insects involved in protection-for-food mutualisms. We examined the constitutive and inducible production of food rewards [extrafloral (EF) nectaries] in Vicia faba plants by manipulating the presence/absence of AMF and by simulating various levels of herbivory. Plants inoculated with AMF produced significantly fewer EF nectaries than uninoculated plants, even after accounting for differences in plant growth. In contrast to earlier studies, EF nectaries were not inducible: damaged plants produced significantly fewer EF nectaries than undamaged plants. Moreover, the effects of mycorrhizal and damage status on EF nectary production were additive. The reduction in EF nectaries in mycorrhizal plants potentially represents a mechanism for indirect effects of AMF on the protective insects that exploit EF nectaries as a food source (e.g., ants). Reduced reward size should result in reduced protection by ants, and could therefore be a previously unappreciated cost of the mycorrhizal symbiosis to host plants. However, the overall effect of AMF will depend upon the extent to which the reduction of EF nectaries affects the number and activity of ants and the extent to which AMF alter other aspects of host plant physiology. Our results emphasize the complexity of multitrophic interactions, particularly those that span belowground and aboveground ecology.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Laird, RA (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",rlaird@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,73,27,27,3,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2007,152,3,,,,,541,551,,10.1007/s00442-007-0676-4,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,169TN,WOS:000246614700015,17356811,,,,10/31/19J,"Montano, NM; Garcia-Oliva, F; Jaramillo, VJ",,,,"Manuel Montano, Noe; Garcia-Oliva, Felipe; Jaramillo, Victor J.",,,Dissolved organic carbon affects soil microbial activity and nitrogen dynamics in a Mexican tropical deciduous forest,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,C and N availability; dissolved organic C; microbial biomass; Mexico; nitrification; tropical dry forests,FUMIGATION-EXTRACTION METHOD; VIABLE NITRIFIER COMMUNITY; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; N-MINERALIZATION; WESTERN MEXICO; FINE ROOTS; DRY FOREST; BIOMASS; TRANSFORMATIONS; NITRIFICATION,"Seasonal variation of dissolved organic C (DOC) and its effects on microbial activity and N dynamics were studied during two consecutive years in soils with different organic C concentrations (hilltop and hillslope) in a tropical deciduous forest of Mexico. We found that DOC concentrations were higher at the hilltop than at the hillslope soils, and in both soils generally decreased from the dry to the rainy season during the two study years. Microbial biomass and potential C mineralization rates, as well as dissolved organic N (DON) and NH4+ concentrations and net N immobilization were higher in soils with higher DOC than in soils with lower DOC. In contrast, net N immobilization and NH4+ concentration were depleted in the soil with lowest DOC, whereas NO3- concentrations and net nitrification increased. Negative correlations between net nitrification and DOC concentration suggested that NH4+ was transformed to NO3- by nitrifiers when the C availability was depleted. Taken together, our results suggest that available C appears to control soil microbial activity and N dynamics, and that microbial N immobilization is facilitated by active heterotrophic microorganisms stimulated by high C availability. Soil autotrophic nitrification is magnified by decreases in C availability for heterotrophic microbial activity. This study provides an experimental data set that supports the conceptual model to show and highlight that microbial dynamics and N transformations could be functionally coupled with DOC availability in the tropical deciduous forest soils.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest & Ecosist, Morelia 58090, Michoacan, Mexico","Garcia-Oliva, F (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest & Ecosist, Apartado Postal 27-3 Sta Maria de Guido, Morelia 58090, Michoacan, Mexico.",fgarcia@oikos.unam.mx,,,,,,61,47,48,2,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2007,295,2-Jan,,,,,265,277,,10.1007/s11104-007-9281-x,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,179HA,WOS:000247279100022,,,,,10/31/19
