We used a 7 by 7 factorial greenhouse experiment to create a matrix of bulk density (rho(h)) and volumetric water content (theta,) to better understand soil compaction effects on seedling growth of: (i) ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws) grown on Dome and Cohasset soils; (ii) shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) on a Clarksville soil; and (iii) loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) on an Argent soil. Models of root length density (RLD) were developed using multiple regression. The general model of RLD = b(0) + b(1)theta(v) + b(2)rho(h) + b(3)theta(v)(2) described rooting response for the Clarksville-shortleaf and Argent-loblolly soil-species combinations (p = 0.005). However, the ponderosa pine RLD response on Cohasset soil was linear and there was an interaction between theta, and rho(h) in the Dome soil. Shoot mass of seedlings growing within the least limiting water range (LLWR) was greater than those growing outside the range for all soil-species combinations except the Argent-loblolly pine (p = 0.05). The loblolly pines had greater shoot mass at theta, above the upper LLWR limits (aeration limiting). Least limiting water range has potential as a soil quality indicator, but seedling response was not always associated with LLWR. Root length density (RLD) response surface models in conjunction with seasonal site water data have potential for determining compaction-induced soil limitations for tree growth, but need to be field tested and calibrated for both soil and species.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry 0324, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; USDA, Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, Redding, CA 96001 USA; Lincoln Univ, USDA, Forest Serv, N Cent Res Stn, Jefferson City, MO 65102 USA; MeadWestvaco Corp, Forest Sci Lab, Summerville, SC 29483 USA","Siegel-Issem, CM (reprint author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forestry 0324, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",csiegel@vt.edu,,,,,,50,54,58,0,28,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Foliage, branch, stem sapwood, heartwood and bark components of aboveground biomass were measured in 117 trees sampled from 17 stands varying in age, density and site fertility. A subsample of 32 trees was measured for belowground biomass excluding fine roots. Biomass of fine roots was estimated from the results of an earlier study. Statistical models were constructed to predict dry mass (DW) of components from tree height and basal area, and time derivatives of these models were used to estimate biomass increments from height growth and basal area growth. Biomass growth (G) was estimated by adding estimated biomass turnover rates to increments, and gross photosynthetic production (P) was estimated by adding estimated component respiration rates to growth. The method, which predicts the time course of G, P and biomass increment in individual trees as functions of height growth and basal area growth, was applied to eight example trees representing different dominance positions and site fertilities. Estimated G and P of the example trees varied with competition, site fertility and tree height, reaching maximum values of 22 and 43 kg(DW) year(-1), respectively. The site types did not show marked differences in productivity of trees of the same height, although height growth was greater on the fertile site. The G:P ratio decreased with tree height from 65 to 45%. Growth allocation to needles and branches increased with increasing dominance, whereas growth allocation to the stem decreased. Growth allocation to branches decreased and growth allocation to coarse roots increased with increasing tree size. Trees at the poor site allocated 49% more to fine roots than trees at the fertile site. The belowground parts accounted for 25 to 55% of annual G, increasing with tree size and decreasing with site fertility. Annual G and P per unit needle mass varied over the ranges 1.9-2.4 and 3.5-4.0 kg(DW) kg(-1), respectively. The relationship between P and needle mass in the example trees was linear and relatively independent of competition, site fertility and age.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Vanninen, P (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petteri.vanninen@helsinki.fi,,"Makela, Annikki/0000-0001-9633-7350",,,,54,32,38,3,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2005,25,1,,,,,17,30,,10.1093/treephys/25.1.17,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,887WC,WOS:000226335200003,15519982,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Tang, J; Qi, Y; Xu, M; Misson, L; Goldstein, AH",,,,"Tang, J; Qi, Y; Xu, M; Misson, L; Goldstein, AH",,,Forest thinning and soil respiration in a ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon cycle; CO2 efflux; modeling; multivariate analysis,MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST; CO2 EFFLUX; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ROOT RESPIRATION; LOBLOLLY-PINE; BALSAM FIR; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION; UNTHINNED STANDS,"Soil respiration is controlled by soil temperature, soil water, fine roots, microbial activity, and soil physical and chemical properties. Forest thinning changes soil temperature, soil water content, and root density and activity, and thus changes soil respiration. We measured soil respiration monthly and soil temperature and volumetric soil water continuously in a young ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws. & C. Laws.) plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California from June 1998 to May 2000 (before a thinning that removed 30% of the biomass), and from May to December 2001 (after thinning). Thinning increased the spatial homogeneity of soil temperature and respiration. We conducted a multivariate analysis with two independent variables of soil temperature and water and a categorical variable representing the thinning event to simulate soil respiration and assess the effect of thinning. Thinning did not change the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature or to water, but decreased total soil respiration by 13% at a given temperature and water content. This decrease in soil respiration was likely associated with the decrease in root density after thinning. With a model driven by continuous soil temperature and water time series, we estimated that total soil respiration was 948, 949 and 831 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the years 1999,2000 and 2001, respectively. Although thinning reduced soil respiration at a given temperature and water content, because of natural climate variability and the thinning effect on soil temperature and water, actual cumulative soil respiration showed no clear trend following thinning. We conclude that the effect of forest thinning on soil respiration is the combined result of a decrease in root respiration, an increase in soil organic matter, and changes in soil temperature and water due to both thinning and interannual climate variability.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Tang, J (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jtang@umn.edu,"Goldstein, Allen H/A-6857-2011; Tang, Jianwu/K-6798-2014","Goldstein, Allen H/0000-0003-4014-4896; Tang, Jianwu/0000-0003-2498-9012",,,,34,113,141,3,39,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2005,25,1,,,,,57,66,,10.1093/treephys/25.1.57,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,887WC,WOS:000226335200007,15519986,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Gaucher, C; Gougeon, S; Mauffette, Y; Messier, C",,,,"Gaucher, C; Gougeon, S; Mauffette, Y; Messier, C",,,Seasonal variation in biomass and carbohydrate partitioning of understory sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) seedlings,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,photosynthetic : non-photosynthetic tissue ratio; root : shoot ratio; starch; total nonstructural carbohydrates,SHADE TOLERANCE; LIGHT AVAILABILITY; WOODY-PLANTS; INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION; CANOPY GAPS; CARBON GAIN; GROWTH; ALLOCATION; RESERVES; SAPLINGS,"We investigated seasonal patterns of biomass and carbohydrate partitioning in relation to shoot growth phenology in two age classes of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) seedlings growing in the understory of a partially harvested forest. The high root: shoot biomass ratio and carbohydrate concentration of sugar maple are characteristic of species with truncated growth patterns (i.e., cessation of aboveground shoot growth early in the growing season), a conservative growth strategy and high shade tolerance. The low root:shoot biomass ratio and carbohydrate concentration of yellow birch are characteristic of species with continuous growth patterns, an opportunistic growth strategy and low shade tolerance. In both species, starch represented up to 95% of total nonstructural carbohydrates and was mainly found in the roots. Contrary to our hypothesis, interspecific differences in shoot growth phenology (i.e., continuous versus truncated) did not result in differences in seasonal patterns of carbohydrate partitioning.

In the N-source experiment, the NH4+ treatment resulted in superior growth and lower C/N ratios. Whole plant delta(15)N was higher on NH4+ and NH4NO3, reflecting higher NH4+ removal rates from the media. Families expressed differences in biomass, C/N, delta(15)N and delta(13)C. Family delta(15)N and delta(13)C were positively correlated in the NH4NO3 treatment and the steady-state regime. Supply regime did not affect total biomass, but higher root/shoot ratios implied N was more limiting under the draw-down regime. Family rank changed with supply regime, but not with N source. Analysis of media isotope enrichment during substrate depletion revealed relationships between net discrimination and external N concentration. Discrimination against (NH4+)-N-15 was about twice that of (NO3-)-N-15 stop. A simple model relating isotope discrimination to relative rates of ion efflux and influx predicted efflux/influx ratios consistent with published values for white spruce. We propose that genetic differences in discrimination are caused by different demands on assimilation and in uptake capacity which interact, influencing the balance between N influx and efflux.","Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Guy, RD (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, 3030-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",guy@interchg.ubc.ca,,,,,,47,37,37,2,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Although significant relationships ( P = 0.0001) were found between age and pulp cavity ratios by both methods, the TR ratio calculation and measurement showed heteroscedasity in error variance whereas the KW ratios had a more stable error variance and were normally distributed. The KW method also found significant differences between pulp cavity ratios between teeth of the upper and lower jaws ( P < 0.0001) and sex ( P = 0.01) but not geographic origin ( P = 0.1). Regressions and formulae for fitted curves are presented separately for male and female wild dogs. Males show greater variability in pulp cavity decrements with age than do females, suggesting a physiological difference between the sexes. We conclude that the KW method of using pulp cavity as a proportion of tooth width, measured 15 mm from the root tip and averaged over both upper canines, is the more accurate method of estimating the age of adult wild dogs.","Univ So Queensland, Dept Biol & Phys Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; Nat Resources & Mines, Robert Wick Pest Anim Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; Univ Queensland, Sch Agron & Hort, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia","Kershaw, K (reprint author), Univ So Queensland, Dept Biol & Phys Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",,,,,,,14,7,7,0,6,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

Height profiles of branch and needle biomass as well as biomass allocation were also analyzed. At the branch level, the relationships of branch diameter, branch length and whorl position were the best to predict branch and needle biomass. They were able to explain 96% of the observed variation for branches and needles. Simple allometric relationships of whorl height accurately predicted vertical distribution of branch and needle biomass as well as of their total, and explained more than 96% of the observed variation. The vertical distributions of biomass of branches, of needles and of their total, were very similar and were skewed vertically downward. At the tree level stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were significant determinants of biomass of stems, coarse roots and small roots. Similarly DBH, tree height and crown length were the predominant variables of biomass of branches and needles, and of the entire tree biomass. All together, allometric relationships with DBH were the best to estimate biomass of all above- and belowground compartments. These relationships were able to explain more than 98% of the observed variation. For 4.5-5.6 m tall trees with an average DBH of 7.16 cm, the entire tree biomass was 13.38 kg. On average 33.9% of the biomass was allocated to the stem, 25% to the branches, 22% to the needles, 17.8% to the coarse roots and 1.3% to small roots.

Previous work at this site reported a reduction in soil carbon of 3.6 Mg ha(-1) in the top 0.1 m over one 23-year rotation of pine on improved pasture [Beets, P.N., Oliver, G.R., Clinton, P.W., 2002. Soil carbon protection in podocarp/hardwood forest, and the effects of conversion to pasture and exotic pine forest. J. Environ. Pollut. 116, S63-S73]. In this study, by sampling before and after harvesting, a further reduction of 3.1 Mg ha(-1) (significant at P = 0.05) in mineral soil carbon stocks to 0.1 nt depth was found to be associated with harvesting disturbance. However, less intensive sampling was unable to detect any significant harvesting effects in depths down to 2 m. Variation between plots was large, and it was estimated that to detect a 10% change in carbon content with 95% confidence 19 permanent plots would be required for 0-0.1 m depth and 40 permanent plots required to detect changes to I m depth. Soil C content to I m depth in Puruki Rua subcatchment was estimated to average between 143 and 164 Mg ha(-1). In two paired-site studies comparing pasture with second rotation pine, the difference between land-uses in mineral soil C content to 0.1 m depth was 19.6 Mg ha(-1) in volcanic soil at Kaingaroa and 8.5 Mg ha(-1) in high clay activity soil at Ngaumu. Significant differences in mineral soil C between pine and pasture was found with cumulative depth down to 2 m, well below the rooting depth of pasture, which suggests that historic factors overshadowed influences of the current land-use and can account for the difference in soil carbon. At Kaingaroa, variability in soil carbon content was high at all depths measured, and to detect a 10% difference in soil carbon content with 95% confidence approximately 60 pits measured to I m depth would be required.

This study assessed the effects of fire on mycorrhizal symbiosis and root system architecture (RSA) in South African savanna grasses. Eighteen grass species were sampled across contrasting fire frequency treatments in the Kruger National Park experimental burn plots. All eighteen species studied were highly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Both mycorrhizal symbiosis and RSA were strongly affected by fire, with an increase in AMF colonization and a decrease in root branching and fine root development with decreasing fire frequency. Greater water limitation in frequently burned savanna may result in greater fine root development, thus reducing plant dependency on AMF for acquisition of soil resources. Reduced mycorrhizal colonization in frequently burned savanna may also be driven by higher phosphorus : nitrogen ratios, or indirect effects related to higher grazing intensities in frequently burned sites.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Hartnett, DC (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",dchart@ksu.edu,"Wilson, Gail/G-4255-2012",,,,,53,27,28,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

After labelling, seedlings were either submitted to a removal of root tips to simulate a nursery lifting or kept intact before being transplanted into minirhyzotrons ( parallelepipedal containers allowing root elongation observations) and grown for 41 days in a climatized chamber. Applying isotopic dilution equations allowed to assess for regrowth the effects of lifting on the use of C and N either derived from reserves or newly assimilated. Lifting decreased markedly root and shoot growth after transplanting, as well as CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance of needles. However, both the ratio of needle intercellular/ambient CO2 concentration and needle predawn water potential remained unaltered. Lifting also decreased total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration at the whole seedling level. Shoot growth began just after transplanting and was supported by old C. Concomitantly, a strong decrease in old C and TNC occurred in old roots. A marked N mobilisation was also observed in needles. New root growth occurred 15 days after transplanting and depended less on old C and N than did the new shoot growth. Shoot and root growth were further supported more and more by newly acquired C and N. On day 41 after transplanting, new roots contained mainly new C and N, while new shoots remained enriched in old N. The decrease in growth in response to lifting was more pronounced in roots than in shoots and resulted less from a reduced availability of reserves than from a significant decrease in acquisition of both C and N.","Ctr INRA Nancy, UMR INRA UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54280 Seichamps, France; Univ Paris 11, Inst Biotechnol Plantes, CNRS, Lab Struct & Metab Plantes, F-91405 Orsay, France","Maillard, P (reprint author), Ctr INRA Nancy, UMR INRA UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54280 Seichamps, France.",maillard@nancy.inra.fr,,,,,,33,13,14,0,1,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

The seedlings were either irrigated with spring water (pH 6) or got only natural rain during the whole field experiment.

Guajacol peroxidase activity was measured. Short roots were classified into two groups according to their condition and the composition of the mycorrhizal community was expressed as a proportion of morphotypes in the roots. The seedlings exposed to additional Ni had higher shoot growth than the seedlings in the other treatments. The mean Ni concentration in the roots of seedlings exposed to additional Ni was 79 p.p.m. and in other seedlings 16 p.p.m. Additional Ni also decreased the frequency of clearly senescent short roots and the proportion of the mycorrhizal morphotype with the thinnest mantle. These results indicate that the Ni exposure levels used in this experiment had some positive effects on the seedlings. The relative fungal biomass was about 6% lower (p = 0.0981) in the fine roots of seedlings treated with additional Cu. The mean Cu concentration in the roots of seedlings exposed to additional Cu was 256 p.p.m. and in other seedlings 29 p.p.m. Peroxidase activity, which was used as a general stress indicator in this study, was not affected by any of the treatments. The shoot growth and the relative biomass of fungi in the fine roots were positively correlated in all seedlings, and this correlation was stronger in seedlings exposed to additional Ni that were not irrigated compared with seedlings not exposed to additional Ni that were irrigated. The frequency of asymptomatic infections of G. abietina was positively correlated with the proportion of senescent short roots in the irrigated seedlings but not in not-irrigated seedlings. The general condition of seedlings may be an important factor for infection by G. abietina when moisture is high enough for the fungi to infect seedlings by conidia.","Univ Coll Gavle, Dept Math Nat & Comp Sci, SE-80176 Gavle, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu, Finland; MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Environm Res, Ecol Prod, Mikkeli, Finland; Univ Turku, Dept Biol, SF-20500 Turku, Finland; Univ Turku, Kevo Subarctic Res Inst, SF-20500 Turku, Finland","Ahonen-Jonnarth, U (reprint author), Univ Coll Gavle, Dept Math Nat & Comp Sci, SE-80176 Gavle, Sweden.",uah@hig.se,,,,,,37,10,12,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1437-4781,1439-0329,,FOREST PATHOL,Forest Pathol.,DEC,2004,34,6,,,,,337,348,,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2004.00375.x,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,883HL,WOS:000226002100001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lusk, CH",,,,"Lusk, CH",,,Leaf area and growth of juvenile temperate evergreens in low light: species of contrasting shade tolerance change rank during ontogeny,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,allocation; biomass distribution; carbon balance; leaf area ratio; relative growth rate,RAIN-FOREST; CARBON GAIN; INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; TREE SEEDLINGS; ALLOCATION; SURVIVAL; NITROGEN; TRAITS; SAPLINGS,"1. Interspecific variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25-1180 mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2-5% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central Chile. 2. As predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio (LAR) of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light LAR fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over approximate to500 mm tall. 3. Although the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or Aristotelia. 4. Above-ground relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to LAR, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings (>400 mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining LAR and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low light. 5. Results are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.","Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile","Lusk, CH (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",clusk@udec.cl,,,,,,39,91,102,0,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The existence of multiple rRNA sequences within AMF single spores and the high levels of variability found in these symbionts for highly conserved genes with low copy numbers have provoked intense controversy over the genetic structure of the Glomeromycota. Lately, two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the source of such a variation, mainly either at internuclear (multigenomic) or intranuclear (polyploidy) levels. 2. Evidence reported by numerous authors suggests that the magnitude of sequence variation, and the presence in single spores of sequences from apparently unrelated taxa within the Glomeromycota, makes the use of one, or very few sequences, from only one or two isolates of AMF insufficient for taxonomic purposes in some species groups. 3. A large-scale, collaborative study on genetic variation in AMF across different genes could help to address fundamental questions on the biology and genetic structure of these important symbionts.","Univ Kent, Res Sch Biosci, Canterbury CT2 7NJ, Kent, England; Int Inst Biotechnol, Sittingbourne ME9 8HL, Kent, England","Rodriguez, A (reprint author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Pflanzenbau & Gunland 340, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",aliarodn@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,29,20,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In this study, we assessed the importance of spatial scale and forest size on changes in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) spore communities by sampling AMF spores in soils of forested mainland and island sites in the vicinity of Gatun Lake, Republic of Panama. We encountered a total of 27 AMF species or morphospecies, with 17, 8, 1 and 1 from the genera Glomus, Acaulospora, Sclerosystis, and Scutellospora, ;respectively. At small scales (< 100 m(2)), we found little evidence for spatial structuring of AMF communities ( decay of Morisita-Horn community similarity with distance). However, at large spatial scales, we found that the AMF spore community of a mainland plot was more similar to other mainland plots several kilometers (> 5) away than to nearby island plots ( within 0.7 km). Likewise, most island plots were more similar to other island plots regardless of geographic separation. There was no decay in AMF species richness ( number of species), or Shannon diversity ( number of species and their spore numbers) either with decreasing forest-fragment size, or with decreasing plant species richness. Of the six most common species that composed almost 70% of the total spore volume, spores of Glomus ""tsh"" and G. clavisporum were more common in soils of mainland plots, while spores of Glomus ""small brown"" and Acaulospora mellea were more abundant in soils of island plots. None of these common AMF species showed significant associations with soil chemistry or plant diversity. We suggest that the convergence of common species found in AMF spore communities in soils of similar forest sizes was a result of forest fragmentation. Habitat-dependent convergence of AMF spore communities may result in differential survival of tree seedlings regenerating on islands versus mainland.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 2072, Panama; Korea Natl Univ Educ, Inst Nat Sci, Chungbuck 363791, South Korea; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Mangan, SA (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",smangan@indiana.edu,,,,,,62,51,59,0,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2004,141,4,,,,,687,700,,10.1007/s00442-004-1684-2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,869QT,WOS:000224999800014,15322901,,,,10/31/19J,"Launonen, TM; Ashton, DH; Kelliher, KJ; Keane, PJ",,,,"Launonen, TM; Ashton, DH; Kelliher, KJ; Keane, PJ",,,The growth and P acquisition of Eucalyptus regnans F.

In undried forest soil seedlings grow poorly and develop purple coloration in the foliage. indicating P deficiency. This paper reports the results of pot experiments designed to investigate the relationship between growth and P acquisition. ectomycorrhizal infection and age of seedlings grown in air-dried and undried soil. The effect on seedling growth of their inoculation with air-dried or undried soil or with ectomycorrhizal roots from plants growing in air-dried or undried soil was also investigated. Ectomycorrhizal root tips were detected in 3-week-old E. regnans seedlings in both air-dried and undried soil, and from then on the frequency of ectomycorrhizal root Lips increased rapidly. In air-dried soil, seedlings were fully ectomycorrhizal at 9 weeks, and the occurrence of maximum ectomycorrhizal infection coincided with enhanced P acquisition and the initiation of rapid seedling growth. In undried forest soil, seedling growth remained poor, even though the seedlings had well-developed ectomycorrhizae and the incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips was the same as in air-dried soil. The dominant ectomycorrhizae in air-dried soil were associated with an ascomycete fungus, whereas in undried, undisturbed soil they were commonly associated with basidiomycete fungi. Inoculation of sterile soil/sand mix with washed ectomycorrhizal roots from air-dried soil increased the P acquisition and growth of the seedlings significantly compared with controls. whereas ectomycorrhizal inocula from undried soil had no effect on seedling growth. although both inocula resulted in a similar incidence of ectomycorrhizal root tips. Similarly, addition of a small amount of air-dried soil into sterile soil/sand mix resulted in a significantly greater increase in the P content and dry weight of the seedlings, compared with the control, than addition of undried soil. In both treatments. the incidence of ectomycorrhial root tips was similar. As (i) the differentiation in seedling growth between air-dried and undried soil occurred after seedlings became ectomycorrhizal, (ii) the dominant ectomycorrhizae in air-dried soil were different from those in undried soil, and (iii) inocula from air-dried soil, but not from undried soil. stimulated seedling growth in sterile soil/sand mix, it is concluded that development of particular ectomycorrhizae may be involved in seedling growth stimulation and enhanced P acquisition associated with air drying of forest soil.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Bot, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia","Launonen, TM (reprint author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Bot, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",,,,,,,41,7,7,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2004,267,2-Jan,,,,,179,189,,10.1007/s11104-005-4794-7,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,889LM,WOS:000226444500016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bogeat-Triboulot, MB; Bartoli, F; Garbaye, J; Marmeisse, R; Tagu, D",,,,"Bogeat-Triboulot, MB; Bartoli, F; Garbaye, J; Marmeisse, R; Tagu, D",,,Fungal ectomycorrhizal community and drought affect root hydraulic properties and soil adherence to roots of Pinus pinaster seedlings,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhiza; Hebeloma cylindrosporum; hydraulic conductance; root; soil aggregation,HIGH-PRESSURE FLOWMETER; WATER RELATIONS; HEBELOMA-CYLINDROSPORUM; DOUGLAS-FIR; MYCORRHIZAL; CONDUCTIVITY; CONDUCTANCE; AGGREGATION; SYMBIOSIS; GROWTH,"Pinus pinaster seedlings were grown in a sandy dune soil either inoculated with Hebeloma cylindrosporum or let to natural colonisation. Six months later, half of the seedlings of both treatments were subjected to a 3-week moderate drought. Root colonisation analysis showed that root tips were colonised to almost 100%. independent of the inoculation. DNA determination of the ectomycorrhizal morphotypes showed that inoculated seedlings were extensively mycorrhized by H. cylindrosporum (more than 75%) whereas non-inoculated seedlings were mycorrhized by the exotic species Thelephora terrestris (50%) and Laccaria bicolor (30%) and to a lesser extent by H. cylindrosporum (20%). Drought did not affect these frequencies. Total plant biomass was not affected by the mycorrhizal status or by drought but the root/shoot biomass ratio as well as the root/leaf surface area ratio were much lower in seedlings extensively colonised by H. cylindrosporum. Root hydraulic conductivity was higher in plants mainly mycorrhized by H. cylindrosporum, showing that this fungus improved the water uptake capacity of the root system as compared to T terrestris and/or L. bicolor. This positive effect was also found under drought but to a lesser extent. H. cylindrosporum also increased the amount of root-adhering soil as compared to the other fungal symbionts, illustrating the performance of this association in aggregating sandy soil particles and developing the rhizosheath. The origin of the reduced root hydraulic resistance by H. cylindrosporum mycorrhization is discussed for the whole path including soil. soil-root interface and root cortex.","INRA, UMR INRA UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54280 Champenoux, France; CNRS, Ctr Pedol Biol, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; INRA, UMR INRA UHP Interact Arbres Microorganismes 1136, F-54280 Champenoux, France; Univ Lyon 1, UMR CNRS Ecol Microbienne Sol Symbiose Mycorhizie, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Bogeat-Triboulot, MB (reprint author), INRA, UMR INRA UHP Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",triboulo@nancy.inra.fr,,"Tagu, Denis/0000-0002-6320-8648",,,,41,29,31,0,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2004,267,2-Jan,,,,,213,223,,10.1007/s11104-005-5349-7,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,889LM,WOS:000226444500019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bliss, CM; Comerford, NB; Muchovej, RM",,,,"Bliss, CM; Comerford, NB; Muchovej, RM",,,"Determination of microbial phosphorus K-p factors in a spodosol: influence of extractant, water potential, and soil horizon",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,microbial phosphorus; microbial diversity; soil water potential; spodosol; flatwoods; lower coastal plain; forest soils,FOREST SOILS; SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS; BIOMASS PHOSPHORUS; FLORIDA SPODOSOL; SPODIC HORIZON; BACTERIAL; RETENTION; MOISTURE; ALUMINUM; PASTURE,"The acidic, sandy soils in the southeastern US are phosphorus (P) limited for forest production and are commonly fertilized with P. There is no P retention capacity in the A horizon. However, microbial biomass may immobilize and retain P fertilizer before it is leached below seedling rooting depth making P fertilization more efficient. An accurate estimation of microbial P is dependent on measuring the K-p factor in the fumigation-extraction method. The overall purpose of this study was to examine the fumigation-extraction method for microbial P in acidic, forested, sandy soils. The three objective were: to determine which extractant was the most useful extracting microbial P by comparing the standard basic extractant, 0.5 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5, against several acidic and oxalate extractants; to evaluate whether soil water potential influenced the K-p factor; and to test whether the K-p factor differed by soil horizon within the profile of a representative Flatwoods Spodosol. Three millimolar oxalate was determined to be the preferred extractant due to its efficient removal of microbial P and ease of analysis. The K-P factor was dependent on soil water potential and horizon. The range in K-p at different water potentials using 3 mM oxalate was from 0.31 to 0.67 in the A horizon, 0.48 to 0.91 in the E horizon, and 0.22 to 0.45 in Bh horizon. The highest K-P factors tended to be at water potentials near saturation and under the driest condition. Differences in K-p were attributed to the influence that water potential and soil horizon had on microbial assemblages and diversity. Using a literature value of K-p, instead of measuring K-p directly, caused an overestimate of -7 to 63% in the A horizon, 63-160% in the E horizon and 7-32% in the Bh horizon. The best estimate of microbial P required that K-P be evaluated for specific soil conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

By cluster analysis of the metabolic and genomic fingerprints, the test strains were grouped into 13 Biolog and 11 AFLP clusters. Twenty-two strains in the Biolog method and 15 strains in the AFLP analysis were linked to eight and four reference species, respectively, out of the 28 included in the study. Most of the test strains (more than 80% of 110) were not related to any of the reference species by both methods. Forty-six test strains (42% of 110) were grouped into seven corresponding Biolog and AFLP clusters, suggesting that these groups represented the same strains, or in some cases clonal descendants of the same organisms. In contrast to the strains from S. sesban, isolates from Acacia spp. were represented in several Biolog and AFLP clusters indicating the promiscuous nature of the latter and widespread occurrence of compatible rhizobia in most of the soil sampling locations.

Incubating a forest humus soil at 25 C resulted in a decrease in the relative proportion (mol%) of the phospholipid fatty acid 18:2omega6,9 (a fungal marker molecule) within 3-6 months, indicating that fungal biomass was disappearing. Incubation at 5 degreesC resulted in essentially no change in the amount of 18:2omega6,9. The measurement of ergosterol, another fungal marker molecule, gave similar results. Incubation of different forest soils (pine, spruce and spruce/oak), and assuming that the disappearance of fungal biomass during this period of time was entirely due to EM fungi, resulted in an estimation of EM biomass of between 47 and 84% of the total fungal biomass in these soils. The humus layer had more EM biomass than deeper mineral layers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The soil was mixed with bacterial suspension for one week followed by an immobilization of each heavy metal for another week. The total binding and fractionation of heavy metals in soils were analyzed. As compared with the control, the retention of total Cu, Zn, and Cd in Red soil increased by 28, 16, and 28%, respectively, in the presence of rhizobia. The amount of exchangeable, NH4OAc-extractable, Mn oxides-bound and organic matter-bound Cu increased by 23-123%. There were significant decrease of exchangeable Cu and marked increases of NH4OAc-extractable and Mn oxide-bound Cu in Cinnamon soil with the presence of rhizobial cells, although no changes for the total retention of Cu were observed. The amount of exchangeable Zn in Red soil-rhizobia composite was 20% greater than that of the no-rhizobia soil. Addition of rhizobia also increased exchangeable Cd and specifically-adsorbed Cd by 25 and 93%, respectively, in Red soil. No considerable differences were found for the total immobilization of Zn and Cd as well as their distribution in various solid fractions of Cinnamon soil in the absence and presence of rhizobial cells. In terms of soil components, it is assumed that bacterial biomass had a relatively less impact on the species of heavy metals bound with Fe oxides. Results suggested that the retention and speciation of heavy metals in soil are governed largely by the interactions of bacteria with various inorganic and organic soil constituents. The data are useful in understanding the impact of microorganisms on the behavior, mobility and transformation of heavy metals in soil environments.","Huazhong Agr Univ, Fac Resources & Environm, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China","Huang, QY (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Fac Resources & Environm, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",,"Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012; Chen, Wenli/D-5625-2014",,,,,19,0,2,0,9,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Signaling substances communicating the N demand of the shoot to the roots are required in an integrated regulatory system. Beside phloem mobility, such signal compounds must have the potential to repress or increase nitrate uptake either at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Amino compounds cycling within the tree are involved in the regulation of nitrate uptake. In many tree species, inorganic N is generally assimilated in roots, and amino acids-the direct products of N assimilation-are transported in the xylem to the sites of N demand. If the quantity of amino acids transported to the above-ground parts of the tree exceeds shoot N demand, some amino compounds are reallocated to the roots by phloem transport. Particular amino compounds exert transcriptional and post-transcriptional control over nitrate uptake by roots. Induction of nitrate transporters is mediated by nitrate or nitrite, or both, and possibly also by cytokinins, which cycle within the tree and act as both root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root signals. This review focuses on tree-specific requirements for N regulation and signaling, as well as the link between carbon metabolism and nitrate uptake.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany","Rennenberg, H (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Georges-Kohler-Allee,Gebaude 053-054, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",heinz.rennenberg@ctp.uni-freiburg.de,"Kopriva, Stanislav/C-7401-2013; Rennenberg, Heinz/A-2083-2013; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008","Kopriva, Stanislav/0000-0002-7416-6551; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Rennenberg, Heinz/0000-0001-6224-2927",,,,102,61,61,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2004,24,12,,,,,1313,1321,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,877ST,WOS:000225591200001,15465694,,,,10/31/19J,"Barton, CVM; Montagu, KD",,,,"Barton, CVM; Montagu, KD",,,Detection of tree roots and determination of root diameters by ground penetrating radar under optimal conditions,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,GPR; nondestructive root measurement; radar antenna; root biomass,BIOMASS; SYSTEMS; PLANTATIONS; AUSTRALIA; UTILITY,"A tree's root system accounts for between 10 and 65% of its total biomass, yet our understanding of the factors that cause this proportion to vary is limited because of the difficulty encountered when studying tree root systems. There is a need to develop new sampling and measuring techniques for tree root systems. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) offers the potential for direct nondestructive measurements of tree root biomass and root distributions to be made. We tested the ability of GPR, with 500 MHz, 800 MHz and 1 GHz antennas, to detect tree roots and determine root size by burying roots in a 32 m(3) pit containing damp sand. Within this test bed, tree roots were buried in two configurations: (1) roots of various diameters (1-10 cm) were buried at a single depth (50 cm); and (2) roots of similar diameter (about 5 cm) were buried at various depths (15-155 cm). Radar antennas were drawn along transects perpendicular to the buried roots. Radar profile normalization, filtration and migration were undertaken based on standard algorithms. All antennas produced characteristic reflection hyperbolas on the radar profiles allowing visual identification of most root locations. The 800 MHz antenna resulted in the clearest radar profiles. An unsupervised, maximum-convexity migration algorithm was used to focus information contained in the hyperbolas back to a point. This resulted in a significant gain in clarity with roots appearing as discrete shapes, thereby reducing confusion due to overlapping of hyperbolas when many roots are detected. More importantly, parameters extracted from the resultant waveform through the center of a root correlated well with root diameter for the 500 MHz antenna, but not for the other two antennas. A multiple regression model based on the extracted parameters was calibrated on half of the data (R-2 = 0.89) and produced good predictions when tested on the remaining data. Root diameters were predicted with a root mean squared error of 0.6 cm, allowing detection and quantification of roots as small as 1 cm in diameter. An advantage of this processing technique is that it produces results independently of signal strength. These waveform parameters represent a major advance in the processing of GPR profiles for estimating root diameters. We conclude that enhanced data analysis routines combined with improvements in GPR hardware design could make GPR a valuable tool for studying tree root systems.","State Forests NSW, Forest Res & Dev Div, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia","Barton, CVM (reprint author), State Forests NSW, Forest Res & Dev Div, POB 100, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia.",craigba@sfnsw.gov.au,"Barton, Craig/B-7026-2008",,,,,20,80,88,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2004,24,12,,,,,1323,1331,,10.1093/treephys/24.12.1323,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,877ST,WOS:000225591200002,15465695,,,,10/31/19J,"Leuschner, C; Coners, H; Icke, R",,,,"Leuschner, C; Coners, H; Icke, R",,,In situ measurement of water absorption by fine roots of three temperate trees: species differences and differential activity of superficial and deep roots,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fagus sylvatica; Picea abies; Quercus petraea; root surface area; water transport; water uptake,OSMOTIC PROPERTIES; WOODY ROOTS; SAP; FLOW; SOIL; FOREST; OAK; SYSTEMS; BEECH; DEPTH,"The spatial heterogeneity of water uptake by fine roots under field conditions was analyzed in situ with miniature sap flow gauges in a mature beech-oak-spruce mixed stand. Sap flow rate (J), sap flow density (J(d)), and root surface-area-specific flow rate (uptake rate, J(s)) were measured for eight to 10 small-diameter roots (3-4 mm) per species in the organic layer (superficial roots) and in the mineral soil (30-80 cm, deep roots) during four months in summer 1999. We calculated J(s) by relating J to the surface area of the section of the fine root system distal to the position of the gauge on the root. When measured synchronously, roots of the three species did not differ significantly in mean J(s), although oak roots tended to have lower rates. However, J(d) decreased in the sequence spruce > beech > oak in most measurement periods. Microscopic investigation revealed differences in fine root anatomy that may partly explain the species differences in J(d) and J(s). Oak fine roots had a thicker periderm than beech and spruce roots of similar diameter and spruce roots had fewer fine branch rootlets than the other species. Synchronously recorded J(d) and J(s) of nearby roots of the same tree species showed large differences in flow with coefficients of variation from 25 to 150% that could not be explained by patchy distribution of soil water. We hypothesize that the main cause of the large spatial heterogeneity in root water uptake is associated with differences between individual roots in morphology and ultrastructure of the root cortex that affect root radial and root-soil interface conductivities. The high intraspecific variation in J(s) may mask species differences in root water uptake. Superficial roots of all species typically had about five times higher J(d) than deep roots of the same species. However, J(s) values were similar for superficial and deep roots in beech and spruce because small diameter roots of both species were more branched in the organic layer than in mineral soil. In oak, deep roots had lower J(s) (maximum of 100 g m(-2) day(-1)) than superficial roots (about 1000 g m(-2) day(-1)). We conclude that temperate tree species in mixed stands have different water uptake capacities. Water flow in the rhizosphere of forests appears to be a highly heterogeneous process that is influenced by both tree species and differences in uptake rates of individual roots within a species.","Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,,,,,,31,14,14,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2004,24,12,,,,,1359,1367,,10.1093/treephys/24.12.1359,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,877ST,WOS:000225591200005,15465698,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Vasilas, B; Vasilas, L; Thompson, J; Rizzo, A; Fuhrmann, J; Evans, T; Pesek, J; Kunkle, K",,,,"Vasilas, B; Vasilas, L; Thompson, J; Rizzo, A; Fuhrmann, J; Evans, T; Pesek, J; Kunkle, K",,,Ectomycorrhizal mantles as indicators of hydrology for jurisdictional wetland determinations,WETLANDS,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhizae; mantles; seasonally-saturated wetlands; hydrology indicators; drained hydric soils; wetland delineation,MYCORRHIZAE; WATER; FUNGI; SOIL,"Ectomycorrhizae are symbiotic relationships between soil fungi and higher plants. Evidence of the symbiosis is the presence of a 'mantle,' a hyphal layer that covers root tips, and a change in root morphology. The potential use of ectomycorrhizal mantles as hydrology indicators for wetland determinations was evaluated on the Delmarva Coastal Plain (Delaware and eastern shores of Maryland and Virginia, USA) over three seasons. In theory, the distribution of mantles with soil depth should vary from uplands to wetlands in most years, as mantle development is considered to be impeded by anaerobic conditions. At four forested locations, plots were set up in seasonally-saturated wetlands and adjacent uplands and drained wetlands (twelve sub-sites). Plots were evaluated according to the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual for soils, plant community, and hydrology to identify a jurisdictional classification. Hydrology was further addressed using automated monitoring wells (twice daily readings), and anaerobic conditions were confirmed via platinum electrodes. Plant roots (Pinus taeda was targeted) were sampled via spade slices in March and August each year and separated by depth: 0 horizon, 0-5 cm, 510 cm, 10-15 cm, and 15-20 cm. Roots were evaluated for the presence of mantles. A threshold depth of 5 cm was identified. From a total of 892 roots with mantles in uplands (including effectively-drained wetland sub-sites), 253 (28%) were found below the threshold depth. For wetlands (including one ineffectively-drained wetland), seven of 331 roots with mantles (2%) were found below the threshold depth. Temporal and spatial variability in mantle data was common; however, mantles consistently occurred at greater depths where seasonally high water tables were lower. We concluded that mantle depth has potential as a hydrology indicator.","Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; USDA, Nat Resources Conservat Serv 339, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; Maryland Dept Environm, Wetlands & Waterways Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; Univ Delaware, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Vasilas, B (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Townsend Hall,541 S Coll Ave, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",,,,,,,25,5,5,0,9,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,DEC,2004,24,4,,,,,784,795,,10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0784:EMAIOH]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,886WW,WOS:000226264700008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Williamson, TN; Graham, RC; Shouse, PJ",,,,"Williamson, TN; Graham, RC; Shouse, PJ",,,Effects of a chaparral-to-grass conversion on soil physical and hydrologic properties after four decades,GEODERMA,,,English,Article,,,,,,A-horizons; Ehrharta calycina; pedogenesis; water content; surface cover; wetting front,SCALE; FIRE,"Forty years after conversion from chaparral to perennial veldt grass in the San Dimas Experimental Forest, we compared land surface and soil properties between areas of the two vegetation types. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of this vegetation conversion on the soil physical properties likely to impact zero-order watershed hydrology. In three watersheds of each vegetation type, surface cover and soils were described within five watershed elements. Surface cover is approximately 90% in both vegetation types, but the frequency of individual plants is significantly higher in converted watersheds, leading to significantly lower variability in surface cover between grass watersheds. In chaparral watersheds, very fine to very coarse roots extend laterally and downwards in all directions. Only very fine roots emanate from grass, forming a dense fibrous mass that is concentrated below individual plants. In areas converted to grass vegetation, A-horizon bulk density is significantly higher due to the development of transitional AB-horizons that are absent from chaparral areas. Vertical changes between the surface soil and subsoil are more gradual under grass than under chaparral. The significantly higher frequency of grass plants caused concurrent transformation of much of the converted areas, removing the layered effect that is observed in the chaparral soils and allowing spatially homogeneous infiltration, distribution and storage of soil water.

Across all plots, annual soil respiration was not correlated with aboveground net primary production (R(2)=0.06, P>0.1) but it was moderately correlated with belowground net primary production (R(2)=0.46, P<0.001). Despite the wide range in temperature and precipitation regimes experienced by these forests, all exhibited similar soil respiration per unit live fine root biomass, with about 5 g of carbon respired each year per 1 g of fine root carbon (R(2)=0.45, P<0.001). Annual soil respiration was only weakly correlated with dead carbon pools such as forest floor and mineral soil carbon (R(2)=0.14 and 0.12, respectively). Trends between soil respiration, production, and root mass among age classes within forest type were inconsistent and do not always reflect cross-site trends. These results are consistent with a growing appreciation that soil respiration is strongly influenced by the supply of carbohydrates to roots and the rhizosphere, and that some regional patterns of soil respiration may depend more on belowground carbon allocation than the abiotic constraints imposed on subsequent metabolism.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Campbell, JL (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",john.campbell@orst.edu,"Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984",,,,53,44,49,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Using a time-course approach, we investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), soil warming and drought and their interactions on root length colonized (RLC) by mycorrhizal fungi and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) production. Plant growth responded as would be expected to the environmental manipulations. There was no plant growth-independent effect of eCO(2) on mycorrhizal colonization; however, EMH production was stimulated by eCO(2), i.e. there was increased partitioning of below-ground carbon to the EMH. Soil warming directly stimulated both percent RLC by the Glomus species and EMH density; soil warming did not affect RLC by the fine endophyte. Drought decreased percent RLC for the fine endophyte, but not for the Glomus species. The presence of one mycorrhizal fungus did not affect the response of another to the environmental variables. There was no evidence of any interactive effects of the environmental variables on RLC, but there were significant environmental interactions on EMH production. In particular, the stimulatory effects of eCO(2) and soil warming on EMH density were not additive. The results are discussed in terms of the soil carbon cycle, highlighting some crucial gaps in our knowledge. If future environmental changes affect mycorrhizal fungal turnover and respiration, then this could have important implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle.","Riso Natl Lab, Plant Res Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Univ Copenhagen, Dept Microbiol, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark","Staddon, PL (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",philip.staddon@nottingham.ac.uk,"Jakobsen, Iver/F-1116-2011; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535; Staddon, Philip/0000-0002-7968-3179",,,,82,51,58,3,92,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We measured the pool size and leaching of inorganic N at each site for 2 years and the net N mineralization 1 and 2 years after trenching.

However, the net nitrification at the trenched cypress sites increased remarkably at the deeper horizons in comparison with that at the control sites. Enhanced nitrification might result from improved ammonium availability through root exclusion. Net N mineralization at the trenched cedar sites decreased more than 60% compared with that at the control sites 2 years after trenching. Higher nitrification potential at the cedar plantation and enhanced nitrification potential at the trenched cypress sites never resulted in increased leaching of N, due to added fine root litter which acted as an immobilization agent for excess N, thus preventing N loss.","[Yamashita, Tamon] Shimane Univ, Educ & Res Ctr Biol Resources, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Kasuya, Nobuhiko] Kyoto Prefectural Univ, Lab Forest Ecol, Kyoto 606, Japan; [Nishimura, Sen] Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kl, Malaysia; [Takeda, Hiroshi] Kyoto Univ, Lab Forest Ecol, Kyoto, Japan","Yamashita, T (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Educ & Res Ctr Biol Resources, 1060 Nishi Kawatsu, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",tamonyam@life.shimane-u.ac.jp,,,,,,27,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",1341-6979,,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

The objective of this study was to describe mycorrhizal colonization patterns in contrasting grazing situations (exclosure and continuous grazing) and topographical positions (upland and lowland) in the flooding pampa (Argentina). We determined the mycorrhizal colonization of the community as a whole and of Dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.), a highly palatable, dominant species. We characterized colonization by the proportion of root length occupied by fungi and their different structures. At the community level, there was higher total colonization in the grazed area than in the exclosure. In contrast, Dallis grass showed higher total colonization and higher proportion of vesicles and arbuscules in the exclosure than in the grazed area. For both levels, colonization was higher in the lowland than in the upland position. Differences were observed only in winter and spring, not in summer. Our results show that 1) continuous grazing is associated with an increase of mycorrhizal colonization at the community level and 2) community-level patterns of mycorrhizal colonization cannot be inferred from dominant species. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of AM abundance at the plant community level under contrasting long-term grazing conditions in a subhumid grassland.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Recursos Naturales, IFEVA, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Grigera, G (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Recursos Naturales, IFEVA, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ggrigeria@ifeva.edu.ar,,,,,,32,12,12,0,13,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

Sequences from fungi cultured from Neuwiedia roots and from direct peloton amplifications were analyzed cladistically with sequences determined from reference fungal collections and published sequences. The fungi from Newiedia are referred to the heterobasidiomycetous orders Tulasnellales and Ceratobasidiales, indicating that apostasioids utilize the same fungi as other photosynthetic orchids. The majority of Neuwiedia mycobionts came together in a clade with Tulasnella species, but some were most closely related to Thanatephorus. In some cases members of these two clades were isolated from the same orchid plant, providing another example of multiple mycobionts occurring in a single plant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The use of C-13 depleted CO2 (delta(13)C = -30%) in a free air CO2 enrichment experiment in a mature deciduous forest permitted us to trace the carbon transfer from tree crowns to the rhizosphere of 100-120 years old trees. During the first season of CO2 enrichment the CO2 released from soil originated substantially from concurrent assimilation. The small contribution of recent carbon in fine roots suggests a much slower fine root turnover than is often assumed. C-13 abundance in soil air correlated best with temperature data taken from 4 to 10 days before air sampling time and is thus rapidly available for root and rhizosphere respiration. The spatial variability of delta(13)C in soil air showed relationships to above ground tree types such as conifers versus broad-leaved trees. Considering the complexity and strong overlap of roots from different individuals in a forest, this finding opens an exciting new possibility of associating respiration with different species. What might be seen as signal noise does in fact contain valuable information on the spatial heterogeneity of tree-soil interaction.","Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem Stable Isotopes & Ecosyst Flux, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Siegwolf, R (reprint author), Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem Stable Isotopes & Ecosyst Flux, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",rolf.siegwolf@psi.ch,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014; Saurer, Matthias/C-6724-2018; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009","Saurer, Matthias/0000-0002-3954-3534; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651",,,,38,87,90,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2004,141,3,,,,,489,501,,10.1007/s00442-004-1674-4,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,863JJ,WOS:000224557300014,15309613,,,,10/31/19J,"Sakamoto, K; Iijima, T; Higuchi, R",,,,"Sakamoto, K; Iijima, T; Higuchi, R",,,Use of specific phospholipid fatty acids for identifying and quantifying the external hyphae of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora rosea,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; external hyphae; Gigaspora; Glomus; phospholipid fatty acid; specific marker,METHYL-ESTER PROFILES; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; STEROL COMPOSITION; AM FUNGI; SOIL; BIOMASS; MYCELIUM; ERGOSTEROL; INFECTION,"The external hypha of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, extending from roots out into soil, is an important structure in the uptake of phosphate from the depletion zone around each root. In this paper, we analysed some phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) derived from external hyphae of four AM fungi (Glomus etunicatum, Glomus clarum, Gigaspora margarita and Gigaspora rosea) to find fatty acids which may be useful as specific markers for identifying and quantify the external hyphae of Gigaspora species. Leek (Allium porrum L.) seedlings inoculated with each AM fungus were grown in river sand. Sand samples were collected and four PLFAs (16:1omega5, 18:1omega9, 20:1omega9 and 20:4) in the sand were analysed. In addition, the hyphal biomass in the sand was determined by the direct microscopic method. PLFAs 18:1omega9 and 20:4 were found in all the AM-inoculated and non-inoculated sand samples. PLFA 16:1omega5 was detected in the sand inoculated with G. etunicatum, G. clarum and Gi. rosea. PLFA 20:1omega9 was detected only in the sand inoculated with Gi. rosea. PLFAs 16:1omega5 and 20:1omega9 were not found in the sand inoculated with Gi. margarita. The amount of PLFA 20:1omega9 was closely correlated with the amount of biomass of external hyphae of Gi. rosea (r = 0.937, P < 0.001), whereas no correlation was observed for PLFA 16:1omega5. The 20:1omega9 content of Gi. rosea was approximately 6.56 nmol mg(-1) hyphal biomass. We suggest that PLFA 20:1omega9 can be used as a specific marker for identifying and quantifying the external hyphae of Gi. rosea, at least in controlled experimental systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for twenty weeks under full factorial combinations of mycorrhizal inoculum, fungicide, and fertilizer. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased Sapium growth but caused zero to negative growth changes of the five native species. This suggests that Sapium may gain unusual benefits from mycorrhizal associations.

Don) are common species for plantation forestry in Japan. Cypress is conventionally planted on sites of low fertility whereas for cedar high fertility sites are used. Objectives of this study were to compare the productivities of cypress and cedar plantations grown on adjacent sites where common properties of soils, such as pH values and C and N contents, were similar, and to relate the N cycling at their site with productivities. The stem diameter of trees, aboveground litter production and fine root biomass were measured as indices of forest productivity. Parameters of N cycling included pools of total N and mineral N (ammonium + nitrate), annual N leaching, and potentially mineralizable N. The radial stem increment of the two tree species was similar. However, cedar site had higher total basal area and annual basal increment than cypress site reflecting higher tree density on the cedar site. Aboveground litter, fine root biomass. soil organic matter, and N turnover were higher on the cedar site than on the cypress site. However, litter production and fine root biomass per unit basal area was greater at the cypress site. Phenological pattern of stem growth and periodical litter production were similar for both species during the study period (1992-2000), but showed distinct annual variations caused by the fluctuation in the ambient temperature and precipitation. Mineral N content and the N mineralization potential were greater on the cedar site, indicating greater N availability and higher total tree productivity at the cedar site than those at the cypress site. When provided with more space in the canopy to expand more needles and in the soil to develop more fine roots to exploit sufficient resources, the individual cypress trees have the potential to grow faster. On fertile site and at lower tree density, thicker logs of cypress might be yielded. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Although this has been attributed to the emergent habit of Nothofagus, here we explore the possible role of belowground resource partitioning. We measured fine root biomass and vertical distribution of emergent Nothofagus dombeyi and its canopy associates in an old-growth rain forest, to test for evidence of vertical partitioning of belowground resources. Fine roots were sampled to a depth of 80 cm in three plots. Total fine root biomass averaged 4685 gm(-1) ,N. dombeyi contributing about 22% of this figure. Roots were concentrated mainly in the upper horizons, with 69% of the total occurring at <30 cm. However, fine root biomass of N. dombeyi declined significantly more steeply with depth than that of its associates did, the average contribution of N. dombeyi to total fine root biomass decreasing from 29% in the uppermost 10 cm, to little more than 1% at 70-80 cm. The observed differences in rooting depth could be linked to differences in mycorrhizal syndromes: ectomycorrhizal Nothofagus might be expected to be more shallow-rooted than the VAM and nonmycorrhizal canopy species, because of the reportedly greater ability of ectomycorrhizal species to assimilate organic nitrogen from the litter layer. A degree of belowground resource use complementarity may therefore minimize competition between N. dombeyi and its associates. and could thus contribute to the additive basal area and productivity observed in these forests.

During the single low-intensity backing fire temperatures in the lethal range ( > 60degreesC) were reached only at the surface of the mineral soil. Largely as a result the fire had no significant effect on the fine root system to a depth of 25 cm, as determined by a combination of video imaging in minirhizotrons and soil coring. To understand better the susceptibility of roots to injury by fire, individual fine roots of red pine trees were exposed to high-temperature (45-62.5degreesC) water for 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 min. Root death was assessed 1, 2 and 3 weeks following exposure to high temperatures. Heat-induced mortality of fine roots was apparent within 1 week of exposure to temperatures of approximately 52.5degreesC and higher, the amount of mortality directly relating to exposure time. The effect of exposure time was minimal below this temperature after 1 week. Two weeks after exposure there was a general decrease in root survival with increased time of exposure, even at the lowest treatment temperature. Because non-treated roots also began dying 3 weeks after the study began, effects of heat exposure must be evaluated before other causes of root mortality become significant. The technique helped define the time-temperature relationship of heat-induced mortality of red pine roots in an ecological context. Low intensity fires with a short residence time - e.g., our experimental fire-do not produce the necessary combination of high temperature and time of exposure to induce significant root injury in red pine.

Their corresponding pHs were 5.50, 4.91, 5.64, 5.28, 5.49 and 4.60. By using a plant trap method, a total of 25 soybean rhizobia were isolated from the soil above an altitude of 1,500 m and all identified to be Sinorhizobium fredii. Their genetic biodiversity was characterized by 16S-23S rDNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and random amplification DNA (RAPD) analysis. All the tested strains produced a 2.1 kb 16S-23S rDNA ITS fragment. After digestion with three restriction endonucleases (HaeIII, MspI and CfoI), respectively, great variations in 16S-23S rDNA ITS PCR-RFLP patterns were observed. The tested strains could be differentiated into 11 ITS genotypes. The genotypes of rhizobia were not related to geographical location. Twelve primers were applied to RAPD analysis and a dendrogram was obtained, showing that all the strains (including reference strain S. fredii USDA205) were divided into two diverging groups. Moreover, each group could be further divided into two subgroups. Both RAPD and 16S-23S rDNA ITS PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that a high degree of genetic diversity existed among S. fredii strains isolated from Shennongjia virgin soils. Since Shennongjia is an unexploited forest region in central China and the gene centre of soybean is located in China, the symbiotic genes harboured by these strains may be of great importance and the rich diversity of these strains might contribute to the adaptation of soybean to an alpine environment.","Huanzhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; Huazhong Agr Univ, Fac Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; Acad Hubei Forestry Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China","Chen, WL (reprint author), Huanzhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",wlchen@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012; Chen, Wenli/D-5625-2014",,,,,14,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

This study uses aboveground tree metrics and spatial relationships to improve core-based estimates of stand-level fine-root biomass. Using the multiple-tree Ribbens model for pure stands, the approach assumes that the total fine-root biomass at a given point is the additive contribution of the nearest dominant trees and that fine-root biomass for a single tree depends on the distance to the trunk and its size. A Monte Carlo random sampling technique, or sampling on a regular grid, is used to estimate the average fine-root biomass across the stand. We illustrate the applicability of this approach by using it on root-core data from a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stand and a western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) stand in the Pacific Northwest. We conclude that stand-level fine-root biomass is adequately estimated using the Ribbens model. Unlike the model-based estimate for stand-level fine-root biomass, the accuracy and precision of the arithmetic mean of the coring samples depends on the spatial heterogeneity of root distributions and the representativeness of the root coring samples.","US EPA, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Lee, EH (reprint author), US EPA, 200 SW 35th St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",Lee.EHenry@epa.gov,,,,,,22,4,5,0,0,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We use this model to explore the shift from mutualism to parasitism in plant-mycorrhizae interactions across gradients of soil fertility. We demonstrate two mechanisms by which increased soil fertility may cause interactions to change from mutualistic to parasitic: as relative benefits to the plant decrease with increasing soil fertility, the interaction between the fungus and its host turns parasitic; with two fungal species-one a mutualist and the other a cheater-increasing soil fertility can favor the cheater if mutualists have faster growth rates than cheaters.

However, few studies have experimentally examined the consequences of interspecific root interactions for these important mutualists in the field. We used a trenching experiment to examine how belowground interactions between pinyon pine and one-seed juniper affected the ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities of pinyon pine. Three major findings emerged: (1) pinyons responded to the reduction of juniper roots with a near doubling of fine root biomass in just two years, (2) this increase in pinyon roots translated into a potential two-fold increase in EM abundance, and (3) the EM fungal communities of trenched trees differed significantly from controls largely due to a decrease in ascomycete fungi. Because species of EM fungi vary in the benefits they provide, changes in EM communities could have long-term consequences for host-plant establishment, growth, and survival. Belowground interactions with juniper may contribute to the high mortality of pinyons and the reduced diversity of EM fungi associated with recent droughts.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Haskins, KE (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Kristin.Haskins@nau.edu,,,,,,33,30,30,2,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2004,85,10,,,,,2687,2692,,10.1890/04-0306,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,867LS,WOS:000224844700007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Callaway, RM; Ridenour, WM",,,,"Callaway, RM; Ridenour, WM",,,Novel weapons: invasive success and the evolution of increased competitive ability,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; EXOTIC PLANT INVASION; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; BETULA-PENDULA; PICEA-ABIES; SOIL BIOTA; ALLELOPATHY; HERBIVORES,"When introduced to new habitats by humans, some plant species become much more dominant. This is primarily attributed to escape from specialist consumers. Release from these specialist enemies is also thought by some to lead to the evolution of increased competitive ability, driven by a decrease in the plant's resource allocation to consumer defense and an increase in allocation to size or fecundity. Here, we discuss a new theory for invasive success - the ""novel weapons hypothesis"". We propose that some invaders transform because they possess novel biochemical weapons that function as unusually powerful allelopathic agents, or as mediators of new plant-soil microbial interactions. Root exudates that are relatively ineffective against their natural neighbors because of adaptation, may be highly inhibitory to newly encountered plants in invaded communities. In other words, the novel weapons of some plant invaders provide them with an advantage that may arise from differences in the regional coevolutionary trajectories of plant communities. Furthermore, the selective advantage of possessing a novel weapon may result in rapid evolution of that weapon - for example, the production of greater quantities of allelopathic or antimicrobial root exudates. Direct selection of competitive traits provides an alternative to the ""grow versus defend"" trade-offs that underpin the theory of the evolution of increased competitive ability.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ray.callaway@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,71,750,835,18,542,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1540-9295,,,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

In the beginning of the experiment, all experimental trees were 7 years old and during the experiment the trees were growing in sandy field soil and fertilized regularly. In general, elevated O-3 caused soil CO2 efflux stimulation during most measurement days and this stimulation enhanced towards the end of the experiment. The overall soil respiration response to CO2 was dependent on the genotype, as the soil CO2 efflux below clone 80 trees was enhanced and below clone 4 trees was decreased under elevated CO2 treatments. Like the O-3 impact, this clonal difference in soil respiration response to CO2 increased as the experiment progressed. Although the O-3 impact did not differ significantly between clones, a significant time x clone x CO(2)x O-3 interaction revealed that the O-3-induced stimulation of soil respiration was counteracted by elevated CO2 in clone 4 on most measurement days, whereas in clone 80, the effect of elevated CO2 and O-3 in combination was almost constantly additive during the 3-year experiment. Altogether, the root or above-ground biomass results were only partly parallel with the observed soil CO2 efflux responses. In conclusion, our data show that O-3 impacts may appear first in the below-ground processes and that relatively long-term O-3 exposure had a cumulative effect on soil CO2 efflux. Although the soil respiration response to elevated CO2 depended on the tree genotype as a result of which the O-3 stress response might vary considerably within a single tree species under elevated CO2, the present experiment nonetheless indicates that O-3 stress is a significant factor affecting the carbon cycling in northern forest ecosystems.","Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, Suonenjoki Res Stn, FIN-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland","Kasurinen, A (reprint author), Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, POB 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",Anne.Kasurinen@uku.fi,,,,,,55,27,50,1,23,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The CO2 treatment was crossed with a two-level nitrogen (N) fertilization treatment. In the tenth year, soil samples were collected on three occasions through the growing season to assess the impact of eCO(2) and N fertilization on mycorrhizal fungal abundance. Soil moisture content, which varied with harvest date, was linked to the vegetation type and was higher under eCO(2). Root weight density was affected by vegetation type: lower for clover, higher for grass. Root weight density was stimulated by eCO(2) and decreased by high N fertilization. The percent root length colonized by mycorrhizal fungi was lowest in the clover plots and highest in the grass plots. High N significantly decreased root length colonized. There was no overall effect of eCO(2) on root length colonized; however, there was a significant eCO(2)x N interaction: eCO(2) increased root length colonized at high N, but decreased root length colonized at low N. Extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density was linked to soil moisture content. Extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density was not affected by eCO(2) or high N individually, but as for root length colonized, there was a significant eCO(2)x N interaction: eCO(2) increased extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal density at low N but not at high N. These environmental effects on root colonization and external mycorrhizal hyphae were independent of soil moisture content and root weight density. This field study demonstrated a significant mediating effect of N fertilization on the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to eCO(2) irrespective of any change in root biomass.","Riso Natl Lab, Plant Res Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Staddon, PL (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",philip.staddon@nottingham.ac.uk,"Jakobsen, Iver/F-1116-2011; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535",,,,62,20,24,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Experiments in shadehouses were used to examine the influence of light and soil source (beneath and away from conspecific adults) on mortality and growth of its seedlings in relation to fungal pathogens and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization. 2 The experiment in Ghana included treatments for light (2% and 20% of unshaded irradiance), three soil sources (under female, under male and 200 m distant from adults), and two different fungicide treatments. 3 The results showed significant effects of irradiance, soil source and fungicide on both seedling mortality and accumulated biomass. Biomass was greater and mortality reduced at higher irradiance. Fungicide application reduced mortality in 2% irradiance, but had no significant effects at 20%, although AM infection of seedlings grown in soils from beneath adults was severely reduced. Mortality was greatest in soil from beneath female trees and least in soil distant from adult conspecifics. However, biomass in 20% irradiance was greater in soil from beneath females, possibly because of enhanced AM colonization: seedlings had a significantly higher percentage root length colonized by AM fungi beneath adult conspecifics, and biomass accumulation was significantly correlated with root length colonized by AM fungi. 4 There were significant interactions amongst light, soil source and fungicide treatments that attest to the complexity of spatial effects on seedling establishment in tropical forest. Whilst there was clear evidence of pathogen-mediated effects that provides support for Janzen-Connell spacing mechanisms, and escape from the parent tree increases the chances of arriving in gaps, spatial differences in AM fungal communities may act in the opposite direction and enhance seedling growth close to adult conspecifics. 5 The complexity of interactions between abiotic and biotic factors and the way in which these factors can vary spatially to affect seedling recruitment may be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests.","CEH Edinburgh, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Hood, LA (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Cruickshank Bldg,St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",lorrainehood@yahoo.com,,,,,,40,61,66,0,36,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Despite the phylogenetic diversity among both the hosts and the microsymbionts of these symbioses, certain developmental and physiological imperatives must be met for successful mutualisms. In this review, phylogenetic and ecological aspects of the four symbioses are first addressed, and then the symbioses are contrasted and compared in regard to infection and symbio-organ development, supply of carbon to the microsymbionts, regulation of 02 flux to the microsymbionts, and transfer of fixed-N to the hosts. Although similarities exist in the genetics, development, and functioning of the symbioses, it is evident that there is great diversity in many aspects of these root-based N2-fixing symbioses. Each symbiosis can be admired for the elegant means by which the host plant and microsymbiont integrate to form the mutualistic relationships so important to the functioning of the biosphere.","Univ Manitoba, Dept Plant Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Stockholm, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Vessey, JK (reprint author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Plant Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",k_vessey@umanitoba.ca,"Pawlowski, Katharina/U-9955-2017","Pawlowski, Katharina/0000-0003-2693-885X",,,,244,50,54,1,31,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2004,266,2-Jan,,,,,205,230,,,,,26,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,888PA,WOS:000226385500020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Tomioka, R; Takenaka, C",,,,"Tomioka, R; Takenaka, C",,,Difference in response to aluminum among Japanese coniferous species,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Abies firma; aluminum response; Chamaecyparis obtusa; Cryptomeria japonica,CALLOSE FORMATION; PLANTS; ROOTS; TOXICITY; TOLERANCE; SENSITIVITY; CELLS; RESISTANCE; PARAMETER; SEEDLINGS,"Seedlings of Chamaecyparis obtusa, Cryptomeria japonica D. Don, and Abies firma Sieb. et Zucc. were grown hydroponically for 4 weeks in the presence or absence of aluminum (Al) and with or without reduced pH. Under exposure to Al, root and shoot growth of C. obtusa was enhanced. A. firma showed the same tendency as C. obtusa, though not significantly. Only in C. japonica, growth was reduced with Al, especially shoot growth. In all the species, callose production in the root tips was observed in the presence of Al. A positive correlation was observed between the relative root callose content and relative root growth (r = 0.83), and significant root elongation with Al treatment was observed in all the species. Therefore, it is considered that callose deposition in the root tips of these species may not indicate the Al-induced root cell injury causing root growth inhibition. The highest callose content in the root tip and strong callose fluorescence in the epidermis and zones of cell contact were observed in C. obtusa. Since the Al translocation rate from roots to leaves was the lowest in C. obtusa and since significant growth enhancement was observed in the presence of Al, it is possible that the accumulation of callose in the root epidermis and in the zones of cell contact is related to Al-resistance in C. obtusa.","Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Tomioka, R (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",,,,,,,34,2,2,0,0,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

A species may become invasive when a new site provides the potential for positive rates of population growth. This may be the case of several Agave species introduced to Spain in the 1940s. In this paper we document factors that promote large increases of populations of these species, and their effects on native plant communities in two sites of SE Spain. Results showed higher rhizome and bulbil production, and higher establishment rates by agaves in sandy soils than in clay soils. In their native habitats, agaves have low establishment rates and sandy soils are rare. This suggests that sandy soils are an opportunity which releases the clonal reproduction of Agave. The effects of agaves on the physiological performance and reproduction of native species were negative, positive or neutral, depending on the size and rooting depth of neighbours. Assemblages of native species growing within Agave stands had lower diversity than non-invaded sites. Our data show that Agave stands have positive growth rates in SE Spain, and suggest that sandy soils are a niche dimension enhancing the invasion in these new habitats.","Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, ECOBIOSIS, Concepcion, Chile; CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria, Spain","Badano, EI (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, ECOBIOSIS, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",ebadano@udec.cl,"Badano, Ernesto I./C-3585-2013; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008","Badano, Ernesto I./0000-0002-9591-0984; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827",,,,34,20,27,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1366-9516,,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

The feedback between transpiration, carbon gain and soil moisture through a plant gas exchange simulator coupled to a stochastic soil water balance model is described. In previous studies stomatal responses to environment are modeled through an empirical relationship, based on correlative behavior with respect to net assimilation rate, that has been shown to accurately predict gas exchange rates under a range of climatic conditions. In these models, however, the parameter that controls the level of conductance attained for a given assimilation rate (g(F)) is unknown under drought conditions, precluding their application to water limited ecosystems. In this article I propose an algorithm to compute this parameter based on the assumption that canopy conductance must convey to a strategy of long-term carbon gain maximization and avoidance of mortality by the plant, the unit of natural selection. Two possible negative feedback control strategies between g(F) and soil moisture, depending on whether the plant senses the environment via leaf or soil water potential are tested. It is found that a strategy operating via leaf potential is more effective from a whole plant perspective than direct sensing of soil water status. The parameter g(F) provides an integrative description of various processes (e.g. concentration of root generated compounds) leading to stomatal closure. Thus this result supports the view that stomatal control requires both hydraulic and chemical signaling to be effective. Simulations based on a negative feedback via leaf potential predict linear dependency between g(F) and soil water potential during the dry period as reported by detailed empirical studies on g(F) variation. Comparison of the whole plant simulator against a leaf based optimization model suggests that stomatal conductance represents an optimal solution of a hierarchically structured system that operates at two temporal scales. At short time scales (minutes to hours) stomata perform a sub-optimal system strategy that allows the plant to optimize water loss per unit of carbon gain. Simultaneously, adjustment of canopy conductance to soil water status allows the plant to maximize carbon gain and avoid mortality at longer time scales (hours to days). These results are relevant both to understand how plants integrate process across functional levels and to proper description of soil water resources in mechanistic biosphere vegetation dynamic models.

C nepalensis seedlings were subjected to four drought cycles of 7, 14, 2 1, and 28-days, and to one control level (watered on alternate days) in a glasshouse. The seedlings failed to survive a 28-days drought during summer. Osmotic adjustment (defined as the decrease in osmotic potential at zero or full turgor in response to water deficit) was measured as the difference between the osmotic potential of seedlings watered on alternate days (control) and those subjected to 21-days drought cycle. Seedlings subjected to 21-days drought had a predawn water potential of -2.60MPa, and showed an osmotic adjustment of - 1.95 MPa at full turgor and -2.17 MPa at zero turgor. The growth of seedlings was positively related to moisture and with water potential. With decline in soil moisture the root:shoot ratio increased while leaf weight ratio decreased. Leaf characteristics, such as leaf number, leaf area, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and leaf drop, were also affected by moisture stress. This study has indicated that osmotic adjustment is a major adaptive mechanism of C nepalensis that aids successful regeneration of seedlings in degraded sites with inhospitable soil conditions.

Using minirhizotrons and soil root cores, fine root dynamics were measured in a chronosequence of reference and restoration AWC wetlands to compare trends in ecosystem development after canopy harvest. Seasonal fine root abundance, production, and mortality were sampled during a 439-day period in one restoration and three reference AWC wetlands. Soil cores were collected to measure fine root biomass and to determine allometric relationships between root length and biomass. Significant seasonal variation of root dynamics was observed in the young reference and restoration sites. The mature and intermediate-aged sites exhibited little seasonal variability in root abundance and mortality. Root production was variable but not seasonally consistent. Results suggest that root dynamics become less seasonal as AWC communities shift from herbaceous to woody vegetation dominance. No trend in fine root abundance along the chronosequence was observed, suggesting that roots rapidly reestablish following tree harvest. Measurements of annual root length production suggest increasing annual production with decreasing stand age. However, a reversal of this trend was observed when using production estimates calculated from minirhizotron measurements and root length-mass relationships. These findings underscore the importance of supplementing minirhizotron data with root allometric relationships when analyzing vegetation gradients. Overall, results indicate substantial differences in the form and quantity of root contributions to soil organic matter in the restoration site compared to that in the reference chronosequence. Higher initial planting densities of AWC are recommended to achieve similar contributions of roots to soil organic matter accumulation in the restoration site.","Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Biol Chem & Environm Sci, Newport News, VA 23606 USA","Rodgers, HL (reprint author), S Florida Water Management Dist, 3301 Gun Club Rd,POB 24680, W Palm Beach, FL 33416 USA.",lrodgers@sfwmd.gov,,,,,,53,9,10,0,19,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950 four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next. Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit front viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information.

Acidity due to simulated sea level rise of 30 cm was more serious in fine soil than that in coarse soil. Propagules of K. candel had more rapid establishments under high water level and prolonged inundation, but establishments of B. gymnorrhiza were not significantly influenced by tide condition. Water level rise of 30 cm and prolonged inundation stimulated early growth especially in stem height increments during the first 2 months for K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza. However, relative growth rates (RGRs) during the second 2 months did not significantly change for K. candel and even decreased for B. gymnorrhiza with water level rise. The root/shoot biomass ratio in both K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza treated with high water level was significantly lower than that treated with low water level, especially in coarse soil. Biomass percentages of coarse roots of K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza seedlings significantly increased with water level rise. Water level rise led to decreases in Chl. a/b ratios in leaves of K. candel seedlings, but the ratios did not significantly change with water level for B. gymnorrhiza. Decreases in RGRs of B. gymnorrhiza were due to decreases in total leaf area resulting from increases in stomatal density. Contents of N and P in roots tended to increase with water level rise and prolonged inundation. Under both high and low water levels, all propagules of K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza successfully established and the seedlings survived throughout the mesocosm experiment. For the field trial, K. candel seedlings had similar high survival rates of over 90%, while B. gymnorrhiza seedlings had much less survival in lower intertidal zones than in upper intertidal zones. These differences were ascribed to stronger tidal action and more sedimentation in the field than under mesocosm conditions. Survived seedlings of K. candel and B. gymnorrhiza from both propagule plantation and seedling transplantation in field trial also showed higher stem increments during the first 4 months in lower intertidal zones.

Precipitation varied seasonally, with a wet season from mid-December 2000 to July 2001 characterized by successive rainy days, wet soil, and,,relative to the dry season, cooler temperatures, greater cloudiness, and reduced incoming solar and net radiation. Average evapotranspiration decreased from 3.96 +/- 0.65 mm/d during the dry season to 3.18 +/- 0.76 mm/d during the wet season, in parallel with decreasing radiation and decreasing water vapor deficit. The average Bowen ratio was 0.17 +/- 0.10, indicating that most of the incoming radiation was used for evaporation. The Bowen ratio was relatively low during the early wet season (December-March), as a result of increased evaporative fraction and reduced sensible heat flux. The seasonal decline in Bowen ratio and increase in evaporative fraction coincided with an increase in ecosystem CO2 assimilation capacity, which we attribute to the growth of new leaves. The evaporative fraction did not decline as the dry season progressed, implying that the forest did not become drought stressed. The roots extracted water throughout the top 250 cm of soil, and water redistribution, possibly by hydraulic lift, partially recharged the shallow soil during dry season nights. The lack of drought stress during the dry season was likely a consequence of deep rooting, and possibly vertical water movement, which allowed the trees to maintain access to soil water year round.","Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, Dept Atmospher Sci, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","da Rocha, HR (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, Dept Atmospher Sci, Rua Matao 1226, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",humberto@model.iag.usp.br,"Goulden, Michael L/B-9934-2008","Goulden, Michael/0000-0002-9379-3948",,,,29,196,200,1,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The mean air temperature and daily temperature range varied little year-round; the rainy season lasted from late December to around July. Daytime CO2 uptake under high irradiance averaged 16-19 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1) . Light was the main controller of CO2 exchange, accounting for 48% of the half-hour-to-half-hour variance. The rate of canopy photosynthesis at a given irradiance was lower in the afternoon than the morning. This photosynthetic inhibition was probably caused by high evaporative demand, high temperature, an intrinsic circadian rhythm, or a combination of the three. Wood increment increased from January to May, suggesting greater rates of carbon sequestration during the wet season. However, the daily net CO2 exchange measured by eddy covariance revealed the opposite trend, with greater carbon accumulation during the dry season. A reduction in respiration during the dry season was an important cause of this seasonal pattern. The surface litter was desiccated in the dry season, and the seasonal pattern of respiration appears to be a direct result of reduced forest floor decomposition during drought. In contrast, canopy photosynthesis was not directly reduced by the dry season, probably because deep rooting allows the forest to avoid drought stress","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Atmospher Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Goulden, ML (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mgoulden@uci.edu,"Goulden, Michael L/B-9934-2008",,,,,34,174,181,1,32,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

These measurements were used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP); autotrophic respiration (R-a) and heterotrophic (R-h) respiration; and net ecosystem production (NEP). Monte Carlo methods were used to calculate uncertainty (expressed as +/- 2 standard deviations of 200-400 calculations). Live carbon (C) stores were 39,800 g C m(-2) (34,800-44,800 g C m(-2)). The store of C in detritus and mineral soil was 22,092 g C m(-2) (20,600-23,600 g C m(-2)), and the total C stores were 61,899 g C m(-2) (56,600-67,700 g C m(-2)). Total NPP was 597 g C m(-2) y(-1) (453 to 741 g C m(-2) y(-1)). R-a was 1309 g C m(-2) y(-1) (845-1773 g C m(-2) y(-1)), indicating a GPP of 1906 g C m(-2) y(-1) (1444-2368 g C m(-2) y(-1)).

Here we outline a general predictive framework for understanding salinization of afforested grasslands based on biophysical, hydrologic, and edaphic factors. We tested this framework in 20 paired grassland and adjacent afforested plots across ten sites in the Argentine Pampas. Rapid salinization of groundwater and soils in afforested plots was associated with increased evapotranspiration and groundwater consumption by trees, with maximum salinization occurring on intermediately textured soils. Afforested plots (10-100 ha in size) showed 4-19-fold increases in groundwater salinity on silty upland soils but <twofold increases on clay loess soils and sand dunes. Two years of salinity and groundwater measurements at a 40 ha Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation revealed that the plantation reduced groundwater recharge, underwent groundwater discharge on >50% of the days, and depressed the water table 38 cm on average compared to the adjacent grassland. Soil cores and vertical electrical soundings indicated that approximate to6 kg m(-2) of salts accumulated close to the water table and suggested that salinization resulted from the exclusion of fresh groundwater solutes by tree roots. Groundwater use with afforestation in the Pampas and in other regions around the world can enhance primary production and provide a tool for flood control. However, our framework and experimental data also suggest that afforestation can compromise the quality of soils and water resources in predictable ways based on water use, climate, and soil texture.","INTA San Luis, CONICET, RA-5730 San Luis, Argentina; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environmn & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Jobbagy, EG (reprint author), INTA San Luis, CONICET, Ruta 7 & Ruta 8,Villa Mercedes, RA-5730 San Luis, Argentina.",egj@duke.edu,,,,,,52,118,126,3,68,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Annual carbon use in R-A was 7.5, 9.0, 15.0, and 15.1 Mg C ha(-1) in control (C), irrigated (I), fertilized (F) and irrigated and fertilized (IF) treatments, respectively. Foliage, fine root and perennial woody tissue (stem, branch, coarse and taproot) respiration accounted for, respectively, 37%, 24%, and 39% of R-A in C and I treatments and 38%, 12% and 50% of R-A in F and IF treatments. Annual gross primary production (GPP=NPP+R-A) ranged from 13.1 to 26.6 Mg C ha(-1). The I, F, and IF treatments resulted in a 21, 94, and 103% increase in GPP, respectively, compared to the C treatment. Despite large treatment differences in NPP, R-A, and carbon allocation, carbon use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) averaged 0.42 and was unaffected by manipulating site resources. Ecosystem respiration (R-E), the sum of S-ff, and above ground R-A, ranged from 12.8 to 20.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). S-ff contributed the largest proportion of R-E, but the relative importance of S-ff decreased from 0.63 in C treatments to 0.47 in IF treatments because of increased aboveground R-A. Aboveground woody tissue R-A was 15% of R-E in C and I treatments compared to 25% of R-E in F and IF treatments. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP=GPP-R-E) was roughly 0 in the C and I treatments and 6.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in F and IF treatments, indicating that non-fertilized treatments were neither a source nor a sink for atmospheric carbon while fertilized treatments were carbon sinks. In these young stands, NEP is tightly linked to NPP; increased ecosystem carbon storage results mainly from an increase in foliage and perennial woody biomass.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; MeadWestvaco Inc, Summerville, SC 29484 USA","Maier, CA (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",cmaier@fs.fed.us,,,,,,113,76,90,2,38,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Mean soil CO2 efflux in May-October increased with elevated CO2 by 23-37%, with elevated temperature by 27-43%, and with the combined treatment by 35-59%. Temperature elevation was a significant factor in the combined 4-year efflux data, whereas the effect of elevated CO2 was not as evident. Elevated temperature had the most pronounced impact early and late in the season, while the influence of elevated CO2 alone was especially notable late in the season. Needle area was found to be a significant predictor of soil CO2 efflux, particularly in August, a month of high root growth, thus supporting the assumption of a close link between whole-tree physiology and soil CO2 emissions. The decrease in the temperature sensitivity of soil CO2 efflux observed in the elevated temperature treatments in the second year nevertheless suggests the existence of soil response mechanisms that may be independent of the assimilating component of the forest ecosystem. In conclusion, elevated atmospheric CO2 and air temperature consistently increased forest soil CO2 efflux over the 4-year period, their combined effect being additive, with no apparent interaction.","Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland; Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Niinisto, SM (reprint author), Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",sini.niinisto@joensuu.fi,,,,,,49,59,64,1,60,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The composition of the acid fog was similar to that observed in a region where momi fir trees have been declining, and it contained organic acids. We then treated the firs with various additional stresses, such as drought, low temperature, fine root cutting, ozone exposure, soil acidification, nitrogen load, and rhizosphere aluminum stress. Under chronic exposure to acid fog, the momi fir seedlings exhibited a pattern of stomatal behavior whereby they excessively opened in summer and closed in winter. Furthermore, the stomata of these seedlings tended to open during drought stress, and their needles were visibly injured after ozone exposure. The net photosynthesis rates of the seedlings exposed to acid fog were regulated by their stomatal aperture, rather than directly by acid fog. These results suggest that acid fog exposure disturbs the control of stomatal function in the momi fir seedlings. In addition, we found that chronic acid fog exposure suppressed the decrease in net photosynthesis rate, due to its nitrogen load.","[Yoshida, Koji; Takami, Chika; Takenaka, Chisato; Yamamoto, Kazukiyo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Lab Forest Environm & Resources, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yamamoto, Kazukiyo] Japan Sci & Technol Corp CREST, Tokyo, Japan; [Shibasaki, Ryota] Nagoya Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Tezuka, Takafumi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Yoshida, K (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Lab Forest Environm & Resources, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",i011019d@mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Science and Technology CorporationJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST); CRESTCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); Center for Forest Decline Studies,"We thank Professor Hiroshi Miyake of Nagoya University for his fruitful guidance.

Since data obtained from minirhizotrons are limited to the length and diameter of fine roots observed on minirhizotron tubes, data conversion is necessary to determine the fine root biomass per unit soil volume or unit stand area. We first examined the regression between diameter squared and weight per unit length of fine roots in soil core samples, and calculated the fine root biomass on minirhizotron tubes from their length and diameter. Then we determined conversion factors based on the ratio of the fine root biomass in soil core samples to that on minirhizotron tubes. We examined calculation methods, using a single conversion factor for total fine root biomass in the soil for depths of 0-40 cm (Cal1), or using four conversion factors for fine roots in the soil at 10-cm intervals (Cal2). Cal1 overestimated fine root biomass in the lower soil or underestimated that in the upper soil, while fine root biomass calculated using Cal2 better matched that in soil core samples. These results suggest that minirhizotron data should be converted separately for different soil depths to better estimate fine root biomass.","[Noguchi, Kyotaro; Sakata, Tadashi; Mizoguchi, Takeo; Takahashi, Masamichi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan","Noguchi, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Nutrient Dynam Lab, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",kyotaro@affrc.go.jp,"Takahashi, Masamichi/B-6584-2009","Takahashi, Masamichi/0000-0002-6109-0826","Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [B60]","We thank Dr. Akio Akama, Hidetoshi Shigenaga, Junko Nagakura, and the staff at the Department of Forest Site Environment of FFPRI, for their valuable suggestions concerning this study.

Controversy reigns over how specific the mycorrhizal association is in tropical species. Although there is little experimental evidence to support any viewpoint, some variation is known to exist. We compared mycorrhizal specificity and performance in two phylogenetically related epiphytic orchids from Puerto Rico, Tolumnia variegata and Ionopsis utricularioides (Oncidiinae) by integrating two techniques: phylogenetic analysis of mycorrhizal fungi based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and symbiotic seed germination experiments. Most of the mycorrhizal isolates from T. variegata fell into four different clades of Ceratobasidium, while most of those from I. utricularioides were restricted to a single clade of the same genus. Seeds of T. variegata germinated equally well with fungi from both T. variegata and I. utricularioides, but seeds of I. utricularioides germinated significantly better with its own isolates. Seeds of I. utricularioides germinated and developed faster than those of T. variegata. Both the molecular phylogeny and the seed germination experiments showed that T. variegata is a generalist in its association with fungal symbionts. In contrast, I. utricularioides is more specialized and more effective at exploiting a specific fungal clade. Our data are consistent with the theoretical trade-offs between specialized and generalized interactions.","Univ Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00931 USA","Otero, JT (reprint author), Australian Natl Herbarium, CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",tupac.otero@csiro.au,"Otero, J.

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the fine root branching system have hampered the assessment and prediction of C and N dynamics at ecosystem scales. We examined how root morphology, biomass, and chemistry differed with root branch orders (1-5 with root tips classified as first order roots) and how different root orders responded to increased C sink strength (via N fertilization) and reduced carbon source strength (via canopy scorching) in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris L.) ecosystem. With increasing root order, the diameter and length of individual roots increased, whereas the specific root length decreased. Total root biomass on an areal basis was similar among the first four orders but increased for the fifth order roots. Consequently, total root length and total root surface area decreased systematically with increasing root order. Fine root N and lignin concentrations decreased, while total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) and cellulose concentrations increased with increasing root order. N addition and canopy disturbance did not alter root morphology, but they did influence root chemistry. N fertilization increased fine root N concentration and content per unit area in all five orders, while canopy scorching decreased root N concentration. Moreover, TNC concentration and content in fifth order roots were also reduced by canopy scorching. Our results indicate that the small, fragile, and more easily overlooked first and second order roots may be disproportionately important in ecosystem scale C and N fluxes due to their large proportions of fine root biomass, high N concentrations, relatively short lifespans, and potentially high decomposition rates.","Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Newton, GA 39870 USA; State Univ W Georgia, Dept Biol, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA","Guo, DL (reprint author), Jones Ecol Res Ctr, Route 2,Box 2324, Newton, GA 39870 USA.",dguo@jonesctr.org,"Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012; Guo, Dali/G-2158-2014",,,,,49,180,288,12,129,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2004,140,3,,,,,450,457,,10.1007/s00442-004-1596-1,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,842MP,WOS:000223008700009,15179577,,,,10/31/19J,"Chen, WJ; Zhang, QF; Cihlar, J; Bauhus, J; Price, DT",,,,"Chen, WJ; Zhang, QF; Cihlar, J; Bauhus, J; Price, DT",,,Estimating fine-root biomass and production of boreal and cool temperate forests using aboveground measurements: A new approach,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Review,,,,,,boreal; cool temperature; fine-root biomass; fine-root production; forest; new approach; regional estimation; turnover rate,NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; BLACK SPRUCE FORESTS; CARBON-BUDGET MODEL; PINUS-RADIATA PLANTATION; BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS; MAPLE ACER-SACCHARUM; GREAT DISMAL SWAMP; SOIL CO2 EFFLUX; DOUGLAS-FIR; ORGANIC-MATTER,"Information of fine-root biomass and production is critical for quantifying the productivity and carbon cycle of forest ecosystems, and yet our ability to obtain this information especially at a large spatial scale (e.g., regional to global) is extremely limited. Several studies attempted to relate fine-root biomass and production with various aboveground variables that can be measured more easily so that fine-root biomass and production could be estimated at a large spatial scale, but found the correlations were generally weak or non-existed at the stand level. In this study, we tested a new approach: instead of using the conventional way of analysing fine-root biomass at the stand level, we analysed fine-root data at the tree level. Fine-root biomass of overstory trees in stand was first separated from that of understory and standardized to a common fine-root definition of < 2 mm or < 5 mm diameter. Afterwards, we calculated fine-root biomass per tree for a 'representative' tree size of mean basal area for each stand. Statistically significant correlations between the fine-root biomass per tree and the diameter at the ground surface were found for all four boreal and cool temperate spruce, pine, fir and broadleaf forest types, and so allometric equations were developed for each group using a total of n = 212 measurements. The stand-level fine-root biomass of trees estimated using the allometric equations agrees well with the measurements, with r(2) values of 0.64 and 0.57 (n = 171), respectively, for fine-roots < 2 mm and < 5 mm diameter. This study further estimated fine-root production as the product of fine-root turnover rate and fine-root biomass, and determined the turnover rate as a function of fine-root biomass, stand age, and mean annual temperature. The estimates of tree fine-root production agree well with reported values, with r(2) value of 0.53 for < 2 mm and 0.54 for < 5 mm diameter (n = 162) at the stand level.","Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Applicat Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0Y7, Canada; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Resources Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada","Chen, WJ (reprint author), Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Applicat Div, 288 Booth St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0Y7, Canada.",wenjun.chen@ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013; Zhang, Quanfa/H-1922-2011","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986; ",,,,117,49,54,1,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2004,265,2-Jan,,,,,31,46,,10.1007/s11104-005-8503-3,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,884NB,WOS:000226091200003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bernier, PY; Robitaille, G",,,,"Bernier, PY; Robitaille, G",,,A plane intersect method for estimating fine root productivity of trees from minirhizotron images,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,belowground productivity; balsam fir; black spruce; root turnover; sugar maple,FOREST; BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; LENGTH,"The advent of minirhizotrons more than a decade ago has made the careful and widespread study of fine root dynamics of trees possible. However, to this day, the estimation of fine root productivity in terms of mass production per unit of ground surface from the minirhizotron data remains hampered by the difficulty in transforming images of roots captured along a two-dimensional plane into estimates of root volume or mass within a soil volume. In this work, we propose that the date of fine root appearance and the diameter of fine roots are the most robust variables that can be obtained from minirhizotron measurements of tree roots and that these two variables should be the basis of productivity estimates. The method proposed for estimating fine root productivity expands the line intersect method of Van Wagner (1968) into a plane intersect method that permits, with the appropriate volumetric transformations and corrections for tube and slope angles, the estimation of fine root productivity per unit ground area for specific periods. Examples of calculations are presented for two datasets obtained within two different forested sites, as well as a comparison with a methodology based on camera depth-of-view. The main weakness of the plane intersect method is the assumption that all fine root segments are independent. The correction for the fraction of coarse particles also creates uncertainty in the final estimate.","Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, St Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Bernier, PY (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, 1055 PEPS,POB 3800, St Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",pbernier@nrcan.gc.ca,,,,,,23,27,32,0,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2004,265,2-Jan,,,,,165,173,,10.1007/s11104-005-0056-y,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,884NB,WOS:000226091200014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Schurr, FM; Bossdorf, O; Milton, SJ; Schumacher, J",,,,"Schurr, FM; Bossdorf, O; Milton, SJ; Schumacher, J",,,Spatial pattern formation in semi-arid shrubland: a priori predicted versus observed pattern characteristics,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,community structure; functional groups; null models; root competition; seed dispersal; spatial statistics,SOUTH-AFRICA; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; ARID KAROO; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; GERMINATION SITES; MESSOR-CAPENSIS; GROWTH; FACILITATION; COMPETITION,"Ecologists increasingly use spatial statistics to study vegetation patterns. Mostly, however, these techniques are applied in a purely descriptive fashion without a priori statements on the pattern characteristics expected. We formulated such a priori predictions in a study of spatial pattern in a semi-arid Karoo shrubland, South Africa. Both seed dispersal and root competition have been discussed as processes shaping the spatial structure of this community. If either of the two processes dominates pattern formation, patterns within and between shrub functional groups are expected to show distinct deviations from null models. We predicted the type and scale of these deviations and compared predicted to observed pattern characteristics. As predicted by the seed dispersal hypothesis, small-scale co-occurrence within and between groups of colonisers and successors was increased as compared to complete spatially random arrangement of shrubs. The root competition predictions, however, were not met as shrubs of similar rooting depth co-occurred more frequently than expected under random shrub arrangement. Since the distribution of rooting groups to the given shrub locations also failed to match the root competition predictions, there was little evidence for dominance of root competition in pattern formation. Although other processes may contribute to small-scale plant co-occurrence, the sufficient and most parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern is that its formation was dominated by seed dispersal. To characterise point patterns we applied both cumulative (uni- and bivariate K-function) and local (pair- and mark-correlation function) techniques. Based on our results we recommend that future studies of vegetation patterns include local characteristics as they independently describe a pattern at different scales and can be easily related to processes changing with interplant distance in a predictable fashion.","Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle An Der Saale, Germany; Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Schurr, FM (reprint author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",schurr@oesa.ufz.de,"Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Milton, Suzanne Jane/0000-0003-4390-6040",,,,66,81,103,2,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2004,173,2,,,,,271,282,,10.1023/B:VEGE.0000029335.13948.87,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,824KN,WOS:000221685500011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hartley, E; Gemell, LG; Herridge, DF",,,,"Hartley, E; Gemell, LG; Herridge, DF",,,Lime pelleting inoculated serradella (Ornithopus spp.) increases nodulation and yield,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,13th Australian Nitrogen Fixation Conference,"SEP, 2003","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA",,,serradella; Ornithopus; nodulation; rhizobia; bradyrhizobia; lime pelleting,BRADYRHIZOBIUM SP LUPINUS; RHIZOBIUM; SURVIVAL; LEGUMES; SEED,"Lime pelleting of the inoculated seed is recommended for most pasture legume species to improve survival of the rhizobia on the seed and to counter deleterious effects of soil or fertiliser acidity on rhizobial numbers. Except for New South Wales, lime pelleting is specifically not recommended for serradella (Ornithopus spp.). Our objectives were to evaluate effects of lime pelleting on bradyrhizobial numbers on seed, and nodulation and growth of the serradella plants. Three experiments are reported at two acid-soil sites in northern New South Wales involving four cultivars of yellow serradella (Ornithopus compressus) and Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus) strains WSM471 (current inoculant strain) and WU425 and WSM480. Lime pelleting increased bradyrhizobial numbers on seed, 24 h after inoculation, by an average of 90%. Similarly, lime pelleting increased nodulation and shoot dry matter of the inoculated plants by an average of 57 and 28%, respectively. The three strains were similar in effects on plant growth. Relative values for shoot dry weight, averaged over sites, were 100 for WSM471 and 98 for both WU425 and WSM480. Our results confirmed previous research that lime pelleting inoculated serradella seed was not deleterious to survival of the bradyrhizobial inoculum, and showed that it could result in enhanced symbiotic activity of the inoculum in some instances. We recommend lime pelleting of serradella and that WSM471 remain the inoculant strain. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For individual populations and communities, strain richness indices were calculated by dividing the number of strain types identified by the number of isolates recovered. Where possible, strain dominance (the proportion of rhizobial isolates represented by each strain type) was also calculated. Analysis of the genetic diversity of populations, communities and rhizobial strain collections originating from diverse legume hosts and locations, was confined to studies using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) so that diversity could be compared on the basis of published H values. Strain richness indices were highly variable (0.02-0.94) and were influenced by both the discriminatory power of the strain typing method and the type and number of legume species used to recover rhizobia from soil. The strain richness of populations recovered either directly from soil, or from the nodules of trap hosts inoculated with the same soil, was similar. Because the arithmetic relationship between the number of strain types and number of isolates varies between different populations and communities, strain richness curves are proposed as the most appropriate method for reporting rhizobial structural diversity. Comparison of over 50 rhizobial populations and communities from published studies showed that strain dominance patterns in nodules were often similar. Typically, a single strain type occupies more than 30% of nodules with the majority of strain types being recovered at low frequency (similar to 75% of published populations and communities). Rhizobial populations and communities characterised by MLEE varied in their genetic diversity, with H values ranging from 0.06 to 0.78. In several studies, most of the genetic diversity within a site could be recovered from the nodules of a single plant. When hierarchical analyses were performed on populations within and between sites, the genetic diversity within sites was similar to the genetic diversity between sites. Similarly, the genetic diversity of strain collections originating from multiple hosts and locations was no more diverse than some individual populations and communities. Strain richness and genetic diversity measures were not always correlated for rhizobial populations. Populations with low strain richness were sometimes genetically diverse, and the relationship between the diversity measures varied for different legume species at the same location. We suggest that both strain richness and genetic diversity measures are required to fully describe rhizobial population and community diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Buff medic is nodulated by rhizobia (Sinorhizobium metiloti and Sinorhizobium medicae) that reside in many Australian soils, but the symbioses that develop are often sub-optimal in their rate of N-2 fixation. We attempted to identify burr medic lines, which are able to form effective symbioses with the naturalised Sinorhizobium in Australian field soils, as potential parents for a breeding program. There were three glasshouse experiments. Initially, 222 lines (including the M. polymorpha cvv. Santiago, Serena and Circle Valley) were inoculated with extracts of two soils that had been collected near Waikerie (soil S109) and Lochiel (soil S142) in South Australia. These soils were used because they contained numerically large communities of naturalised Sinorhizobium spp. that produced sub-optimal rates of N2 fixation with cv. Santiago. None of the 222 lines of burr medic were able to form an effective symbiosis with the rhizobia from soil S109. However, when nodulated by the rhizobia from soil S142, some lines (e.g. SA8194) formed a very effective symbiosis, producing up to double the shoot dry matter (DM) of Santiago and eight times the DM of uninoculated plants. Seven promising lines were selected for further testing (with extracts of nine soils). Subsequently, two lines (SA20056 and SA8194) were selected and their symbiotic performance compared with that of Santiago, using extracts from 28 soils. While soil treatment had a major effect on mean shoot DM (soil N103 = 120 mg, soil N105 = 17 mg), the three medic lines performed similarly. Santiago, SA20056 and SA8914 all formed ineffective symbioses with the rhizobia in at least half of the 28 soils, even though >95% of the plants were nodulated. These experiments confirm that ineffective symbioses are common between buff medics and the rhizobia that have become naturalised in many Australian soils. Although some lines of burr medic were identified that were able to form more effective symbioses with the rhizobia in individual soils, none were able to form effective symbioses with a wide range of soil rhizobia. If a plant breeding approach is to be used to improve symbiotic performance of burr medic we propose that its hybridisation with other medic species, that have less specific rhizobial needs, will be required.

Below a threshold Psi(soil) of about -0.4 MPa, overnight recharge of soil water storage increased sharply, and reached a maximum value of 80-90% over a range of Psi(soil) from similar to -1.2 to -1.5 MPa. Although amounts of water hydraulically redistributed to the upper 60 cm of soil were relatively small (0 to 0.4 min day(-1)), they greatly reduced the rates of seasonal decline in Psi(soil). The effectiveness of HR in delaying soil drying diminished with increasing sapwood area per ground area. The relationship between soil water utilization and Psi(soil) in the 20-60-cm layer was nearly identical for all six sites. Soil water utilization varied with a surrogate measure of rhizosphere conductance in a similar manner at all six sites. The similarities in relationships between Psi(soil) and HR, soil water utilization and relative rhizosphere conductance among the six sites, suggests that, despite probable differences in maximum rooting depth and density, there was a convergence in biophysical controls on soil water utilization and redistribution in the upper soil layers where the density of finer roots is greatest.","Forest Serv, USDA, Forestry Sci Lab, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; NHEERL, US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Biol, Lab Ecol Func, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Meinzer, FC (reprint author), Forest Serv, USDA, Forestry Sci Lab, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",fmeinzer@fs.fed.us,"Brooks, J.

This conversion provided an opportunity to compare regolith moisture patterns of zero-order watersheds under native chaparral with those under nonnative veldt grass ( Ehrharta calycina Sm.). We collected data as a function of vegetation type and watershed element to test the hypothesis that conversion from chaparral to grass altered water distribution in the vadose zone as a result of changes in the physical environment, including rooting depth and soil horizonation. Patterns in vadose zone water distribution during the dry season, including soil water potential and residual flux, were significantly different in converted areas, reflecting the different rooting habits of the two vegetation types. In chaparral areas, there was no significant change in soil water potential between the surface and the 150-cm depth; soil water potential was consistently below - 1.5 MPa, reflecting the extensive root system. In grass areas, soil water potential was most negative close to the surface, where grass roots were most abundant. Plant available water was present below the 100-cm depth, that recharge to groundwater may occur under grass in average or wetter years. Under both vegetation types, the largest differences in residual water fluxes were near the soil - weathered rock contact. However, there was a significant relation between minor differences in fluxes and soil horizon boundaries, confirming the effects of vegetation conversion on soil properties and vadose zone soil water.","Univ Pacific, Dept Geosci, Stockton, CA 95211 USA; Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; ARS, USDA, US Salin Lab, Riverside, CA 92507 USA","Williamson, TN (reprint author), Univ Pacific, Dept Geosci, Stockton, CA 95211 USA.",twilliam@pacific.edu,,,,,,47,15,15,0,6,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1539-1663,,,VADOSE ZONE J,Vadose Zone J.,AUG,2004,3,3,,,,,1007,1016,,,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Soil Science; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,904BB,WOS:000227469000027,,,,,10/31/19J,"Patreze, CM; Cordeiro, L",,,,"Patreze, CM; Cordeiro, L",,,Nitrogen-tixing and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses in some tropical legume trees of tribe Mimoseae,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,nitrogen fixation; Mimoseae; Mycorrhiza; rhizobia; Riparian forest; symbiosis,GROWTH; FIXATION; RHIZOBIUM; FUNGI; INFECTION; URUGUAY; ROOTS,"Response to mineral fertilization and inoculation with rhizobia and/or arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) of the Anadenanthera colubrina, Mimosa bimucronata and Parapiptadenia rigida (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae) native trees from Brazilian riparian forests, were studied in nursery conditions. Each species was submitted to seven treatments, varying nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization and inoculation with rhizobia (r), mycorrhiza (m) or both (rm): NP, P, P + r, P + rm, N, N + m and N + rm. Results showed that AMF inoculations did not enhance the mycorrhizal colonization, and P uptake was not sufficient to sustain good growth of plants. The level of P mineral added affected negatively the AMF colonization in A. colubrina and M. bimucronata, but not in P. rigida. Native fungi infected the three legume hosts. The absence of mineral N limited growth of A. colubrina and P. rigida, but in M. bimucronata the lack of N was corrected by biological nitrogen fixation. N mineral added inhibited the nodulation, although spontaneous nodulation had occurred in A. colubrina and M. bimucronata. Rhizobia inoculation enhanced the number of nodules, nitrogenase activity and leghemoglobin content of these two species. Thus, the extent of rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis in these species under nursery conditions can affect growth and consequently the post-planting success. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration of N cycling patterns 14 and processes in forests is one potentially negative outcome of accelerated N deposition worldwide. To assess potential impacts of N deposition on temperate forests, a series of chronic nitrogen additions in two contrasting forest types (red pine plantation and mixed hardwood stand) were designed as a core experiment of the Harvard Forest (HF) Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) pro-ram. This paper describes the chronic N experimental study site in detail and presents the long-term baseline measurements established at the beginning of treatments in 1988. Results reported here continue or accelerate trends presented in previous papers. Losses of inorganic N remain high in the high N plots (higher in pines than hardwoods) and low N plots in the pine stand also have measurable DIN losses. Foliar and fine root N concentrations are elevated significantly. Mortality of red pine reached 56% by 2002 in the Pine high N plot, and biomass accumulation has stopped alto.gether. The high N hardwood stand shows increased ANPP, but excess N availability and a severe drouaht in 1995 contributed to mortality of 72% of red maple trees by 2002. Species importance and litterfall patterns were altered in several plots after 1995. Roots, foliage and wood have diminished as net sinks for added N, re-emphasizing the role of soils in N retention. Two mechanisms for large net retention of added N were suggested in a review paper in 1998. Of these, abiotic immobilization is supported by a growing set of papers, while assimilation and re-exudation by mycorrhizae is suggested by increased DON concentrations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The plots used in our tracer study are the same as of those used in the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment study (see Magill et al., this volume) at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA. Nitrogen tracers were added monthly during growing seasons (April-October) of fertilization years 4 and 5 (1991 and 1992) as either (NH4)-N-15 or (NO3)-N-15 to control and to N-fertilized plots (low N treatment, receiving additions of 5 g N m(-2) per year as NH4NO3). Seven years after the end of 15 N additions (1999), tracer recoveries were highest in organic soil, ranging from 34 to 83% of additions across 15 N ion form, N loading rate and forest type. Mineral soil (0-20 cm depth) was the second largest sink, with tracer recoveries ranging from 15 to 34% of additions. Tree biomass (foliage, woody tissue, plus fine roots) accumulated 7-16% of tracer additions. Patterns of 15 N recoveries after 7 years differed from recovery patterns at the end of the 2-year labeling period. At the end of labeling in 1992, recoveries in tree biomass were higher under chronic N fertilization than under ambient atmospheric N loading (control plots), higher with (NO3)-N-15 than (NH4)-N-15 additions, and higher in hardwoods than in pines. Seven years after the end of labeling, recoveries in trees were still higher with (NO3)-N-15 than with (NH4)-N-15 labeling, and trees in control plots continued to accumulate N-15 tracers. In contrast, tracer recoveries in trees on the chronically fertilized plots were lower after 7 years than at the end of the labeling period. This was due mainly to transfers of N-15 tracer from leaf and root tissue to other ecosystem pools during the years since labeling. Wood produced during the 2-year labeling period and the 7-year post-labeling interval continued to accumulate N-15 tracers in control and chronically fertilized plots in both forest types. However, recoveries were low in woody tissues (wood formed from 1990 through 1999 plus bark), ranging from 1.1 to 6.1% of N-15 additions across forest types and treatments. Our comparisons of N-15 tracer recoveries at the end of a 2-year labeling period and at 7 years following the end of labeling suggest that soils are the dominant sinks for N deposition on temperate forests and that N does not contribute substantially to enhanced carbon uptake into tree biomass.

During Fall 2002 we collected one soil core (5.6 cm diameter; organic horizon plus 10 cm of mineral soil) from each of four 5 m x 5 m subplots within the control, low N (5 g N m(-2) per year), and high N (15 N m(-2) per year) plots in both the hardwood and pine stands at the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study at Harvard Forest. The samples were analyzed for total and active bacterial and fungal biomass, microbial catabolic response profiles, the activities of cellulolytic and ligninolytic enzymes, and total, labile and microbially derived organic carbon (C). Live, fine roots were also collected from the control and low N pine plots and analyzed for ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity. Active fungal biomass was 27-61% and 42-69% lower in the fertilized compared to control plots in the hardwood and pine stands, respectively. Active bacterial biomass was not greatly affected by N additions, resulting in significantly lower fungal:bacterial biomass ratios in the N-treated plots. This shift in microbial community composition was accompanied by a significant reduction in the activity of phenol oxidase, a lignin-degrading enzyme produced by white-rot fungi. In the pine stand, ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity was lower in the low N-treated plot than in the control plot. Differences in ectomycorrhizal community structure were also detected between control and fertilized pine plots, including a reduction in those species with the highest relative frequencies in the control community. Finally, N enrichment altered the pattern of microbial substrate use, with the relative response to the addition of carboxylic acids and carbohydrates being significantly lower in the N-treated plots, even after the data were normalized to account for differences in microbial biomass. These patterns are consistent with lower decomposition rates and altered N cycling observed previously at this site. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A limited number of Kura clover-nodulating rhizobial strains are currently available and many have a limited effectiveness. In this study, 128 rhizobia were isolated from four sites in the center of origin of Kura clover (i.e., two in Azerbaijan, one in Armenia, and one in Northwest Iran) using the three ploidy levels of Kura clover (diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) plants as trap hosts. Rhizobia were fingerprinted using repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (BOXA1R primer) and their genetic diversity was measured using the Shannon-Weaver diversity index. The nodulation specificity and phenotypic diversity of a subset of 13 isolates was determined. Genetic diversity among the 128 isolates was large and similar for rhizobia grouped according to their geographic origin or original host plant. Phenotypic diversity was significant; percentage of similarity among 13 isolates ranging between 38 and 92%. Nodulation specificity of the Kura clover-nodulating rhizobial isolates studied was less complex and not as clearly delineated as previously reported. Some strains originally isolated from Kura clover could effectively nodulate more than one ploidy level of Kura clover and even one or both of two other Trifolium species (i.show $132#e., red clover and white clover). Three strains formed effective nodules on both Kura clover and white clover; however, none promoted plant growth of both species to levels currently obtained with commercial inoculants when evaluated in a growth chamber. Rhizobial isolates that are highly effective with both species have yet to be identified.","McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada","Seguin, P (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Macdonald Campus,21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",philippe.seguin@mcgill.ca,,,,,,27,5,6,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. wislizenii (S. Wats.) Eckenw.) has been suffering stress and high mortality rates with decreased water availability and increased salinity levels. Genetic variation in salt tolerance has been documented in adult cottonwoods, and we hypothesized that these traits might be heritable. This potential heritable genetic variation in seedling offspring might be advantageous in reforestation efforts along the Rio Grande. We screened four New Mexican Rio Grande populations for seedling genotypes that might be salt tolerant and correlated seedling performance under both high- and low-salt treatments with the physiological performance of their open-pollinated family. For all populations, we found significant stunting effects of high salinity on mean leaf size, plant height, total plant mass, root mass, and shoot mass, with no effects on chlorophyll content (as measured by a Minolta SPAD-502 meter) or root/shoot ratio. Although there were no significant differences between the four populations, there were highly significant differences between open-pollinated families within each site. In addition, at one site (San Antonio), genetically based open-pollinated family physiology, as measured in a common garden, was significantly correlated with seedling performance, especially under low-salt conditions. This indicates these traits are heritable, and adult salt tolerance may convey an advantage in offspring establishment under high-salt conditions.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Rowland, DL (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Natl Peanut Res Lab, 1011 Forrester Dr SE, Dawson, GA 39842 USA.",drowland@nprl.usda.gov,"Sher, Anna/Z-1644-2019; Sher, Anna/J-8843-2015","Sher, Anna/0000-0002-6433-9746",,,,43,6,6,0,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Of the 37 574 roots.m(-2) produced in total over the 2-year observation period, some 78% disappeared during the study. Over 90% of new root production occurred between March and October. Root production was highest in June 1998 (2263 roots.m(-2)) and lowest in January of 1998 and 1999 (31 roots.m(-2)). Combination of these data with counts of root disappearance showed that there was a net increase in root numbers per tree between March and June. From June onwards, the rate of root disappearance exceeded the rate of production. Thus, any annual increase in the number of roots depended upon a short period of major root production in late spring - early summer.","Scottish Agr Coll, Crop & Soil Res Grp, Aberdeen AB21 9YA, Scotland","Baddeley, JA (reprint author), Scottish Agr Coll, Crop & Soil Res Grp, Craibstone Estate, Aberdeen AB21 9YA, Scotland.",J.Baddeley@ab.sac.ac.uk,"Watson, Christine A/I-2135-2012","Watson, Christine A/0000-0002-3758-9483",,,,22,7,12,1,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Clover strains differ from one another by the occurrence frequency of actinomycetes utilizing the particular components of root exudates of clover, as well as by the occurrence frequency of species-antagonists of micromycetes and species stimulating the growth of nodule bacteria. The decree of similarity between the actinomycetal complexes developing in the rhizosphere of tetraploid clover strains (Kudesnik and Vityaz') is greater than the degree of similarity between these complexes and the actinomycetal complex developing in the rhizosphere of the diploid clover strain Trio.","Russian Acad Agr Sci, Rudnitskii Res Inst Agr NE European Russia, Kirov 610007, Russia","Shirokikh, IG (reprint author), Russian Acad Agr Sci, Rudnitskii Res Inst Agr NE European Russia, Ul Lenina 166A, Kirov 610007, Russia.",,"Shirokikh, Irina/V-3449-2017; Shirokikh, Alexandr/X-1684-2018","Shirokikh, Irina/0000-0002-3319-2729; Shirokikh, Alexandr/0000-0002-7808-0376",,,,16,0,0,0,1,INTERPERIODICA,BIRMINGHAM,"PO BOX 1831, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35201-1831 USA",1064-2293,,,EURASIAN SOIL SCI+,Eurasian Soil Sci.,JUL,2004,37,7,,,,,762,768,,,,,7,Soil Science,Agriculture,847HO,WOS:000223383500012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Burton, AJ; Pregitzer, KS; Crawford, JN; Zogg, GP; Zak, DR",,,,"Burton, AJ; Pregitzer, KS; Crawford, JN; Zogg, GP; Zak, DR",,,Simulated chronic NO3- deposition reduces soil respiration in northern hardwood forests,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,atmospheric nitrate deposition; nitrogen fertilization; root biomass; root respiration; soil CO2 efflux; temperature and moisture effects,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MAPLE ROOT RESPIRATION; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; FINE-ROOT; SUGAR MAPLE; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; EUROPEAN FORESTS; DOUGLAS-FIR,"Chronic N additions to forest ecosystems can enhance soil N availability, potentially leading to reduced C allocation to root systems. This in turn could decrease soil CO2 efflux. We measured soil respiration during the first, fifth, sixth and eighth years of simulated atmospheric NO3- deposition (3 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) to four sugar maple-dominated northern hardwood forests in Michigan to assess these possibilities. During the first year, soil respiration rates were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the NO3--amended plots. In all subsequent measurement years, soil respiration rates from NO3--amended soils were significantly depressed. Soil temperature and soil matric potential were measured concurrently with soil respiration and used to develop regression relationships for predicting soil respiration rates. Estimates of growing season and annual soil CO2 efflux made using these relationships indicate that these C fluxes were depressed by 15% in the eighth year of chronic NO3- additions. The decrease in soil respiration was not due to reduced C allocation to roots, as root respiration rates, root biomass, and root turnover were not significantly affected by N additions. Aboveground litter also was unchanged by the 8 years of treatment. Of the remaining potential causes for the decline in soil CO2 efflux, reduced microbial respiration appears to be the most likely possibility. Documented reductions in microbial biomass and the activities of extracellular enzymes used for litter degradation on the NO3--amended plots are consistent with this explanation.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Univ New England, Dept Biol Sci, Biddeford, ME USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Burton, AJ (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",ajburton@mtu.edu,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,74,144,175,4,81,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

A factorial field experiment encompassing two levels of UV-B supplementation (simulating ambient and a 30% increase in stratospheric ozone) and two levels of disturbance (disturbed and undisturbed) was established at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory, Derbyshire, UK, and maintained for 7 years prior to sampling. Enhanced UV-B increased microbial utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, polymers and aromatic compounds present in Biolog(R) GN plates when inoculated with soils taken from disturbed plots, but did not affect carbon utilization of soil microbial communities associated with undisturbed plots (UV-BxDisturbance interaction, P<0.05 for each substrate type). UV-B treatment did not affect numbers of bacteria or fungi. Direct microscopic counts showed fewer bacteria in soil originating from disturbed plots than from undisturbed plots (Disturbance, P<0.001), although a greater number of culturable bacteria and fungi were isolated from disturbed than from undisturbed soils (Disturbance, P<0.001). No UV-B- or disturbance-related differences in protein, starch or urea hydrolysis were exhibited by bacterial isolates. UV-B treatment did not affect total plant biomass within undisturbed plots or the biomass of individual groupings of grasses, forbs and mosses. Per cent root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was not affected by enhanced UV-B radiation in the undisturbed plots. Neither AMF nor plant biomass was measured in disturbed plots. The key findings of this study show that UV-B-mediated alterations in carbon utilization occurred in soil microbial communities subjected to disturbance, but such changes were not observed in communities sampled from undisturbed grassland. Differences in the catabolic potential of microbial communities from disturbed grassland subjected to enhanced UV-B are probably related to plant-mediated changes in resource availability or quality.","Univ Nottingham, Div Agr & Environm Sci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; Univ Lancaster, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","West, HM (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Div Agr & Environm Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",helen.west@nottingham.ac.uk,"Paul, Nigel/E-5350-2014; Avery, Lisa/J-8038-2019","Paul, Nigel/0000-0001-6959-4239; Avery, Lisa/0000-0003-1701-214X",,,,40,11,12,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Undercutting in September and July in two consecutive years increased the number of first-order lateral roots. Field performance was evaluated by transplanting under two conditions, (a) competition with a mixture of grasses with no irrigation or fertilisation and (b) standard conditions with fertilisation and irrigation first year and no competition with grass. After two growing seasons under competitive conditions, seedlings undercut in September of year 1 had a significantly higher dry weight compared with that of uncut control seedlings. Numbers of lateral roots and field performance under competitive conditions was related when numbers of lateral roots were small, but not when high.

In that framework, we have analyzed the effects of three levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration (350, 500 and 700 ppm) on the germination rate, growth and morphology of seedlings of two Mediterranean oaks used in reforestation programs: the evergreen Quercus ilex L. and the deciduous Quercus cerrioides Wilk. et Costa. CO2 enrichment increased the germination rate of Q. cerrioides (from 70+/-7 to 81+/-3%) while it decreased that of Q. ilex (from 71+/-10 to 41+/-12%). Seedlings of both species increased approximately 60% their total biomass in response to CO2 enrichment but at two different CO2 concentrations: 500 ppm for Q. cerrioides and 700 ppm for Q. ilex. This increase in seedlings biomass was entirely due to an augmentation of root biomass. Considering germination and biomass partitioning, an enriched CO2 atmosphere might not be appropriate for growing Mediterranean evergreen oaks, such as Q. ilex, since it reduces acorn germination and the only gains in root biomass occur at a high concentration (700 ppm). On the other hand, a moderate CO2 enrichment (500 ppm) appears as a promising nursery technique to stimulate the germination, growth and root/shoot ratio of deciduous oaks, such as Q. cerrioides.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencies, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; IRTA, Dept Tecnol Hort, Barcelona 08348, Spain","Espelta, JM (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencies, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",Josep.Espelta@uab.es,"Espelta, Josep M/I-3891-2016; Biel, Carmen/G-6816-2014","Espelta, Josep M/0000-0002-0242-4988; ",,,,40,10,11,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,JUL,2004,28,1,,,,,79,88,,10.1023/B:NEFO.0000031341.81923.9b,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,827YC,WOS:000221938600007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hoffmann, WA; Orthen, B; Franco, AC",,,,"Hoffmann, WA; Orthen, B; Franco, AC",,,Constraints to seedling success of savanna and forest trees across the savanna-forest boundary,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbohydrate; cerrado; fire; tropical forest; water potential,NEOTROPICAL SAVANNAS; EUCALYPTUS-SAVANNA; BRAZILIAN CERRADO; TROPICAL SAVANNA; RAIN-FOREST; FIRE; ESTABLISHMENT; VEGETATION; GROWTH; AMAZON,"Tropical savannas and closed forests are characterized by distinct tree communities, with most species occur-ring almost exclusively in only one of the two environments. The ecology of these two groups of species will largely determine the structure and dynamics of the savanna-forest boundary, but little is known about the ecological and physiological differences that might control their distributions. We performed field and nursery experiments to compare seedling establishment success, predawn leaf water potential, biomass allocation, and root carbohydrate concentration of congeneric species, each composed of one savanna species and one forest species. Seedling establishment of savanna and forest species responded differently to vegetation cover, with forest species having lowest establishment success in the open savanna and savanna species having lowest success in forest. Subsequent survival followed similar patterns, resulting in even greater differences in cumulative success. The low survival of forest species in the savanna appears related to drought stress, as seedlings of forest species had lower predawn leaf water potential than savanna species. Seedlings of savanna species had greater root: shoot ratios and root total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration, particularly among evergreen genera. Among evergreen genera, root TNC per shoot mass, which may largely determine resprout capacity, was seven times higher in savanna species than forest species. Although water availability and microclimate may reduce the success of forest species, these factors appear unable to completely exclude forest seedling establishment in savanna. Fire, on the other hand, appears to be a much more absolute constraint to success of forest species in savanna.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Bot, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Munster, Inst Okol Pflanzen, D-48143 Munster, Germany; Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Hoffmann, WA (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Bot, Campus 7612, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",william_hoffmann@ncsu.edu,"Hoffmann, William A./E-8894-2010; Franco, Augusto/B-1615-2008","Hoffmann, William A./0000-0002-1926-823X; Franco, Augusto/0000-0003-0869-5989",,,,59,107,117,2,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2004,140,2,,,,,252,260,,10.1007/s00442-004-1595-2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,844ZD,WOS:000223204100008,15148603,,,,10/31/19J,"Salamon, JA; Schaefer, M; Alphei, J; Schmid, B; Scheu, S",,,,"Salamon, JA; Schaefer, M; Alphei, J; Schmid, B; Scheu, S",,,Effects of plant diversity on Collembola in an experimental grassland ecosystem,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ONYCHIURUS-ARMATUS COLLEMBOLA; FOOD PREFERENCE; PINE FOREST; SUGAR-BEET; BOTTOM-UP; SOIL; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; ECOLOGY; DECOMPOSITION,"The response of species numbers and density of Collembola to manipulation of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 32 species) and number of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-legume herbs) was studied in an experimental grassland at the Swiss BIODEPTH site (Lupsingen, Switzerland) in October 1997. Plant species richness or number of plant functional groups did not affect total diversity of Collembola, however, the number of Collembola species increased in the presence of legumes and the grass Trisetum flavescens. The abundance of Protaphorura armata increased but that of Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae significantly decreased with increasing number of plant functional groups. Other groups including the herbivorous Symphypleona did not respond to plant species richness and plant functional groups. Possibly, Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae species are weak competitors declining in density if the density of other Collembola groups increase. In general, the effect of the number of plant functional groups on the densities of collembolan taxa was stronger than that of plant species richness. Changes in Collembola density and diversity in part was likely caused by increased soil microbial and fine root biomass in treatments with higher plant functional group diversity. The presence of legumes resulted in an increase in the densities of total Collembola, Symphypleona/Neelipleona and Isotomidae indicating that they benefited from the high litter quality and the increased microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of legumes. The results suggest that microbivorous soil invertebrates are controlled by food quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, they indicate that presence of certain plant species and functional groups may be more important for collembolan community structure than the diversity of plant species and functional groups per se.","Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol, DE-35392 Giessen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Inst Zool & Anthropol, DE-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Salamon, JA (reprint author), Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32 IFZ, DE-35392 Giessen, Germany.",joerg-alfred.salamon@allzool.bio.uni-giessen.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214",,,,76,64,68,2,46,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2004,106,1,,,,,51,60,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12905.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CV,WOS:000221438300006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hokka, V; Mikola, J; Vestberg, M; Setala, H",,,,"Hokka, V; Mikola, J; Vestberg, M; Setala, H",,,Interactive effects of defoliation and an AM fungus on plants and soil organisms in experimental legume-grass communities,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LOLIUM-PERENNE; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; NITROGEN; HERBIVORY; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM; RHIZOSPHERE; GROWTH,"We established a 13-week greenhouse experiment based on replicated microcosms to test whether the effects of defoliation on grassland plants and soil organisms depend on plant species composition and the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The experiment constituted of three treatment factors - plant species composition, inoculation of an AM fungus and defoliation - in a fully factorial design. Plant species composition had three levels: (1) Trifolium repens monoculture (T), (2) Phleum pratense monoculture (P) and (3) mixture of T. repens and P. pratense (T+P), while the AM inoculation and the defoliation treatment had two levels: (1) no inoculation of AM fungi and (2) inoculation of the AM fungus Glomus claroideum BEG31, and (1) no trimming, and (2) trimming of all plant material to 6 cm above the soil surface three times during the experiment, respectively. At the final harvest, AM colonization rate of plant roots differed between the plant species compositions, being on average 45% in T, 33% in T+P and 4% in P. Defoliation did not affect the colonization rate in T but raised the rate from 1% to 7% in P and from 20% to 45% in T+P. Shoot production and standing shoot and root biomass were 48%, 85% and 68% lower, respectively, in defoliated than in non-defoliated systems, while the AM fungus did not affect shoot production and root mass but reduced harvested shoot mass by 8% in non-defoliated systems. Of the plant quality attributes, defoliation enhanced the N concentration of harvested shoot biomass by 129% and 96% in P and T+P, respectively, but had no effect in T, while the C concentration of shoot biomass was on average 2.7% lower in defoliated than in non-defoliated systems. Moreover, defoliation reduced shoot C yield (the combined C content of defoliated and harvested shoot biomass) on average by 47% across all plant species compositions and shoot N yield by 37% in T only. In contrast to defoliation, the AM fungus did not affect shoot N and C concentrations or shoot N yield, but induced 10% lower C yield in non-defoliated systems and 17% higher C yield in defoliated T. In roots, defoliation led to 56% and 21% higher N concentration in P and T+P, respectively, and 28% higher C concentration in P, while the mycorrhizal fungus lowered root N concentration by 9.7% in defoliated systems and had no effect on root C concentrations. In the soil, the nematode community was dominated by bacterivores and the other trophic groups were found in a few microcosms only. Bacterivores were 45% more abundant in defoliated than in non-defoliated systems, but were not affected by plant species composition or the AM fungus. Soil inorganic N concentration was significantly increased by defoliation in T+P, while the mycorrhizal fungus reduced NH4-N concentration by 40% in T. The results show that defoliation had widespread effects in our experimental systems, and while the effects on plant growth were invariably negative and those on bacterivorous nematodes invariably positive, most effects on plant C and N content and soil inorganic N concentration varied depending on the plant species present. In contrast, the effects of defoliation did not depend on the presence of the AM fungus, which suggests that while the relative abundance of legumes and grasses is likely to have a significant role in the response of legume-grass communities to defoliation, the role of AM fungi may be less important. In line with this, the AM fungus had only a few significant effects on plant and soil attributes in our systems and each of them was modified by defoliation and/or plant species composition. This suggests that the effects of AM fungi in legume-grass communities may largely depend on the plant species present and whether the plants are grazed or not.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Laukaa Res & Elite Plant Stn, FIN-41330 Vihtavuori, Finland","Hokka, V (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35 YAC, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",jmikola@bytl.jyu.fi,"Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015; Mikola, Juha/A-1630-2015","Mikola, Juha/0000-0002-4336-2648; Setala, Heikki Martti/0000-0002-5230-4001",,,,62,34,36,5,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2004,106,1,,,,,73,84,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12963.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,821CV,WOS:000221438300009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bolte, A; Rahmann, T; Kuhr, M; Pogoda, P; Murach, D; Von Gadow, K",,,,"Bolte, A; Rahmann, T; Kuhr, M; Pogoda, P; Murach, D; Von Gadow, K",,,Relationships between tree dimension and coarse root biomass in mixed stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.),PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Conference on Ecology of Forest Transformation,"SEP, 2002","Brandenburg Univ Technol, Cottbus, GERMANY",,Brandenburg Univ Technol,allometry; biomass; Fagus sylvatica; forest; Picea abies; root/shoot ratio; root system,BREAST-HEIGHT DIAMETERS; CANADIAN FOREST SECTOR; CARBON BUDGET MODEL; DOUGLAS-FIR; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; SYSTEM BIOMASS; ALLOCATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN,"Relationships between tree parameters above ground and the biomass of the coarse root system were examined in six mixed spruce-beech stands in the Solling Mountain region in northwest Germany. The selected stands were located on comparable sites and covered an age range of 44 to 114 years. Coarse roots (d greater than or equal to 2 mm) of 42 spruce and 27 beech trees were sampled by excavating the entire root system. A linear model with logarithmic transformation of the variables was developed to describe the relationship between the coarse root biomass (CRB, dry weight) and the corresponding tree diameter at breast height (DBH). The coefficients of determination (R-2) attained values between 0.92 for spruce and 0.94 for beech; the logarithmic standard deviation values were between 0.29 and 0.43. A significantly different effect of tree species on the model estimates could not be detected by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). For spruce, the derived relationships were similar to those reported in previous studies, but not for beech. Biomass partitioning in the tree compartments above and below ground differs significantly between spruce (coarse root/shoot ratio 0.16 +/- 0.06) and beech (coarse root/shoot ratio 0.10 +/- 0.03) in the mixed stands. These results are similar to those given in other studies involving pure spruce and beech stands on comparable sites in the region, although the ratios of pure stands in other regions growing under different site conditions are somewhat higher. Comparing trees of the same DBH classes, root/shoot ratios of spruce are 1.2 to 3 times higher than those of beech. Dominant spruce trees (DBH > 60 cm) attained the highest ratios, suppressed beech trees (DBH < 10 cm) the lowest. Site conditions of varying climate and soils and interspecific tree competition are likely to affect root/shoot ratio and DBH-coarse root biomass relationships. The greater variability in beech compared with spruce indicates a high 'plasticity' and adaptability of beech carbon allocation. Thus, the derived equations are useful for biomass estimates of coarse roots involving trees of different ages in mixed stands of spruce and beech in the Solling Mountains. However, application of these relationships to stands in other regions would need further testing.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Silviculture, Dept 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; FIV, Hessen Forst, D-34346 Munden, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Inst Forest Management, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Appl Sci, Fac Forestry, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany","Bolte, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Silviculture, Dept 1, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",abolte@gwdg.de,"Bolte, Andreas/A-3521-2009; von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,,,,64,72,85,0,50,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2004,264,2-Jan,,,,,1,11,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000047777.23344.a3,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,883HC,WOS:000226001200002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ebersberger, D; Werrnbter, N; Niklaus, PA; Kandeler, E",,,,"Ebersberger, D; Werrnbter, N; Niklaus, PA; Kandeler, E",,,Effects of long term CO2 enrichment on microbial community structure in calcareous grassland,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,16S rDNA; DGGE; elevated CO2; grassland; PLFA; soil microbial community,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE LEVELS; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; PASTURE ECOSYSTEM; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; SOIL MICROBIOTA; LOLIUM-PERENNE; FINE ROOTS; RHIZOSPHERE; RESPONSES,"Elevated CO2 generally increases plant productivity, and has been found to alter plant community composition in many ecosystems. Because soil microbes depend on plant-derived C and are often associated with specific plant species, elevated CO2 has the potential to alter structure and functioning of soil microbial communities. We investigated soil microbial community structure of a species-rich semi-natural calcareous grassland that had been exposed to elevated CO2 (600 muL L-1) for 6 growing seasons. We analysed microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and DNA fingerprints obtained by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA fragments amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PLFA profiles were not affected by CO2 enrichment and the ratio of fungal and bacterial PLFA did not change. Ordination analysis of DNA fingerprints revealed a significant relation between CO2 enrichment and variation in DNA fingerprints in summer (P = 0.01), but not in spring. This variation was due to changes in low-intensity bands, while dominant bands did not differ between CO2 treatments. Diversity of the bacterial community, as assessed by number of bands in DNA fingerprints and calculation of Shannon diversity indices, was not affected by elevated CO2. Overall, only minor effects on microbial community structure were detected, corroborating earlier findings that soil carbon inputs did probably change much less than suggested by plant photosynthetic responses.","Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Ebersberger, D (reprint author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",Diana.Ebersberger@web.de,"Turan, Veysel/G-7722-2011; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010","Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357",,,,53,47,50,2,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2004,264,2-Jan,,,,,313,323,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000047768.89268.8c,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,883HC,WOS:000226001200026,,,,,10/31/19J,"Timonen, S; Christensen, S; Ekelund, F",,,,"Timonen, S; Christensen, S; Ekelund, F",,,Distribution of protozoa in Scots pine mycorrhizospheres,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,amoebae; ectomycorrhiza; flagellates; mycor-rhizosphere; Paxillus involutus; Pinus sylvestris; protozoa; Suillus bovinus,BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NAKED AMEBAS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; SOIL MICROCOSMS; FOREST HUMUS; RHIZOSPHERE; PLANTS; MYCORRHIZAE; SUILLUS,"The distribution of heterotrophic flagellates, naked amoebae, testate amoebae and ciliates was investigated in habitats created by Scots pine-Paxillus involutus and -Suillus bovinus ectomycorrhizospheres.

The testate amoebae were more abundant on external mycelium than on mycorrhizae regardless of the mycorrhizal fungal species. Numbers of protozoa were higher in the different habitats provided by S. bovinus mycorrhizospheres when compared with P. involutus mycorrhizospheres. Interestingly, the quality of the bacterial flora as food for the protozoa was affected by the mycorrhizal fungi even in the soils adjacent to non-mycorrhizal root tips of pine.

But, we know very little about the potential loss of forest production due to cold soils. Liquid soil water may not be available to trees due to cold soil conditions, thus reducing transpiration and photosynthesis. We believe that these effects need to be quantified in order to keep silvicultural practices from inadvertently reducing forest growth through effects on soil temperature. In order to test this hypothesis it is important to know more about water uptake in the field by trees in cold environments. The snow cover was manipulated on plots in a young stand of Pinus sylvestris L. to create plots with different timings of soil warming. Soil profile temperature and liquid water content, as well as snow and frost depths, were measured together with tree physiological parameters such as sap flow, stomatal conductance and needle water potential. The study has confirmed the importance of the soil temperature for tree water uptake when soil warming was delayed beyond the start of growing season as defined by air temperature. The absence of frost (and hence the presence of liquid water) was not sufficient to enable water uptake. It was rather elevation of soil temperature above zero in the upper soil layers that was required for substantial water uptake, in combination with other site factors. Below ca. +8 degreesC, soil temperature was a factor in the restriction of transpiration, explained by a lower stomatal conductance and likely decreased root permeability. The effect of a certain soil temperature was not the same at different times due to its interaction with aboveground factors such as air temperature and day-length. The effect of low soil temperature increased with the persistence of low temperatures after the start of the growing season. The timings of soil warming induced by our study were within the spatial and inter-annual variation of soil warming in this region. Thus, we conclude that influences of forest management on soil temperature can affect the transpiration deficit during spring, with potential implications for forest productivity.

Thus, it is important to develop a mechanism to evaluate nursery seedling quality and performance prior to field planting. The study was conducted to evaluate two measures of root growth potential (RGP; number and length of new roots) as seedling performance attributes of narra. (Pterocarpus indicus Willd.), one of the most valuable native reforestation species in the Philippines. RGP was determined in response to three different soil moisture regimes (50, 75 and 100% of field capacity). Effects of these treatments on height, root-collar diameter, stem diameter, length of taproot, shoot biomass, root biomass, total biomass, root:shoot ratio and seedling quality index were also investigated. Measurements were made on 7, 14 and 21 days after transplanting. The experiment was laid out using a completely randomized design. RGP and length of taproot were significantly affected by moisture treatment at 7 days. High RGP and longer taproots were observed in soil at 50% of field capacity. Increased stem diameter, shoot biomass, total biomass and quality index were observed in the reduced soil moisture condition at 7 and 14 days. Results confirm that narra is capable of producing new roots in response to reduced soil moisture on a relatively short period of time. This response would enable narra plants to counteract transplanting shock thereby ensuring their survival in the nursery. Correlation analysis of new root counts and length measurements revealed a strong positive correlation with each other. Thus, either will provide a good estimate of RGP in narra.

It was found that the percent of stem biomass increases with age while the inverse relationship was found for foliage and branches. Cultural treatments also impacted the proportional allocation among various tree compartments. Specifically, this investiuation showed that compared with unfertilized trees, annually fertilized trees in the Lower Coastal Plain had a larger proportional biomass allocation to the stem relative to root, branch, and foliage compartments. A system of related compartment biomass models was developed that reproduces observed relationships in the raw data. This system of models uses total tree biomass to obtain estimates of biomass for other tree compartments. The flexibility of the system of biomass prediction models allows users to estimate biomass for the various compartments as a function of another known compartment biomass. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between the incidence of I. tomentosus and spruce diameter, density and basal area was examined on two different sites on the Kenai Peninsula. Sites were systematically surveyed using 50 M plots and disease incidence was calculated as the percent of spruce trees infected with I. tomentosus. Transects from the top of slopes to the bottom were also established at the same sites and soil moisture probes were installed in the upper 15-20 cm at five equidistant points on each transect. The relationship between slope position, percent soil moisture content, soil pH and disease incidence was determined by ANOVA and regression analysis. The incidence of I. tomentosus in the plot survey ranged from 0 to 100% and spruce density (stems per hectare) and basal area had no relationship with disease incidence. Disease incidence was significantly and positively related to individual tree diameter and disease was most common on slopes compared to either bottom or top (flat) positions. Percent moisture content was greatest at bottom slope positions and at flat sites located beyond the crest of slopes. Disease incidence was negatively related to percent moisture content, but not related to pH. Slope position, or soil moisture content, may be used by forest managers to indicate areas more likely to have a higher incidence of root disease and can therefore reduce costs of disease surveys by enabling stratification of managed forest stands. Further, the results suggest that a higher planting density to compensate for losses to tomentosus root disease will not significantly increase disease incidence. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V.

So far, studies of the herbivory-mycorrhiza relationship have not yielded consistent results. This may be related to differences between species of fungi, or the frequency of the herbivory. This study tested the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species with varying clipping frequency on the phenology and colonization by AMF in the roots of Bromus inermis. The species of AMF significantly affected root and shoot biomass, as well as the degree of mycorrhizal colonization. Clipping frequency also influenced plant biomass and mycorrhizal phenology. High frequency clipping typically had the strongest effect on the variables measured. However, the extent of the clipping effect was dependent on which AMF species were associated with the plant, and which mycorrhizal structure was assessed. For example, intraradical hyphae and arbuscules were negatively affected by clipping, whereas the production of vesicles and spores was stimulated, albeit to different degrees in different AMF species. In contrast, extraradical hyphal length did not respond significantly to clipping. This AMF x clipping interaction indicates that it is difficult to generalize on the effects of herbivory on plant and fungal responses, even when dealing with the same plant species.

The results shown that the two isolates had different effects on growth and phosphorus; sodium and chloride uptake by cotton: isolate GM1 increased biomass and phosphorus concentrations, but had no significant effects on sodium and chloride concentrations in cotton at the four NaCl levels. Isolate GM2 significantly improved plant growth at 3 g/kg NaCl and increased phosphorus concentrations at 0 and 1 g/kg NaCl, respectively. It also significantly increased sodium concentrations at 2 and 3 g/kg NaCl and chloride concentrations at 1-3 g/kg NaCl: Comparing the two isolates, cotton plants inoculated with GM1 had significantly higher biomass and phosphorus concentrations; but lower sodium and chloride concentrations than those inoculated with GM2 at 2 and 3 g/kg NaCl. These results did pot support our initial hypothesis. The isolate GM2 had a lower capacity to alleviate saline stress in cotton than GM1 and this can be attributed to its higher capacity to increase the concentrations of sodium and chloride in cotton: It is concluded that the mechanisms for protecting plants from the detrimental effects of salinity by AM fungi may differ in their capability to influence the uptake of sodium and chloride.

Associated rhizobia were isolated from these and from excavated nodules of field standing mature trees, and phenotypically characterized. Indigenous rhizobia capable of eliciting nodules on at least one or more of the woody legume species tested were present in most of the soils. Tree species were markedly different in nodulation in the different site soils. Sesbania sesban and Acacia abyssinica showed higher nodulation ability across the different sites indicating widespread occurrence of compatible rhizobia in the soils. The nodulation patterns of the different provenances of Acacia spp. suggested the existence of intraspecific provenance variations in rhizobial affinity which can be exploited to improve N fixation through tree selection. Altogether, 241 isolates were recovered from the root nodules of trap host species and from excavated nodules. Isolates were differentiated by growth rate and colony morphology and there were very fast-, fast-, slow-, and very slow-growing rhizobia. The bulk of them (68.5%) were fast-growing acid-producing rhizobia while 25.3% were slow-growing alkali-producing types. Fast-growing alkali-producing (2.9%) and slow-growing acid-producing strains (3.3%) were isolated from trap host species and excavated nodules, respectively.

The diversity of indigenous rhizobia in growth rate and colony morphology suggested that the collection probably includes several rhizobial genera.","Debub Univ, Dept Plant Prod & Dryland Farming, Awassa Coll Agr, Awasa, Ethiopia; Agr Univ Norway, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; Agr Univ Norway, Ctr Int Environm & Dev Studies, NORAGRIC, N-1432 As, Norway; NIGMS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Wolde-meskel, E (reprint author), Debub Univ, Dept Plant Prod & Dryland Farming, Awassa Coll Agr, POB 5, Awasa, Ethiopia.",endame@nlh.no,,"Peters, Norman/0000-0003-0795-1362",,,,44,14,14,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Moreover, I argue for the utility of using discourse as a productive entry point for neo-Gramscian analysis. Taking a discursive approach to a case study of the governance of 'global Sydney' since the mid-1990s, I explore how engaging a neo-Gramscian SRA can connect theoretically informed explanation of the practical accomplishment of urban governance to its broader politico-economic embeddedness and to the territoriality of the state. I explore how the activation of Sydney's governance via the hegemonic project of producing the 'competitive city' is shaping a contingent and scaled state form-with a specific (and scaled) institutional form, regime of representation, and range of interventions. Additionally, I consider how counterhegemonic claims and currents shape this process. The relational and constructivist perspectives of the neo-Gramscian SRA ensure that, at all times, urban governance is understood both as a multiscalar production and as a political construction. The result of neo-Gramscian analysis, then, is more theoretically informed and theoretically informative studies of the situated practice of urban governance.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Urban & Reg Studies, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia","McGuirk, PM (reprint author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Urban & Reg Studies, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.",pauline.mcguirk@newcastle.edu.au,"McGuirk, Pauline/A-2302-2010","McGuirk, Pauline/0000-0002-6688-9661",,,,129,57,58,1,12,PION LTD,LONDON,"207 BRONDESBURY PARK, LONDON NW2 5JN, ENGLAND",0308-518X,,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Samples were taken from the A(1) and A(3) horizons of three GR soils (Typic Dystrudepts), under stands of Quercus robur L., Pinus radiata D. Don., and Eucalyptus globulus Labill., whereas A(1) and B horizons were sampled from three nearby AMP soils (Lithic Hapludands, Andic Dystrudept) under the same tree species. Fine roots were sequentially extracted with NH4Cl (1 M) and HCl (1, 10, and 10 mM), and also digested with HNO3. The distribution of Ca, Mg, and Al at the root exchange sites was mainly related to aqueous Ca and Mg concentrations in the rhizosphere, which in turn, were related to the type of parent material. This was more evident in the deeper horizons where the effect of the mineral solid phase on the soil solution composition was more intense. The fraction of Ca-extractable with HCl comprised 36-51% of the sum of HCl and NH4Cl-extractable Ca, and that of Mg comprised 49-76% of the sum of HCl- and NH4Cl-extractable Mg. A large fraction of the Al was more strongly bound to the root in an HCl soluble form (78-92%). Values of total Al concentration in roots (after HNO3 digestion) indicated that less Al accumulated in roots of the GR A, horizons than in those of AMP A, horizons. The GR A, horizons had a more acidic (pH < 4.2) and Al-undersaturated organic matter, which may have negatively affected the precipitation of Al compounds in roots. The acid forest soils studied have provided us with an opportunity to investigate the influence of a range of soil solutions under natural conditions (varying in pH, Ca/Al, and Mg/Al) and to confirm previous findings obtained under greenhouse conditions.","Univ Santiago Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Edafol & Quim Agr, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; Univ Santiago Compostela, EPS Lugo, Dept Edafol & Quim Agr, Lugo 27002, Spain","Arbestain, MC (reprint author), Univ Santiago Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Edafol & Quim Agr, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",mcamps@neiker.net,"Alvarez-Rodriguez, Esperanza/B-3154-2018","Alvarez-Rodriguez, Esperanza/0000-0003-3470-2679; Camps Arbestain, Marta/0000-0002-5354-2087",,,,33,8,13,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

There is limited understanding of patterns of variation that exist among root traits of different species, especially under field conditions. We contrasted 11 fast- and slow-growing species paired within five evolutionary lineages to investigate whether root traits associated with soil resource acquisition were related to species' potential growth rate. 2. Measurements of root morphology, architecture, nitrogen and phenolic concentration, respiration and phosphorus uptake were taken on fine, non-woody roots sampled from forest stands in central Pennsylvania, USA. 3. Across all five contrasts, roots of fast-growing species generally had higher specific root length, smaller diameters, greater degree of branching, and lower phenolic concentrations than those of slow-growing species. This suggests differences in potential soil exploration and root defences among species differing in potential growth rate. 4. There were no significant differences between fast- and slow-growing species in root tissue density, respiration or P uptake. Lack of root physiological differences between species differing in growth rate contrasted with previous research on chamber-grown seedlings. 5. These results imply that, while roots of fast-growing species may be constructed for more rapid soil exploration and shorter life span than those of slow-growing species, root physiology is either more closely tied to overall plant physiology, which is more similar among mature trees, or masked by variation in soil microsites, root age or interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.","Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Plant Physiol Grad Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Ecol Intercoll Grad Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Comas, LH (reprint author), ARS, USDA, PSWMRU, Curtin Rd,Bldg 3702, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lhc105@psu.edu,,,,,,41,190,211,7,125,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We report here the first measured emissions of methyl chloride, methyl bromide, and methyl iodide from ectomycorrhizal fungi. We grew nine fungal isolates on growth media containing halide concentrations similar to those found in soils and plant tissues. The observed range of emissions was 0.003-65 mug methyl chloride, 0.001-3 mug methyl bromide, and 0.02-12 mug methyl iodide g(-1) dry weight fungi day(-1). Species varied in production rates of methyl chloride vs. methyl bromide vs. methyl iodide. Cenococcum geophilum, a widespread ectomycorrhizal fungus, was further tested to investigate the effects of halide substrate concentration in growth media. Emissions from this species increased linearly with increasing concentrations of both bromide and iodide. In addition, a subset of four fungi was studied with two media concentrations each of chloride, bromide, and iodide (0.2 or 20 mm). These fungi had similar responses to halide concentration, despite 1000-fold differences in baseline emission rates between isolates. Finally, high chloride concentrations (20 mm) in media did not appear to inhibit emissions of methyl bromide or methyl iodide. Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi might be an important source of methyl halides to the atmosphere, and substrate concentrations and community composition may influence production levels in ecosystems.","Queens Univ Belfast, QUESTOR Ctr, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Redeker, KR (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, QUESTOR Ctr, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland.",k.redeker@qub.ac.uk,"Treseder, Kathleen/E-5148-2011","Treseder, Kathleen/0000-0003-2847-6935; Redeker, Kelly/0000-0002-1903-2286",,,,34,32,34,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Forest soils contain the largest and longest lived carbon pools in terrestrial ecosystems and are therefore extremely important to the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon and future climate. Soil respiration is a sensitive integrator of many soil processes that control carbon storage in soil, and is therefore a good metric of changes to soil carbon cycling. Here, we summarize soil respiration data from four forest free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments in developing and established forests that have been exposed to elevated atmospheric [CO2] (168 muL L-1 average enrichment) for 2-6 years. The sites have similar experimental design and use similar methodology (closed-path infrared gas analyzers) to measure soil respiration, but differ in species composition of the respective forest communities. We found that elevated atmospheric [CO2] stimulated soil respiration at all sites, and this response persisted for up to 6 years. Young developing stands experienced greater stimulation than did more established stands, increasing 39% and 16%, respectively, averaged over all years and communities. Further, at sites that had more than one community, we found that species composition of the dominant trees was a major controller of the absolute soil CO2 efflux and the degree of stimulation from CO2 enrichment. Interestingly, we found that the temperature sensitivity of bulk soil respiration appeared to be unaffected by elevated atmospheric CO2. These findings suggest that stage of stand development and species composition should be explicitly accounted for when extrapolating results from elevated CO2 experiments or modeling forest and global carbon cycles.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Environm & Resources, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; USDA Forest Serv, N Cent Res Stn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","King, JS (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",jsking@mtu.edu,"Hanson, Paul J.

We compared the concentration of patches of organic matter and root biomass in the subsurface (saturated zone) beneath poorly drained riparian wetland soils at four sites in Rhode Island, USA-two dominated by red maple (Acer rubrum) and two dominated by white pine (Pinus strobus). Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and carbon (C) content of patch material were compared between sites and between patches with different visual characteristics. Root decomposition was measured in an 8-week ex-situ incubation experiment that compared the effects of water content, root species, and soil matrix origin on CO2 evolution. We observed significantly greater concentrations of patches at 55 ern at one red maple site than all other sites. DEA and percent C in patches was generally higher in patches than matrix soil and did not vary between sites or by patch type. White pine roots decomposed at a faster rate than red maple roots under unsaturated conditions. Our results suggest that faster root decomposition could result in lower concentrations of patches of organic material in subsurface soils at sites dominated by white pine. Tree species composition and root decomposition may play a significant role in the formation of patches and the creation and maintenance of groundwater denitrification hotspots in the subsurface of riparian wetlands.","Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Coastal Inst 105, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Addy, K (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Coastal Inst 105, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",kaddy@uri.edu,,"Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255",,,,51,18,21,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2004,263,2-Jan,,,,,335,344,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000047747.56753.f3,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,876ZK,WOS:000225537400030,,,,,10/31/19J,"Baldocchi, DD; Xu, LK; Kiang, N",,,,"Baldocchi, DD; Xu, LK; Kiang, N",,,"How plant functional-type, weather, seasonal drought, and soil physical properties alter water and energy fluxes of an oak-grass savanna and an annual grassland",AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ecohydrology; evaporation; biosphere atmosphere interactions,CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; EDDY-COVARIANCE; DECIDUOUS FOREST; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CONTROLLED ECOSYSTEMS; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES; TEMPERATE GRASSLAND; PRAIRIE ECOSYSTEM; SUMMER DROUGHT,"Savannas and open grasslands often co-exist in semi-arid regions. Questions that remain unanswered and are of interest to biometeorologists include: how do these contrasting landscapes affect the exchanges of energy on seasonal and annual time scales; and, do biophysical constraints imposed by water supply and water demand affect whether the land is occupied by open grasslands or savanna? To address these questions, and others, we examine how a number of abiotic, biotic and edaphic factors modulate water and energy flux densities over an oak-grass savanna and an annual grassland that coexist in the same climate but on soils with different hydraulic properties. The net radiation balance was greater over the oak woodland than the grassland, despite the fact that both canopies received similar sums of incoming short and long wave radiation. The lower albedo and lower radiative surface temperature of the transpiring woodland caused it to intercept and retain more long and shortwave energy over the course of the year, and particularly during the summer dry period. The partitioning of available energy into sensible and latent heat exchanged over the two canopies differed markedly. The annual sum of sensible heat exchange over the woodland was 40% greater than that over the grassland (2.05 GJ m(-2) per year versus 1.46 GJ m(-2) per year). With regards to evaporation, the oak woodland evaporated about 380 mm of water per year and the grassland evaporated about 300 mm per year. Differences in available energy, canopy roughness, the timing of physiological functioning, water holding capacity of the soil and rooting depth of the vegetation explained the observed differences in sensible and latent heat exchange of the contrasting vegetation surfaces. The response of canopy evaporation to diminishing soil moisture was quantified by comparing normalized evaporation rates (in terms of equilibrium evaporation) with soil water potential and volumetric water content measurements. When soil moisture was ample normalized values of latent heat flux density were greater for the grassland (1.1-1.2) than for the oak savanna (0.7-0.8) and independent of moisture content. Normalized rates of evaporation over the grassland declined as volumetric water content dropped below 0.15 m(3) m(-3), which corresponded with a soil water potential of -1.5 MPa. The grassland senesced and quit transpiring when the volumetric water content of the soil dropped below -2.0 MPa. The oak trees, on the other hand, were able to transpire, albeit at low rates, under very dry soil conditions (soil water potentials below -4.0 MPa). The trees were able to endure such low water potentials and maintain basal levels of metabolism because ecological forcings kept the tree density and leaf area index of the woodland low, physiological factors forced the stomata to close progressively and the trees were able to tap deeper water sources (below 0.6 in) than the grasses.

Sites were located in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon. Young stands were approximately 40 years old at the time of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years earlier. Although tree spacing was wider in thinned than in unthinned stands, faster tree growth in thinned stands meant that thinning had no long-term effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very large, widely spaced P. menziesii individuals in old-growth stands contributed similar basal area as the smaller trees in young stands; however, old stands had much higher basal area of shade-tolerant conifers. Although low shrubs responded positively to thinning, the difference in cover between thinned and unthinned stands was too small to be statistically significant. Ordination of sample plots in terms of their understory shrub and herb species composition identified a strong gradient in community composition from young to old-growth stands. Understory species associated with old growth included both gap specialists and those that may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal fungi of old-growth forest floors. Although both thinned and unthinned young stand composition were quite distinct from that of old-growth stands, thinned stands were more similar to old growth than were unthinned stands. Thinned stands had higher frequency of late-seral herbs than did unthinned stands. Forest generalist and release species showed mixed responses to thinning. We conclude that pre-commercial thinning may be a useful management toot to encourage old growth associated understory herbs without precipitating dominance of the understory by low shrubs and weedy species. Although thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes in the understory appear to have been precipitated by the transient increase in resource levels following thinning rather than by any long-term changes in stand structure.

Open-top chambers were used for ambient and elevated ( + 350 mumol mol(-1)) concentrations of CO2, and chamberless rings were used for control. Root dynamics were observed in situ with minirhizotrons during the five summers and root biomass production was measured with root in growth cores during the last two years, from which total root biomass was estimated for each of the five years. The elevated CO2 treatment showed both a greater increase in root numbers during the early summer and a greater decline in root numbers during autumn and winter than the ambient CO2 treatment. Mean root production under elevated CO2 was 50% greater than ambient CO2 during the five years, and the difference increased from + 25% in the first year to + 80% in the last two years. Conversely, during the same period, the elevated to ambient CO2 difference in shoot biomass decreased from + 50% to + 5%. This resulted in a dramatic change in root to shoot ratios in elevated CO2 compared with the ambient treatment, which increased from - 15% in 1996 to + 70% in 2000. Similar differences were seen between elevated CO2 and the chamberless grown control plants, where root to shoot ratios increased steadily from - 47% in 1996 to + 27% in 2000. Less dynamically, the root to shoot ratios of ambient CO2 grown plants compared with the chamberless control plants were consistently - 29% +/- 96% during the experimental period. In conclusion, during the 5 years this grassland was studied, there was a clear shift in plant biomass partitioning from above to below ground for plants exposed to elevated CO2.","SLU, Dept Soil Sci, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; SLU, Ecol & Crop Prod Sci, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Sindhoj, E (reprint author), SLU, Dept Soil Sci, Box 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Katterer, Thomas/H-4440-2019; Katterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Katterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X; Andren, Olof/0000-0002-9817-6308",,,,33,8,9,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"CORT ADELERSGT 17, PO BOX 2562, SOLLI, 0202 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

Four distinguishable native AM species, namely, G. intraradices (BEG 123), G. mosseae (BEG 124), G. clarum (BEG 125) and G. viscosum (BEG 126), were morphologically identified. These strains were also genetically characterised by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of a portion of their SSU rRNA. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences shows that the new sequences of G. mosseae, G. intraradices and G. viscosum cluster with those of the same species found in the database. However, the new sequence of G. clarum fell in a different clade. The effectiveness of these native AM fungi as inoculants for two target varieties of olive (Arbequina and Leccino), currently used in many Mediterranean areas, was assessed. Two AM isolates from our own culture collection, namely G. intraradices and G. mosseae, were also used as reference inocula. G. intraradices and G. viscosum isolated from the target agro-system were the most effective fungi to improve the development of both olive varieties. This study supports the need to explore and exploit the natural diversity of AM fungi as a starting point to formulate inoculants to be applied during the commercial nursery production of olive varieties.

However, the mechanism for enhanced Mg uptake in HiMag leaves has not been determined. The objective was to investigate if increased Mg uptake in HiMag could be explained by differences in elemental distribution among plant parts, root characteristics, or organic acid concentrations compared to its parental cultivars, ""Kentucky 31"" (KY31) and ""Missouri 96"" (MO96). The study was conducted on a surface-irrigated calcareous Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed. rnesic, Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcid). Vegetation and soil cores of 7.6-cm diameter were sampled to a 45-cm soil depth in 15-cm increments. Mass and ash were determined for leaves, crowns, and roots. Leaf area, root length, root area, root length density, elemental concentration, and uptake [potassium (K), calcium (Ca), Mg, sodium (Na), and phosphorus (P)], and malate and citrate concentrations also were determined. Leaf Mg concentration was higher in HiMag than parental cultivars. HiMag generally did not differ in crown and root elemental concentrations from its parents. Risk of causing grass tetany, indicated by leaf K/(Ca + Mg), was lower in HiMag than KY31 and MO96 in both 1994 (P = 0.03) and 1995 (P = 0.01). Root length, area, and mass were not related to cation concentrations in the three tall fescue accessions, suggesting that HiMag may have an active uptake or transport mechanism for Mg.","Univ Idaho, Twin Falls Ctr, Twin Falls, ID 83303 USA; Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; USDA ARS, NW Irrigat & Soils Res Lab, Kimberly, ID USA; Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Forage & Range Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Shewmaker, GE (reprint author), Univ Idaho, Twin Falls Ctr, POB 1827, Twin Falls, ID 83303 USA.",gshew@uidaho.edu,,,,,,23,3,3,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",24-Oct,1532-2416,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

The aged refuse contains a wide spectrum and large quantity of micro-organisms, which can effectively decompose refractory organic matter present in some wastewaters, such as MSW landfill leachate. In this study, a biofiltration reactor consisted of the aged refuse excavated from a 10-year-old closed landfill compartment in the Shanghai Refuse Landfill (SRL) was used for biofiltration of livestock and poultry waste water sampled from a farm. Two hundred kilograms of screened aged refuse (diameter less than 15 mm) was used as biofiltration material in a cylindrical biofilter with a 40-cm inner diameter and a 150-cm height. Around 50 L/day (at a hydraulic load of 250 L/m(3) refuse/day) of the preliminary-treated influent livestock wastewaters with initial CODCr, BOD5, NH3-N, total phosphorus concentrations of 197-2,419, 102-459, 260-1,140, and 24-102 mg/L, was intermittently sprayed over the refuse surface once a day with 3 h per interval. The pollutant concentrations were reduced to below 185 mg/L CODCr, 15 mg/L BOD5, 27 mg/L NH3-N, and 0.5 mg/L total phosphorus, with a removal of 64, 54, 75, 88, 94, and 99%, respectively. However, the removal of the total N is quite low, only around 20-30%. The NH3-N is mainly converted to nitrate N. The removal of the total P is high, possibly because of the strong chemical absorption capacity of the aged refuse in the biofiltration reactor used. The effluent looks clear, in contrast to the brownish color of the influent. The treatment process developed is cost-effective and easily operated.","Tongji Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Zhao, YC (reprint author), Tongji Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",zyclmk@online.sh.cn,,,,,,22,23,42,3,17,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1092-8758,1557-9018,,ENVIRON ENG SCI,Environ.

However, these terms have only been studied at a handful of field sites, and with no consistent calculation methodology. Here we calculate above-ground coarse wood carbon productivity for 104 forest plots in lowland New World humid tropical forests, using a consistent calculation methodology that incorporates corrections for spatial variations in tree-size distributions and wood density, and for census interval length. Mean wood density is found to be lower in more productive forests. We estimate that above-ground coarse wood productivity varies by more than a factor of three (between 1.5 and 5.5 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1)) across the Neotropical plots, with a mean value of 3.1 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1). There appear to be no obvious relationships between wood productivity and rainfall, dry season length or sunshine, but there is some hint of increased productivity at lower temperatures. There is, however, also strong evidence for a positive relationship between wood productivity and soil fertility. Fertile soils tend to become more common towards the Andes and at slightly higher than average elevations, so the apparent temperature/productivity relationship is probably not a direct one. Coarse wood productivity accounts for only a fraction of overall tropical forest net primary productivity, but the available data indicate that it is approximately proportional to total above-ground productivity. We speculate that the large variation in wood productivity is unlikely to directly imply an equivalent variation in gross primary production. Instead a shifting balance in carbon allocation between respiration, wood carbon and fine root production seems the more likely explanation.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Leeds, Earth & Biosphere Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem, Para, Brazil; Interconex Elect SA ISA, Equipo Gest Ambiental, Medellin, Colombia; Museo Noel Kempff Mercado, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; CNRS UPS, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, Toulouse, France; NYU, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10003 USA; Inst Natl Pesquisas Amazon, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; Conservat Int, Ctr Appl Biodivers Sci, Washington, DC USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Herbario Vargas, Cuzco, Peru; Jardin Bot Missouri, Proyecto Flora Peru, Oxapampa, Peru; Fdn Jatun Sacha, Quito, Ecuador; Duke Univ, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27706 USA; Univ Brasilia, Dept Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; CIFOR, Tapajos, Brazil; EMBRAPA Amazonia Oriental, Belem, Para, Brazil; Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Ambientale, INDEFOR, Merida, Venezuela; Int Plant Genet Resources Inst, Rome, Italy","Malhi, Y (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Darwin Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",ymalhi@ed.ac.uk,"Mercado, Lina/A-1890-2012; Laurance, William F/B-2709-2012; Laurance, Susan/G-6021-2011; Lloyd, Jonathan/F-8893-2010; Phillips, Oliver L/A-1523-2011; Pitman, Nigel/A-7681-2008","Laurance, William F/0000-0003-4430-9408; Laurance, Susan/0000-0002-2831-2933; Lloyd, Jonathan/0000-0002-5458-9960; Phillips, Oliver L/0000-0002-8993-6168; SALOMAO, RAFAEL/0000-0003-0947-0132; Pitman, Nigel/0000-0002-9211-2880; Lewis, Simon/0000-0002-8066-6851; Alvarez-Davila, Esteban/0000-0001-9032-0099","Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/B503384/1, NE/B504630/1]",,,47,284,301,0,75,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The frequency and severity of drought in the tropics may increase through stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes, global warming, and rainfall inhibition by land use change. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in moist tropical forests, and the complex relationships between patterns of drought and forest fire regimes, tree mortality, and productivity. We present a simple geographic information system soil water balance model, called RisQue (Risco de Queimada - Fire Risk) for the Amazon basin that we use to conduct an analysis of these patterns for 1996-2001. RisQue features a map of maximum plant-available soil water (PAW(max)) developed using 1565 soil texture profiles and empirical relationships between soil texture and critical soil water parameters. PAW is depleted by monthly evapotranspiration (ET) fields estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation and satellite-derived radiation inputs and recharged by monthly rain fields estimated from 266 meteorological stations. Modeled PAW to 10 m depth (PAW(10 m)) was similar to field measurements made in two Amazon forests. During the severe drought of 2001, PAW(10 m) fell to below 25% of PAW(max) in 31% of the region's forests and fell below 50% PAW(max) in half of the forests. Field measurements and experimental forest fires indicate that soil moisture depletion below 25% PAW(max) corresponds to a reduction in leaf area index of approximately 25%, increasing forest flammability. Hence, approximately one-third of Amazon forests became susceptible to fire during the 2001 ENSO period. Field measurements also suggest that the ENSO drought of 2001 reduced carbon storage by approximately 0.2 Pg relative to years without severe soil moisture deficits. RisQue is sensitive to spin-up time, rooting depth, and errors in ET estimates. Improvements in our ability to accurately model soil moisture content of Amazon forests will depend upon better understanding of forest rooting depths, which can extend to beyond 15 m. RisQue provides a tool for early detection of forest fire risk.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, BR-66035170 Belem, Para, Brazil; Ctr Previsao Tempo & Estudos Climat, BR-12630000 Cachoeira Paulista, SP, Brazil","Nepstad, D (reprint author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",dnepstad@whrc.org,"Tomasella, Javier/I-8073-2012; Tomasella, Javier/M-7635-2019; Mitchard, Edward T A/C-6346-2009","Tomasella, Javier/0000-0003-2597-8833; Tomasella, Javier/0000-0003-2597-8833; Mitchard, Edward T A/0000-0002-5690-4055",,,,56,225,240,4,101,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climates. Here we report results of a large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions by >40% and increased rates of consumption of atmospheric CH4 by a factor of >4. No treatment effect has yet been detected for NO and CO2 fluxes. The responses of these microbial processes after three rainy seasons of the exclusion treatment are characteristic of a direct effect of soil aeration on denitrification, methanogenesis, and methanotrophy. An anticipated second phase response, in which drought-induced plant mortality is followed by increased mineralization of C and N substrates from dead fine roots and by increased foraging of termites on dead coarse roots, has not yet been detected. Analyses of depth profiles of N2O and CO2 concentrations with a diffusivity model revealed that the top 25 cm soil is the site of most of the wet season production of N2O, whereas significant CO2 production occurs down to 100 cm in both seasons, and small production of CO2 occurs to at least 1100 cm depth. The diffusivity-based estimates of CO2 production as a function of depth were strongly correlated with fine root biomass, indicating that trends in belowground C allocation may be inferred from monitoring and modeling profiles of H2O and CO2.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, BR-06035170 Belem, Para, Brazil","Davidson, EA (reprint author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",edavidson@whrc.org,"Davidson, Eric A/K-4984-2013","Davidson, Eric A/0000-0002-8525-8697",,,,41,176,201,7,163,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Moreover, chlorophyllous Neottieae species show naturally occurring achlorophyllous individuals. We investigated the fungal associates of such a member of the Neottieae, Epipactis microphylla, to understand whether their mycorrhizal fungi predispose the Neottieae to mycoheterotrophy. Root symbionts were identified by sequencing the fungal ITS of 18 individuals from three orchid populations, including achlorophyllous and young, subterranean individuals. No rhizoctonias (the usual orchid symbionts) were recovered, but 78% of investigated root pieces were colonized by Tuber spp. Other Pezizales and some Basidiomycetes were also found. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrated for the first time that ascomycetes, especially truffles, form typical orchid mycorrhizae. All identified fungi (but one) belonged to taxa forming ectomycorrhizae on tree roots, and four of them were even shown to colonize surrounding trees. This is reminiscent of mycoheterotrophic orchid species that also associate with ectomycorrhizal. fungi, although with higher specificity. Subterranean and achlorophyllous E. microphylla individuals thus likely rely on tree photosynthates, and a partial mycoheterotrophy in individuals plants can be predicted. We hypothesize that replacement of rhizoctonias by ectomycorrhizal symbionts in Neottieae entails a predisposition to achlorophylly.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR CNRS Systemat Adaptat & Evolut 7138, F-75005 Paris, France; Museum Natl Hist Nat, Serv Systemat Mol, IFR CNRS 101, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Turin, Dipartimento Biol Vegetale, CNR, Ist Protez Piante, I-10125 Turin, Italy; Soc Francaise Orchidophilie, F-26220 Dieulefit, France","Selosse, MA (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR CNRS Systemat Adaptat & Evolut 7138, 43 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",ma.selosse@wanadoo.fr,,"Bonfante, Paola/0000-0003-3576-8530",,,,51,154,169,1,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

The humid tropics exert a disproportionately large influence over terrestrial C storage, but C allocation and belowground retention in these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using mass balance and C-13 isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation and fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on belowground C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report that in unfertilized plots, 80% of the C allocated belowground by trees to roots and mycorrhizae was returned to the atmosphere within 1 year; 9% of the belowground C flux was retained in coarse roots and 11% was retained as new soil C. The gains in new soil C were offset entirely by losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization early in stand development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse roots, it reduced by 22% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae into mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to rhizosphere C flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity of these forests to sequester decay-resistant soil C.","US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Holdsworth Nat Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Giardina, CP (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, 410 MacInnes Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",cgiardina@fs.fed.us,"Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008; Giardina, Christian P/C-3120-2011","Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738; Giardina, Christian P/0000-0002-3431-5073",,,,31,111,119,4,62,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2004,139,4,,,,,545,550,,10.1007/s00442-004-1552-0,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,818HI,WOS:000221235800007,15071736,,,,10/31/19J,"Carey, EV; Marler, MJ; Callaway, RM",,,,"Carey, EV; Marler, MJ; Callaway, RM",,,Mycorrhizae transfer carbon from a native grass to an invasive weed: evidence from stable isotopes and physiology,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; Bouteloua gracilis; carbon transfer; Centaurea maculosa; Festuca idahoensis; invasive weeds,CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; PLANT COMMUNITY; PRAIRIE GRASSES; PHOSPHORUS; NETWORK; FUNGI; C-3; BUNCHGRASSES; DIVERSITY; SYMBIOSIS,"Invasive exotic weeds pose one of the earth's most pressing environmental problems. Although many invaders completely eliminate native plant species from some communities, ecologists know little about the mechanisms by which these exotics competitively exclude other species. Mycorrhizal fungi radically alter competitive interactions between plants within natural communities, and a recent study has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide a substantial competitive advantage to spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa, a noxious perennial plant that has spread throughout much of the native prairie in the northwestern U. S. Here we present evidence that this advantage is potentially due to mycorrhizally mediated transfer of carbon from a native bunch-grass, Festuca idahoensis, to Centaurea. Centaurea maculosa, Festuca idahoensis (Idaho fescue, C-3), and Bouteloua gracilis (blue gramma, C-4) were grown in the greenhouse either alone or with Centaurea in an incomplete factorial design with and without AM fungi. Centaurea biomass was 87-168% greater in all treatments when mycorrhizae were present in the soil (P < 0.0001). However, Centaurea biomass was significantly higher in the treatment with both mycorrhizae and Festuca present together than in any other treatment combination (P < 0.0001). This high biomass was attained even though Centaurea photosynthetic rates were 14% lower when grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae together than when grown with Festuca without mycorrhizae. Neither biomass nor photosynthetic rates of Centaurea were affected by competition with the C-4 grass Bouteloua either with or without mycorrhizae. The stable isotope signature of Centaurea leaves grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae was more similar to that of Festuca, than when Centaurea was grown alone with mycorrhizae (P = 0.06), or with Festuca but without mycorrhizae (P = 0.09). This suggests that carbon was transferred from Festuca to the invasive weed. We estimated that carbon transferred from Festuca by mycorrhizae contributed up to 15% of the aboveground carbon in Centaurea plants. Our results indicate that carbon parasitism via AM soil fungi may be an important mechanism by which invasive plants out compete their neighbors, but that this interaction is highly species-specific.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Carey, EV (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",ecarey@umn.edu,,,,,,32,79,93,7,98,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAY,2004,172,1,,,,,133,141,,10.1023/B:VEGE.0000026031.14086.f1,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,816PH,WOS:000221121300012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pennanen, T; Caul, S; Daniell, TJ; Griffiths, BS; Ritz, K; Wheatley, RE",,,,"Pennanen, T; Caul, S; Daniell, TJ; Griffiths, BS; Ritz, K; Wheatley, RE",,,Community-level responses of metabolically-active soil microorganisms to the quantity and quality of substrate inputs,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,substrate-induced respiration; ribosomal RNA; soil microbial community; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; INDUCED RESPIRATION METHOD; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; GRASSLAND SOILS; RIBOSOMAL DNA; GROWTH-RATE; BACTERIAL; EXTRACTION; DIVERSITY; RATES,"The community fingerprints of both the prevalent and the metabolically active microbial community were related to a quantitative estimation of microbial biomass in an arable soil, revealed by substrate-induced-respiration (SIR). Two concentrations of glucose or L-asparagine, representing those used in the SIR measurement or equivalent to those released in root exudates, were studied. Respiration rates and changes in community structure fingerprints were followed for 48 In. Bacterial and fungal community fingerprints were obtained using both reverse transcribed 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions and the corresponding rDNA as a template in PCR. Samples were then analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Low concentrations of substrate amendments resulted in minor changes in rRNA or rDNA-based bacterial and fungal banding patterns during the whole 48 In incubation. High concentrations of substrates, especially L-asparagine, increased respiration rates and induced significant changes in both 16S rRNA and rDNA-community fingerprints. The prominent rRNA and rDNA bacterial community sequence types were common. to all treatments, but in general the bacterial rDNA fingerprints had fewer bands than the corresponding rRNA profiles that assess the. active fraction of the community. In contrast, there was little difference between fungal 18S rRNA and rDNA patterns. The number of fungal ribosomal sequence types in DGGE fingerprints was lower than the number of bacterial types. This study indicated that there was a rapid respiration response by the whole microbial community during SIR estimates in soil, but that community structure did not change during the conventional incubation period. In an extended (8-48 h) incubation with high amounts Of L-asparagine increased respiration was associated with growth of the microbial community. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Laws) forest. Forest management consists of clearcut harvest and natural regeneration. Soil microbial activity is interconnected with forest processes because substrate quality and availability can be important driving variables. Stand development influences the soil water regime, and water availability may also limit microbial activity. We determined factors limiting litter and mineral soil carbon (C) mineralisation rates in undisturbed old growth and regenerating (hereafter, young) ponderosa pine stands under a semi-arid climate. Mass of litter and dead fine roots did not differ significantly between the stands, but litter substrate quality was different. Young stand litter had significantly higher concentrations of total nitrogen (N), extractable organic N, extractable C, and microbial C and N than that from the old stand, probably because of litter fall from the broadleaved shrub understorey, including the N-fixing species Purshia tridentata (Pursch) DC, that comprised 40% of the young stand's leaf area. The old stand contained no understorey. For litter samples from the two stands, wetted to 60% of water-holding capacity (WHC), net mineral-N and CO2-C mineralisation rates were similar despite the substrate quality differences. Mineral soil properties at 0-0.1 m depth were similar in the two stands, except for lower CO2-C production in samples from the young stand; at 0.1-0.5 m depth, total C and N and microbial N concentrations were higher in the young stand. Net mineral-N production in field-moist soil, sampled during a typical summer drought and incubated at 25 degreesC for 56 days, was generally 3-6 mg kg(-1) soil at both sites, but increased up to 29 mg kg(-1) upon wetting to 60% of water-holding capacity. Over 56-day-long incubations, wetting also increased litter and soil microbial respiration rates by factors of about 500 and 3, respectively. The incubations yielded a proportionality between respiration rate and water content that was supported by in situ measurements of soil respiration in the young stand, before and after irrigation. A hypothetically wet year without soil water deficit caused a 2.5-fold increase in a modelled estimate of the young stand's annual soil respiration rate. Litter and soil C mineralisation rates in these ponderosa pine forests thus appeared to be limited much more by the availability of water than by a lack of available C or N substrates.

We measured approximately twice as much dead below-ground biomass in the grazed site as in the ungrazed site, with a strong concentration of total below-ground biomass towards the upper 10 cm of the soil layer in both sites. The main contribution to total live biomass was accounted for by very fine (<0.5 mm) and fine roots (0.5-1.0 mm) both at the grazed (79%) and at the ungrazed (81%) sites. We measured more dead biomass for almost all root components, more live biomass of rhizomes, tap roots and bulbs, and less live biomass of thicker roots (>1 mm) in the grazed site. The seasonal variation of total live below-ground biomass mainly reflected climate, with the growing season being limited to the warmer and wetter portion of the year, but such variation was higher in the grazed site. Using different methods of estimation of BNPP, we estimated maximum values of 1241 and 723 g m(-2) year(-1) for the grazed and ungrazed sites, respectively. We estimated that very fine root productivity was almost twice as high at the grazed site as at the ungrazed one, despite the fact that both sites had similar total live biomass, and root turnover rate was twofold at the grazed site.","Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, IMBIV, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Catedra Biogeog, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Dept Geofis Astron & Biol, San Juan, Argentina","Pucheta, E (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, IMBIV, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",,"Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018",,,,,41,83,104,3,72,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,APR,2004,29,2,,,,,201,208,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01337.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,809HR,WOS:000220628300008,,Green Published,,,10/31/19J,"Huang, QY; Chen, WL; Guo, XJ",,,,"Huang, QY; Chen, WL; Guo, XJ",,,"Chemical fractionation of copper, zinc, and cadmium in two Chinese soils as influenced by rhizobia",COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil; heavy metal fractionation; rhizobia; copper; zinc; cadmium,SPECIATION; MICROORGANISMS; MOBILIZATION; METALS; LEAD,"Red soil and Cinnamon soil were collected from Chenzhou of Hunan and Gongyi of Henan, respectively.

Sequential extraction method was employed to investigate the forms of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) in the examined soils with the absence and presence of rhizobia. Results showed that the total amount of solid-bound Zn decreased 10% after the inoculation. The decrease for the amount of Zn associated with carbonate, manganese (Mn) oxides, and organic matter fraction was from 9 to 26%. No significant change was observed for the total amount of Zn combined with solid phase of Red soil in the presence of rhizobia. However, the amount of specifically adsorbed and Mn oxides bound Zn decreased, while the amount of exchangeable Zn increased. Inoculation of rhizobia depressed the release of Cu to the soil solution and increased the total amount of Cu associated with solid phase in Cinnamon soil. The increase for the amount of exchangeable Cu and the Cu in fractions of carbonate, Mn oxides, and organic matter ranged from 20 to 54%. There was no significant change for the level of Cd in the solution in both soils after rhizobia inoculation. The amount of Cd in the fractions of exchangeable and organic increased 22 and 11%, while that in the fractions of specific and Mn oxides decreased 14 and 29%, respectively. The different influence of rhizobia on the distribution of three heavy metals in two soils was mainly ascribed to the growth status and pH changes exerted by the metabolites of rhizobia. These data are helpful for the understanding of the chemical behavior and biogeochemical cycle of heavy metals affected by microorganisms in soil environment, which is fundamental for heavy metal bioremediation.","Huazhong Agr Univ, Fac Resources & Environm, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei Province, Peoples R China","Huang, QY (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Fac Resources & Environm, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",qyhuang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012; Chen, Wenli/D-5625-2014",,,,,22,4,9,0,11,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

In addition, a better understanding of the effects of natural disturbances on C cycling is critical, particularly in light of alterations to disturbance regimes that may occur with global climate change. However, quantitative data about how postfire differences in ecosystem structure affect C allocation patterns are lacking. For this study, we examined how above- and belowground C pools, fluxes, and allocation patterns varied with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age in lodgepole pine stands in Yellowstone National Park of four forest types: low (< 1000 trees/ha), moderate (7000-40 000 trees/ha), and high tree densities (>50 000 trees/ha) in 13-year-old stands, and in similar to110-year-old mature stands. C pools in live biomass and detritus were estimated with allometric equations and direct sampling. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated as aboveground biomass increment plus fine litterfall, and total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) was estimated using a C balance approach. Our results indicate that the magnitude of C pools and fluxes varies greatly with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age. Coarse woody debris and mineral soil carbon accounted for the majority of total ecosystem C in young stands (91-99%), in contrast to mature stands where the largest amount of C was found in live biomass (64%).

Notably, the ratio of TBCA to (TBCA + ANPP) remained remarkably constant (0.63-0.66) across extreme gradients of tree density and stand age, differing only slightly for the low-density young stands (0.54). These results suggest that C allocation patterns in a postfire lodgepole pine ecosystem are independent of tree density and stand age.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degreee Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Litton, CM (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, POB 3165, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",clitton@fullerton.edu,"Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008","Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738",,,,72,75,90,4,49,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We investigated the effects of soil fungi on interactions between the invasive weed Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed) and six species native to the intermountain prairies of the northwestern United States. We also compared the effect of C. maculosa on the composition of the soil microbial community to that of the native species. In the field, fungicide (Benomyl) reduced AM mycorrhizal colonization of C. maculosa roots by >80%. Fungicide did not significantly reduce non-AM fungi. When grown alone, the biomass of C. maculosa was not affected by the fungicide application. However, depending on the combination of native competitor and fungicide, C. maculosa biomass varied from 10-fold decreases to 1.9-fold increases. In untreated soils, C. maculosa grew larger in the presence of Festuca idahoensis or Koeleria cristata than when alone. When fungicide was applied these positive effects of Festuca and Koeleria on C. maculosa did not occur. A third native grass, Pseudoroegneria spicata, had much stronger competitive effects on C. maculosa than Festuca or Koeleria, and fungicide reduced the competitive effects of Pseudoroegneria. Fungicide increased Centaurea biomass when competing with the forb Gallardia aristata. However, fungicide did not affect the way two other forbs; Achillea millefolium and Linum lewisii, interacted with C. maculosa. Rhizosphere microbial communities in the root zones of the three native bunchgrass species differed from that of C. maculosa. However, despite the strong effects of soil fungi in field interactions and differences in microbial community composition, soil biota from different plant rhizospheres did not affect the growth of C. maculosa in the absence of native competitors in greenhouse experiments. Our results suggest that successful invasions by exotic plant species can be affected by complex and often beneficial effects of local soil microbial communities. These effects were not manifest as simple direct effects, but become apparent only when native plants, invasive plants, and soil microbial communities were interacting at the same time.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",callaway@selway.umt.edu,,,,,,74,166,182,7,131,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2004,85,4,,,,,1062,1071,,10.1890/02-0775,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,811IW,WOS:000220766600017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Vivanco, JM; Bais, HP; Stermitz, FR; Thelen, GC; Callaway, RM",,,,"Vivanco, JM; Bais, HP; Stermitz, FR; Thelen, GC; Callaway, RM",,,Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: novel weapons and exotic invasion,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,8-hydroxyquinoline; allelopathy; biota; Centaurea diffusa; microbes; soil,SPOTTED KNAPWEED; CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; PLANT INVASION; NEIGHBORS; RELEASE; BIOLOGY; GROWTH,"Centaurea diffusa is one of the most destructive invasive weeds in the western USA and allelopathy appears to contribute to its invasiveness (Callaway & Aschehoug 2000). Here we identify a chemical from the root exudates of C. diffusa, 8-hydroxyquinoline, not previously reported as a natural product, and find that it varies biogeographically in its natural concentration and its effect as an allelochemical. 8-Hydroxyquinoline is at least three times more concentrated in C. diffusa-invaded North American soils than in this weed's native Eurasian soils and has stronger phytotoxic effects on grass species from North America than on grass species from Eurasia. Furthermore, experimental communities built from North American plant species are far more susceptible to invasion by C. diffusa than communities built from Eurasian species, regardless of the biogeographical origin of the soil biota. Sterilization of North American soils suppressed C. diffusa more than sterilization of Eurasian soils, indicating that North American soil biota may also promote invasion by C. diffusa. Eurasian plants and soil microbes may have evolved natural resistance to 8-hydroxyquinoline while North American plants have not, suggesting a remarkable potential for evolutionary compatibility and homeostasis among plants within natural communities and a mechanism by which exotic weeds destroy these communities.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Montana, Dept Biol Sci, Missoula, MO USA","Vivanco, JM (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",jvivanco@lamar.colostate.edu,"Rechsteiner, Cynthia/C-5894-2011",,,,,27,183,223,4,121,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Partial cultivation and abandonment of a C-4-dominated grassland ca. 1930, and natural recovery to a native C-3-dominated grassland changed the C-13/(12) C ratio (reported in units of delta(13)C parts per thousand) of plant residue inputs to soil organic matter. After 70 years, macro-organic matter carbon (MOMC) differed up to 5.6 parts per thousand, and fine soil organic carbon (FSOC) by 2.9 parts per thousand near the surface; differences declined to a depth of 1 m. Mean residence time estimates differed among fractions from a short 35 years for MOMC 0-5 cm, to a longer 413 years for FSOC 5-10 cm. The background carbon pool on this site was substantial, and the minimum change in soil carbon of 10.29 Mg C ha(-1) over 70 years represented less than 7% of the carbon pool to a 1-m depth. Considerable vertical and horizontal variation in soil organic carbon mass and C-13 content were observed. Variation due to small sample size was a more substantial limitation than cumulative analytical variation for calculating turnover estimates >500 years or at depths >20 cm. Corrections for bias were also necessary since imperfect physical separation of soil organic matter fractions, or CO32- contamination, were issues. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

BSP)-dominated sites comprising a boreal forest chronosequence near Thompson, Man., Canada. The sites burned between 1998 and 1850, and each contained separate well- and poorly drained stands. All components of NPP were measured, most for 3 consecutive years. Total NPP was low (50-100 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) immediately after fire, highest 12-20 years after fire (332 and 521 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the dry and wet stands, respectively) but 50% lower than this in the oldest stands. Tree NPP was highest 37 years after fire but 16-39% lower in older stands, and was dominated by deciduous seedlings in the young stands and by black spruce trees (>85%) in the older stands. The chronosequence was unreplicated but these results were consistent with 14 secondary sites sampled across the landscape. Bryophytes comprised a large percentage of aboveground NPP in the poorly drained stands, while belowground NPP was 0-40% of total NPP. Interannual NPP variability was greater in the youngest stands, the poorly drained stands, and for understory and detritus production. Net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated using heterotrophic soil and woody debris respiration data from previous studies in this chronosequence, implied that the youngest stands were moderate C sources (roughly, 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), the middle-aged stands relatively strong sinks (100-300 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and the oldest stands about neutral with respect to the atmosphere. The ecosystem approach employed in this study provided realistic estimates of chronosequence NPP and NEP, demonstrated the profound impact of wildfire on forest-atmosphere C exchange, and emphasized the need to account for soil drainage, bryophyte production, and species succession when modeling boreal forest C fluxes.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA; NE Forestry Univ, Ecol Program, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Bond-Lamberty, B (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bpbond@wisc.edu,"Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426",,,,101,197,215,9,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Burning of slash (woody debris) piles resulting from the harvest of fuel wood is a common management technique designed to reduce fire risk and increase establishment of understorey vegetation in many semi-arid woodlands. However, the consequences of slash burning on plant communities and their below-ground fungal mutualists are poorly understood. 2. We examined how the burning of slash piles affected understorey plant communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a pinyon-juniper woodland in northern Arizona, USA, 5 years after harvesting. We analysed plant communities and AM inoculum potential along 16 transects in: (i) burned slash pile sites; (ii) interspaces between burned slash piles; (iii) non-burned canopy sites; and (iv) non-burned interspaces. We quantified AM colonization of dominant native and exotic plants in burned and non-burned areas. 3. Burned areas had significantly fewer understorey plant species than non-burned areas, and exotic species were four times more abundant at burned slash sites than at other sites. 4. Exotic plants from burned and non-burned areas exhibited levels of AM colonization that were 50% greater than native plants. Bioassay and field-collected plants exhibited similar levels of AM colonization and there were no significant treatment differences. 5. The total biomass of bioassay plants grown in soil from burned slash sites averaged 19% greater than plant biomass from other sites, and had 27% more phosphorus in their shoot tissue; however, tissue nitrogen contents were similar. 6. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that either fire did not reduce AM inoculum potential, or that AM fungal populations recovered in the 5 years after the slash was burned. Changes in understorey plant communities and increases in exotic species with burning could result from other soil changes (e.g. species of AM fungi present), reduction of native species in the seed bank or greater dispersal ability of exotic plants compared with native plant species. We suggest that burning slash piles as a management tool in pinyon-juniper woodlands can result in plant communities that are persistently dominated by exotic species. Management approaches that utilize fuel wood harvest alone or that incorporate seeding of native plants may achieve the desired results.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Haskins, KE (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Kristin.Haskins@nau.edu,,,,,,62,41,42,0,29,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the effect of vegetative water utilization on soil water content; and (2) monitor the long-term vegetative response to the change of soil water content after establishing the revegetation of sand dunes of the Shapotou Region in the Tengger Desert, Northern China. The permanent revegetation plots were established in different sites in 1956, 1964, 1976 and 1982. Soil water content was monitored at 20 cm intervals of 10-300 cm in depth. Water content in sand dunes, was measured gravimetrically after 24-h desiccation at 105degreesC during the entire period of revegetation through the year to 2000. Our data show that soil water contents rapidly decreased at 9-10 years after revegetation, and similarly the vertical profile of soil water contents also decreased by depth. Annual precipitation is positively correlated with the water contents at depths 0-40cm, although no clear-cut relationship was shown between precipitation and soil water at the deeper soil layers (from 40 to 300 cm). it is therefore concluded that water utilization of different plant species: shrub with deep-rooting system and annual plants with shallow-rooting system influences the spatial distribution of water inside the soil profile. Temporal and spatial variances of soil water also affected the changes in composition, coverage and biomass of vegetation. Vegetation composition of dominant species has successively changed from all shrub species, such as Caragana korshinskii and Hedysarum scoparaium to annual plants and shrub with shallow-rooting system (Artemisia ordosica). The shrub biomass also changed along with soil water content, although the biomass of herb species increased over time. After 45 years, the shrub coverage decreased from the highest average 30.21% to the current level of 6%, whereas herb coverage increased over time. The soil water content was, however, kept relatively constant at lower level (1.23%) despite shrub coverage was reduced to about 6%. These results provide important baseline information for establishing vegetation and utilization of limited water resource in and desert regions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a multi-scale methodology to link field inventory data reported at plot and forestry district levels through a remotely sensed total plant biomass map derived from 1-km(2) AVHRR image. Total litter fall was estimated as function of elevation and latitude. Leaf litter fall, a surrogate for fine root production, was estimated from total litter fall by forest type. The gridded NPP estimates agreed well with previously reported NPP values, based on point measurements. Regional NPP increases from northeast to southwest. It is positively related to annual mean temperature and annual mean total precipitation (strongly correlated with temperature) and is negatively related to elevation at broad scale. Total NPP (TNPP) values for representative cells selected based on three criteria were highly correlated with simulated values from a process-based model (CEVSA) at 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees resolution. At 1-km(2) resolution, mean above-ground NPP in the region was 408 g/m(2)/yr ranging from 172 to 1091 (standard deviation (SD) = 134). Mean TNPP was 563 (252 to 1426, SD = 176). Ranges and SD were reduced while the mean values of the estimated NPP stayed almost constant as cell size increased from 1-km(2) to 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees, as expected.

In a field experiment, cultivar Sona was grown at two P levels on eight soil types at three locations. There were large differences in extractable (0.2 mM CaCl2) rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations amongst the locations. The effect of P fertiliser was variable and carboxylate concentrations depended on soil type. To examine the effect of soil P in more detail, a glasshouse experiment was carried out, in which three cultivars (Heera, Sona and Tyson) were grown at four P levels on one soil type. The biomass of chickpea plants increased with increasing P level of the soil, and the root mass ratio decreased at the highest soil P level. However, rhizosphere concentrations of the carboxylates malonate, malate and citrate did not differ significantly between P treatments. This implied that there was no simple relation between available P and root exudation rates, in contrast to earlier results in studies using hydroponics. Cultivars differed in carboxylate concentration pattern: Sona and Tyson showed a tendency towards increased rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations at the second harvest, whereas the carboxylate concentration of Heera tended to decrease. It is hypothesised that chickpea roots always exude a basal level of carboxylates into the rhizosphere. They only increase carboxylate exudation considerably when the P availability is extremely low, which may occur in soils that strongly bind P.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Wouterlood, M (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",mwouterl@agric.uwa.edu.au,"Veneklaas, Erik J/C-8907-2009; Cawthray, Gregory R/E-7404-2013; Lambers, Hans/A-1544-2008","Veneklaas, Erik J/0000-0002-7030-4056; Lambers, Hans/0000-0002-4118-2272",,,,33,21,22,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2004,261,2-Jan,,,,,1,10,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000035568.28893.f6,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,839WJ,WOS:000222815300001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, Y; Guo, LD; Liu, RJ",,,,"Zhang, Y; Guo, LD; Liu, RJ",,,"Survey of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in deforested and natural forest land in the subtropical region of Dujiangyan, southwest China",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,disturbance; diversity; mycorrhiza; subtropical forest,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANT; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; SPORES; SOILS; FIRE,"The diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi in deforested (Mantoushan) and natural forest (Banruosi) land in the subtropical region of Dujiangyan was surveyed and compared.

Arguments in favor of hierarchical modeling are made, especially for considering a complex environmental issue like widespread eastern hemlock regeneration failure. We present the philosophy and basic framework for the NORTHern Woodland Dynamics Simulator (NORTHWDS) Integrated Hierarchical Model System (NIHMS). NIHMS has an individual tree component (the NORTHWDS Individual Response Model (NIRM)), a mesoscale stand simulator (NORTHWDS), and a landscape model (NORTHWDS Landscape Model (NLM, presented in another paper)). NIRM predicts the behavior of a tree given the physical and biotic environment that constrains its performance, using process-response functions at a scale larger than the individual plant. The NORTHWDS model integrates both the structure of the individual tree model (including tree growth and mortality functions) with a series of ecosystem processes (e.g. competition, site biogeochemistry, small-scale disturbance, deer browsing) and even larger scale events (e.g. catastrophic windthrow) to predict long-term stand dynamics on a 5-year simulation cycle. The boundaries in time and space between the NIRM, NORTHWDS, and NLM models are not discrete, but overlap due to the multiscale expression of ecological and physiological processes. For example, the NORTHWDS model represents both the intersection between the NIRM and NLM models with additional unique mesoscale processes (e.g. intertree competition). At the highest level of NIHMS, NLM provides the environmental context for NORTHWDS, with all levels operating in an internally consistent and parsimonious manner. Three case study scenarios are used to illustrate some of the potential applications of NIRM. Scenario 1: simulation of northern red oak survivorship, crown dynamics, diameter increment, and cumulative propagule production under different local stand densities; Scenario 2: the response of white ash along an available nitrogen gradient with respect to mortality, crown surface area, diameter growth, tree biomass, and propagule production; and Scenario 3: the survivorship and total propagule production of black spruce along a soil moisture gradient. Under Scenario 1, crown size decreased appreciably as local stand density increased from open-grown (<1 m(2)/ha) to closed canopy conditions (15-30 m(2)/ha), triggering reduced annual increment, lower established propagule production, and increased small tree mortality. Similarly, nitrogen (for white ash) and moisture (for black spruce) gradients significantly affected crown size and growth potential, with many of the same consequences as noted for increased competition in northern red oak. These predictions were consistent with ecological expectations for all scenarios except the black spruce moisture gradient response, which arose because of scale-related issues and the complexity of gradients. To evaluate NORTHWDS model behavior, a 36 ha synthetic stand resembling a hardwood-dominated forest from northern Wisconsin was simulated for 300 years using four windthrow disturbance scenarios (no windthrow, acute windthrow only, chronic windthrow only, and both types of windthrow). Acute (particularly severe but locally discrete and infrequent events) windthrow patterns were designed to generate many small, low intensity events, while chronic windthrow (pervasive yet low intensity cyclic loss of trees) losses depended on species, stature, rooting depth, and tree exposure. These scenarios were compared by examining differences in structural (i.e. biomass, tree richness) and compositional attributes for a number of key species. NORTHWDS predicted the maturation of a pole-sized aspen stand and its eventual conversion to a predominantly sugar maple forest. Quantitatively, aboveground biomass levels comparable to field data were forecast (up to 250-300 Mg/ha, depending on the scenario). The predicted dominance of sugar maple was also consistent with other regional studies, and can be attributed to its shade and browsing tolerance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Basal diameter, height, number of leaves and number of scars of approximately 100 individuals were monitored between 1991 and 1996. These measurements were used to estimate the age of 28 seedlings (up to 137 cm, of height) that were excavated for root depth measurements, and a model was derived for estimating root penetration rate for D. kunthii at this site. The deepest individual excavated had roots as deep as 10 m and had a mean estimated age of 15 years. Root penetration rate was higher below 3 m depth than in more superficial soil, perhaps due to a decrease in soil resistance, with depth. Some individuals made use of less resistant soil, such as leaf-cutter ants' nests or the channels of dead roots, to increase their root depth. Pre-dawn leaf water potential, measured in 28 other individuals, was uniformly high in plants with a diameter greater than 12 mm, but highly variable in plants with a smaller diameter, indicating lower water deficit in more deeply rooting plants. Deep rooting was shown to be a priority in the development of D. kunthii and may contribute to its success in establishing in regenerating seasonal forests. Soil heterogeneity plays an important role in allowing for deeper root penetration, which may result in a reduction in the water deficit during the dry season. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This decline may be attributed, in part, to local atmospheric N deposition, which causes elevated soil NO3-. Unaffected soils have low N with a relatively higher concentration of NH4+ than NO3-. The objectives in this study were: (1) to compare the short-term uptake of (NO3-)-N-15 and (NH4+)-N-15 by B. madritensis and A. californica and (2) to discern whether (NO3-)-N-15 or (NH4+)-N-15 uptake is influenced by the mycorrhizal status of either plant species. Analysis of N-15 concentrations indicated that both A. californica and B. madritensis took up more (NO3-)-N-15 than (NH4+)-N-15, but overall, B. madritensis took up 6-15 times more of both forms of N-15 than A. californica. Mycorrhizal A. californica had an increased (NH4+)-N-15 concentration in roots but not shoots. In B. madritensis, the only mycorrhizal response was a reallocation of (NO3-)-N-15, with mycorrhizal plants retaining a higher proportion of (NO3-)-N-15 in roots. Overall, arbuscular mycorrhizae had a small effect on N-15 uptake in this short-term study. However, the ability of B. madritensis to take up so much N-15 may explain in part why it has been so successful in replacing A. californica in CSS.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Yoshida, LC (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, 261 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",lyoshida@uci.edu,,,,,,44,22,26,1,21,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Thus, plants were thought to use N that microbes ""left over,"" allowing the N cycle to be divided cleanly into two pieces-the microbial decomposition side and the plant uptake and use side. These were linked by the process of net mineralization. Over the last decade, research has changed these views. N cycling is now seen as being driven by the depolymerization of N-containing polymers by microbial (including mycorrhizal) extracellular enzymes. This releases organic N-containing monomers that may be used by either plants or microbes. However, a complete new conceptual model of the soil N cycle needs to incorporate recent research on plant-microbe competition and microsite processes to explain the dynamics of N across the wide range of N availability found in terrestrial ecosystems. We discuss the evolution of thinking about the soil N cycle, propose a new integrated conceptual model that explains how N cycling changes as ecosystem N availability changes, and discuss methodological issues raised by the changing paradigm of terrestrial N cycling.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Forest Nutr Coop, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Schimel, JP (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",Schimel@lifesci.ucsb.edu,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,117,1166,1232,37,962,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2004,85,3,,,,,591,602,,10.1890/03-8002,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,805VD,WOS:000220392900001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chen, XY; Eamus, D; Hutley, LB",,,,"Chen, XY; Eamus, D; Hutley, LB",,,Seasonal patterns of fine-root productivity and turnover in a tropical savanna of northern Australia,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Australia; below-ground; fine-root growth; in-growth bag; net primary productivity; savannas; temporal and spatial distribution; turnover rate,SOUTHERN INDIA; FOREST; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOMASS; DYNAMICS,,"No Terr Univ, Fac Sci Informat Technol & Educ, Cooperat Res Ctr Sustainable Dev Trop Savannas, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Chen, XY (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 100 St Georges St,Room 5047, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",chenx@geog.utoronto.ca,"Eamus, Derek/F-7375-2017; Hutley, Lindsay B/A-7925-2011","Eamus, Derek/0000-0003-2765-8040; Hutley, Lindsay B/0000-0001-5533-9886",,,,17,36,41,2,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

The nodA gene, which is essential for symbiosis, is responsible for the attachment of the fatty acid group to the oligosaccharide backbone. The nodZ, nolL, and noeI genes are involved in specific modifications of Nod factors common to bradyrhizobia, i.e., the transfer of a fucosyl group on the Nod factor core, fucose acetylation and fucose methylation, respectively. PCR amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of nodA gene sequences from a collection of diverse Bradyrhizobium strains revealed the monophyletic character with the possible exception of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium, despite high sequence diversity. The distribution of the nodZ, nolL, and noeI genes in the studied strains, as assessed by gene amplification, hybridization or sequencing, was found to correlate with the nodA tree topology. Moreover, the nodA, nodZ, and noeI phylogenies were largely congruent, but did not closely follow the taxonomy of the strains shown by the housekeeping 16S rRNA and dnaK genes. Additionally, the distribution of nodZ, noeI, and nolL genes suggested that their presence may be related to the requirements of their legume hosts. These data indicated that the spread and maintenance of nodulation genes within the Bradyrhizobium genus occurred through vertical transmission, although lateral gene transfer also played a significant role.

We tested the hypothesis that foliar endophytes of grasses may also affect below-ground processes upon their host death, by altering the litter quality for detritivores or the microenvironment for decomposition. Microcosm-litterbag experiments were used to assess decay rates for litter produced by endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) infected vs uninfected Lolium multiflorum plants, and to examine endophyte-mediated effects of prior site occupants on current litter decomposition. We found that litter from endophyte-infected L. multiflorum decomposed more slowly than litter from endophyte-free conspecifics and from a naturally uninfected grass, Bromus unioloides. Furthermore, the endophyte-grass association modified the decomposition environment, so that B. unioloides litter decomposed faster when placed underneath a thick layer of endophyte-free L. multiflorum litter. Litter decay rates increased with the amount of root debris remaining in situ from the previous season, but were not affected by the infection status of prior site occupants. The lower decomposability of litter from infected L. multiflorum plants persisted across a range of microenvironments, as determined by different amounts of above-ground litter and soil moisture conditions. Endophyte infection tended to reduce the N content of decaying litter; however, litter N and C/N ratio mainly accounted for interspecific differences in decomposition. Our results imply that fungal endophytes not only can affect herbivory food chains, but also soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they regulate. This study suggests a novel role for symbiotic foliar endophytes in linking above-ground and below-ground sub-systems.","Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IFEVA, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Recursos Nat & Ambiente, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Omacini, M (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IFEVA, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",omacini@ifeva.edu.ar,,,,,,52,56,64,1,17,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2004,104,3,,,,,581,590,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,775CV,WOS:000189023900017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rasanen, LA; Saijets, S; Jokinen, K; Lindstrom, K",,,,"Rasanen, LA; Saijets, S; Jokinen, K; Lindstrom, K",,,"Evaluation of the roles of two compatible solutes, glycine betaine and trehalose, for the Acacia senegal-Sinorhizobium symbiosis exposed to drought stress",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia senegal; compatible solutes; drought stress; infection process; nodulation; osmotic stress; Sinorhizobium,RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; LEGUMINOUS TREES; MOISTURE STRESS; HEAT-STRESS; GROWTH; BACTERIA; DESICCATION; RESPONSES; PLANTS; OSMOPROTECTANTS,"Acacia senegal (Mimosoideae) is a leguminous, nitrogen-fixing tree that grows in arid areas of Africa and the Near East.

We also evaluated if two exogenous compatible solutes, glycine betaine and trehalose, are advantageous for the A. senegal-Sinorhizobium symbiosis and if these solutes are capable of protecting two Sinorhizobium strains from salt stress (NaCl) and osmotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). A. senegal seedlings exposed to severe drought stress developed more root hairs than plants grown under moderate stress. After inoculation with the GUS marked S. arboris strain HAMBI 2180 the hairs were deformed but infection threads occurred only occasionally. Non-typically deformed hairs were dwarfed and swollen. Severely stressed roots contained less nodules but more nodule initials than moderately stressed ones. Nodules formed showed a lowered glucuronidase activity and signs of premature senescence. The numbers of culturable rhizobia in soil mix were reduced from 10(7) to 10(6) CFU g(-1). Thirty days after inoculation severely drought-stressed A. senegal seedlings were wilted. Regarding endogenous glycine betaine, A. Senegal appeared to be a non-accumulator plant but was able to translocate foliar-applied glycine betaine into roots.

In the case of salt stress only trehalose had a favourable effect. Application of 0.0003 M glycine betaine or trehalose into A. senegal soil mix exposed to severe drought stress maintained the numbers of culturable rhizobia at the same level as in moderately stressed soils. The presence of glycine betaine in the soil mix also helped A. senegal seedlings survive under severe drought.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Kemira Oyj, Espoo Res Ctr, FIN-02271 Espoo, Finland","Rasanen, LA (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, POB 56,Bioctr 1, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Leena.A.Rasanen@helsinki.fi,,"Lindstrom, Kristina/0000-0001-9499-1797",,,,45,25,27,1,23,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2004,260,2-Jan,,,,,237,251,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000030181.03575.e1,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,825MQ,WOS:000221763000021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Korb, JE; Johnson, NC; Covington, WW",,,,"Korb, JE; Johnson, NC; Covington, WW",,,Slash pile burning effects on soil biotic and chemical properties and plant establishment: Recommendations for amelioration,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; disturbance; ecological restoration; exotic species; plant succession; ponderosa pine; slash pile burning; soil amendments; soil seed bank,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; PONDEROSA PINE; SIMULATED FIRE; FOREST; RESTORATION; RECLAMATION; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; SURFACE,"Ponderosa pine forest restoration consists of thinning trees and reintroducing prescribed fire to reduce unnaturally high tree densities and fuel loads to restore ecosystem structure and function. A current issue in ponderosa pine restoration is what to do with the large quantity of slash that is created from thinning dense forest stands. Slash piling burning is currently the preferred method of slash removal because it allows land managers to burn large quantities of slash in a more controlled environment in comparison with broadcast burning slash. However burning slash piles is known to have adverse effects such as soil sterilization and exotic species establishment. This study investigated the effects of slash pile burning on soil biotic and chemical variables and early herbaceous succession on burned slash pile areas. Slash piles were created following tree thinning in two adjacent approximately 20-ha ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments in the Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona. We selected 30 burned slash pile areas and sampled across a gradient of the burned piles for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) propagule densities, the soil seed bank, and soil chemical properties. In addition, we established five 1-m(2) plots in each burned pile to quantify the effect of living soil (AM inoculum) and seeding amendments on early herbaceous succession in burned slash pile areas. The five treatments consisted of a control (no treatment), living soil (AM inoculum) amendment, sterilized soil (no AM inoculum) amendment, seed amendment, and a seed/soil (AM inoculum) amendment. Slash pile burning nearly eliminated populations of viable seeds and AM propagules and altered soil chemical properties. Amending scars with native seeds increased the cover of native forbs and grasses. Furthermore adding both seed and living soil more than doubled total native plant cover and decreased ruderal and exotic plant cover. These results indicate that seed/soil amendments that increase native forbs and grasses may enhance the rate of succession in burned slash pile areas by allowing these species to outcompete exotic and ruderal species also establishing at the site through natural regeneration.","No Arizona Univ, Coll Ecosyst Sci & Management, Ecol Restorat Inst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Korb, JE (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Coll Ecosyst Sci & Management, Ecol Restorat Inst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",korb_j@fortlewis.edu,,,,,,53,93,102,4,54,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Soil organic carbon content, aggregate stability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth were all less under ryegrass than kikuyu pasture. There was, however, no consistent effect of pasture-type on pore size distribution or penetrometer resistance. Differences in penetrometer resistance were most obvious in the 10-30 cm layer with subsurface compaction being evident at some sites under both types of pasture. This was attributed to the treading effects of grazing cattle plus formation of a compacted layer at the depth of tillage under ryegrass pastures. Subsoil tillage of a ryegrass pasture resulted in a substantial reduction in penetrometer resistance in the compacted 10-20 cm layer and increases in hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth. We conclude that conversion from conventional to zero tillage is a potential way of improving the sustainability of annual pasture production and that the extent of subsoil compaction under both pasture types needs further investigation.","Univ Natal, Sch Appl Environm Sci, Discipline Soil Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa","Haynes, RJ (reprint author), Univ Natal, Sch Appl Environm Sci, Discipline Soil Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa.",haynesd@nu.ac.za,,,,,,33,19,21,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-0032,1475-2743,,SOIL USE MANAGE,Soil Use Manage.,MAR,2004,20,1,,,,,81,88,,10.1079/SUM2003227,,,8,Soil Science,Agriculture,819FD,WOS:000221299100012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Staddon, PL",,,,"Staddon, PL",,,Carbon isotopes in functional soil ecology,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY FUNCTION; C-13 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; UPLAND GRASSLAND; ROOT RESPIRATION; STABLE ISOTOPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FATTY-ACIDS,"Soil is an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems.

Shumard oak seedlings with greater initial lateral root lengths and shoot heights sustained higher leaf gas exchange rates during both non-drought and drought periods. On the contrary, cherrybark oak seedlings had high leaf water potential (IF) and water use efficiency (WUE) and maintained low stomatal conductance (g(s)). This strategy generally allows for adequate gas exchange while minimizing water loss during drought. Initial lateral root:shoot ratio (LRSR) was negatively related to leaf gas exchange and water status, suggesting that excessive water loss of large seedlings with large root volume may negatively affect their drought hardiness. The responses of these floodplain oak species to drought was likely mediated by the absolute development of root systems at the time of planting and the balance between functioning root absorbing surface and transpirational leaf area. Responses of both species to drought in the subsequent growing seasons must be studied to determine their unique responses to water stress. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The responses of fine roots to natural gradients in resource availability, however, are poorly understood. We assessed fine root dynamics across a soil texture gradient in Pinus palustris Mill.-Aristida stricta Michx. savannas. These savannas are currently the subject of considerable conservation and restoration efforts in the southeastern US. Fine root dynamics were determined for two growing seasons in three soil types with minirhizotrons. The soils were characterized as: shallow, loamy soils; intermediate depth sandy soils; and deep, sandy soils. Although soil moisture was not quantified in this study, increasing drainage capacity and clear shifts to xerophytic vegetation strongly suggest increasing soil moisture limitation from shallow to deep soils. Potential net N mineralization, microbial biomass and annual overstory litterfall were also characterized across the gradient. Consistent with increasing soil moisture limitation, fine root production increased and diameters decreased from shallow to deep sands, as did the amount of deep root production. Litterfall also declined across this gradient. In contrast, fine root turnover rates were highest in the intermediate soils where nitrogen availability was highest. These results suggest that fine root turnover rate may vary independently of annual fine root production and these components may differentially respond to multiple limiting resources.

Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of negative feedback. To examine short-term changes, we planted successive cycles of seedlings in the same soil. We found that seedling mortality increased steadily with growth cycle when sterile background soil was inoculated with living field soil but not in controls inoculated with sterilized field soil. To examine long-term changes, we quantified negative feedback across successive growth cycles in soil inoculated with living field soil from a mature forest system (more than 70 years old) versus a younger successional site (ca. 25 years old). In both cases negative feedback developed similarly.

We characterized effects on soil carbon dynamics of species identity and rotation frequency in experimental plantations containing three native, non-N-fixing tree species, Hyeronima alchoreoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora, grown in monocultures and in polycultures with two monocot species, Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata. Over all treatments, change in total soil organic carbon (TSOC, 0-15 cm) after 10 years ranged from a loss of 24% (0.9 mg/ha in 1-yr rotation of Cedrela) to an increase of 14% (0.6 mg/ha under Hyeronima polycultures). Species differed in their effects on quantities of TSOC (P = 0.038), but differences were more pronounced in light particulate organic matter (LPOM; P = 0.001), a biologically active, sand-size soil fraction that constituted 6% of TSOC. Effects of rotation frequency were strong; in Cedrela and Cordia, the 4-yr rotations had higher soil C stocks than did long-term monocultures, where soil C stocks had declined under 10-yr-old trees. Under Cedrela and Cordia, polycultures had significantly higher stocks of soil C than monocultures, whereas soil C stocks were high under Hyeronima in both cultures. In polycultures, Hyeronima dominated detrital inputs, contributing 88% of litterfall and fine-root growth, whereas Cedrela and Cordia contributed <34%. Root C:N ratio and fine-root growth accounted for most of the variability in changes in soil C stocks after 10 years in long-term rotations (partial R-2 = 0.70 and 0.14, respectively). These data suggested that roots drove soil C accrual in long-term rotations, and that mechanisms involving root chemistry, and not quantity of detrital inputs, best explained effects of species on soil C sequestration.","USDA ARS, Natl Soil Tilth Lab, Ames, IA 50011 USA; USDA Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Islands Forestry, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA","Russell, AE (reprint author), USDA ARS, Natl Soil Tilth Lab, 2150 Pammel Dr, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",arussell@iastate.edu,"Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361",,,,73,53,60,2,31,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit, rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span (LLS) and minimum seasonal water potentials (psi(min)) were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to these two ""anchor traits"" supported this view. Short LLS was significantly associated with high specific leaf area, hi-h carbon assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to LLS. Low psi(min) (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area: sapwood area ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species, this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the LLS axis and the psi(min) axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional strategy space, approximately defined by LLS and psi(min), can be used to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs. avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to resource availability and disturbance.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Ackerly, D (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dackerly@stanford.edu,"Ackerly, David/A-1247-2009; Yang, Da/L-6267-2013","Ackerly, David/0000-0002-1847-7398; Yang, Da/0000-0001-7306-3289",,,,103,316,330,18,284,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",15-Dec,,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, the information on how co-occurring species in natural habitats differ in HL ability is insufficient. In a field study, we compared HL ability of four tree species (including three congeneric oak species) and two C4 bunch grass species that co-occur in subxeric habitats of fall-line sandhills in southeastern USA. Soil water potentials (psi(s)) were recorded hourly for 3 years both in large chambers that isolated roots for each species and outside the chambers. Outside of root chambers, soil drying occurred periodically in the top 25 cm and corresponded with lack of precipitation during the summer growing season. Soil moisture was continuously available at a 1 m depth. HL activity was observed in three of the tree species, with greater frequency for Pinus palustris than for Quercus laevis and Q. incana. The fourth tree species Q. margaretta did not exhibit HL activity even though it experienced a similar psi(s) gradient. For the C4 bunch grasses, Aristida stricta exhibited a small amount of HL activity, but Schizachyrium scoparium did not. The capacity for HL activity may be linked to the species ecological distribution. The four species that exhibited HL activity in this subxeric habitat are also dominant in adjacent xeric sandhill habitats, whereas the species that did not exhibit HL are scarcely found in the xeric areas. This is consistent with other studies that found greater fine root survival in dry soil for the four xeric species exhibiting HL activity. The differential ability of these species to redistribute water from the deep soil to the rapidly drying shallow soil likely has a strong effect on the water balance of sandhill plant communities, and is likely linked to their differential distribution across edaphic gradients.","Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Org Trop Studies, Selva Biol Stn, Puerto Viejo De Sarapiqu, Costa Rica; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Espeleta, JF (reprint author), Org Trop Studies Interlink 341, POB 02-5635, Miami, FL 33102 USA.",,"Donovan, Lisa/H-4754-2016; West, Jason B/G-8833-2012","Donovan, Lisa/0000-0001-9814-0666; West, Jason/0000-0002-7811-8020",,,,56,70,82,0,26,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2004,138,3,,,,,341,349,,10.1007/s00442-003-1460-8,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,766QM,WOS:000188387100003,14689298,,,,10/31/19J,"Midgley, DJ; Chambers, SM; Cairney, JWG",,,,"Midgley, DJ; Chambers, SM; Cairney, JWG",,,Distribution of ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes and root-associated fungi in neighbouring Ericaceae plants in the field,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ericaceae; ericoid mycorrhizal fungi; Epacridaceae; fungal diversity; mycorrhiza,MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; WOOLLSIA-PUNGENS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; GAULTHERIA SHALLON; CALLUNA-VULGARIS; RIBOSOMAL DNA; READ KORF; EPACRIDACEAE; POPULATION; BIOLOGY,"Three hundred and twenty-seven fungal endophyte isolates were obtained from hair roots of neighbouring Woollsia pungens Cav.

While two mycorrhizal RFLP- types were exclusive to either W. pungens or L. parviflorus, RFLP- type VI was isolated from both hosts. This putative taxon had strong ITS sequence identity with Helotiales ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes, comprised ca. 75% of all isolates from each plant and was spatially widespread in both root systems. Inter-simple sequence repeat PCR analysis indicated that two and four genotypes of RFLP- type VI were present in the W. pungens and L. parviflorus root systems respectively, however single genotypes appeared to dominate each root system.

A strong decrease in both relative and absolute concentration of these leaf-derived compounds was observed when comparing the litter layer with the mineral soil. The presence of C-22-C-32 n-alkanoic acids, C-22-C-26 omega-hydroxy acids, C-31 n-alkane and C-22-C-32 n-alkanols observed in the sub-soil is indicative of an important contribution by (grass) roots. In summer, a signal most likely reflecting the leaching of microbially derived products from the litter and/or aerial vegetation at the surface was observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The wick applicator consisted of a perforated plastic pipe covered with a sponge cylinder supplied by a reservoir. With both application methods, as the rate of uniconazole increased, seedling height, root-collar diameter, and biomass decreased. Compared to the controls, uniconazole decreased the percentage of seedlings with root-collar diameters greater than 4.7 mm. At lifting there was no difference among rates for root/shoot ratio, but root/shoot ratios of uniconazole treated seedlings increased significantly after outplanting. Eighteen months after outplanting, there were no treatment effects on seedling height or survival.

These attributes include the seasonal dynamics of fine root mass and length, the depth distribution of fine roots, fine root width and, most importantly, the annual appearance and disappearance of fine roots. The principal objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to compare these attributes of fine roots between plant communities and (2) to compare the results of the two methods used to quantify the attributes: (1) harvesting roots from forest soil with soil cores and (2) photographing roots growing against the windows of minirhizotron boxes. The plant communities that were sampled are characteristic of the region and are designated as follows from lowest elevation (782 m) to highest elevation (1347 m): (1) xeric ridge, (2) cove hardwoods, (3) low elevation mixed oak, (4) high elevation mixed oak, and (5) northern hardwoods. Fine root mass varies seasonally in this temperate region with lowest and highest mass in the spring and autumn, respectively. Fine root mass and fine root mass appearance were lowest in the cove hardwood community and highest in the low elevation mixed oak community. The total length of fine roots was highest in the xeric ridge community and lowest in the low elevation mixed oak community. The high total root length in the xeric, ridge community was due to the presence of an exceptionally dense mat of very fine roots found there. The width of these roots was significantly less than that of roots on all other plots. Subsequent regression illustrates two strong patterns in the data. First, fine root mass, fine root mass appearance and leaf production were positively correlated. Second, fine root length and soil moisture were negatively correlated. The accumulation of root mass in these communities was linked to overall site productivity and the development of root length in response to moisture stress. Only the timing of root growth initiation was related to elevation and the associated parameter of soil temperature. The best estimates of fine root appearance and disappearance were generated by harvesting roots rather than photographing them. Some methodological problems with root photography implemented in this study are addressed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Albizia procera, one among important species, is difficult to propagate commercially either by stem / root cuttings or layering. A study was undertaken to develop procedure for its in vitro regeneration through organogenesis. Explants collected from 15 +/- 2 yr-old mature plus trees and from 15 days old juvenile seedlings were regenerated with exogenous application of different hormones. Epicotyl and hypocotyl explants excised from juvenile seedlings showed higher callusing than axillary bud and shoot tip explants derived from mature trees. Benzylaminopurine (BA) at 3 mug/l was most effective, which induced hundred percent callusing in epicotyl and hypocotyl explants in 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Callus originated from axillary buds and apical shoot tips of mature trees failed to form organs, however callus derived from epicotyl and hypocotyl explants proliferated and formed de novo shoots and leaflets. A concentration of 3 mug/l of BA was found effective for shoot proliferation. Shoots grew vigorously in 2 mug/l gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatment and rooted in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Rooting was most successful on medium supplemented with 6 mug/l IBA alone on which 93.3% of the shoots formed roots. Sand or vermiculite supplemented with 4 ml of yoshida solution proved as best hardening media, which recorded 70-80% survival of plantlets. One year old tissue culture raised plants had comparatively more height, collar diameter, biomass, and root shoot ratio than plants raised from cuttings and seeds of the same age. The procedures enumerated provide a basis for the development of in vitro techniques for rapid multiplication of A. procera.","IG Agr Univ, Dept Forestry, Raipur 492006, Madhya Pradesh, India; IG Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Raipur 492006, Madhya Pradesh, India","Swamy, SL (reprint author), IG Agr Univ, Dept Forestry, Raipur 492006, Madhya Pradesh, India.",swamy_101@yahoo.com,,,,,,23,5,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Hook.) and Tsoong's tree (Tsoongiodendron odorum Chun) in Sanming, Fujian, China. In a 540 d period of decay, fine roots in all litter bags decomposed in a three-phase manner: (a) for the Chinese fir, an initial, relatively low rate of decay up to 90 d followed by a period of rapid weight loss until 270 d, and then by a phase of slow decay rate; (b) for the Tsoong's tree, a rapid loss period between 0-60 d followed by a relatively rapid loss period between 60-360 d, and then a slow loss period between 360540 d occurred. The mass loss after 1 yr of decomposition ranged from 58.5% to 63.3% for the Chinese fir and 68.8% to 78.2% for the Tsoong's tree. Fine roots with a larger diameter had a lower rate of mass loss. Consistent increase in lignin concentration and decrease in absolute amount of phosphorus (P) were found for fine roots of the two tree species during decomposition. The absolute amounts of nitrogen (N) increased a little initially in the fine roots of the Chinese fir during a short duration. In contrast, the fine roots of Tsoong's tree were releasing N from the outset. The chemical composition controlled decomposition rate and it was found a change of TNC (total nonstructural carbohydrates)-regulating in the initial decomposition phase to lignin- or N-regulating in the second phase, and P- or lignin-regulating in the last phase.","Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; Fujian Agr & Forestry, Coll Forestry, Nanping 353001, Peoples R China; Xiamen Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China","Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",ffcyys@public.npptt.fj.cn,"Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013",,,,,37,33,50,0,18,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Recently, we have seen a growing appreciation of how multispecies interactions can act synergistically or antagonistically to alter the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of interactions in ways that differ fundamentally from outcomes predicted by pairwise interactions. Here, we review the evidence for criteria identified to detect community-based, diffuse coevolution. These criteria include (a) the presence of genetic correlations between traits involved in multiple interactions, (b) interactions with one species that alter the likelihood or intensity of interactions with other species, and (c) nonadditive combined effects of multiple interactors. In addition, we review the evidence that multispecies interactions have demographic consequences for populations, as well as evolutionary consequences. Finally, we explore the experimental and analytical techniques, and their limitations, used in the study of multispecies interactions. Throughout, we discuss areas in particular need of future research.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Strauss, SY (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",systrauss@ucdavis.edu; rirwin@uga.edu,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012; Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085; ",,,,161,345,354,3,230,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Because forest management activities can reduce ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus diversity and forest regeneration success, management approaches are needed to sustain these essential forests organisms. We present selected results from experiments that test biodiversity assumptions behind current guidelines for ecosystem management. We examine contrasts in structural retention as they affect biodiversity and sporocarp production of EM fungi-a functional guild of organisms well suited as indicators of disturbance effects on below-ground ecosystems. Overstory removal significantly reduced EMF sporocarp production but, in contrast to the initial hypothesis, the effects were not always proportional to basal area retained. The effect of spatial pattern of retention varied between retention levels and mushroom and truffle sporocarp groups. Management implications include the need to address the conservation of rare truffle and mushroom species in a manner that recognizes their different responses to forest disturbance. We also raise the hypothesis that fire suppression may favor mushroom production over truffle production. Because fire seems to be important in the reproductive evolution of EMF, our results also add further impetus to the development of management plans that seek to restore forest health from the effects of decades of fire suppression. Experimental results suggest using dispersed green-tree retention in combination with aggregated retention to maintain sporocarp production. Such a mix ameliorates disturbance effects and may maintain higher levels of sporocarp production in the aggregates by reducing edge effects. It remains unclear how short-term reductions in sporocarp abundance will affect EM fungus populations for future forests. After disturbance, spores are a form of legacy and key to enabling adaptations by other species in the face of environmental change. Long-term silvicultural experiments are essential for monitoring trends in the EM fungus community.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Luoma, DL (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,67,0,0,0,5,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV PACIFIC NW RESEARCH STN",PORTLAND,"319 SW PINE ST, PO BOX 3890, PORTLAND, OR 97208 USA",0363-6224,,,US FOR SERV T R PNW,,,2004,635,,,,,,257,264,,,,,8,Ecology; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BCQ20,WOS:000230655100034,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zaller, JG; Searles, PS; Caldwell, MM; Flint, SD; Scopel, AL; Sala, OE",,,,"Zaller, JG; Searles, PS; Caldwell, MM; Flint, SD; Scopel, AL; Sala, OE",,,Growth responses to ultraviolet-B radiation of two Carex species dominating an Argentinian fen ecosystem,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass allocation; biomass production; global climate change; morphological responses; ozone depletion; sedges; specific leaf area; specific root length; ultraviolet radiation,TIERRA-DEL-FUEGO; UV-B; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SOUTHERN ARGENTINA; NATURAL ECOSYSTEM; PLANT COMPETITION; OZONE DEPLETION; DNA-DAMAGE; FIELD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm) in the Southern Hemisphere has been increasing over the last few decades due to seasonal stratospheric ozone depletion associated with the 'ozone hole' and a more general erosion of the stratospheric ozone layer. We studied the effect of UV-B radiation on growth responses of Carex curta and C. decidua, the two most dominant sedges in a fen ecosystem in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) in field plots and growth chambers where U-V-B radiation was manipulated using different transparent plastic films that either transmitted or attenuated UV-B radiation. In the field, leaf and spike elongation of both species was unaffected by UV-B treatments in all four seasons studied (1997/98 through 2000/2001). Specific leaf areas (SLA) were only measured in the last two seasons and remained unaffected by UV-B for both species in the third field season. However, SLA decreased for C. curta in the fourth season but increased for C. decidua under near-ambient UV-B. Ecosystem specific root length was unaffected by UV-B. Although UV-B did not have a statistically significant effect on biomass production, there was a trend for a 15% higher production under near-ambient UV-B in the fourth year (P = 0.064). In the growth chambers, simulated ambient UV-B approximately equivalent to ambient UV-B in Tierra del Fuego stimulated seedling emergence of C. curta but reduced emergence of C. decidua; leaf elongation remained unaffected in both species. While plant morphology of C. curta remained unaffected by UV-B radiation, C. decid-ua had fewer tillers per plant, however tillers had more leaves and biomass under simulated ambient UV-B than under reduced UV-B radiation. The SLA of C. curta was unaffected by UV-B treatments; however, it was significantly lower for C. decidua under simulated ambient UV-B. Root morphology remained unaffected by UV-B for C. curta but roots of C. decidua were significantly thicker under simulated ambient UV-B. Taken collectively, our findings demonstrate that even moderate changes in UV-B radiation (e.g., corresponding to those expected with current stratospheric ozone depletion) may influence growth, morphology and biomass allocation in a species-specific manner for these native sedges in growth chambers and might also affect competitive relationships of these species in the field.","Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CRILAR, Anillaco, La Rioja, Argentina; Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IFEVA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Zaller, JG (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Inst Organ Agr, Katzernburgweg 3, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",jzaller@uni-bonn.de,"Zaller, Johann G/A-9914-2009","Zaller, Johann G/0000-0001-7744-7378; Searles, Peter/0000-0002-2867-5881; Sala, Osvaldo/0000-0003-0142-9450",,,,43,11,12,0,13,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",1439-1791,,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

However, much of the uncertainty in these estimates of carbon stocks is attributable to uncertainty in the B-ef and R parameters, as they are not measured in standard forestry practice and are rarely measured on a large scale in research work. Here, we present measurements which represent the largest available data set on which estimates of B-ef and R can be based for coniferous species in Great Britain. B-ef varied between 1.04 and 2.32, with a mean of 1.43 +/- 0.008, whilst R varied from 0.12 to 1.21, with a mean of 0.36 +/- 0.008. Tree height accounted for 45 per cent of the variance in B-ef in a logarithmic regression. Differences between species accounted for 27 per cent of the remaining variance. Equations to estimate the value of B-ef for a given species and tree height are provided. No continuous variable accounted for >5 per cent of the variance in R. Differences between sites accounted for 25 per cent of the variance in R, and the effects of species, soil type and cultivation method were of lesser significance. Values of R used in some recent UK studies are lower than our values. If our results are representative, more carbon is present in UK conifer forests than is estimated in these studies, and the R terms should be increased by up to 0.2.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; Forestry Res, No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland","Levy, PE (reprint author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland.",plevy@ceh.ac.uk,"Levy, Peter/K-6523-2012; Nicoll, Bruce/D-4858-2011","Levy, Peter/0000-0002-8505-1901; Nicoll, Bruce/0000-0002-5891-0555",,,,22,71,88,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,,,FORESTRY,Forestry,,2004,77,5,,,,,421,430,,10.1093/forestry/77.5.421,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,878IX,WOS:000225641600005,,Bronze,,,10/31/19B,"Amaranthus, M; Steinfeld, D",,,USDA,"Amaranthus, Michael; Steinfeld, David",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation following biocide treatment improves Calocedrus decurrens survival and growth in nursery and outplanting sites,National Proceedings: Forest and Conservation Nursery Associations 2004,USDA FOREST SERVICE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RESEARCH STATION PROCEEDINGS,,English,Proceedings Paper,Joint Meeting of the Southern-Forest-Nursery-Association/Northeastern-Forest-and-Conservation-Nursery-Association,"JUL 12-15, 2004","Charleston, SC","So Forest Nursery Assoc, NE Forest & Conservat Nursery Assoc",,bareroot seedlings; nursery culture; outplanting performance,FOREST-FIRE; SEEDLINGS; FUNGI; REESTABLISHMENT; VIABILITY; WILDFIRE,"Commercial production of tree seedlings often includes various biocidal soil treatments for disease control.

The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) relationship has been verified for some important western coniferous species such as incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens [Torr.] Florin), coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D.

This study was designed to determine the response of incense cedar after soil fumigation with and without the addition of phosphorous fertilizer and a commercial mycorrhizal inoculant containing Glomus intraradices. Incense cedar seedling performance was monitored in both the nursery and outplanting environments. At the nursery, non-mycorrhizal seedlings had significantly less foliar phosphorous levels even when phosphorous fertilizers were applied. Mycorrhizal inoculation at the nursery significantly improved height and seedling survival on treated plots. Seedlings from the nursery beds were then outplanted on 2 reforestation sites.

Chinese Brake fern exuded 2 times more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than Boston fern and the difference was more pronounced under As stress. The composition of organic acids in the root exudates for both ferns consisted mainly of phytic acid and oxalic acid. However, Chinese Brake fern produced 0.46 to 1.06 times more phytic acid than Boston fern under As stress, and exuded 3 - 5 times more oxalic acid than Boston fern in all treatments. Consequently, root exudates from Chinese Brake fern mobilized more As from aluminum arsenate ( 3 - 4 times), iron arsenate ( 4 - 6 times) and CCA-contaminated soil ( 6 - 18 times) than Boston fern. Chinese Brake fern took up more As and translocated more As to the fronds than Boston fern. The molar ratio of P/As in the roots of Chinese Brake fern was greater than in the fronds whereas the reverse was observed in Boston fern. These results suggested that As- mobilization from the soil by the root exudates ( enhancing plant uptake), coupled with efficient As translocation to the fronds ( keeping a high molar ratio of P/As in the roots), are both important for As hyperaccumulation by Chinese Brake fern.","Univ Florida, Dept Soil & Water Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Tu, SX (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Soil & Water Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",stu@mail.ifas.ufl.edu,"Q, Lena/E-5854-2010","Q, Lena/0000-0002-8463-9957",,,,51,101,118,4,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2004,258,2-Jan,,,,,9,19,,10.1023/B:PLSO.0000016499.95722.16,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,774XT,WOS:000189012200003,,,,,10/31/19B,"Tang, M; Chen, H; Hu, JJ; Li, ZB",,"Feng, CG; Huang, P; Ma, Y; Su, Q; Wang, YJ; Li, SC",,"Tang, M; Chen, H; Hu, JJ; Li, ZB",,,Diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improving plant drought-resistance,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE CHINA ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 1, NO 1",,,English,Proceedings Paper,5th Annual Conference for Young Scientists of China-Association-for-Science-and-Technology,"NOV 02-05, 2004","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",China Assoc Sci & Technol,,AMF; drought-resistance; RAPD,,"This paper analyzes the heredity of eight AMF species with RAPD technology employed and physiological index of drought-resistance of the host plants when the eight AMF species were inoculated back to the host plants again.

Excavation of these nodulated Rosaceous plants in the field requires care and attention to detail. Strategies for excavation should involve allowing sufficient time and input of energy into the excavation process, and excavation of mature plants may take even weeks to accomplish. Field observations and subsequent greenhouse studies strongly suggest that the agents responsible for nodulation of these plants (member of the actinomycete genus Frankia) is either not present or is inactive in surface soils. The paradox of stressing plants via sampling and the expectation that collected data represents normal response is discussed.","Univ Wyoming, Coll Agr, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Williams, SE (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Coll Agr, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",,,,,,,23,2,2,0,0,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPTL STN",FT COLLINS,"FT COLLINS, CO 80526 USA",,,,US FOR SERV RMRS-P,,,2004,31,,,,,,84,91,,,,,8,Agronomy; Ecology; Soil Science,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BAJ24,WOS:000222498800017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cheng, XM; Bledsoe, CS",,,,"Cheng, XM; Bledsoe, CS",,,"Competition for inorganic and organic N by blue oak (Quercus douglasii) seedlings, an annual grass, and soil microorganisms in a pot study",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,N-15; Avena barbata; blue oak; nitrogen competition; soil microorganisms,CALIFORNIA ANNUAL GRASSLAND; AMINO-ACIDS; MICROBIAL IMMOBILIZATION; N-15 ANALYSIS; NITROGEN; PLANTS; MINERALIZATION; WOODLAND; NITRATE; FOREST,"Sources of competition for limited soil resources, such as nitrogen (N), include competitive interactions among different plant species and between plants and soil microorganisms (microbes). To study these competitive interactions, blue oak seedlings (Quercus douglasii) were grown alone or grown together with an annual grass, wild oats (Avena barbata) in pots containing field soil. We injected N-15-labeled ammonium, nitrate or glycine into the soil of each pot and harvested plants 5 days later. Plant shoots and roots, soil microbial N and soil KCl-extractable N were analyzed for N-15 content. When oak and grass were grown together, N-15 recovery from the inorganic N treatments (NH4+ or NO3-) was 34, 9 and 4% for the grass, microbes and oak seedlings, respectively, and only 1% remained as KCl-extractable N. N-15 recovery from the glycine treatment was 18, 22, 5% for the grass, microbes and oak seedlings, respectively, and 4% remained as KCl-extractable N. When oaks were grown alone, N-15 recovery by soil microbes was 21, 48 and 40% in the NO3-, NH4+ and glycine treatments, respectively. N forms had no effects on N-15 recovery in oak seedlings (7%) and in KCl-extractable N pool (13%). In general, total N recovery by the grass was much greater than by oaks. However, on a fine root surface area or length basis, oaks exhibited higher N uptake than the grass. Our results suggest that the high rooting density and rapid growth rate of the annual grasses such as A vena barbata made them superior competitors for available soil N when compared to blue oak seedlings and to microbes. Soil microbes were better competitors for organic than inorganic N when annual grasses were present, but preferred NH4+ when competing only with oak seedlings. 4 (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Two-year-old beech seedlings were grown during two growing seasons in 160-1 containers in bare soil or with a mixture of five grass species widely represented in semi-natural meadows of central France. At the end of the second growing season, beech seedlings in the presence of grass showed significant reductions in diameter and height growth, annual shoot elongation, and stem, root and leaf biomass, but an increase in root to shoot biomass ratio. Grasses greatly reduced soil water availability, which was positively correlated with daily seedling diameter increment. Beech seedlings seemed to respond to water deficit by anticipating stomatal closure. There was evidence of competition for nitrogen (N) by grasses, but its effect on seedling development could not be separated from that of competition for water. By labeling the plants with N-15, we showed that beech seedlings absorbed little N when grasses were present, whereas grasses took up more than 97% of the total N absorbed in the container. We conclude that, even if beech seedlings display morphological and physiological adaptation to belowground competition, their development in full-light conditions may be strongly restricted by competition from grass species.","CEMAGREF UR DFCF, Appl Ecol Woodlands Res Team, F-63172 Aubiere, France; INRA, UR Agron, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France","Coll, L (reprint author), CEMAGREF UR DFCF, Appl Ecol Woodlands Res Team, 24 Av Landais,BP 50085, F-63172 Aubiere, France.",,", Picon-Cochard/J-3954-2013; Coll, Lluis/E-8724-2015",", Picon-Cochard/0000-0001-7728-8936; Coll, Lluis/0000-0002-8035-5949",,,,72,53,55,1,22,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2004,24,1,,,,,45,54,,10.1093/treephys/24.1.45,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,759VJ,WOS:000187757300004,14652213,Bronze,,,10/31/19S,"Feddes, RA; Roats, PAC",,"Feddes, RA; DeRooij, GH; VanDam, JC",,"Feddes, R.

Locally, water uptake can be considered at two different Darcian scales, referred to as the mesoscopic and the macroscopic scales. At the local mesoscopic scale, root water uptake is represented by a flux across the soil-root interface, resulting from the mesoscopic Richards equation describing the flow of water from soil to plant root, supplemented by appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The mesoscopic model involves two characteristic lengths describing the root-soil geometry, and two characteristic times describing, respectively, the capillary flow of water from soil to plant roots and the ratio of supply of water in the soil and demand by plant roots. Generally, at a certain critical time, uptake will switch from plant-atmosphere demand-driven to soil supply-dependent. The resulting expressions for the evolution of the average water content can be used as a basis for upscaling from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic scale. At the local macroscopic scale, the root water uptake is represented by a sink term in the macroscopic Richards equation. Reduction of water uptake due to water and salinity stresses is incorporated by either linear or non-linear response functions. The root water uptake is strongly related to root length density, but it is easier to obtain root mass density, and therefore a conversion relationship has been established between the bulk root mass and root length densities, both in space and in time. The local macroscopic model can be incorporated in Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC) numerical models, like the SWAP, HYSWASOR, HYDRUS, ENVIRO-GRO and FUSSIM models. These SPAC models in turn can be used for upscaling, first to the field scale and from there to the regional and global scales. As Global Climate Models (GCMs) show a strong sensitivity to continental evaporation, closer root water-uptake modeling might improve soil vegetation control instead of uncontrolled continental evaporation. It is concluded that the relationships between mesoscopic and macroscopic descriptions of water uptake provide a useful framework for interpreting laboratory and field data and formulating macroscopic sink terms. One-dimensional analysis of the root-zone water balance is now well developed and has strong computational capabilities. Joint stresses can be computed easily by multiplication of water stress with salinity stress. The implementation at the macroscopic scale of the mesoscopic description of simultaneous uptake of water and solutes is promising. Present Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) schemes should be improved with respect to root water-uptake descriptions, using existing global data sets of root and soil properties. A first priority is to establish firmly the relationships of root biomass, rooting depth, root distribution and root functions with land-use type, soil type, soil texture, topography and climate.","Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sub Dept Water Resources Soil Phys, Agrohydrol & Groundwater Management Grp, NL-6709 PA Wageningen, Netherlands","Feddes, RA (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sub Dept Water Resources Soil Phys, Agrohydrol & Groundwater Management Grp, Nieuwe Kanaal 11, NL-6709 PA Wageningen, Netherlands.",reinder.feddes@wur.nl; pac.raats@home.nl,,,,,,133,92,93,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1573-4544,,1-4020-2918-7; 1-4020-2917-9,WAG UR FRON,Wagening.

The pattern of relationships revealed by stepwise regression models was different for each month, and the models compiled on the overall dataset were generally weaker than those compiled for separate months. Functional relationships among different microarthropods revealed by stepwise regression modelling are summarised in a structural model of their statistical associations. Interpretation of specific relationships revealed is given and implications for dynamic simulation models are discussed. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that both microbial feeding nematodes (MF) and plant feeding nematodes (PF) appear to prefer a high level of bacteria and moisture, glomalin and organic matter in the soil. Close scrutiny, however, reveals that microbial feeding nematodes have a particularly high affinity to the sites with a high level of bacteria and organic matter, whilst plant feeding nematodes appear to be more associated with moisture and glomalin. Folsomia candida was abundant in sites with a higher pH level (pH ranged between 3.1 and 4.9), but was not abundant in sites with high ergosterol or a high bacteria, moisture, glomalin and organic matter level. However, other Collembola (mainly represented by Folsomia quadrioculata) appeared to be associated with high levels of ectomycorrhizal fungi. As F candida is known to feed on fungal food sources, the results suggest that the relatively high local abundances of this collembolan might have caused local declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi, reflected, in turn, in the increase in pH. In addition, environmental plasticity of this species might have allowed them to expand into areas with low fungal density by utilising alternative food sources. The fact that E candida was a dominant microarthropod in the majority of the samples collected in this research also supports this point. However, for those samples where E candida were less abundant, overcompensatory fungal growth due to grazing by mites and other Collembola was implicated. Overall, our results suggest that both direct negative and indirect positive effects of the microarthropod community on specific fungal groups appear to take place. The differential effect of specific mesofaunal groups on other soil biota justifies their detailed representation in dynamic simulation models of soil ecosystems.

A positive relationship between height increment and initial ratio between root and shoot was found. Unpruned 2 + 2 seedlings maintained their initial advantage in terms of height, whereas the difference between 2 + 1 seedlings and 3 + 0 seedlings was small two years after transplanting.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark; Danish Forest & Landscape Res Inst, Dept Forestry, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark","Andersen, L (reprint author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Hort, Kirstinebjergvej 10,PO 102, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark.",lillie.Andersen@agrsci.dk,"Bentsen, Niclas Scott/E-4766-2010","Bentsen, Niclas Scott/0000-0002-5130-0818",,,,19,9,10,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

The selected exotic species were very successful under afforestation programs on wastelands. Plant species showed a considerable variations in growth characteristics with response to their ages on coal mine spoils. The shoot height was found to be maximum in Eucalyptus hybrid and minimum for Cassia siamea during whole course of study. The circumference of plants varied significantly due to plant species as well as age. Shoot biomass increased by 2.5-3 times in 7 years old plantations of different plant species as compared to those of 4 years. Marked increments were also observed in the major root and fine root biomass with increasing age of plantations. Total biomass accumulation was recorded maximum in E. hybrid and minimum in C. siamea. The NPP also followed a similar trend as total biomass. The maximum contribution was made by stem with branch in comparison to other components in NPP among different plant species. Shoot production including branches was found to be maximum in E. hybrid and minimum in C. siamea, whereas the NPP of major roots did not show a similar trend as that of shoot. On the basis of biomass and primary productivity, E. hybrid and Acacia auriculiformis were found suitable for plantation on coal mine spoil land. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

But there are few experimental studies comparing the parallel impact of enemies (or competitors and mutualists) on a plant species in its native and invaded ranges, and release from soil pathogens has been rarely investigated. Here we present evidence showing that the invasion of black cherry (Prunus serotina) into north-western Europe is facilitated by the soil community. In the native range in the USA, the soil community that develops near black cherry inhibits the establishment of neighbouring conspecifics and reduces seedling performance in the greenhouse. In contrast, in the non-native range, black cherry readily establishes in close proximity to conspecifics, and the soil community enhances the growth of its seedlings. Understanding the effects of soil organisms on plant abundance will improve our ability to predict and counteract plant invasions.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Susquehanna Univ, Dept Biol, Selinsgrove, PA 17870 USA","Reinhart, KO (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"Reinhart, Kurt/A-6730-2010; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Reinhart, Kurt/0000-0002-7985-6738",,,,22,234,247,4,164,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

In the field, parasitism of Chromatomyia syngenesiae by Diglyphus isaea was lower on mycorrhizal plants, compared with plants where the association was reduced. A laboratory experiment, in which L. vulgare was inoculated with three species of AM fungi, showed that the effects on parasitism rates were mycorrhizal species-dependent. Some fungal combinations increased parasitism, some decreased it, while others had no effect. It is concluded that the most likely cause of these differences is plant size, with parasitoid searching efficiency being reduced on the larger plants, resulting from certain mycorrhizal species combinations.

Pools of total C in bulk soil and in water-stable aggregates (WSA) increased 1.5- and threefold, respectively, between the 250- and 650-ppm treatments. in addition, the abundance of live AM hyphae and spores rose markedly over the same range of CO2, and the community composition shifted toward dominance by the AM genera Scutellospora and Acaulospora. Net ecosystem exchange of C with the atmosphere declined with CO2 treatment. It appears that under CO2 enrichment, extra C was added to the soil via AM fungi. Moreover, AM fungi were predominant in WSA and may shunt C into these aggregates versus bulk soil. Alternatively, C may be retained longer within WSA than within bulk soil. We note that differences between the soil fractions may act as a potential feedback on C cycling between the soil and atmosphere.","Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; San Diego State Univ, Global Change Res Grp, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Treseder, KK (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Oechel, Walter C/F-9361-2010; Treseder, Kathleen/E-5148-2011; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019","Oechel, Walter C/0000-0002-3504-026X; Treseder, Kathleen/0000-0003-2847-6935; ",,,,52,45,51,2,56,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,DEC,2003,6,8,,,,,786,796,,10.1007/s10021-003-0182-4,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,754GV,WOS:000187308500007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Atkinson, D; Black, KE; Forbes, PJ; Hooker, JE; Baddeley, JA; Watson, CA",,,,"Atkinson, D; Black, KE; Forbes, PJ; Hooker, JE; Baddeley, JA; Watson, CA",,,The influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and environment on root development in soil,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FUNGI INDUCED ALTERATION; LONGEVITY; TURNOVER; DYNAMICS; TEMPERATURE; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; CARBON,"The production of fine roots is one of the principal means by which carbon, fixed during photosynthesis, enters the soil, and quantifying the production for particular combinations of environmental and biotic factors is important for predicting the sequestration of carbon in the soils of grassland ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can have a major effect on the production of roots, and we studied how colonization by AMF affects the lifespan of roots. Twenty per cent of control roots of Trifolium repens survived for longer than 42 days whereas 37% survived that long in AMF-colonized plants. The overall survival of the roots of Lolium perenne was less than in T. repens: around 10% of roots survived beyond 42 days and this was not affected by AMF colonization. Previous studies have shown that lifespans of roots can be affected by temperature. We tested the hypothesis that these observations are linked to a change in the morphology of the root system caused by temperature and also by AMF. We found that inoculation with AMF in a microcosm study using Plantago lanceolata grown at various temperatures, with and without AMF, showed no clear effect of AMF on branching patterns. Temperature had a significant effect on total lengths, numbers and branching rates of some higher orders of roots. Total lengths of both secondary and tertiary roots grown at 27degreesC were about double those of plants grown at 15degreesC. Colonization by AMF tended to reduce this effect. Evidently the effect of colonization by AMF on root lifespan depends on the species. Increased branching, and thus a greater proportion of ephemeral roots, was responsible for shortening the lives of the roots at increased temperature, which suggests a strong link between lifespan and morphology.","SAC, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; SAC, Environm Div, Aberdeen AB21 9YA, Scotland","Atkinson, D (reprint author), SAC, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",d.atkinson@ed.sac.ac.uk,"Hooker, John/A-9561-2011; Watson, Christine A/I-2135-2012","Watson, Christine A/0000-0002-3758-9483; Forbes, Paula/0000-0003-1737-9929",,,,31,23,34,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,1365-2389,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

Plantago lanceolata, which can grow in soils of a very wide pH range, was grown in two closely related limestone soils and an acid soil from rock habitats. Plants were colonised by the indigenous AM fungal community. The use of compartmented systems allowed LIS to compare soil with and without mycorrhizal hyphae. Root colonisation of P. lanceolata was markedly higher in the limestone soils (30-60%) than in the acid soil (5 -20%), both in the original habitat and in the experimental study. Growth of extraradical AM fungal hyphae was detected in the limestone soils, but not in the acid soil, using the signature fatty acid 16: 1 omega5 as biomass indicator. Analysis of signature fatty acids demonstrated an increased microbial biomass in the presence of AM fungal hyphae as judged for example from ail increased amount of NLFA 16:0 with 30 nmol g(-1) in one of the limestone soils. Bacterial activity, but not soil phosphatase activity, was increased by around 25% in the presence of mycorrhizal hyphae in the first harvest of limestone soils. AM fungal hyphae can thus stimulate microorganisms. However, no effect of AM hyphae was observed on the soil pH or organic matter content in the limestone soils and the available P was not depleted.

Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 that carries uptake hydrogenase (Hup(+)) was used as an inoculum. The relative efficiency of nitrogen fixation generally increased by the inoculation. However, there were no significant differences in the effects among the genotypes of the host plants. The occupation ratio of serogroup USDA110 in the nodules on the taproot of the inoculated plants was in the range of 77-100%, suggesting that the B. japonicum strain USDA110 infected taproots immediately after inoculation. The occupation ratios in the nodules on the lateral roots were 53-67, 4086, 63-83, and 62-77% in inoculated plants of the non-Rj-, Rj(2)Rj(3)-, Rj(4)-, and Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotypes, respectively, and they decreased in all the genotypes with the progression of growth. At the time of the first sampling, the occupation ratios on the lateral roots of these Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotypes showed values intermediate between those of IAC-2 (Rj(2)Rj(3)) and Hill (Rj(4)), which were the parent cultivars of the Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-lines, B340, B349, and C242. The reduction in the occupation ratio of the serogroup USDA110 for about I month after the first sampling was the lowest (0.13-0.16) in the Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotypes, excluding B349, followed by the non-Rj- and Rj(2)Rj(3)-genotypes and highest (0.52-0.69) in the Rj(4)-genotypes, excluding Hill. Therefore, it was considered that the population of compatible rhizobia with host soybean plants increased in the rhizosphere with the progression of the development and growth. The results showed that with the expansion of the root area of host plants, the occupation ratio of type A rhizobia including the serogroup USDA110 was high. Therefore, the Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotypes were superior to other Rj-genotypes in terms of the inoculation effects of nodulation type A rhizobium, B. japonicum USDA110. However, the preference of the Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotype for serogroup USDA110 is not sufficient to rule out the competition with the other serogroups in this study. Therefore, the study should be centered on the isolation of more efficient (Hup(+)) and highly compatible rhizobial strains with the Rj(2)Rj(3)Rj(4)-genotypes.","Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch, Lab Plant Nutr, Div Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Yamakawa, T (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch, Lab Plant Nutr, Div Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",,,,,,,20,11,12,0,2,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

As a result of the resprouting capacity of holm oaks (Quercus ilex L.), these forests present more than 50% of their biomass below ground (stump + roots > 1 cm in diameter), but the effects of thinning on the fine root system are unknown. Fine root biomass, production, mortality and longevity were studied in a control and a thinned Mediterranean holm oak forest by minirhizotron methodology. Observations of fine roots started 2 years after thinning and continued for almost 3 years. Extraction of 80% of the former basal area of the forest greatly affected carbon allocation patterns. Biomass increased by more than 100%, production increased by 76%, mortality increased by 32% and longevity decreased by around 2 weeks.

Root length density, root abundance, and root longevity were generally greater in the persistently flooded site throughout the 439-day study period, although root length production was similar between the two sites. These results suggest that prolonged inundation in Atlantic white-cedar swamps decreases root elongation rates, but due to greater observed root densities, stand-level belowground production remains similar to that of intermittently flooded stands.

Such relationships, however, are thought to be rare in wetland plant roots, although several recent studies suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizae may be important in wetland ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine (1) the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots in three freshwater marshes and (2) the effect of restoration status, hydrologic zone, and plant species identity on mycorrhizal colonization. We quantified the percentage of plant roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi in one reference and two restored freshwater marshes in northern Indiana, USA during summer 1999. Roots were collected from soil cores taken around dominant plant species present in each of three hydrologic zones and then stained for microscopic examination of mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizae were present in each wetland, in all hydrologic zones and in all sampled plants, including Carex and Scirpus species previously thought to be non-mycorrhizal. Both restored and reference wetlands had moderate levels of mycorrhizal colonization, but no clear trends in colonization were seen with hydrologic zone, which has been hypothesized to regulate the formation of mycorrhizae in wetlands. Mycorrhizal colonization levels in the roots of individual species ranged from 3 to 90% and were particularly large in members of the Poaceae (grass) family. Our results suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizae may be widely distributed across plant species and hydrologic zones in both restored and reference freshwater marshes. Thus, future research should examine the functional role of mycorrhizal fungi in freshwater wetlands.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Bauer, CR (reprint author), US EPA, Region 5,WQ-16J,77 W Jackson St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",bauer.candicer@epa.gov,"Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017","Bridgham, Scott/0000-0003-0614-2678",,,,49,32,36,2,36,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,DEC,2003,23,4,,,,,961,968,,10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0961:MCAHGI]2.0.CO;2,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,766BU,WOS:000188326200024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lee, KH; Jose, S",,,,"Lee, KH; Jose, S",,,"Soil respiration, fine root production, and microbial biomass in cottonwood and loblolly pine plantations along a nitrogen fertilization gradient",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,belowground carbon allocation; carbon cycle; ingrowth core; nitrogen cycle; Populus deltoides Marsh.; Pinus taeda L.; reforestation,EXTRACTION METHOD; CARBON DYNAMICS; SPRUCE STAND; DOUGLAS-FIR; PICEA-ABIES; SODA-LIME; FOREST; WATER; GROWTH; TRANSFORMATIONS,"It is well known that carbon storage capacity of forests will change in response to management practices such as fertilization. However, the influence of fertilization on belowground processes such as soil respiration, fine root production, and microbial biomass is still unclear. We measured soil respiration, fine root biomass production, and microbial biomass along a fertilization gradient (0, 56, 112, and 224 kg N ha(-1) per year) in 7-year-old cottonwood and loblolly pine plantations, established on a well-drained, Redbay sandy loam (a fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Rhodic Paleudlt), in northwest Florida. Soil respiration was measured monthly from June 2001 to May 2002 using the soda-lime technique. Fine root biomass production was quantified using the ingrowth core method during the same period. In addition, microbial biomass, soil temperature, moisture, soil pH, and organic matter were also measured along the same gradient for both species. Annual soil respiration rate was significantly greater (781 g C m(-2) per year) in cottonwood than that (692 g C m(-2) per year) in loblolly pine. Nitrogen fertilization had a significant negative effect on soil respiration in cottonwood, but no effect was observed in loblolly pine stands. Mean daily soil respiration rates exhibited significant exponential relationships with soil temperature both in cottonwood (R-2 = 0.81) and loblolly pine (R-2 = 0.51). Annual soil respiration rates in cottonwood stands were positively correlated with fine root production (r = 0.64) and soil microbial biomass C (r = 0.87) and negatively correlated with soil pH (r = -0.81). Annual soil respiration in loblolly pine stands was correlated positively with fine root production (r = 0.54) and with organic matter content (r = 0.74). Annual fine root production was significantly greater in cottonwood (221 g m(-2) per year) than that in loblolly pine (144 g m(-2) per year). Fertilization did not affect fine root production in both species. Microbial biomass, however, was significantly reduced by nitrogen fertilization in both species. We also observed an optimum range of soil pH (6.0 +/- 0.4), where highest microbial activity could be expected. Multiple regression analysis indicated that microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil pH were the major factors affecting soil respiration in cottonwood, while fine root production and soil organic matter were the major factors affecting soil respiration in loblolly pine. These results suggest that belowground responses to fertilization can vary widely between conifers and hardwoods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results for Zygia cataractae were inconclusive but suggested N-2 fixation in drier microsites. Nodulated Inga disticha had a N-15-to-N-14 ratio similar to non-N-2-fixing trees, but ARA indicated nitrogenase activity and leghaemoglobin was present in nodules.

Juncus roots are coated with iron plaques, and it has been suggested that microbial processes under the iron plaques might be supportive for Juncus plant growth. The objectives of this work were to enumerate the microbes involved in the turnover of iron and organic root exudates in the rhizoplane, to investigate the effect of oxygen and pH on the utilization of these exudates by the rhizobacteria, and to study the ability of the root-colonizing microbiota to reduce sulfate. Enumeration studies done at pH 3 demonstrated that 10(6) Fe(III) reducers and 10(7) Fe(II) oxidizers g (fresh wt root)(-1) were associated with Juncus roots. When roots were incubated in goethite-containing medium without and with supplemental glucose, Fe(II) was formed at rates approximating 1.1 mmol g (fresh wt root) (-1) d(-1) and 3.6 mmol g (fresh wt root)(-1) d(-1) under anoxic conditions, respectively. These results suggest that a rapid microbially mediated cycling of iron occurs in the rhizosphere of Juncus roots under changing redox conditions. Most-probable-number estimates of aerobes and anaerobes capable of consuming root exudates at pH 3 were similar in the rhizosphere sediment and in Juncus roots, but numbers of aerobes were significantly higher than those of anaerobes. At pH 3, supplemental organic exudates were primarily subject to aerobic oxidation to CO2 and not subject to fermentation. However, at pH 4.5, root exudates were also rapidly utilized under anoxic conditions. Root-associated sulfate reduction was not observed at pH 3 to 4.5 but was observed at pH 4.9. The pH increased during all root-incubation studies both under oxic and anoxic conditions. Thus, as result of the microbial turnover of organic root exudates, pH and CO2 levels might be elevated at the root surface and favor Juncus plants to colonize acidic habitats.","Univ Bayreuth, BITOEK, Dept Ecol Microbiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Brandenburg Univ Technol, Dept Soil Protect & Recultivat, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany","Kusel, K (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, BITOEK, Dept Ecol Microbiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",,,,,,,43,21,23,1,14,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

The total carbon (C) stock of the savanna was 204+/-53 ton C ha(-1), with approximately 84% below-ground and 16% above-ground. Soil organic carbon content (0-1 m) was 151+/-33 ton C ha(-1), accounting for about 74% of the total carbon content in the ecosystem.

This study examined seasonal dynamics of several soil variables, with a specific interest in the seasonality of external hyphae and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF, which is correlated with soil aggregate stability. Here we measured glomalin concentrations and external AMF and non-AMF hyphal length, as well as soil moisture, percent fungal root colonization ( AMF and non-AMF), and root length in soil in an intermountain grassland in western Montana over one growing season ( 13 time points). Of the glomalin pools and hyphal lengths measured, significant seasonal changes occurred for total glomalin (TG; 24.5% change), immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin (IREEG; 53.8% change), and AM hyphal length (107% change). Prior studies on glomalin in natural systems have not considered seasonal effects. The small seasonal change in glomalin pools lends further support to the hypothesis that glomalin is relatively stable in soils, and suggests that one-time sampling may be sufficient to satisfactorily capture this response variable. However, the generality of this observation has yet to be tested in a wider range of ecosystems.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Microbial Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Salish Kootenai Coll, Pablo, MT 59855 USA; Univ Montana, Dept Math Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Microbial Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",,,,35,60,69,3,60,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,2003,257,1,,,,,71,83,,10.1023/A:1026224209597,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,734GG,WOS:000186046200008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Horswell, J; Speir, TW; van Schaik, AP",,,,"Horswell, J; Speir, TW; van Schaik, AP",,,Bio-indicators to assess impacts of heavy metals in land-applied sewage sludge,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rhizobium; sewage sludge; heavy metals; biosensor,NITROGEN-FIXATION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; PAST APPLICATIONS; SANDY LOAM; SOILS; RHIZOBIUM; TOXICITY; BIOSENSOR; TRIFOLII; CLOVER,"Soils from a pastoral farm that had received large amounts of heavy metal contaminated sewage sludge 6-10 years previously were investigated to determine the impact of heavy metals on Rhizobium. The 8 ha application area was originally divided into five different-sized blocks (blocks 1-5), which received sludge at different times between 1991 and 1994. The response of a lux biosensor based on R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (Rhizotox-C), was compared with more traditional techniques for measuring the presence of effective strains of Rhizobium (MPN) and nitrogen fixation (delta(15)N natural abundance). Although population size (MPNs), nitrogen fixation and biosensor response varied between treatment blocks, linear regression analysis determined that this block effect could not be directly linked to soil heavy metal concentrations, but was probably due to biological, physical, chemical and environmental compounding factors at the site. In this type of uncontrolled field application, the lux bioassay may provide the most useful information as it measures toxicity to any microorganism exposed to the soil solution, for example, the free living rhizobia.

The role of this deep-rooting vegetation in the hydrological cycle is unknown. We studied the water dynamics of this vegetation with emphasis on the deeper soil by means of a soil water model. The soil hydraulic properties were optimized in an inverse modeling procedure using the soil water model Hydrus-1D providing rainfall, actual evapotranspiration (E-a) determined with the Bowen ratio energy balance method (BREB), rooting depth, and distribution, as well as the in situ control measurements of soil water pressure head and soil moisture. In 1997, E-a according to BREB measurements amounted to 1174 mm, in 1998 this was 1475 mm. Modeled drainage at a 10-m depth in the 2 yr was 951 and 1016 torn, respectively. The model indicated that around 27% of the soil water was taken up below the 0.9-m depth in the 2-yr study period. During the severe 1997 dry season, according to the soil water model E-a was reduced drastically, as the soil water storage was depleted. According to micrometeorological measurements, however, E-a was not reduced as extremely. This difference might be due to general uncertainties of the soil water model as well as BREB measurements. On the other hand, formation and subsequent evaporation of early morning dew apparently contributed to E-a, which was not considered in the soil water model. In general, besides slightly lower interception, the water budget of a young secondary vegetation did not differ from that reported for Amazonian primary forest.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Soil Sci & Forest Nutr, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; EMBRAPA Amazonia Oriental, BR-66095100 Belem, Para, Brazil; Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Sommer, R (reprint author), CIMMYT, Apdo Postal 6-641, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico.",,,,,,,66,24,25,0,20,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Analysis of variations in genetic patterns using BOX-PCR was used for genetic characterization. Zinc and Cd tolerance of each isolate was also determined. Rhizobia isolated from the control soil compared with the metal contaminated soil differed both genetically and phenotypically. Genetic diversity, measured by AMOVA, was high and not related to the presence or the absence of high metal concentrations. Isolates originating from the metal contaminated soil were more tolerant to both Cd (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC50]=2.5 muM) and Zn (MIC50=92.9 muM) compared with those observed for isolates of control soil (Cd MIC50=2.0 muM and Zn MIC50=41.9 muM). Rhizobia originating from the metal contaminated soil expressed a higher number of metal phenotypes (9) compared with isolates of control soils (6). Slow rates of metal accumulation over the years favored an adaptation of the rhizobia to the metal rather than elimination of metal sensitive organisms and the selection of a few preexisting metal tolerant organisms.","Univ Maryland, Dept Nat Resource Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; ARS, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Angle, JS (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Nat Resource Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,38,20,22,0,9,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Phytophthora root rot is thought to have contributed to chestnut dieback prior to the arrival of chestnut blight, and it may now present a serious limitation to establishment of blight-resistant hybrid chestnut. We manipulated soil compaction and moisture to evaluate the effect of soil physical factors on incidence of Phytophthora root rot on American chestnut seedlings. Seedlings were grown under three watering regimes, two soil compaction levels and two fungicide levels. Increased soil moisture enhanced seedling growth in loose soil, but irrigation did not impact seedlings growing in compacted soils. Seedling mortality was greatest in wet, compacted soils. Disease incidence was highest in the wettest soils, irrespective of compaction level. Fine root necrosis and Phytophthora infection occurred on 58 and 24% of non-fungicide-treated seedlings, respectively. Presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi declined in compacted soils that were either wetter or drier than optimal. Occurrence of ectomycorrhizal fungal symbionts was unrelated to root rot. This study demonstrates the high susceptibility of American chestnut to this common root pathogen, even under moderate levels of soil compaction and moisture. While overcoming chestnut blight is the first step in restoring chestnut to its original range, to establish successful plantings it will be crucial to recognize and avoid sites where soil physical factors promote Phytophthora root rot.

C. nepalensis showed dual symbiosis of actinorrhiza and arbuscular mycorrhiza. There was a significant increase in seedling growth of C. nepalensis when inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhiza compared with those inoculated with actinorrhiza. When seedlings of C. nepalensis were dual inoculated (with arbuscular mycorrhiza and actinorrhiza), improvement in growth was more than the sum of the individual effects of both symbionts. In dual inoculated C. nepalensis seedlings, arbuscular mycorrhiza also significantly increased nodule biomass. Actinorrhiza did not affect mycorrhizal status. The facilitative effect of C. nepalensis on the seedling growth of oak and pine was significant with arbuscular mycorrhiza, and among species the effect was more on pine than oak. The study reveals that the symbiotic association of microorganisms is useful not only to the host plant but also to neighbouring species, thus could be exploited for land rehabilitation in the scarce environment.

When weakly beneficial mutualists and parasites have a competitive advantage over strongly beneficial mutualists, it is not clear how strongly beneficial mutualists persist. If mutualism is destabilized by competitive superiority of weakly beneficial mutualists or cheaters, then mechanisms providing for stable coexistence among competing species may also provide for the persistence of mutualism. We analyze coexistence of species within a mutualist guild using a simple spatial model of patch occupancy to suggest hypotheses about the ecological persistence of mutualism in the interaction between plants and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We suggest that plants could facilitate the persistence of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi by enhancing the mortality of root tips colonized by competitively superior and less mutualistic fungi. We also discuss previous empirical studies and present original data from field observations in plant-ectomycorrhizal systems to address our predictions and to suggest profitable avenues for further work.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Hoeksema, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",,,,,,,49,69,70,0,43,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Overall, competition with grass had little effect on seedling size but appeared to reduce development of the lateral root system. However, results were very variable both within and between species. and differences observed were often only indicative and not statistically significant. Competition tended to increase allocation of biomass to roots and the length of the tap-root, but reduced total length of the root system. In general, on a length basis, competition with grass had no effect on the number of 1st order laterals on the tap-root, but the total number of root tips on the root system declined.

Here we show that a mutualism between an anemonefish (Amphiprion) and its sea anemone host mediates the effect of asymmetrical competition for space between the anemonefish and another damselfish (Dascyllus) in a manner that fosters their coexistence. Amphiprion stimulates increases in host area, the shared resource, but social interactions cap the number of anemonefish to two adults per host. Space generated by the mutualism becomes differentially available to Dascyllus because the effectiveness of an anemonefish in excluding its competitor declines with increases in the area it defends. This alters Amphiprion's ratio of per capita intra- to interspecific effects and thus facilitates coexistence of the fishes. This mechanism may be prevalent in nature, adding another major pathway by which mutualism can enhance diversity.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","Schmitt, RJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",,,,,,,31,59,61,46,190,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We estimated canopy CO2 uptake (A(nC)) at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) study. Rates of A(nC) estimated from the 4C-A model agreed well with leaf gas exchange measurements (A(net)) in both CO2 treatments. Under ambient conditions, monthly sums of net CO2 uptake by the canopy (A(nC)) were 13% higher than estimates based on eddy-covariance and chamber measurements. Annual estimates of A(nC) were only 3% higher than carbon (C) accumulations and losses estimated from ground-based measurements for the entire stand. The C budget for the Pinus taeda component was well constrained (within 1% of ground-based measurements). Although the closure of the C budget for the broadleaf species was poorer (within 20%), these species are a minor component of the forest. Under elevated CO2, the C used annually for growth, turnover, and respiration balanced only 80% of the A(nC). Of the extra 700 g C m(-2) a(-1) (1999 and 2000 average), 86% is attributable to surface soil CO2 efflux. This suggests that the production and turnover of fine roots was underestimated or that mycorrhizae and rhizodeposition became an increasingly important component of the C balance. Under elevated CO2, net ecosystem production increased by 272 g C m(-2) a(-1): 44% greater than under ambient CO2.

Amino acid uptake was determined by injecting dual labeled glycine-2-C-13-N-15 into the soil, and then measuring the enrichment of both C-13 and N-15 in plant tissue after 50 hours. We found enrichment of both C-13 and N-15 in root and shoot material of all species in both soils, providing first evidence for direct uptake of glycine. We show that there was considerable inter-specific variability in amino acid uptake in the low fertility soil. Here, direct uptake of amino acid was greater in the grass Agrostis capillaris, which typically dominates low fertility grassland, than Lolium perenne, which inhabits more fertile sites. Direct uptake of amino acid for Holcus lanatus was intermediate between the above two species. Unlike in the low fertility soil, there was no difference in uptake of either C-13 or N-15 by grasses in the high fertility soil, where uptake of mineral N is thought to be the major mechanism of N uptake of these grasses. Overall, our findings may contribute to our understanding of differences in competitive interactions between grasses in soils of different fertility status.","Univ Lancaster, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Lancaster, England; Inst Grassland & Environm Res, Soil Sci & Environm Qual Team, N Wyke Res Stn, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England","Weigelt, A (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Chair Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",alexandra.weigelt@uni-bayreuth.de,"Bol, Roland/H-9324-2013","Bol, Roland/0000-0003-3015-7706",,,,25,40,45,1,24,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

Relationships among the shrubs Leipoldtia schultzei and Ruschia robusta. which are leaf-succulent members of the Mesembryanthemaceae ('mesembs') and Hirpicium alienatum a non-succulent Asteraceae, were compared on two adjacent sites with different histories of browsing intensity. Competition was more prevalent and more important than facilitation. The only evidence for facilitation was found at the heavily-browsed site where the palatable Hirpicium was larger under the unpalatable Leipoldtia. Generally the prevalence and importance of competition was reduced at the heavily-browsed site. Strong evidence was obtained for intraspecific competition in each of the three species: also, competition was evident between the two mesembs, where Leipoldtia was competitively dominant over Ruschia, although neither species inhibited Hirpicium. Minimal competition between the mesembs and the asteraceous shrub was interpreted in terms of differentiation in rooting depth. and competition within the mesembs, in terms of overlap in rooting depth. The mesembs had the bulk of their roots in the top 5 cm of soil. while the asteraceous shrub had the bulk of its roots, and all its fine roots, at greater depths. The shallow-rooted morphology of the mesembs is well adapted to utilize small rainfall events, which occur frequently in the Succulent Karoo, and do not penetrate the soil deeply. Modifications of existing methods are applied for analysing nearest-neighbour interactions.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England","Carrick, PJ (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, Inst Plant Conservat, Private Bag, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,,,,,59,33,34,1,17,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,GRANGARDE,"GAMLA VAGEN 40, S-77013 GRANGARDE, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Changes in rainfall patterns predicted by global climate models for the central United States are expected to cause lower and increasingly variable soil water availability, which may impact net primary production and plant species composition in native Great Plains grasslands. We experimentally altered the timing and quantity of growing season rainfall inputs by lengthening inter-rainfall dry intervals by 50%, reducing rainfall quantities by 30%, or both, compared to the ambient rainfall regime in a native tallgrass prairie ecosystem in northeastern Kansas. Over three growing seasons, increased rainfall variability caused by altered rainfall timing with no change in total rainfall quantity led to lower and more variable soil water content (0-30 cm depth), a similar to10% reduction in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), increased root to shoot ratios, and greater canopy photon flux density at 30 cm above the soil surface. Lower total ANPP primarily resulted from reduced growth, biomass and flowering of subdominant warm-season C-4 grasses while productivity of the dominant C-4 grass Andropogon gerardii was relatively unresponsive. In general, vegetation responses to increased soil water content variability were at least equal to those caused by imposing a 30% reduction in rainfall quantity without altering the timing of rainfall inputs. Reduced ANPP most likely resulted from direct effects of soil moisture deficits on root activity, plant water status, and photosynthesis. Altered rainfall regimes are likely to be an important element of climate change scenarios in this grassland, and the nature of interactions with other climate change elements remains a significant challenge for predicting ecosystem responses to climate change.","Kansas State Univ, Dept Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Fay, PA (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, 5013 Miller Trunk Highway, Duluth, MN 55811 USA.",,"Collins, Scott/Y-6888-2019; Noojipady, Praveen/B-2511-2010; Blair, John M/I-4082-2014; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; Knapp, Alan/A-2931-2008; Fay, Philip/I-1853-2012","Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Blair, John M/0000-0003-0072-0721; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Fay, Philip/0000-0002-8291-6316",,,,48,265,305,4,157,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2003,137,2,,,,,245,251,,10.1007/s00442-003-1331-3,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,726MF,WOS:000185602300011,12845518,,,,10/31/19J,"Obrist, D; Verburg, PSJ; Young, MH; Coleman, JS; Schorran, DE; Arnone, JA",,,,"Obrist, D; Verburg, PSJ; Young, MH; Coleman, JS; Schorran, DE; Arnone, JA",,,Quantifying the effects of phenology on ecosystem evapotranspiration in planted grassland mesocosms using EcoCELL technology,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bromus tectorum; evapotranspiration; plant canopy development; leaf area index; root length density; weighing lysimeter,TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; ELEVATED CO2; SOIL-WATER; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; EVAPORATION; STREAMFLOW; FLUXES; CARBON; SCALE,"Use of plant phenological variables in models predicting evapotranspiration (ET) has largely relied on relatively simple (e.g., linear) relationships which may not be sufficiently accurate to predict small-yet ecologically significant-changes in plant phenology that are expected to occur in response to global climate change. A dearth of experimental data reflects the difficulties in quantifying these relationships against the background of large environmental variability that occurs in the field. Our main objective was to quantify how plant phenology (leaf area index [LAI] and root length density [RLD]) affect ET and its components during an entire vegetation cycle in large-scale model grassland (Bromus tectorum) ecosystems using the Ecologically Controlled Enclosed Lysimeter Laboratory (EcoCELL)-a unique open flow and mass balance laboratory. We also aimed to compare the three methods employed by the EcoCELL laboratory to measure ecosystem ET (whole-ecosystem gas exchange, weighing lysimetry, and weighing lysimetry combined with time domain reflectometry [TDR]) in order to independently confirm the performance of the unique gas exchange technology. Cumulative ET during the 190 days of the experiment measured with the three different methods compared very well with each other (mean errors < 1%). We found that ET reached maximum levels at relatively low LAI (2-3), but as LAI increased beyond this value, small increase in transpiration were more than offset by decreases in soil evaporation, thereby causing declines in ET. A combined rectangular hyperbola (effects on transpiration) and linear (effects on soil evaporation) function between LAI and ET accounted for almost 90% of all variability in measured daily ET. RLD showed relationships to ET similar to those observed for LAI due to high covariance between RLD and LAI, but root length densities did not explain any additional variability in daily ET beyond that explained by LAI under the well-watered conditions of the experiment. Taken together, our results show that: (i) the EcoCELL mesocosm laboratory can precisely and accurately quantify hydrologic processes of large soil-plant monoliths under controlled environmental conditions; (ii) plant canopy phenological changes affect ecosystem ET, and the contribution of transpiration, in non-linear ways; (iii) these non-linear responses must be accounted for when assessing the consequences of changes in plant phenology-e.g., due to global environmental change-on ecosystem hydrology.

Don) planted with and without lucerne understorey, using rhizotron boxes. Periodic in situ growth of coarse root (52 mm diameter) diameter was also recorded over the same period. The maximum rates and timing of fine root tip initiation, fine root elongation, and coarse root cross-sectional growth were estimated by fitting the Gompertz equation to those growth data. Fine root tip initiation and elongation, and cross-sectional area (CSA) growth of coarse roots were mainly influenced by differences between the two genotypes and soil moisture stress caused by lucerne competition. Greater soil moisture content at the 10-30 cm depth in any of the treatments resulted in significantly greater fine root tip initiation and elongation compared with the 0-10 cm depth. The maximum rate of fine root tip initiation occurred earlier in the 0-10 cm than in the 10-30 em depth, whereas the maximum rate of fine root elongation occurred earlier in the latter. The maximum rate of fine root elongation for clonal trees was 35% greater in the no understorey than in the lucerne treatment due to greater soil moisture availability in the former; whereas with the seedling trees it was not different between the understorey treatments. The occurrence of the rate maximum of fine root elongation was 8 weeks later for the seedling trees than that of the clonal trees in the no-understorey treatment, whereas in the lucerne treatment the difference was only 4 weeks. Coarse root CSA growth patterns were similar to that of the fine roots. The maximum growth rate of coarse root CSA occurred in early April (autumn) 10-12 weeks earlier in the no understorey than in the lucerne treatment.

Results showed that root growth and biomass were more deeply stimulated by the drought stress in less vigorous (V-) families than in vigorous (V+) ones, but the latter had their shoots more hydrated. An osmotic adjustment was observed in both types of families with, however, values of osmotic potential in the root tip lower in V- than in V+; inversely in the upper part of the root. This study does not support the hypothesis that mimicking field limiting factors improve juvenile-mature correlations in maritime pine. Statistical parameters were not affected in such a manner which could enhance genotypic parameters, and few family-mean correlations were significant.

In this study, we phenotypically characterized 18 Kura clover rhizobia including 12 newly isolated North American strains using I I I growth tests. The symbiotic performances of these 12 strains when used to inoculate hexaploid Kura clover plants were then evaluated in a growth chamber and compared to five strains commonly used in commercial Kura clover inoculants. Non-inoculated plants with or without N fertilization were used as controls. Field evaluations were also conducted in 2001 and 2002 in Montreal, Quebec and Becker, Minnesota. Hexaploid Kura clover was seeded with one of three North American strains or three commercial strains and compared to non-inoculated controls with or without N fertilizer. Phenotypic diversity observed among the 12 North American strains was limited. The North American strains were often more efficient than strains commonly used in commercial rhizobial inoculants in both growth chamber and field trials. In the growth chamber study, 60 days after seeding, shoot dry matter accumulation was overall 205% greater with North American strains than with commercial strains and 45% greater than with the best commercial strain tested. Some of the strains currently used in commercial inoculants failed to nodulate Kura clover plants effectively. North American strains tested in field trials (i.e., CT1-1, CT1-2, and WI4-4) overall increased total and shoot dry matter accumulation, 100 days after seeding, in three of four environments by 27% and 31% respectively, when compared to commercial inoculant strains. While these strains appear to have potential they still produced less dry matter than noninoculated N-fertilized controls.","McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Seguin, P (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Macdonald Campus,21111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",,,,,,,20,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Subterranean plant feeders and pathogenic microorganisms interfere with basic functions of plant roots, such as resource uptake, storage of reserves, and anchoring of plants in the soil, but concepts and theories on control of herbivores and pathogens, such as the Green World Hypothesis, have been developed and applied almost exclusively for the aboveground subsystem. Root herbivores and pathogens affect spatial and temporal patterns in natural plant communities, and whether these patterns are cyclic or irreversible depends on characteristics of the root feeders, interactions with other soil or aboveground organisms, and the rate of changes in the abiotic environment. Established plants can tolerate root herbivores and pathogens at densities that are lethal to their offspring. Dispersal by seeds or rhizomes allows new cohorts to become established before root herbivores or root pathogens colonize and develop, but it provides only temporal release of plants from their natural enemies. Permanent release from root herbivores and pathogens contributes to plant invasiveness. I propose to expand the concept of plant-soil feedback by including plant defense belowground. Many plant secondary compounds are synthesized in the roots, and these chemicals could affect root herbivores, root pathogens, and their natural enemies. Plants may exert direct and indirect defense. resistance, tolerance, or dispersal to move away from the herbivores and pathogens belowground, and I propose that acknowledging trade-offs and life history strategies will enhance our capacity to predict spatiotemporal patterns in natural vegetation. Further studies in this area will enhance our understanding of plant abundance, succession, and invasions in natural communities, as well as the evolution of plant dispersal and other defensive strategies against root herbivores and pathogens in natural communities.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO KNAW, Multitroph Interact Dept, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","Van Der Putten, WH (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO KNAW, Multitroph Interact Dept, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",,,,104,162,170,3,145,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2003,84,9,,,,,2269,2280,,10.1890/02-0284,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,719VQ,WOS:000185226100004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Klironomos, JN",,,,"Klironomos, JN",,,Variation in plant response to native and exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,exotic; mycorrhiza; native; plant-microbe interactions; soil ecology,TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TROPICAL FOREST; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; GRASSLAND; SYMBIOSIS; SOIL; COLONIZATION; COMPETITION,"High variability in plant-growth response to the presence of different mycorrhizal fungi can be a major determinant of local plant species diversity. Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co-occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was significantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi. This high variation in plant growth response may be a large contributor to plant species coexistence and the structure of plant communities.","Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Klironomos, JN (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,42,646,705,14,372,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2003,84,9,,,,,2292,2301,,10.1890/02-0413,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,719VQ,WOS:000185226100006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Nieuwenhuis, M; Wills, J; Gardiner, J; Sundstrom, E; Keane, M",,,,"Nieuwenhuis, M; Wills, J; Gardiner, J; Sundstrom, E; Keane, M",,,The effect of soil cultivation methods on rooting depth of young Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

Carr.) trees on surface water gley soils. On two sites in the mid-west of Ireland, a total of 207 trees, 5 and 7 years old, were excavated over a 2-year period, during which water-table depths were monitored. Results showed that neither mound drains nor mole drains had as great an effect on tree rooting depth as the presence of a planting mound. In the cultivation treatments that included planting on mounds, tree roots were mainly confined within the mounds, with the exception of the tree root systems in the mole-and-mound treatment on one of the sites, where the mean root depth of both the 5-year-old and 7-year-old trees reached almost 20 cm below the original soil level. Continued evaluation of these experiments is required to assess the long-term effectiveness of the different drainage and cultivation methods in increasing rooting depth and improving tree stability.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Crop Sci Hort & Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland; SLU, Dept Silviculture, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Coillte Teoranta, Newtownmountkennedy, Co Wicklow, Ireland","Nieuwenhuis, M (reprint author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Crop Sci Hort & Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland.",,,,,,,50,4,6,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,,,FORESTRY,Forestry,SEP,2003,76,4,,,,,465,477,,10.1093/forestry/76.4.465,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,726LH,WOS:000185600200008,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Sierra, CA; Del Valle, JI; Orrego, SA",,,,"Sierra, CA; Del Valle, JI; Orrego, SA",,,Accounting for fine root mass sample losses in the washing process: a case study from a tropical montane forest of Colombia,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine roots; root washing; soil cores; wet sieving,BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS,,"Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin, Colombia","Sierra, CA (reprint author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Sede Medellin,AA 1779, Medellin, Colombia.",,"Sierra, Carlos A./A-5694-2009","Sierra, Carlos A./0000-0003-0009-4169",,,,16,9,9,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

Increasing development of these resources has lead to land degradation, which often requires restoration efforts. A common type of disturbance in this region is mineral extraction and these activities often occur in zones of vegetation dominated by shrubs. These mined lands have proven to be particularly challenging to restore to native shrub cover. Mountain shrubland species such as big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), black chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos sp.) are crucial species for wildlife in this region due to the seasonal dependence of many wildlife species on the mountain shrubland zones. The development of successful restoration techniques for these key shrub species is therefore important for the continued and sustainable utilization of natural resources in the Rocky Mountains. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a reference to land managers working on woody plant establishment on mining disturbances in mountain shrublands in the Rocky Mountains. This review covers the biology, ecology, and propagation of six shrub species that are of primary importance for meeting regulatory compliance in this region. Based upon this survey of the published literature, we conclude that successful establishment of these species has most often involved: (1) utilization of local shrub ecotypes, varieties or subspecies in reclamation efforts, (2) protection from browsing during the establishment phase, (3) strategies for avoiding herbaceous competition, and (4) providing a source of mutualistic soil organisms. Additional specific recommendations for each of these species are discussed.

The isolates were derived from 10 legume host species in six genera (Centrosema, Desmodium, Dioclea, Inga, Machaerium and Vigna). The PCR assays differentiated 13 composite genotypes, and sequencing of a 5' 23S rRNA region indicated that all but one had a unique sequence. The most common genotype (seen in 44% of the isolates) was associated with all six legume host genera, and had a marker profile and 5' 23S rRNA sequence identical to a Bradyrhizobium lineage associated with several other legume genera in Panama and Costa Rica. Another 46% of the isolates had genotypes found to be associated with two to three legume genera. Bradyrhizobium strains with low host specificity thus appear to be prevalent in this tropical forest. Based on 16S rRNA and 5' 23S rRNA markers, most of the isolates had clear affinities to either B. japonicum or B. elkanii. However, one strain (Cp5-3) with a B. elkanii-type 16S rRNA marker had a 5' 23S rRNA region resembling B. japonicum. A partition homogeneity test indicated that relationships of strain Cp5-3 were significantly discordant for 16S rRNA vs. 23S rRNA sequences, and a runs test detected significant mosaic structure across the rRNA region. Lateral gene transfer events have therefore played a role in the evolution of symbiotic bacteria in this environment.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Parker, MA (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,39,26,27,0,7,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Difference was observed in functional groups of C-cycling microorganisms. Nodule formation and plant growth were increased by Cry+ strain and ICP when compared with uninoculated plants.

In the summer of 1998 we conducted a study in the Hook Lake area of the SRL to test the effect of burn frequency (unburned, burned once, or burned three times since 1992) on herbaceous plant community composition and Salix spp. L. (willow) shrub vigor. Plant species abundance, litter biomass, soil pH, and depth of the organic soil horizon were measured in 300 1-m(2) quadrats nested within 30 1,000-m(2) plots in both burned and unburned dry meadows. To test the relationship between frequency and willow vigor, all willow shrubs within the plots were assigned a vigor score from I (dead) to IV (flourishing). The spring burns appear to have reduced willow vigor; however, shrub survival remained high (76%) on the most frequently burned meadows. Ordination plots resulting from canonical correspondence analysis suggest that multiple spring burns influenced plant community composition in dry meadow areas and that less palatable bison forage species (e.g., Carex aenea Fern. and Juncus balticus L.) were correlated with a regime of three spring burns. Our results suggest that frequent spring fires in the Hook Lake area have only a small negative effect on willow cover but may reduce the abundance of primary bison forage plants compared with less frequently burned meadows.","Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Calgary, Dept Environm Design, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Quinlan, A (reprint author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",aquinlan@consecol.org,,,,,,30,6,6,3,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

We quantified soil fungal hyphal length and glomalin content at vegetated and open microsites in Stipa tenacissima steppes of SE Spain. Soils underneath the canopy of S. tenacissima had higher glomalin pools compared to open microsites. We also found significant differences between sites, suggesting the presence of landscape level heterogeneity in glomalin concentration. Soil fungal hyphal length also differed significantly among the sites, but there was no significant effect of microsite. Water-stable aggregates (1-2 mm diameter; WSA(1-2 mm)), however, while differing among sites, did not vary as a function of microsite. Furthermore, WSA(1-2 mm) was negatively correlated with glomalin fractions, as well as soil organic C. Carbonates were likely the major binding agents in these carbonate-rich (average carbonate content: 71%) soils, and not organic C (including glomalin).

The density of fine root biomass and necromass in different soil horizons differed among the sites. At one of the most acidic sites (Harz), fine root density in the humus layer was more than twice that at the least acidic site (Ebergotzen). At the two most acidic sites, Fichtelgebirge and Harz, the ratio of biomass to necromass was significantly lower than at Ebergotzen and Barbis, particularly in the subsoil layer. In each stand, clear vertical gradients in fine root length density and root tip density were observed. Most of the roots and the root tips were in the humus layer and in the first mineral soil horizon (0-10 cm). There was a significantly different decrease in specific root length (cm g(DM)(-1)) and specific root tip density (root tips g(DM)(-1)) in the more acidified stands Fichtelgebirge and Harz compared with Ebergotzen and Barbis. Fine root production estimated by ingrowth cores and a net method was approximately twice as high in the more acidic stands Fichtelgebirge and Harz compared with Ebergotzen and Barbis. Rates of living fine root biomass turnover were higher at the Fichtelgebirge and Harz sites than at the Ebergotzen site. Rates of necromass turnover were similar at all sites. The results suggest that the accumulation of necromass was not due to a slower disappearance at the more acid sites, but to earlier root death. Roots contributed 46% to root + needle litter and 32% to root + total aboveground litter at the Harz site in 1997.","Univ Wales, Sch Agr & Forest Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; Univ Gottingen, Forest Ecosyst Res Ctr, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Forest Res Inst Lower Saxony, D-37079 Gottingen, Germany","Godbold, DL (reprint author), Univ Wales, Sch Agr & Forest Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",,"Meesenburg, Henning/H-5794-2019; Rademacher, Peter/C-8997-2013; Rademacher, Peter/B-9646-2014",,,,,36,101,105,0,39,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,2003,23,13,,,,,915,921,,10.1093/treephys/23.13.915,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,721HZ,WOS:000185312100006,14532015,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Resh, SC; Battaglia, M; Worledge, D; Ladiges, S",,,,"Resh, SC; Battaglia, M; Worledge, D; Ladiges, S",,,"Coarse root biomass for eucalypt plantations in Tasmania, Australia: sources of variation and methods for assessment",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,above-ground and below-ground biomass; coarse root; Eucalyptus; size class distribution; site,GROWTH; GRANDIS; FOREST; NITENS; SOIL,"This study develops a feasible method for evaluating coarse root biomass (roots >2 mm diameter) of well established plantations of eucalypts and then examines coarse root biomass variability across tree age and size, fertilization treatment, species and site for Eucalyptus globulus and E. nitens in Tasmania, Australia. The most efficient sampling protocol consisted of rootball excavation and soil coring for bulk coarse roots, which when compared with total tree excavation estimated total coarse root biomass contained inside the sampled area to within 10%. Across all treatments, an average of 76% of the coarse root biomass was located within the rootball. The majority (>65%) of the coarse roots outside the rootball were located in the surface 20 cm of soil. When size class distribution was examined, 75% of coarse root biomass was found to occur in the larger (20+ mm) diameter size class, a size class that displayed considerable spatial heterogeneity. At the stand level, coarse root biomass ranged from 2.18 to 7.38 kg m(-2) depending primarily on tree size but also on fertilization treatment, species and site. It is estimated that allocation to coarse root biomass production was around 0.2 kg m(-2) year(-1) (around 6% of estimated NPP) for the E. nitens stands examined in this study and around 1 kg m(-2) year(-1) (around 20% of estimated NPP) for the E. globulus stand examined.

At a shear depth of 0.20 to 0.44 m, paper birch contributed greater reinforcement than lodgepole pine. Both birch and pine provided the most root reinforcement in coarse-textured soil and the least reinforcement in medium-textured silt soil.

Division of stem cells and differentiation of their progeny are coordinated by intercellular signaling. In Arabidopsis, stem cells in shoot and floral meristems secrete CLAVATA3, a member of the CLE protein family that activates the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex in underlying cells to restrict the size of the stem cell population. We found that CLE40 encodes a potentially secreted protein that is distantly related to CLV3. While CLV3 transcripts are confined to stem cells of the shoot system, CLE40 is expressed at low levels in all tissues, including roots. Misexpression and promoter swap experiments show that CLE40 can fully substitute for CLV3 to activate CLV signalling in the shoot, indicating that CLV3 and CLE40 are functionally equivalent proteins that differ mainly in their expression patterns. Analysis of cle40 mutants shows that wild-type expression levels of CLE40 are insufficient to contribute to CLV signalling. High level expression of CLV3 or CLE40 results in a premature loss of root meristem activity, indicating that activation of a CLV-like signaling pathway may restrict cell fate also in roots. The cellular organization of cle40 root meristems is normal, but mutant roots grow in a strongly waving pattern, suggesting a role for CLE40 in a signaling pathway that controls movement of the root tip.","Univ Cologne, Inst Entwicklungsbiol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Genet, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Simon, R (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Inst Entwicklungsbiol, Gyrhofstr 17, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",ruediger.simon@uni-koeln.de,"Simon, Rudiger/T-6755-2018","Simon, Rudiger/0000-0002-1317-7716; Muller-Xing, Ralf/0000-0003-0024-4243",,,,35,142,154,3,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0949-944X,1432-041X,,DEV GENES EVOL,Dev.

To test this hypothesis under natural conditions, we artificially removed 100% of previous year needles in two successive years on Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) to simulate pine sawfly attack. Despite a decline in the shoot growth of defoliated trees, root biomass did not differ from control trees. The ergosterol (fungal biomass) and starch concentration of fine roots, however, slightly declined in defoliated trees. Percent ectomycorrhizal colonization of fine root tips remained high in both defoliated and control trees. The dominant tubercle morphotypes were slightly more abundant in the control than in defoliated trees. In contrast to the relatively weak effects on vegetative ectomycorrhizae, reproduction declined near the defoliated pines. Average sporocarp numbers and, consequently, the relative fungal investment to reproduction of the estimated total fungal biomass were more than three times higher near controls than defoliated trees in the first treatment year. Defoliation also reduced the diversity of ectomycorrhizal species producing sporocarps. Mutualistic fungal symbionts may thus alter their reproductive investment in response to restrictions on host resources. Because fungal biomass in the roots as well as colonization percentage remained unchanged, Scots pine evidently continues to invest in the maintenance of the symbiosis despite the reduced photosynthetic capacity due to defoliation.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Kuikka, K (reprint author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",,"Finlay, Roger/B-4731-2009; Rautio, Pasi/A-6595-2013; Finlay, Roger/Q-7796-2019","Finlay, Roger/0000-0002-3652-2930; Rautio, Pasi/0000-0003-0559-7531; Finlay, Roger/0000-0002-3652-2930",,,,43,62,63,2,26,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2003,84,8,,,,,2051,2061,,10.1890/02-0359,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,717EQ,WOS:000185073100013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Finzi, AC; Schlesinger, WH",,,,"Finzi, AC; Schlesinger, WH",,,Soil-nitrogen cycling in a pine forest exposed to 5 years of elevated carbon dioxide,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated carbon dioxide; nitrogen cycling; forest productivity; organic nitrogen; amino acids,MICROBIAL BIOMASS NITROGEN; AIR CO2 ENRICHMENT; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ORGANIC NITROGEN; TEMPERATE FOREST; N AVAILABILITY; AMINO-ACIDS; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; LOBLOLLY-PINE; FINE ROOTS,"Empirical and modeling studies have shown that the magnitude and duration of the primary production response to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) can be constrained by limiting supplies of soil nitrogen (N). We have studied the response of a southern US pine forest to elevated CO2 for 5 years (1997-2001). Net primary production has increased significantly under elevated CO2. We hypothesized that the increase in carbon (C) fluxes to the microbial community under elevated CO2 would increase the rate of N immobilization over mineralization. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the pool sizes and fluxes of inorganic and organic N in the forest floor and top 30 cm of mineral soil during the first 5 years Of CO2 fumigation. We observed no statistically significant change in the gross or net rate of inorganic N mineralization and immobilization in any soil horizon under elevated CO2, Similarly, elevated CO2 had no statistically significant effect on the concentration or flux of organic N, including amino acids. Microbial biomass N was not significantly different between CO2 treatments. Thus, we reject our hypothesis that elevated CO2 increases the rate of N immobilization. The quantity and chemistry of the litter inputs to the forest floor and mineral soil horizons can explain the limited range of microbially mediated soil-N cycling responses observed in this ecosystem. Nevertheless a comparative analysis of ecosystem development at this site and other loblolly pine forests suggests that rapid stand development and C sequestration under elevated CO2 may be possible only in the early stages of stand development, prior to the onset of acute N limitation.","Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Finzi, AC (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016","Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533",,,,57,51,55,2,34,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,AUG,2003,6,5,,,,,444,456,,10.1007/s10021-003-0205-1,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,720HU,WOS:000185256000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pettersson, M; Baath, E",,,,"Pettersson, M; Baath, E",,,The rate of change of a soil bacterial community after liming as a function of temperature,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; FOREST SOILS; FATTY-ACIDS; GROWTH-RATE; PH; BIOMASS; THYMIDINE; TOLERANCE; LEUCINE,"The response of a bacterial community to liming of a forest humus soil (pH 4.9 increased to pH 7.5) was studied in the laboratory at three temperatures (5, 20, and 30degreesC).

This compound did not affect the growth and reproduction of this phytopathogen up to 10(-6) M concentration in the culture medium. We also observed that mastoparan, an activator of heterotrimeric G-protein could inhibit the motility of zoospores and then strikingly effect encystment followed by 60 - 80% germination of cysts. Concomitant application of cochliophilin A and mastoparan showed stronger encystment followed by 100% germination of cysts. In addition, we have observed that chemicals interfering with phospholipase C activity ( neomycin) and Ca2+ influx/release ( EGTA and loperamide) suppress cochliophilin A or mastoparan induced encystment and germination. These results suggest that G-protein mediated signal transduction mechanism may be involved in the differentiation of the A. cochlioides zoospores.

For this purpose root biomass, root profile and fine-root architecture of competitor trees were examined in 53 mixed pine-beech and 42 birch-beech woodlands along a stand maturation gradient, using the root auger technique (0-75-cm). The total beech fine-root biomass highly correlated with aerial dimensions such as stem height and girth, whereas it moderately correlated with its age, thus indicating the effects of competition. Basic stand biometric data such as stand density and basal area had no significant effect on beech root biomass. Conversely, competition indices taking into account the vertical dimensions of competitor trees were efficient, probably due to redundancy with beech height. At similar age and height, beeches under birch had a greater belowground development than beeches under pine. Each species exhibited specific rooting pattern and plasticity of fine-root architecture along the gradients of stand maturation and competition. Beech had a heart-shaped rooting habit in both mixings, which strongly increased along stand maturation. Its fine-root system adopted a foraging strategy to respond to increasing stand competition. The Scots pine fine-root system was plate-like and showed a low morphological plasticity, thus presumably a conservative strategy. Silver birch exhibited a high biomass and a foraging capacity in the topsoil but a loose root system in the subsoil. The coexistence of pine and beech roots in the upper soil presumably leads to a high belowground competition. Beech root system becomes predominant throughout the soil profile and it adopts an efficient foraging strategy, but at the expense of its belowground development. Conversely, the niche partitioning strategy between beech and birch may explain why beech develops strongly belowground in spite of the fact that birch has a dense rooting and a competitive fine-root architecture. As a consequence, beech mid-term regeneration and development may be facilitated under birch as compared with pine.","Cemagref, F-63172 Aubiere, France","Curt, T (reprint author), Cemagref, 24 Av Landais,BP 50085, F-63172 Aubiere, France.",,,,,,,67,43,53,2,32,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2003,255,1,,,,,265,279,,10.1023/A:1026132021506,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,732AQ,WOS:000185919000026,,,,,10/31/19J,"Vamerali, T; Guarise, M; Ganis, A; Bona, S; Mosca, G",,,,"Vamerali, T; Guarise, M; Ganis, A; Bona, S; Mosca, G",,,Analysis of root images from auger sampling with a fast procedure: a case of application to sugar beet,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,auger sampling; elongation index; image analysis; nitrogen fertilization; root length; sugar beet,BINARY PICTURES; LENGTH; QUANTIFICATION; DIAMETER; SCANNER; SOIL,"Manual line-intersect methods for estimating root length are being progressively replaced by faster and more accurate image analysis procedures. These methods even allow the estimation of some more root parameters (e.g., diameter), but still require preliminary labour-intensive operations. Through a task-specific macro function written in a general-purpose image analysis programme (KS 300 - Zeiss), the processing time of root images was greatly reduced with respect to skeletonisation methods by using a high-precision algorithm (Fibrelength). This has been previously proposed by other authors, and estimates length as a function of perimeter and area of the digital image of roots. One-bit binary images were acquired, aiming at large savings in computer memory, and automatic discrimination of roots against extraneous objects based on their elongation index (perimeter(2)/area), was performed successfully. Of four tested spatial resolutions (2.9, 5.9, 8.8, 11.8 pixel mm(-1)), in clean samples good accuracy in root length estimation was achieved at 11.8 pixel mm(-1), up to a root density of 5 cm cm(-2) on the scanner bed. This resolution is theoretically suitable for representing roots at least 85 mum wide. When dealing with uncleaned samples, a thick layer of water was useful in speeding up spreading of roots on the scanner bed and avoiding underestimation of their length due to overlaps with organic debris. A set of fibrous root samples of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris var. saccharifera L.) collected at harvest over two years at Legnaro (NE Italy) was analysed by applying the above procedure. Fertilisation with 100 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen led to higher RLD (root length density in soil) in shallow layers with respect to unfertilised controls, whereas thicker roots were found deeper than 80 cm of soil without nitrogen.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Agron Ambientale & Prod Vegetali, I-35020 Padua, Italy","Vamerali, T (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Agron Ambientale & Prod Vegetali, Via Romea 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.",teofilo.vamerali@unipd.it,"MA, Lei/I-4597-2014","VAMERALI, Teofilo/0000-0003-3051-3686",,,,24,26,26,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2003,255,1,,,,,387,397,,10.1023/A:1026147607879,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,732AQ,WOS:000185919000037,,,,,10/31/19J,"Taskinen, O; Ilvesniemi, H; Kuuluvainen, T; Leinonen, K",,,,"Taskinen, O; Ilvesniemi, H; Kuuluvainen, T; Leinonen, K",,,Response of fine roots to an experimental gap in a boreal Picea abies forest,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,gap disturbance; Norway spruce; root system,EXPERIMENTAL CANOPY GAPS; DOUGLAS-FIR FORESTS; OLD-GROWTH FOREST; SCOTS PINE STAND; CLEAR-CUT; BIOMASS; DYNAMICS; SYLVESTRIS; REGENERATION; DISTURBANCE,"We examined the initial response of the quantity and distribution of fine roots to the creation of an experimental canopy gap with a diameter of 50 m in a mature managed Norway spruce forest.

The root densities of grasses, herbs and dwarf shrubs did not show a clear response to gap creation despite the increase of their foliage.

Two contrasting soils and seven plant species have been studied using the radioactive isotope, Ni-63. Shoots and roots were analysed separately and the specific activity of each plant has been measured. The isotopic exchange properties of rhizosphere soil where compared with control non rhizosphere soil. Possible changes in Ni speciation in the rhizosphere have been assessed by comparing the isotopic exchange properties of the rhizosphere and control soil and by comparing the specific activities of Ni in each plant. The capacity of soil to immobilise added radiotracer largely determines root uptake, leading to between a 4- and 40-fold difference between soils for a given species. The redistribution of nickel from roots to shoots was fairly constant for plants grown on the rendzina, but varied strongly between species for the acid soil. This variation enhanced the contrast between species of the soil-to-shoot transfer factor. Root action significantly enhanced immobilisation of added nickel in an acid soil due to the modification of speciation of initially non exchangeable soil nickel, but had little effect on a neutral rendzina. Changes in rhizosphere pH were similar on the two soils. In the acid soil, these pH changes were accompanied by changes in Ni speciation but a causative link has not been established. In the neutral soil pH changes may have modified root uptake properties.","INRA, Unite Rhizosphere & Symbiose, F-34060 Montpellier, France; Direct Sci, Serv Transferts, F-92298 Chatenay Malabry, France","Staunton, S (reprint author), INRA, Unite Rhizosphere & Symbiose, Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",,"Staunton, S./G-8095-2012","Staunton, S./0000-0001-5926-7015",,,,40,15,17,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2003,255,2,,,,,619,629,,10.1023/A:1026052228609,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,727FE,WOS:000185646600018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Perkins, SR; Owens, MK",,,,"Perkins, SR; Owens, MK",,,Growth and biomass allocation of shrub and grass seedlings in response to predicted changes in precipitation seasonality,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; defoliation; light; microsite; shade,HERBIVORY TOLERANCE; DEFOLIATION; SURVIVAL; ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE; SUCCESSION; LIMITATION; MECHANISMS; SAGEBRUSH; REGROWTH,"Anthropogenic emissions contribute to an annual 0.5% increase in atmospheric CO2. As global CO2 levels increase, regional precipitation patterns will likely be altered. Our primary objective was to determine whether a reduction in summer precipitation or an increase in winter/spring precipitation, predicted by global climate change models, will favor the establishment of C-4 grasses or C-3 shrubs in southern savannas. Our secondary objective was to determine how defoliation and microsite light availability interact with altered precipitation regimes to influence grass and shrub seedling growth and biomass allocation patterns. Seedlings of 3 shrub species (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa, Acacia berlandieri, and A. greggii var. wrightii) and 3 grass species (Aristida purpurea var. wrightii, Setaria texana, and Stipa leucotricha) were watered based on probable changes in precipitation in a CO2 enriched atmosphere (0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 current ambient summer precipitation and 1.0, 1.15, and 1.30 current winter/spring precipitation). Seedlings were defoliated at 3 levels (non-defoliated, single defoliation, and repeated defoliation) within 2 levels of microsite light availability (100 and 50% ambient). Defoliation significantly reduced total shrub and grass seedling biomass. Reducing light availability decreased shrub seedling root: shoot ratio, but total biomass was not significantly affected. Grass seedling biomass and root: shoot ratio decreased when light availability was reduced. Changing the seasonality of precipitation by reducing summer rainfall or increasing winter/spring rainfall did not significantly influence growth or biomass allocation of grass and shrub seedlings in a semiarid savanna. Microsite variations in defoliation intensity and light availability influence seedling growth and biomass allocation more than changing seasonality of precipitation. Shrub and grass seedling establishment and growth on semiarid rangelands are already limited by summer precipitation, so a further reduction as proposed by climate change models will have a limited impact on seedling dynamics.","Texas Agr Exptl Stn, Uvalde, TX 78801 USA","Owens, MK (reprint author), Texas Agr Exptl Stn, 1619 Garner Field Rd, Uvalde, TX 78801 USA.",,"Owens, Michael/H-4365-2012",,,,,48,18,25,1,26,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2003,168,1,,,,,107,120,,10.1023/A:1024447305422,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,695MZ,WOS:000183835900010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Curt, T; Prevosto, B",,,,"Curt, T; Prevosto, B",,,Root biomass and rooting profile of naturally regenerated beech in mid-elevation Scots pine woodlands,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,beech (Fagus sylvatica L.); competition; natural afforestation; root system; Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),FAGUS-SYLVATICA; FINE ROOTS; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; BOREAL FOREST; GROWTH; STAND; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMMUNITIES,"The natural establishment of shade-tolerant forest species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) occurs in naturally regenerated Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) woodlands that develop on former pastures and cultivated lands. To examine possible effects of underground competition in beech establishment, we studied the root biomass and the rooting profile of 53 mixed Scots pine-natural beech woodlands in French mid-elevation volcanic areas. Stands were arranged along a maturation gradient. Roots were sampled using the root-auger technique (0 to 75 cm depth every 15 cm). In addition, 23 young beeches were uprooted to study the entire root system. Total beech fine-root biomass was closely correlated with most beech aerial characteristics, (e.g., height, diameter and girth), and correlated moderately with tree age. However, it correlated poorly with basic competition indices such as stand density and basal area. Conversely, competition indices including vertical dimensions of competing trees were correlated with the underground biomass, probably as a result of redundancy with beech height. The rooting profile (fine roots, < 5 mm) of beech and pine were quite similar, and did not change significantly along the stand maturation gradient. Beech has a heart-shaped root system while pine is more plate-like and dimorphic. Beech fine-root biomass progressively surpassed pine biomass throughout the soil layers, thus confirming that it is dynamic and competitive in mature mixed stands. The coexistence of the root systems of beech and pine in the same soil layers presumably results in strong underground competition.","Cemagref, Appl Ecol Woodlands Res Team, F-63172 Aubiere, France","Curt, T (reprint author), Cemagref, Appl Ecol Woodlands Res Team, 24 Av Landais,BP 50085, F-63172 Aubiere, France.",,,,,,,54,21,24,1,20,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2003,167,2,,,,,269,282,,10.1023/A:1023904912712,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,684KC,WOS:000183204300008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Avery, LM; Smith, RIL; West, HM",,,,"Avery, LM; Smith, RIL; West, HM",,,Response of rhizosphere microbial communities associated with Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica) to UV radiation,POLAR BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION; VASCULAR PLANTS; LITTER QUALITY; DECOMPOSITION; FIELD,"The response of rhizosphere microbial communities associated with natural populations of Deschampsia antarctica growing on Leonie Island (67degrees36'S, 68degrees21'W, Antarctic Peninsula) to UV radiation was investigated.

New information regarding the earliest events in this process could provide insights into the development of germplasm, both plant and bacterial, better adapted to such soils. A recently developed plate model system containing a narrow range of limed (pH 4.71-4.99), nonsterile soils (see article by Staley in Soil Science 167, pp. 211-221) was employed to investigate initial nodulation of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) seedlings. Our objectives were to further evaluate nodulation assessment methodology (staining and nodule stage), distinguish between soil pH-induced plant and rhizobia limitations on nodulation by employing (daily) saturation inoculation, and determine if previously observed nodulation reduction by low pH soil was a consequence of inhibition of symbiosis establishment or nodule maturation by utilizing a gusA-marked mutant of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii. Over the course of all experiments in all soils, rhizobial MPN populations never declined below 1.3 X 10(4) CFU g(-1) dry soil. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) nodulation responses to soil pH increase were found for both the wildtype (gus(-)) and the mutant (gus(+)) stains, whether assessed using unstained (fresh) or stained (methylene blue or GUS) roots. The pattern of gusA nodule ontogeny under saturation levels of rhizobia, relative to soil pH, suggests that inhibition of symbiosis establishment (cellular effects), rather than differences in nodule maturation (tissue effects), is the explanation for our observed soil pH effects on nodulation. Re-investigation of root responses revealed small but significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) differences, due to soil pH, primarily for lateral roots. Taken together, these results corroborate our previous, wildtype rhizobia findings of a positive effect of soil lowlevel liming (only 0.25 pH increase) on nodulation and extend them to earlier times (4-6 DAP) in symbiosis establishment, but they refute our previous finding of no root growth and developmental effects. More importantly, they suggest that nodulation reduction in the lower pH soils of our model system was caused by disruption of rhizobia function (but not viable populations) or root hair growth and/or function.","USDA ARS, NAA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, Beaver, WV 25813 USA","Staley, TE (reprint author), USDA ARS, NAA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, 1224 Airport Rd, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",tstaley@afsrc.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,24,4,4,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,AUG,2003,168,8,,,,,540,551,,10.1097/01.ss.0000085051.25696.1b,,,12,Soil Science,Agriculture,712UN,WOS:000184816900002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Yamaguchi, NU; Hiradate, S; Mizoguchi, M; Miyazaki, T",,,,"Yamaguchi, NU; Hiradate, S; Mizoguchi, M; Miyazaki, T",,,Formation and disappearance of Al tridecamer in the presence of low molecular weight organic ligands,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,acetate; Al-27-NMR; Al tridecamer; citrate; oxalate,X-RAY-SCATTERING; KEGGIN AL-13 POLYMER; PROMOTED DECOMPOSITION; POTASSIUM-CHLORIDE; ALUMINUM COMPLEXES; CITRIC-ACID; SPECIATION; CHEMISTRY; TOLERANCE; MECHANISM,"Formation and disappearance of phytotoxic Al tridecamer (Al-13) in the rhizosphere can be affected by root exudates such as organic ligands. We investigated the effects of organic ligands on the formation and disappearance of Al-13 as a function of pH and COOH/Al ratio. The aqueous Al species were analyzed by using a liquid state Al-27-NMR and an atomic absorption spectrometer and separated into four fractions, as follows; 1) Al-13, 2) Al monomer and dimer (Al-SYM), 3) Al complexed with organic ligands (Al-org) and 4) other undefined species (Al-NON). Formation of Al-13 was suppressed by acetate, oxalate, and citrate. In addition, Al-13 that preexisted in a hydroxyaluminum solution was disappeared by the introduction of acetate, oxalate, and citrate. Decrease in the concentration of Al-13 at the early stage of the reaction was caused by the decomposition of Al-13 along with the increase in the concentrations of Al-SYM and Al-ORG. After 7 d of reaction, it was likely that Al-13 was transformed into Al(OH)(3)(0) and other undefined species that could not be detected by Al-27-NMR. The ability of the carboxylic groups to suppress the occurrence of Al-13 (molar-basis) was in the order of acetate much less than oxalate < citrate, corresponding to the ability of complexation with Al. In conclusion, the phytotoxic effects of Al-13 were less pronounced because of the ubiquitous presence of organic ligands in the rhizosphere.","Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Yamaguchi, NU (reprint author), Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058604, Japan.",,,,,,,27,10,10,0,5,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Quercus crispula seedlings were grown from seed in a relative photosynthetically active photon flux density (RPPFD) of 100, 10 or 2%. There was no difference in total dry mass between 100 and 10% RPPFD. At the end of the growing season, plants grown in 2% RPPFD had a lower total dry mass than those grown in 100 or 10% RPPFD. Seedlings grown in 100% RPPFD showed morphological acclimation, i.e., high root/shoot ratios and high leaf mass per area. De-epoxidation level in the xanthophyll cycle and activity of an antioxidant enzyme were highest in 100% RPPFD, but total chlorophyll concentration and photosynthetic rate were highest in 10% RPPFD. These results indicate that excess photons were generated in 100% RPPFD, leading to increased capacities for dissipation of received light energy through the xanthophyll cycle and for scavenging of reactive oxygen species through the water-water cycle. Nevertheless, a midday decrease in dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) indicated that seedlings grown in 100% RPPFD were suffering from photoinhibition. We conclude that Q. crispula current-year seedlings have high morphological acclimation to high light but that photosynthetic efficiency cannot be maintained under high-light conditions even with a photoprotection system.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; Res Inst Biol Sci, Okayama 7161241, Japan","Matsuki, S (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.",,"Tanaka, Ayumi/D-9003-2012; Hara, Toshihiko/D-8016-2012",,,,,42,11,13,0,5,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2003,23,11,,,,,769,775,,10.1093/treephys/23.11.769,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,714TW,WOS:000184930400005,12839730,,,,10/31/19J,"Calfapietra, C; Gielen, B; Galema, ANJ; Lukac, M; De Angelis, P; Moscatelli, MC; Ceulemans, R; Scarascia-Mugnozza, G",,,,"Calfapietra, C; Gielen, B; Galema, ANJ; Lukac, M; De Angelis, P; Moscatelli, MC; Ceulemans, R; Scarascia-Mugnozza, G",,,Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) enhances biomass production in a short-rotation poplar plantation,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated CO2; light-use efficiency; POPFACE; Populus; root/shoot ratio; SRC; wood density,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL N-AVAILABILITY; HYBRID POPLAR; POPULUS-GRANDIDENTATA; CROWN ARCHITECTURE; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; FINE ROOTS,"This paper investigates the possible contribution of Short Rotation Cultures (SRC) to carbon sequestration in both current and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]).

By contrast, fine-scale studies investigate interactions that might occur once AMF have developed more fully within ecosystems, and most plants come into contact with AMF. Whereas coarse-scale effects are well understood, our understanding of fine-scale factors is just developing, as a result of investigations into AMF-plant specificity, AMF species richness, shared mycelial networks, and plant-AMF feedback effects.

Riparian forest biomass and carbon pools were quantified for four riparian forests representing different seral stages in the South Carolina Upper Coastal Plain. Three of the riparian forests were recovering from disturbance (thermal pollution), whereas the fourth represents a mature, relatively undisturbed riparian forest. Above and belowground carbon pools were determined from linear transects established perpendicular to the main stream channels and spanning the width of the riparian area. The objective of this study was to quantify the biomass and carbon pools in severely disturbed, early successional bottomland hardwood riparian forests and to compare these values to those of a less disturbed, mature riparian forest. Aboveground biomass in all four riparian forests increased during the 2.5-year investigation period. The total carbon pool in these South Carolina Coastal Plain riparian forests increased with forest age/development due to greater tree and soil carbon pools. The mature riparian forest stored approximately four times more carbon than the younger stands. The importance of the herbaceous biomass layer and carbon pool declined relative to total aboveground biomass with increasing forest age. As stands grew older fine root biomass increased, but an inverse relationship existed between percentages of fine root biomass to total biomass. The root carbon pool increased with forest age/development due to a combination of greater fine root biomass and higher root percent carbon. Aboveground net primary production (NPP) in young riparian forests rapidly approached and exceeded NPP of the more mature riparian forest. As a woody overstory became established (after similar to8-10 years) annual litterfall rate as a function of NPP was independent of forest age and litterfall amount in the young riparian forests was comparable to mature riparian forests. Biomass in the riparian forest floor and carbon pool declined with increasing riparian forest development. Woody debris in these riparian forests comprised a relatively small carbon pool. An understanding of bottomland hardwood riparian forest carbon pools at different stages of succession allows us to assess how time since disturbance influences these pools, leading to a better understanding of the recovery processes.

In the controlled environment study there were three watering regimes which were watered to 100, 50 and 25% field capacity, respectively. Significant differences in dry matter accumulation and allocation, leaf guard cell length, the minimum daily leaf water potential, carbon isotope composition (described as water-use efficiency) and abscisic acid (ABA) concentration were detected among populations. Compared with the southeastern population, under water deficit the northwestern and central populations had lower biomass production and higher root/shoot ratio, foliage area/stem cross-sectional area ratio and specific leaf area density. The northwestern and central populations also exhibited higher minimum daily water potentials, water-use efficiencies and ABA accumulation as effected by drought than the southeastern population. These morphological and physiological responses to water availability showed that the different populations may employ different survival strategies under drought stress at the initial phase of seedling growth and establishment. The southeastern population possesses a prodigal water-use strategy and quick growth, while the northwestern and central populations exhibit conservative water-use strategies and slow growth. These differences in drought responses maybe used as criteria for genotype selection in and and semi-arid regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Questions remain as to how the metal contamination and subsequent remediation at this site have impacted the population structure of the soil microbial communities. In the current study, microbial communities from this site were analyzed by the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) procedure. Principal component analysis of the PLFA profiles indicated that there were differences in the profiles for soils with different levels of metal contamination, and that soils with higher levels of metal contamination showed decreases in indicator PLFAs for mycorrhizal fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. PLFA profiles for remediated sites indicated that remediated soils showed increases in indicator PLFAs for fungi, actinomycetes, and Gram-positive bacteria, compared to unremediated metal contaminated soils. These data suggest a change in the population structure of the soil microbial communities resulting from metal contamination and a recovery of several microbial populations resulting from remediation.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Biotechnol Ctr Agr & Environm, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Kelly, JJ (reprint author), Loyola Univ, Dept Biol, 6525 N Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60626 USA.",,"Haggblom, Max M/E-7597-2010","Haggblom, Max M/0000-0001-6307-7863; Kelly, John/0000-0002-0894-137X",,,,32,97,113,2,46,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The isotope signals are depleted delta(13)C values from elevated CO2 experiments and enriched Delta(14)C values from bomb C-14 in atmospheric CO2. For the CO2 experiments, I explored the effects of six root mortality patterns (on-off, proportional, constant, normal, left skew, and right skew distributions), five levels of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves, and increased root growth on root delta(13)C values after CO2 fumigation. My analysis indicates that fitting a linear equation to delta(13)C data provides unbiased estimates of longevity only if root mortality follows an on-off model, without dilution of isotope signals by pretreatment NSC reserves, and under a steady state between growth and death. If root mortality follows the other patterns, the linear extrapolation considerably overestimates root longevity. In contrast, fitting an exponential equation to delta(13)C data underestimates longevity with all the mortality patterns except the proportional one. With either linear or exponential extrapolation, dilution of isotope signals by pretreatment NSC reserves could result in overestimation of root longevity by several-fold. Root longevity is underestimated if elevated CO2 stimulates fine root growth. For the bomb C-14 approach, I examined the effects of four mortality patterns (on-off, proportional, constant, and normal distribution) on root Delta(14)C values. For a given Delta(14)C value, the proportional pattern usually provides a shorter estimate of root longevity than the other patterns. Overall, we have to improve our understanding of root growth and mortality patterns and to measure NSC reserves in order to reduce uncertainties in estimated fine root longevity from isotope data.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, 770 Van Vleet Oval, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,,,,,,36,29,34,1,11,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The low species diversity of tropical flooded forests has been ascribed to the paucity of species with adaptations to tolerate flooding. To test the hypothesis that flooding is the only factor restricting most species from SFF, we compared plant morphological and physiological responses to flooding in 2-month old seedlings of 6 species common to SFF and 12 species common to terra firme forests. Although flooding impaired growth, total biomass, maximum root length and stomatal conductance in most species, responses varied greatly and were species-specific. For example, after 90 days, flooding reduced leaf area growth by 10-50% in all species, except in Tabebuia, a common species from non-flooded habitats. Similarly, flooding had a 5-45% negative effect on total biomass for all species, except in 1 SFF and 1 terra firme species both of which had more biomass under flooding. A principal component analysis, using the above responses to flooding, provided no evidence that SFF and terra firme species differed in their responses to flooding. Flooding also caused reductions in root growth for most species. Rooting depth and root: shoot ratios were significantly less affected by flooding in SFF than in terra firme species. Although flood tolerance is critical for survival in flooded habitats, we hypothesize that responses to post-flooding events such as drought might be equally important in seasonal habitats. Therefore, we suggest that the ability to grow roots under anoxia might be critical in predicting success in inundated habitats that also experience a strong dry season.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Lopez, OR (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Lopez, Omar/0000-0003-4953-2123",,,,57,44,48,0,20,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2003,136,2,,,,,193,204,,10.1007/s00442-003-1259-7,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700BJ,WOS:000184092500004,12743794,,,,10/31/19J,"Yamanaka, T; Li, CY; Bormann, BT; Okabe, H",,,,"Yamanaka, T; Li, CY; Bormann, BT; Okabe, H",,,"Tripartite associations in an alder: effects of Frankia and Alpova diplophloeus on the growth, nitrogen fixation and mineral acquisition of Alnus tenuifolia",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Alnus; Alpova; mineral weathering; mycorrhizal formation; tripartite symbiosis,"ANDREWS,H.J.

Isolates in this group from both locations and from both legume hosts all had identical sequences for a highly polymorphic 5' portion of 23S rRNA, while nine other ETs outside this cluster all had unique sequences. This indicates that both sites are occupied by one primary lineage of nodule symbionts that is both locally predominant and geographically widespread.

A single application of urine (equivalent to 746 kg N ha(-1)), was applied in late spring to plots immediately after light and moderately-severe defoliation (35 mm and 85 mm cutting heights, respectively) treatments were imposed. Estimates of percentage clover N derived from N-2 fixation (%Ndfa) were compared by labelling the soil with N-15 either by applying a low rate of N-15-labelled ammonium sulphate, immobilising N-15 in soil organic matter, adding N-15 to applied urine, or by utilising the small differences in natural abundance of N-15 in soil. Urine application increased annual grass production by 85%, but had little effect on annual clover production. However, urine caused a marked decline in %Ndfa (using an average of all N-15 methods) from 84% to a low of 22% by 108 days, with recovery to control levels taking almost a year. As a result, total N fixed (in above ground clover herbage) was reduced from 232 to 145 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Moderately-severe defoliation had no immediate effect on N-2 fixation, but after 108 days the %Ndfa was consistently higher than light defoliation during summer and autumn, and increased by up to 18%, coinciding with an increase in growth of weeds and summer-grass species. Annual N-2 fixation was 218 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) under moderately-severe defoliation compared to 160 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) under light defoliation. Estimates of %Ndfa were generally similar when N-15-labelled or immobilised N-15 were used to label soil regardless of urine and defoliation severity. The natural abundance technique gave highly variable estimates of %Ndfa (-56 to 24%) during the first 23 days after urine application but, thereafter, estimates of %Ndfa were similar to those using N-15-labelling methods. In contrast, in urine treated plots the use of N-15-labelled urine gave estimates of %Ndfa that were 20-30% below values calculated using conventional N-15-labelling during the first 161 days. These differences were probably due to differences in the rooting depth between ryegrass and white clover in conjunction with treatment differences in N-15 distribution with depth. This study shows that urine has a prolonged effect on reducing N-2 fixation in pasture. In addition, defoliation severity is a potential pasture management tool strategically enhancing N-2 fixation.","AgRes Ruakura Res Ctr, Hamilton, New Zealand; Environm Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand","Menneer, JC (reprint author), AgRes Ruakura Res Ctr, Private Bag 3123, Hamilton, New Zealand.",,,"Ledgard, Stewart/0000-0002-6623-8172",,,,40,16,16,2,21,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2003,254,2,,,,,469,480,,10.1023/A:1025516429032,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,717DT,WOS:000185070900020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rodrigues, LA; Martins, MA; Salomao, MSMB",,,,"Rodrigues, LA; Martins, MA; Salomao, MSMB",,,"Use of mycorrhizas and rhizobium in intercropping system of Eucalyptus and Sesbania.

The diversity of terrestrial humus forms (mor, moder and mull) can be attributed to the existence of different patterns (strategies) for the capture and use of resources by ecosystems, in ascending order of biodiversity and bioavailability. Arguments are found in the parallel development of humus forms and terrestrial ecosystems, in exclusion mechanisms between organisms living in different humus forms, and in palaeontological studies. The diversification of terrestrial life forms in the course of Earth history, concomitant with an improvement in resource availability due to the development of sedimentary layers at the surface of continents, may explain the successive appearance of more active humus forms enabling the co-existence of an increasing number of organisms. Contradictory reports about the relationships between biodiversity and stability of ecosystems can be explained by the existence of different belowground pathways making ecosystems more stable.

A fungal/bacterial biomass index using the PLFA technique was calculated using the PLFA 18:2w6,9 as an indicator of fungal biomass and the sum of 13 bacterial specific PLFAs as indicator of the bacterial biomass. Good linear correlation (p < 0.001) was found between the total microbial biomass estimated with SIR and total PLFAs (totPLFA), indicating that 1 mg biomass-C was equivalent to 130 nmol totPLFA. Both biomass estimates were positively correlated to soil pH. The fungal/bacterial ratio measured using the selective inhibition technique decreased significantly with increasing pH from about 9 at pH 3 to approximately 2 at pH 7, while the fungal/bacterial biomass index using PLFA measurements tended to increase slightly with increasing soil pH. Good correlation between the soil content of ergosterol and of the PLFA 18:2w6,9 indicated that the lack of congruency between the two methods in estimating fungal/bacterial ratios was not due to PLFA 18:2w6,9-related non-fungal structures to any significant degree. Several PLFAs were strongly correlated to soil pH (R-2 values > 0.8); for example the PLFAs 16:1w5 and 16:1w7c increased with increasing soil pH, while i16:0 and cy19:0 decreased. A principal component analysis of the total PLFA pattern gave a first component that was strongly correlated to soil pH (R-2 = 0.85, p < 0.001) indicating that the microbial community composition in these beech/beech-oak forest soils was to a large extent determined by soil pH.

Zygotic embryos of G. biloba were inoculated with the wild agropine-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A4. Three months after bacterial infection, primordia-like nodular structures formed at the root wound sites and developed into tiny calli. Calli cultivated on hormone-free Lloyd and McCown (1980) solid medium were transferred onto Murashige and Skoog (1962) solid medium, and grew rapidly for the first few months. As browning appeared and growth slowed, calli were transferred onto Ball (1959) or White (1954) solid media. These calli became nodular with several nodules from which roots, displaying characteristic features of hairy roots, developed. Transgenic calli cultivated in agitated, hormone-free liquid media led to the formation of root meristems and root tips by a cyclic development process. Stable integration of the rolA, rolB and rolC genes into calli, mature roots and root meristem and root tip mixtures was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The absence of a 437 bp amplificate corresponding to the virD] gene confirmed that there was no bacterial contamination of G. biloba tissues. The reverse transcription-PCR method was used to verify the expression of rolA and rolC genes in mature roots. Expression of rolA, rolB and rolC in root meristems and root tips was confirmed by 3' RACE-PCR analysis, which excluded amplification of possible rol gene transcripts produced by residual bacteria. This paper shows, for the first time, the feasibility of developing G. biloba roots from transformed calli.","Univ Tours, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, EA 2106, Lab Biol Mol & Biochim Vegetale, F-37200 Tours, France","Tremouillaux-Guiller, J (reprint author), Univ Tours, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, EA 2106, Lab Biol Mol & Biochim Vegetale, 31 Ave Monge, F-37200 Tours, France.",,,,,,,25,17,23,0,9,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,2003,23,10,,,,,713,718,,10.1093/treephys/23.10.713,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,695WV,WOS:000183854100007,12777244,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Rahman, MS; Messina, MG; Newton, RJ",,,,"Rahman, MS; Messina, MG; Newton, RJ",,,Performance of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings and micropropagated plantlets on an east Texas site - I.

One solution may be to regenerate with clonally propagated drought-hardy planting stock. The objective of this research was to compare the field performance of loblolly pine seedlings and plantlets of diverse genetic origin, produced via micropropagation technology. Two adjacent sites were established (Site I in 1993 and Site 11 in 1994) with trees produced from four genetic families: Liberty (LIB) and Montgomery (MON) Counties from southeast Texas, and Fayette (FAY) and Bastrop (BAS) Counties from the ""Lost Pines"" in Central Texas. Height, groundline diameter (GLD), leaf area, survival, root/shoot ratio, and root system architecture were measured throughout the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. In addition, height and diameter at breast height on Site 11 were measured at the end of 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. Height and GLD growth for seedlings was significantly greater than for plantlets on both sites. However, mean relative growth rates for height were greater for plantlets during the first growing season, but comparable thereafter. Survival for all treatments was >85% on Site I and >90% on Site II at the end of the 1995 growing season. Survival was significantly different, but by a negligible margin, between families and stock types on Site H at the end of the 1995 growing season, and by a margin of 7% (89% for seedlings vs. 82% for plantlets) at the end of the 2000 growing season. Seedlings had greater leaf area growth than plantlets after two growing seasons. Root/shoot ratio was significantly greater for plantlets after two growing seasons, whereas their specific root length was significantly smaller than that of seedlings. This was attributed to root system architecture. Whereas plantlets produced thicker roots with less length per unit dry weight, seedlings produced more branching with thinner roots for similar dry weights. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the time associated with processing videotaped minirhizotron images limits the amount of data that can be extracted in a reasonable amount of time. We found that this limitation can be minimized using a more easily measured variable r (i.e. root numbers) as a substitute of root length. Linear regression models were fitted between root length versus root number for production and mortality of seven, sample datasets of varying tree species and treatments. The resulting r(2) values ranged from 0.79 to 0.99, suggesting that changes in root numbers can be used to predict root length dynamics reliably. Slope values, representing the mean root segment length (MRSL), ranged from 2.34 to 8.38 mm per root segment for both production and mortality. Most treatments did not alter MRSL substantially, the exceptions being CO2 treatments and a girdling treatment that altered plant community composition and, consequently, root morphology. The high r(2) values demonstrated a robust relationship between variables irrespective of species or treatments. Once the quantitative relationship between root lengths and numbers has been established for a particular species-treatment combination, quantifying changes in root number through time should substantially decrease the time required to quantify root dynamics.

C-14-labelled, dried and ground P. australis root and shoot litter was buried in waterlogged, planted or non-planted fen microcosms. The evolution of (CO2)-C-14 and (CH4)-C-14 from the pots was monitored during the 35-day experiment. The C-14 activity in the shoots and roots of the plants, soil, and inundation water was also analysed at the end of the experiment. Up to 40% of the released CH4-C originated from the added litter, whereas the rest originated from old soil organic matter. The comparison of planted and non-planted pots suggested that the contribution of recent plant-derived C (i.e. root exudates) to CH4 emission was negligible. The proportion of litter-derived CH4-C was significantly higher in the planted pots, suggesting that the presence of plants enhanced the formation of CH4 from litter. The major part of the initial C-14 activity was recovered from the soil. About 3% was recovered from the inundation water, about 10% was emitted as CO2, and only <0.01% as CH4. However, these results demonstrated that plant litter and old soil organic matter are the major sources of CH4-C in fens during the early growth stage of P. australis.","Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland; Inst Primary Prod & Microbial Ecol, Ctr Agr Landscape & Land Use Res eV, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Plant Nutr & Soil Sci, D-06108 Halle Saale, Germany","Juutinen, S (reprint author), Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",,"Augustin, Juergen/C-3588-2013","Augustin, Juergen/0000-0002-8560-2814",,,,30,11,15,0,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The soil conditions at the sites from which Phytophthora spp. were recovered ranged from mesic sediments to moraines, with clayey to silty textures and with soil pH (BaCl2) between 3.5 and 5.0.

An elevated CO2 treatment (550 ppm), of 200 ppm over ambient (350 ppm) was provided using a FACE technique. Standing root biomass, fine root turnover and mycorrhizal colonization of the following Populus species was examined: Populus alba L., Populus nigra L., Populus x euramericana Dode (Guinier). Elevated CO2 increased belowground allocation of biomass in all three species examined, standing root biomass increased by 47-76% as a result of FACE treatment. Similarly, fine root biomass present in the soil increased by 35-84%. The FACE treatment resulted in 55% faster fine root turnover in P. alba and a 27% increase in turnover of roots of P. nigra and P. x euramericana. P. alba and P. nigra invested more root biomass into deeper soil horizon under elevated CO2. Response of the mycorrhizal community to elevated CO2 was more varied, the rate of infection increased only in P. alba for both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). The roots of P. nigra showed greater infection only by AM and the colonization of the root system of P. x euramericana was not affected by FACE treatment. The results suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions induce greater belowground biomass investment, which could lead to accumulation of assimilated C in the soil profile. This may have implications for C sequestration and must be taken into account when considering long-term C storage in the soil.","Univ Wales, Sch Agr & Forest Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Sci Ambiente Forestale & Sue Risorse, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy","Lukac, M (reprint author), Univ Wales, Sch Agr & Forest Sci, Deiniol Rd, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",m.lukac@bangor.ac.uk,"Lukac, Martin/A-4379-2013; Calfapietra, Carlo/E-2269-2015","Lukac, Martin/0000-0002-8535-6334; ",,,,47,108,109,3,63,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Analysis of plant community biological accumulation factors (BAFs), calculated using total soil metal and free soil metal ion (Me(2+)) found that free soil metal BAFs were more similar among locations than total soil metal BAFs, but that disparity still existed. Fine roots were found to dominate annual vegetation transfer of Cu, Ni, and Pb to soils, relative to foliage; fine root mortality played a smaller role than foliage for Zn plant-soil transfer.

Root exudates of turnip and cabbage stimulated hyphal growth of Pisolithus tinctorius and two isolates of P. involutus. Colony area of P. involutus was increased by 452 and 414%, respectively, in the presence of turnip and cabbage germinants. Root exudates of turnip increased the biomass of P. involutus and P. tinctorius by 256 and 122% and cabbage by 220 and 82%, respectively. The stimulatory effect was not affected by autoclaving the root exudates. Root exudates had chemical reactions with glutathione and lysine, which resulted in a reduction of the growth stimulation of ECM fungi. Myrosinase enhanced further the stimulatory effects of turnip on the ECM colony diameter growth by 23%. Autoclaved roots and leaves of turnip did not stimulate fungal growth, but mechanically ground roots and leaves of turnip stimulated growth of P. involutus by 147 and 135%, respectively. After desulfuration with aryl sulphatase, the glucosinolates (GLSs) in turnip roots and leaves were identified by HPLC. The major ones were indole GLSs. Prominent compounds identified were 1-methoxy-3-indolymethyl GLS and 4-methoxy-3-indolymethyl GLS.

The species originated from contrasting environments (winter-wetland versus non-wetland habitats), and differed in abundance (endangered ironstone species versus common species). Waterlogging arrested growth of the main root system, and stimulated the formation of superficial adventitious roots just below the root/shoot junction in all species. Wetland species produced at least twice the amount of adventitious root dry mass of that of non-wetland species, due to differences in number, length or degree of branching. Their adventitious roots also tended to have higher porosities (7-10% versus 5-6% gas spaces). The relative amount of adventitious roots formed was strongly, positively correlated with the maintenance of shoot growth, and only the non-wetland species showed significant shoot growth reductions (19%) upon waterlogging. Dry mass percentage of stems and leaves, and leaf dry mass per area (LMA) increased considerably during waterlogging in all species (averages of 15, 29 and 27%, respectively), returning to the values of continuously drained control plants after drainage. Similarly, upon drainage, a suppression of shoot growth (average 35%) and a stimulation of root growth (average 50%) restored the root mass ratios to those of control plants. We found a negative correlation between the maintenance of growth during waterlogging versus that after waterlogging, suggesting a trade-off in functioning of the superficial adventitious roots between waterlogged and drained conditions. The rare winter-wet ironstone endemics resembled the common winter-wet species in most of their responses to waterlogging and drainage. Therefore, the results presented here cannot offer an explanation for their different distribution patterns. Our results suggest that non-wetland species may be disadvantaged in a wetland environment, due to their lower capacity to form adventitious roots resulting in stronger growth reductions.","Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Poot, P (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",,"Poot, Pieter/B-3457-2011; Lambers, Hans/A-1544-2008","Lambers, Hans/0000-0002-4118-2272; Poot, Pieter/0000-0001-7721-0696",,,,36,46,51,2,19,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2003,253,1,,,,,57,70,,10.1023/A:1024540621942,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,696VF,WOS:000183907700003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Falchini, L; Naumova, N; Kuikman, PJ; Bloem, J; Nannipieri, P",,,,"Falchini, L; Naumova, N; Kuikman, PJ; Bloem, J; Nannipieri, P",,,CO2 evolution and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of bacterial communities in soil following addition of low molecular weight substrates to simulate root exudation,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,root exudates; soil bacterial community; soil respiration; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis,SORBING COMPOUNDS; RHIZOSPHERE; PLANT; POPULATIONS; PRECIPITATION; RESPIRATION; DIVERSITY; DIFFUSION; KINETICS,"Simulating the evolution of both C-14 and C-12-CO2 in the rhizoplane was monitored during the diffusion of C-14-labelled glucose, oxalic acid, or glutamic acid into soil from a filter placed on the surface of a sandy loam. After 3 and 7 d, soil was sampled from four layers (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and 6-14 mm) to determine residual C-14 in each layer. The mineralisation pattern of oxalic acid was characterised by a lag phase probably due to the presence, in the early stages of exposure, of a few microorganisms able to mineralise this substrate. Glucose and glutamic acid showed a positive priming effect with a CO2 flush from native organic matter. Oxalic and glutamic acids changed the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of soil bacterial communities with the appearance of a few extra-bands in the 0-2 mm soil layer. The addition of the substrates onto the soil surface formed a gradient due to their diffusion in soil.

Total biomass for the stand was 176 Mg ha(-1), of which 74.4% was found in stems. The root system contained 12.6% of total biomass, most of it in coarse roots (> 5 mm). Fine roots (< 5 mm.) comprised only about 1.7% of total biomass, and more than 50% of fine root biomass was retrieved in the litter layer and the upper 15 cm. of the mineral soil. The ratio of belowground biomass to aboveground biomass was 0.14, which is lower than that of other Scots pine forests and other coniferous forests. Between 1995 and 2001, mean annual NPP was 11.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), of which 68.7% was allocated to aboveground compartments. Stems, needles and cones made relatively high contributions to total NPP compared with branches. However, branch NPP was possibly underestimated because litterfall of big branches was neglected. The proportion of total NPP in belowground components was 31.3%. Coarse root NPP (2% of total) was low compared with its biomass. Fine root NPP was 3.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), representing about 29.5% of total NPP; however, the estimate of fine root NPP is much more uncertain than NPP of aboveground compartments. The ratio NPP/GPP (gross primary production) was 0.32, which was low compared with other coniferous forests.","Minist Flemish Community, Inst Forestry & Game Management, IBW, B-9500 Geraardsbergen, Belgium; Univ Ghent, Lab Forestry, B-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium; Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Ceulemans, R (reprint author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Res Grp Plant & Vegetat Ecol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",rceulem@uia.ua.ac.be,"Carrara, Arnaud/L-8144-2014; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/A-6438-2011","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/0000-0002-3221-6960",,,,70,84,94,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,2003,23,8,,,,,505,516,,10.1093/treephys/23.8.505,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,685BH,WOS:000183240600001,12730042,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Diouf, D; Forestier, S; Neyra, M; Lesueur, D",,,,"Diouf, D; Forestier, S; Neyra, M; Lesueur, D",,,Optimisation of inoculation of Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium with rhizobium under greenhouse conditions,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia mangium; Leucaena leucocephala; rhizobium; size of inoculum; symbiosis,NITROGEN-FIXATION; CALLIANDRA-CALOTHYRSUS; SYMBIOTIC PERFORMANCE; INTRODUCED RHIZOBIA; GROWTH; NODULATION; BRADYRHIZOBIUM; LEGUMES; FIELD; SOIL,"Our work concerned the optimization of inoculation of two agroforestry species of woody leguminous plants: Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium with various strains of rhizobium. First, we showed that the physiological stage of the bacterial culture had no effect on nodulation and growth of the seedlings of Acacia mangium inoculated and cultivated in vitro for four months. For Leucaena leucocephala, the number of nodules was significantly higher when the seedlings were inoculated with a bacterial culture in stationary phase. On the other hand, whatever the species, no significant difference was noted with regards to the dry weight of the shoots. The effect of the size of inoculum on the nodulation and growth of the seedlings was studied in L. leucocephala after five months in a greenhouse. Our result show that an inoculation with bacterial cultures containing 10(9) to 10(10) bacteria per milliliter are the optimal conditions to have a maximum nodulation and growth of the seedlings. The two legume plant species showed significant differences with regard to the effect of the method of inoculation on nodulation and growth of the seedlings. For Acacia mangium, inoculation with a liquid culture one week after sowing was more favourable for the growth of the seedlings. On the other hand, for Leucaena leucocephala, this method of inoculation and the coating of seeds with a bacterial culture mixed with arabic gum improved significantly the growth of the seedlings. Results obtained in our study can be useful for the partners from developing countries involved in the large scale production of tree seedlings.","IRD, Lab Microbiol Sols, CIRAD Foret, Programme Arbres & Plantat, Dakar, Senegal; IRD, Lab Microbiol Sols, Unite Rech Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, Dakar, Senegal; Univ CA Diop, Dept Biol Vegetal, Lab Microbiol Sols, IRD, Dakar, Senegal","Lesueur, D (reprint author), IRD, Lab Microbiol Sols, CIRAD Foret, Programme Arbres & Plantat, BP 1386, Dakar, Senegal.",,,,,,,34,9,11,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

The last few years have seen molecular studies of a number of putative ancient asexual lineages, including bdelloid rotifers, Darwinulid ostracods, and mycorrhizal fungi. To help make sense of the diverse findings of such studies, we present a review and classification of the predicted effects of loss of sex on the eukaryotic genome. These include: (1) direct effects on the genetic structure of individuals and populations; (2) direct effects on the mutation rate due to the loss of the sexual phase; (3) decay of genes specific to sex and recombination; (4) effects of the cessation of sexual selection; (5) dis-adaptation due to the reduced efficiency of selection; and (6) adaptations to asexuality. We discuss the utility of the various predictions for detecting ancient asexuality, for testing hypotheses of the reversibility of a transition to asexuality, and for discriminating between theories of sex. In addition, we review the current status of putative ancient asexuals.

The amounts of N and N-15 in the seedlings and in microbial biomass derived from fumigation-extraction were measured 48 h after addition of N-15. In the mineral soil, 19-30% of the added N-15 was found in the plants and 14-20% in the microbial biomass. There were no statistically significant differences between the tree species. In the organic soil, 74% of the added N-15 was recovered in the microbial biomass in birch soil, compared to 26% and 17% in pine and spruce soils, respectively. Correspondingly, about 70% of the N-15 was recovered in pine and spruce seedlings, and only 23% in birch seedlings. In conclusion, plants generally competed more successfully for added (NH4+)-N-15 than soil microbes did.

Existing information on the effects of macrophytes on treatment performance is contradictory and mostly derived from greenhouse mesocosm experiments. This study investigated the removal efficiency of fecal bacteria, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) in 12 constructed wetlands treating secondary effluent from single household domestic wastewater in Kentucky. The wetlands were monoculture systems planted to cattails (Typha latifolia L.) or fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), polyculture systems planted with a variety of flowering plants, and unplanted systems. Influent and effluent samples were taken on a monthly basis over a period of I year and analyzed for fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), BOD and TSS. The findings suggested no significant differences (P < 0.05) in the average yearly removal of fecal bacteria ( > 93%) between systems, with the vegetated systems performing best during warmer months and the unplanted systems performing best during the winter. The vegetated systems showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) removal efficiencies for BOD ( > 75%) and TSS ( > 88%) than the implanted systems (63 and 46%, respectively) throughout the year. Overall, the polyculture systems seemed to provide the best and most consistent treatment for all wastewater parameters, while being least susceptible to seasonal variations. The performance of the cattail systems may improve by harvesting the plants at the end of the growing season, thus reducing additional BOD and TSS inputs from decaying biomass litter. The fescue systems were generally inferior to the polyculture and cattail systems because of their shallow rooting zone and limited biofilm surface area, while the unplanted systems were completely inefficient for BOD and TSS removal and should not be recommended.

Several studies in the past few years have focused on the effect of AMF on plant diversity, showing contradictory results. On the basis of studies carried out in grasslands, it has been proposed that these results may not be in conflict but rather depend on mycorrhizal dependence of dominant and subordinate species in the plant community. Here, we propose a simple conceptual model to explain the effect of AMF on plant diversity and dominance hierarchy. Our model suggests that the effect of AMF on plant diversity can be explained mainly by mycorrhizal dependence of subordinates. It also gives predictions for a wider range of community types, and helps in identifying the systems in which empirical data are most critically needed.","Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, FCEFyN, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Urcelay, C (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",,"Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018",,,,,23,79,98,2,48,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Barred from rearranging genetic variation by recombination, their reduced number of gene arrangements is thought to hamper their response to changing environments. For the same reason, it should be difficult for them to avoid the build-up of deleterious mutations. Several groups of taxonomically diverse organisms are thought to be ancient asexuals, although clear evidence for or against the existence of recombination events is scarce. Several methods have recently been developed for predicting recombination events by analyzing aligned sequences of a given region of DNA that all originate from one species. The methods are based on phylogenetic, substitution, and compatibility analyses. Here we present the results of analyses of sequence data from different loci studied in several groups of evolutionarily distant species that are considered to be ancient asexuals, using seven different types of analysis. The groups of organisms were the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomales), Daiwinula stevensoni (Darwinuloidea crustacean ostracods) and the bdelloid rotifers (Bdelloidea), which are thought to have been asexual for the last 400, 25-100, and 35-40 Myr, respectively. The seven different analytical methods evaluated the evolutionary relationships among haplotypes, and these methods had previously been shown to be reliable for predicting the occurrence of recombination events. Despite the different degree of genetic variation among the different groups of organisms, at least some evidence for recombination was found in all species groups. In particular, predictions of recombination events in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were frequent. Predictions of recombination were also found for sequence data that have previously been used to infer the absence of recombination in bdelloid rotifers. Although our results have to be taken with some caution because they could signal very ancient recombination events or possibly other genetic variation of nonrecombinant origin, they suggest that some cryptic recombination events may exist in these organisms.","Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Univ Lausanne, Inst Ecol, Lausanne, Switzerland","Gandolfi, A (reprint author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; Gandolfi, Andrea/A-3428-2012; MENOZZI, PAOLO/A-6234-2012; Rossi, Valeria/I-8112-2014","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Gandolfi, Andrea/0000-0002-7961-1431; MENOZZI, PAOLO/0000-0001-8638-7370; Rossi, Valeria/0000-0002-8346-4569",,,,40,41,43,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0737-4038,,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

An extensive literature review revealed an 88% probability of measuring a higher relative nitrification index (i.e. RNI = [NO3-] divided by [NO3- + NH4+]) in mineral soil horizons than in forest floors, across a wide range of conifer and hardwood ecosystems. We then hypothesised that humus form and fine root density could be used as two crude variables to predict changes in in situ, potential and relative nitrification rates. Twenty-seven trench plots were established in 1999, across nine contrasting hardwood and coniferous stands in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Forest floor and mineral soil samples were collected from each plot, and from a 1 m radius surrounding each plot, on three dates during summer 2000. In situ RNI values increased significantly in trench plots as the season progressed. Potential nitrification rates (i.e. NO3- concentrations following incubation) were two orders of magnitude higher in forest floor than in mineral soil samples. RNI was significantly higher in mineral soil than in forest floor samples after incubations, but the relative increase in RNI due to trenching was higher in forest floor samples. Indices of available C were significantly higher in forest floor than mineral soil samples, and decreased only in forest floor samples during incubations. Likewise, trenching significantly reduced available C in forest floor samples only. Seasonal changes in soil temperature and fine root growth were the most plausible explanations for seasonal changes in NO3- dynamics, whereas other factors such soil acidity and moisture appeared less important in determining NO3- dynamics in this study. We conclude that crude assessments of humus form and fine root density have the potential to be used as calibration parameters for the simulation of NO3- dynamics in forest growth and yield models.","Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Bradley, RL (reprint author), Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",,,,,,,84,14,14,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2003,252,2,,,,,367,384,,10.1023/A:1024773410874,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,701WK,WOS:000184191800017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fracchia, S; Godeas, A; Scervino, JM; Sampedro, I; Ocampo, JA; Garcia-Romera, I",,,,"Fracchia, S; Godeas, A; Scervino, JM; Sampedro, I; Ocampo, JA; Garcia-Romera, I",,,Interaction between the soil yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae and Gigaspora rosea,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Gigaspora rosea; Glomus mosseae; Rhodotorula mucilaginosa; soil yeast,SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; FUSARIUM-OXYSPORUM; GROWTH; INFECTION; COLONIZATION; INTRARADICES; RHIZOSPHERE; BACTERIA; PLANTS; ROOTS,"The effect of the soil yeast, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa LBA, on Glomus mosseae (BEG n(o)12) and Gigaspora rosea (BEG n(o)9) was studied in vitro and in greenhouse trials.

Beneficial effects of R. mucilaginosa on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization were found when the soil yeast was inoculated either as a thin agar slice or as a volume of 5 and 10 ml of an aqueous solution. R. mucilaginosa exudates (20 ml per pots) applied to soil increased significantly the percentage of AM colonization of soybean and red clover. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Karst.], Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris (L.)] and pubescent birch clones (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) were examined in open-top chambers after a 4-year-long experiment. The total biomass responses of the tree seedlings to increased CO2 and CO2+O-3 concentrations were not statistically significant and varied between the provenances and species. The seedlings of northern origin were the least sensitive in their response to treatments. The total biomass of the Norway spruce seedlings slightly decreased in response to CO2 in three provenances. Scots pine from the local provenance had a slight biomass increase after elevated CO2+O-3 treatment. The slower-growing birch clone seemed to benefit from elevated CO2, whereas in the faster-growing clone, reductions in biomass accumulation were seen. The combined CO2+O-3 treatment reduced the positive effects of elevated CO2, especially in the slower-growing birches. Observations of significant effects were limited to a few parameters. Carbon dioxide treatment decreased needle dry weight of Norway spruce in one northern provenance. The needle and wood dry weight increased (CO2 + O-3) in local Scots pine. Significant birch response was limited to increased fine root density (O-3 + CO2) in the inland clone. The diverse effects of elevated CO2 and CO2 + O-3 on seedling growth and biomass provide evidence that exposure of northern trees to the enhanced variable CO2 and O-3 concentrations of the future will have varied effects on the growth of these species. The direction and magnitude of those effects will differ depending on species and origins.","Oulu Univ, Dept Biol Bot, Oulu 90014, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Huttunen, S (reprint author), Oulu Univ, Dept Biol Bot, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland.",,"Back, Jaana K/A-7405-2010","Back, Jaana K/0000-0002-6107-667X",,,,58,11,12,0,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

In a few cases, such plants have been shown to be epiparasitic because they obtain carbon from neighbouring green plants through shared mycorrhizal fungi. In all such cases, the epiparasitic plants have been found to specialize upon narrow lineages of ecto- or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Here we show that a non-vascular plant, the non-photosynthetic liverwort Cryptothallus mirabilis, is epiparasitic and is specialized on Tulasnella species that form ectomycorrhizae with surrounding trees at four locations in England, France and Portugal. By using microcosm experiments we show that the interaction with Tulasnella is necessary for growth of Cryptothallus, and by using labelling experiments we show that (CO2)-C-14 provided to birch seedlings is transferred to Cryptothallus by Tulasnella. This is one of the first documented cases of epiparasitism by a non-vascular plant and of ectomycorrhizal formation by Tulasnella. These results broaden the emerging association between epiparasitism and mycorrhizal specialization into a new class of plants and a new order of fungi.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Tubingen, Spezielle Bot & Mykol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; CEBV, Museu & Fardim Bot, P-1250102 Lisbon, Portugal; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Bidartondo, MI (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",martinb@nature.berkeley.edu,"Sergio, Cecilia/M-4718-2013; Read, David/C-2454-2013; WeiSS, Michael/F-6206-2012","Sergio, Cecilia/0000-0001-5145-5329; WeiSS, Michael/0000-0002-4869-9186",,,,52,103,112,0,22,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The sampling sites were classified and grouped according to the following soil type: Leptosols, weathered soils (Ferralsols, Acrisols, Lixisols and Nitosols), Luvisols and Cambisols/Phaeozems. Likewise, they were classified in the following groups with respect to land use/land cover (LU/LC): oak-evergreen cloud forest, fragmented forest, pine and pine-oak forest, and open land (cultivated land and pasture). No clear influence of soil-type grouping on amounts of SOC was revealed, between soil-type groups (soil type). The weathered soils had higher amounts of SOC and RC in the upper 50 cm than the other soil types and the lowest amounts of SOC and RC in the 50100 cm layers. The LU/LC groups showed marked differences in amounts of SOC. Open land had between 20 and 60% less soil carbon than the different types of forests. Oak-evergreen cloud forest had the largest amounts of SOC at all depths. The differences in amounts of carbon (SOC and RC) between oak-evergreen cloud forest and the other LU/LC classes were proportionally larger in the 50-100 cm layer. This suggests that the amounts of SOC in deep soil layers may be influenced by changes in LU/LC. The considerably smaller amounts of SOC and RC 174 and 38.5 Mg ha(-1), and 31 and 24.8 Mg ha(-1), exhibited in open land compared to oak-evergreen cloud forest and pine and pine-oak forests, respectively, suggest that conversion of forests to open land reduces SOC and RC. Despite the magnitude of the differences, evaluation with ANOVA (nested design) did not reveal a statistically significant influence of LU/LC. The large spatial variability in amounts of soil carbon prevented precise estimates. Changes induced by a gradient in altitude among the plots may have contributed to the large variability between the plots. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The biomass and morphology of coarse root components were studied for 3- and 4-year-old Pinus radiata clonal and seedling trees growing with or without lucerne (Medicago sativa). Root:shoot ratio and lateral and vertical root biomass were greater by 1.5, 2.3 and 6.1 times, respectively, in clonal than in seedling trees, particularly in the no understory treatment compared to the lucerne treatment. Fractional allocation of root biomass to lateral and vertical roots was higher in clonal than in seedling trees by 1.1 and 2.6 times, respectively, while allocation to the root core was 1.4-times higher in the seedlings than the clone. Competition from lucerne reduced fractional allocation of root biomass to lateral roots by 40% in the seedling tree in 1993 and increased allocation to the root core. Competition was more intense at age 3 than at 4 years. No competition effect on lateral roots was observed with the clonal trees. Radiata pine root systems showed strong morphological plasticity to respond to changing soil conditions. Ripping coupled with thinning increased lateral root growth in the ripped zone so that by age 4 years 60% of lateral roots was in this zone. This was probably due to alterations in soil structure and reduced competition, particularly for moisture. Similarly higher soil moisture led to more lateral root biomass growth in the no understory compared to the lucerne treatment and on the south side of the trees compared to the north side. These results illustrated that selection of genotypes and planting material as well as management techniques such as soil cultivation, selection and placement of pasture understory, and thinning can all be used to manipulate rooting patterns and tree productivity in agroforestry systems. Furthermore, selection of planting material can also be used to reduce tree toppling in radiata pine.

The percentage infection of barley roots and the spore numbers decreased proportionally with increasing Cd concentration in soil. However, the S2 inoculum showed the highest capacity to colonise the barley roots. This inoculum also created the best biotic barrier against the movement of Cd from the roots to the shoot in the T2 soil. In the T1 soil, the SI and S2 inocula were less efficient than the S0 inoculum, probably because the level of soil pollution was not sufficiently high for any difference to be seen.

A significant fraction of plant photosynthetic carbon may be used by these associated microorganisms, both to support their beneficial activities and for microbial growth and reproduction. Because many microbial individuals are associated with each individual plant, the individual benefit to a microbe that allocates more resources to its own reproduction (thereby allocating less to fixing N-2, supplying P, or producing antifungal metabolites) would exceed its individual loss from any resulting reduction in collective benefits (mainly plant carbon substrates). An initially rare ""free rider"" mutant strain might therefore be expected to displace its more cooperative parental strain. Yet, the mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium mutualisms have persisted (often coexisting with ""cheating"") for millions of years. This paper discusses the importance of microbial cooperation (with plants and with other microbes) and possible reasons for its evolutionary persistence in the rhizosphere. In undisturbed soils, spatial structure can favor kin selection, but this may be counterbalanced by the increased likelihood that future competitors will be among the beneficiaries of current cooperation. In loose associations, direct fitness benefits to microorganisms may explain the evolutionary persistence of activities (e.g., production of antifungal compounds) that can benefit plants as a side effect. In closer, more symbiotic, relationships, host sanctions against individuals or clones that fail to perform their symbiotic function may be more important. New molecular methods and other research tools are facilitating research on this topic, and some of these conclusions soon may be revised.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Microbiol, Cork, Ireland; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Washington State Univ, USDA ARS, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Denison, RF (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,"Kahn, Michael/0000-0002-5204-561X",,,,73,52,58,6,65,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2003,84,4,,,,,838,845,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0838:CITRAT]2.0.CO;2,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,677NC,WOS:000182813600004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kytoviita, MM; Vestberg, M; Tuom, J",,,,"Kytoviita, MM; Vestberg, M; Tuom, J",,,A test of mutual aid in common mycorrhizal networks: Established vegetation negates benefit in seedlings,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; common mycorrhizal network; competition; Glomus claroideum; Glomus hoi; seedling growth; Sibbaldia procumbens; subarctic herbs; symbiotic benefit,PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; CARBON TRANSFER; FUNGI; COMPETITION; PHOSPHORUS; INFECTION; DIVERSITY; GRASSES,"By acquiring symbiosis from the mycelium supported by neighboring plants, seedlings become connected to a common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Although the maintenance of a CMN may lead to mutual benefit among the neighboring plants, the benefits may be unequally distributed if the plants differ in their sink strength for the shared resources in the CMN. Hence, seedlings may not obtain any net benefit from a CMN maintained by competitively superior, mature plants. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, we showed that the presence of a mycorrhizal adult plant does not improve the growth of seedlings, although solitary seedlings benefit from mycorrhizae. Seedlings of the perennial, mycorrhizal, subarctic herbs Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Solidago virgaurea were germinated alone or in the vicinity of an adult established Sibbaldia plant. The seedlings were either left nonmycorrhizal (NM) or were inoculated by spores or by a hyphal network connected to established Sibbaldia plants. Three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were involved: Glomus claroideum, G. hoi, or an undescribed Glomus sp. isolate. In the absence of an adult Sibbaldia plant, the plant species responded differently to each AMF species, of which G. claroideum was most infective and most improved the growth of solitary seedlings. In NM seedlings grown alternatively with or without a NM adult plant, competition had no or only weakly adverse effects on seedling growth. Interestingly, the situation was the same in seedlings grown with a mycorrhizal adult plant: although heavily infected, seedlings did not show improved growth as compared to NM seedlings. A common mycorrhizal network may well imply some mutual aid for the connected plants, but competitive interactions within the CMN overwhelm any benefits.","Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; MTT Agrifood Res Finland, FIN-41330 Vihtavuori, Finland","Kytoviita, MM (reprint author), Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, Linnanma PL 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",minna-maarit.kytoviita@oulu.fi,,"Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit/0000-0002-8928-6951",,,,39,72,79,1,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2003,84,4,,,,,898,906,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0898:ATOMAI]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,677NC,WOS:000182813600011,,,,,10/31/19J,"O'Connell, KEB; Gower, ST; Norman, JM",,,,"O'Connell, KEB; Gower, ST; Norman, JM",,,Comparison of net primary production and light-use dynamics of two boreal black spruce forest communities,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,boreal black spruce forests; net primary production; light-use efficiency; Saskatchewan,JACK PINE; ROOT PRODUCTION; WATER-CONTENT; FINE ROOTS; CARBON; TURNOVER; NORTHERN; BIOMASS; MOSS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) is the most dominant forest ecosystem in the North American boreal region.

The objectives of this study were (a) to compare net primary production (NPP) and light-use efficiency (LUE) for the two contrasting black spruce communities, and (b) to quantify the contribution of different vegetation strata (bryophytes, understory, overstory, and belowground) to total NPP and LUE in a mature black spruce forest stand in central Saskatchewan, Canada.Total NPP for the BSFM community (446 g biomass m(-2) y(-1)) was significantly greater (P = 0.04) than the BSSP community (276 g biomass m(-2) y(-1)). Bryophyte and understory NPP together comprised the greatest fraction of total (overstory, understory, bryopbytes, and belowground) NPP in the BSSP community (51%), whereas overstory NPP comprised the largest fraction of total NPP (86%) for the BSFM community. Overstory LUE was similar (P = 0.87) for the two communities (0.20-0.21 g MJ(-1) annual absorbed photosynthetic active radiation [APAR]), but ecosystem LUE was significantly greater (P = 0.03) for the BSFM community (0.20 g MJ(-1) annual APAR) than the BSSP community (0.15 g MJ(-1) annual APAR).

The rhizobial population size varied from undetectable numbers to 1.8 x 10(4) cells/g of soil depending on the trap host and the soil. Calliandra calothyrsus was the most promiscuous legume, nodulating in eight soils, while S. sesban nodulated in only one of the soils. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes were used to assess the diversity and relative abundance of rhizobia trapped from seven of the soils by C. calothyrsus , G. sepium and L. leucocephala . Representatives of the 16S rRNA RFLP groups were also subjected to sequence analysis of the first 950 base pairs of the 16S rRNA gene. Eighty ITS groups were obtained, with none of the ITS types being sampled in more than one soil. RFLP analysis of the 16S rRNA yielded 23 'species' groups distributed among the Rhizobium , Mesorhizobium , Sinorhizobium and Agrobacterium branches of the rhizobial phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny of the isolates was independent of the site or host of isolation, with different rhizobial groups associated with each host across the soils from widely separated geographical regions. Although rhizobial populations in soils sampled from the centre of diversity of the host legumes were the most genetically diverse, soil acidity was highly correlated with the diversity of ITS types. Our results support the hypothesis that the success of these tree legumes in soils throughout the tropics is the result of their relative promiscuity (permissiveness) allowing nodulation with diverse indigenous rhizobial types.","Univ London Wye Coll, Imperial Coll Wye, Ashford TN25 5AH, Kent, England; Fed Univ Technol, Minna, Nigeria; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Plant Prod Syst, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands","Giller, KE (reprint author), Univ London Wye Coll, Imperial Coll Wye, Ashford TN25 5AH, Kent, England.",,"Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012","Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652",,,,40,56,63,0,17,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Root elongation and viability staining of root tip cells were used as indicators for Cu resistance. The Cu resistance increased in the order Cadriano<Prinzera<Vigonzano. Renewal of the root cap in Prinzera and enhanced border cell production in Vigonzano in response to excess Cu provided a more efficient protection of the root tip meristem than in Cu sensitive Cadriano. The enhanced Cu resistance in Prinzera could not be attributed to high soil Cu acting as a natural selection factor at the serpentine site. In Prinzera Cu exclusion from roots and shoots probably was a consequence of root impermeabilization causing reduced radial water and ion flux in roots. In contrast, the high Cu resistance in the mine spoil ecotype, Vigonzano, was due to both reduced Cu uptake and higher tissue tolerance of Cu.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencias, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Geol Ambientali, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","Barcelo, J (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencias, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",,"C., Poschenrieder/C-7160-2008; Llugany, Merce/A-5440-2013; dinelli, enrico/G-6532-2012","Llugany, Merce/0000-0002-9940-0383; dinelli, enrico/0000-0002-3870-544X",,,,39,38,44,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2003,251,1,,,,,55,63,,10.1023/A:1022990525632,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,660DQ,WOS:000181818900006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kishinevsky, BD; Nandasena, KG; Yates, RJ; Nemas, C; Howieson, JG",,,,"Kishinevsky, BD; Nandasena, KG; Yates, RJ; Nemas, C; Howieson, JG",,,"Phenotypic and genetic diversity among rhizobia isolated from three Hedysarum species: H-spinosissimum, H-coronarium and H-flexuosum",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,clustering; Hedysarum spp.; Rhizobium; 16S rRNA gene sequencing,16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; CICER-ARIETINUM-L; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; SEQUENCES; LEGUMINOSARUM; PHOSPHATE; SELECTION; BACTERIA; MELILOTI,"Cultural, physiological and biochemical properties of 18 strains of rhizobia isolated from root nodules of the forage legume H. spinosissimum were compared with those of rhizobia from the related species H. coronarium (15 strains) and H. flexuosum (four strains).

The strains tested exhibit a high degree of specificity for nodulation and nitrogen fixation. We also determined the 16SrRNA gene sequence of H. spinosissimum rhizobia (four strains), H. coronarium (two strains) and H. flexuosum (two strains) and found that the four H. spinosissimum isolates share a 98% identity among each other in this region but they showed less than 92% identity to the H. coronarium and H. flexuosum isolates.

Also evaluated was the relationship between the spatial distribution of spores and AM plant distribution and soil properties. A nested sampling scheme was applied in both sites with sample cores taken from nested grids. Spores of AMF and soil characteristics (organic matter and moisture) were quantified in each core, and core sample location was related to plant location. Semivariograms for spore density indicated strong spatial autocorrelation and a patchy distribution within both sites for all AM fungal genera found. However, the patch size differed between the two plant communities and AM fungal genera. In the salt marsh, AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with distance to AM plants and projected stand area of AM plants. In maquis, spatial AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with organic matter. These results suggest that spore distribution of AMF varied between the two plant communities according to plant distribution and soil properties.","Fac Ciencias Lisboa, Dept Biol Vegetal, Ctr Ecol & Biol Vegetal, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; Utah State Univ, Dept Forest Range & Wildlife Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Carvalho, LM (reprint author), Fac Ciencias Lisboa, Dept Biol Vegetal, Ctr Ecol & Biol Vegetal, Bloco C2,Campo Grande, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Ryel, Ronald/A-3422-2008; Martins-Loucao, Maria Amelia/H-1994-2011; Carvalho, Luis M/A-8820-2010","Martins-Loucao, Maria Amelia/0000-0002-5883-2462; Carvalho, Luis M/0000-0003-4918-6160",,,,41,43,48,0,23,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2003,251,2,,,,,227,236,,10.1023/A:1023016317269,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,663LM,WOS:000182007100005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bouma, TJ; Hengst, K; Koutstaal, BP; van Soelen, J",,,,"Bouma, TJ; Hengst, K; Koutstaal, BP; van Soelen, J",,,Estimating root lifespan of two grasses at contrasting elevation in a salt marsh by applying vitality staining on roots from in-growth cores,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,root diameter; root lifespan; root turnover; specific root length; tidal marsh; tissue density,SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; PLANT ZONATION; SOIL; ECOSYSTEM; DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; TURNOVER; AERATION; PATCHES; CARBON,"Contrasting soil conditions caused by different inundation frequencies require different root growth strategies along the elevational gradient of coastal salt marshes. The objective of this study was to examine (1) if root lifespan was shorter in Elymus pycnanthus, a relatively fast-growing competitive species dominating high marshes, than in Spartina anglica, a relatively slow-growing stress-tolerating species dominating low marshes, and (2) if the species with longer lifespan had higher tissue density (g cm(-3)) and lower specific root length (m g(-1)) than the species with shorter lifespan. Root production and mortality rates were established by sampling roots in in-growth cores, and using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to distinguish vital from dead roots. Root lifespan was estimated by dividing the living root biomass (Elymus: 36 g m(-2), Spartina: 100 g m(-2)) by root production (Elymus: 0.28 g day(-1) m(-2), Spartina: 0.25 g day(-1) m(-2)) or root mortality rates (Elymus: 0.42-0.53 g day(-1) m(-2)). Spartina did not exhibit substantial mortality. Despite the present method only yielding rough estimates of average root lifespan, it is evident that root longevity is much shorter in Elymus than in Spartina. Root lifespan ranged between 10-19 weeks for Elymus but was close to 1 year in Spartina, indicating that Elymus replaces it's roots continuously throughout the growing season, whereas Spartina maintains its roots over the growing season. Fine roots of Elymus had slightly lower tissue density (0.094) than those of Spartina (0.139), whereas coarse roots of Elymus and Spartina had similar tissue density (0.100 g cm(-3)). Fine roots of Elymus and Spartina had similar specific root length (195 m g(-1)). However, coarse roots of Elymus (50 m g(-1)) had higher specific root length than those of Spartina (20 m g(-1)) due to having smaller root diameter (Elymus: 548 mum, Spartina: 961 mum). We conclude that present observations on Elymus and Spartina support our first hypothesis that the 'competitive' species from the high marsh had short-lived roots compared to the 'stress-tolerating' species from the low marsh. However, our result provide only weak support for the existence of a positive correlation between root longevity and tissue density and a negative correlation between root longevity and specific root length.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands","Bouma, TJ (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands.",,"Bouma, Tjeerd/A-9841-2011",,,,,53,5,5,2,26,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2003,165,2,,,,,235,245,,10.1023/A:1022290530303,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,641NJ,WOS:000180750600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Burke, DJ; Hamerlynck, EP; Hahn, D",,,,"Burke, DJ; Hamerlynck, EP; Hahn, D",,,"Interactions between the salt marsh grass Spartina patens, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and sediment bacteria during the growing season",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,diversity; in situ hybridization; mycorrhizas; nitrogen-fixation; rRNA; salt marsh; Spartina patens,NONMYCORRHIZAL CONTROL; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; RHIZOSPHERE; SOIL; CARBON; COMMUNITIES; ALTERNIFLORA; POPULATIONS; ALLOCATION,"The interaction between the salt marsh plant Spartina patens, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and bacteria in salt marsh sediment was examined in a long-term arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) suppression study by applying the systemic fungicide benomyl to field-collected sediment cores with and without S. patens plants. Microbial populations were sampled four times corresponding to major plant phenological stages (dormancy, vegetative growth, reproduction, and senescence) previously linked to changes in microbial populations under field conditions. Benomyl-treatment of soil cores significantly suppressed AM colonization on S. patens, keeping values relatively consistent throughout the growing season (11.5%) whereas plants in non-treated cores I experienced seasonal increases and declines in AM colonization (26.6% during vegetative growth to 11.5% during dormancy). Soil physicochemical parameters were not affected by benomyl application. In unvegetated cores, no benomyl- or seasonal effects were displayed by cell numbers and specific biomass of DAPI-stained organisms, members of the domain bacteria and here especially members of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-subdivisions of proteobacteria that were the most abundant bacterial groups. In vegetated cores, the microbial community as well as specific bacterial populations were at least twice as large in terms of number and biomass than in samples from unvegetated cores with significant seasonal changes for DAPI-stained cells, for members of the domain bacteria and for members of the alpha- and gamma-subdivisions of proteobacteria. In benomyl-treated cores, the population of gamma-subdivision of proteobacteria was significantly smaller than in non-treated cores, and a positive association was found between this bacterial group and root length colonized by AM suggesting that AM-suppression can affect populations of specific soil bacterial populations in salt marsh sediment. Benomyl-treatment had no effect on the diversity of N-fixing bacteria as evidenced by PCR-RFLP analysis, but seasonal changes were noted in vegetated cores with populations during active plant growth substantially different from populations during dormancy and senescence.

Hirugatake, Tanzawa Mountains, Kanto district, Japan, where serious forest decline had been observed since the 1970s for broadleaved deciduous trees. The selection of the study sites under different degrees of forest decline was based on the interpretation of vegetation changes in aerial photographs taken in 1947, 1967, 1977, and 1993, and also on vegetation surveys at and around the selected sites. The results obtained were as follows. The soil profile morphology was similar among the study sites in terms of depth, sequence, and content of scoria fragments in each horizon. However, with the disappearance of tree layers of Fagus crenata and associated trees, the thickness of the 0 horizon had decreased and the distribution of medium to coarse roots had also decreased, especially at the advanced stage of forest decline. The increase in the hardness of the surface soils and the decrease in the soil organic matter content tended to occur at the very early stage of forest decline. As for the changes in the chemical properties of the soil samples associated with forest decline, the pH and contents of exchangeable bases did not show a definite tendency while the content of exchangeable Al seemed to decrease, especially for the A horizon. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the acidification of soils was the major factor responsible for forest decline in the study area, in contrast to the results obtained in investigations of forest decline areas conducted in Europe.","Univ Tsukuba, Inst Appl Biochem, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; Univ Tsukuba, Masters Program Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; Univ Tsukuba, Doctoral Program Agr Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; Univ Tsukuba, Coll Agrobiol Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan","Higashi, T (reprint author), Univ Tsukuba, Inst Appl Biochem, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",,,,,,,22,7,7,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Through the peribacteroid space (PBS) between the PBM and bacteroids, metabolic substances and signal compounds are exchanged between two symbionts. In this study, organic compounds with low molecular weight in the PBS were collected from isolated symbiosomes of soybean (Glycine max L.) root nodules, and their composition was analyzed and compared with that of the organic compounds in whole root nodules and bacteroids. Major differences were detected in the molar percentages of amino and organic acids, and sugars, to the total low molecular weight organic compounds among whole root nodules, PBS, and bacteroids. The PBS composition was characterized by abundant sugars and poor amino acids. Also the composition of the amino acids, organic acids, and sugars in the PBS was clearly different from that in whole root nodules and bacteroids. The PBS sugar composition was characterized by the predominance of inositols, especially myo-inositol at the 5th and 7th weeks of the host plant growth stages. Changes in the myo- and D-chiro-inositol balance at the host plant growth stages occurred and a syntony was observed between the PBS and bacteroids. The localization of myo-inositol in the PBS accounted for almost 70% of the total myo-inositol in root nodules. A small difference in the PBS composition between two soybean cultivars was recorded but it varied with the growth stages. It was tentatively concluded that the PBS sugar composition affected the bacteroidal sugar composition in soybean plants, and that inositol utilization in the bacteroids could be a factor controlling the bacteroidal function level which varied with the host plant growth stages.","Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan","Tejima, K (reprint author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.",,"yokoyama, tadashi/G-1095-2013",,,,,27,7,7,0,3,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

A negative relationship between percent seed germination and salt concentration was obtained. Seedlings did not emerge when soil salinity exceeded 10.6 dS m(-1). Results suggested that this tree species is salt tolerant at the seed germination stage. Seedlings survived and grew up to soil salinity of 10.6 dS m(-1) and eventually this species is salt tolerant at the seedling stage too. Elongation of stem and root was retarded by increasing salt stress. However, this species has a tendency for rapid root penetration and roots are able to extract water from very dry saline soil (6.8% moisture). Among the tissues, young roots and stem were most tolerant to salt stress and were followed by leaf and old roots successively. Production of young roots and death of old roots were found to be continuous and plants apparently use this process as an avoidance mechanism to remove excess ions and delay onset of ion accumulation in this tissue. This phenomenon, designated ""fine root turnover"" assumes an importance to the mechanisms of salt tolerance. The ability of this plant to thrive in dry regions is further conferred by the xeromorphic features of its leaves. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sampling covered a range of ages (1-47-year-old), sizes (e.g. DBH 0-47 cm) and spacings (close- and open-spaced arrangements). Equations were developed to predict biomass and carbon mass of whole-trees and tree components (stems, crowns, tops and roots) as functions of stem diameter (DBH), tree height (h) and height to crown base (h(c)) or basal stem diameter (d(10)) of small trees. One equation was sufficient to predict biomass (or carbon mass) of both close- and open-spaced trees as a function of DBH and h(c). For developing prediction equations a weighted non-linear (WNL) model was always best if DBH was included in the predictor variables. Either a log-transformed allometric (LTA) model or the WNL model were best for predictions as a function of d(10), but a weighted combined variable (WCV) model was never best. Root:shoot (R:S) ratio decreased with increasing tree size in both close- and open-spaced trees but was higher in open-spaced trees than close-spaced trees of the same size. From literature review, we conclude that increased partitioning of biomass to roots in open-spaced stands may be due to increased light availability or, more likely, more pronounced root thickening on open-spaced trees in response to greater mechanical stress from wind sway.

Root phenology and ontogeny are depicted, and the biological responses of the roots to adverse growing conditions appraised. Norway spruce is regarded as a species which is able to grow under a wide range of soil physical and chemical conditions, provided sufficient soil aeration is guaranteed. The root system of spruce is however sensitive to any dislocation of its primary taproot. Nursery handling and planting damage often affect the root system development of the young tree. Soil acidity and Al-toxicity represent other significant restraints to root growth of spruce. Rooting patterns and mycorrhizal communities are influenced by atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and acidity. Root system spread is closely related to the tree's competitive status in the forest stand and responds to forest management practices. The preference of Norway spruce roots for humus-rich soil horizons and patches is repeatedly reported. Though, a general characterisation of P abies as a primary 'surface-rooter' has been disproved. Different structures and functions of long and short roots can be identified. Periodic shedding of small and fibrous root structures is a natural phenomenon and is influenced by ambient (i.e. climatic) conditions. Nonetheless, adverse growing conditions result in an increased frequency of adventitious root formation. Permanent root system damage will occur when such root replacement strategies fail. The resulting occurrence of root derangement points and the loss of ramification orders, advances from the fine- to the coarse-root structures. The result is an irregular arrangement of the structural root system, with increasing frequency of damaged roots and disturbance of the root system symmetry. Damaged coarse roots are characterised by discolouration following decay. A damage class scheme for Norway, spruce that depicts general stages of root system vitality and decay is provided. The work illustrates that root parameters are good indicators of the sustainability of forest sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Plants of high altitude sites have low N concentrations in both their leaves and roots, have thick leaves and roots, yet no differences in tissue density or photosynthetic water use efficiency when compared to plants of low altitude sites. Both the leaves and roots of the low altitude plants were enriched in N-15 relative to the plants of higher altitude, indicating that the low-N set of traits is associated with a more closed N cycle at high altitude. A second independent set of correlations shows that plants of wetter habitats have lower photosynthetic water use efficiency (more negative partial derivative(13)C) and lower leaf and root tissue density than the plants of drier sites. For both leaves and roots, plants of native species consistently had traits associated with lower resource availability: lower N concentrations, denser tissues, more negative partial derivative(15)N, and more positive partial derivative(13)C than non-native species. If root %N is correlated with root longevity as has been shown in other systems, root longevity may be able to be predicted from simple measurements of leaf %N, though a hysteresis in the relationship between leaf and root N concentrations may make prediction of high longevity roots difficult.","Landcare Res, Dunedin, New Zealand","Craine, JM (reprint author), Landcare Res, Private Mail Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand.",,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244",,,,39,100,144,5,80,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2003,134,4,,,,,471,478,,10.1007/s00442-002-1155-6,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,655ZD,WOS:000181582700003,12647118,,,,10/31/19J,"Burke, MK; Chambers, J",,,,"Burke, MK; Chambers, J",,,Root dynamics in bottomland hardwood forests of the Southeastern United States Coastal Plain,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,bottomland hardwood; flooding; oak; NPP; root dynamics; turnover,SIMULATION APPROACH; IMAGINARY PROBLEM; SWAMP FOREST; FINE; ECOSYSTEMS; TURNOVER; OVERESTIMATION; ALLOCATION; PATTERNS; ERROR,"Effects of flooding on root dynamics appear nonlinear and therefore difficult to predict, leading to disparate and often contradictory reports of flooding impacts on production in bottomland hardwood forests. We explored root dynamics in two adjacent wetland habitats by comparing results obtained from several methods of estimating root processes. Also, we tested the influence of flooding on root dynamics of cherrybark, overcup, water and swamp chestnut oaks. Fine root biomass in the laurel oak habitat was greater (a < 0.05) than in the swamp tupelo habitat (5.7 vs. 2.4 Mg ha(-1)), as was fine root necromass (2.4 vs. 1.3 Mg ha(-1)), productivity (2.3 vs. 0.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) when the sum of significant increments method was used, 5.6 vs. 2.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) when the maximum minus minimum method was used, and 1.2 vs. 1.0 Mg ha-1 yr-1, when the root screen method was used), and turnover (40% and 12% per year). Mortality estimates were lower in the laurel oak habitat (1.3 and 1.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in the swamp tupelo community (2.8 and 2.1 Mg ha-1 yr-1) when significant increment and maximum minus minimum methods were used, respectively. This apparent contradiction between estimates of production and mortality may be due to more rapid decomposition rates in the more aerated soil of the laurel oak than in the swamp tupelo forest type. Roots in the swamp tupelo habitat appeared to be longer-lived than in the laurel oak habitat. We concluded that there was greater investment in roots in the laurel oak habitat, where a shallow rooting zone and episodes of flooding and drought required drastic changes in root structure and physiology. In contrast, the swamp tupelo habitat had a deeper rooting zone and more consistently moist to flooded hydroperiod, allowing flood adapted roots to persist. The four oak species varied in their phenology of root production and response to flooding, from no difference among treatments for overcup oak to dramatic reductions in root growth during and after flooding for cherrybark oak. Flooding enhanced or at least did not negatively influence root growth in overcup oak, but seriously impacted root growth and survival of cherrybark oak and swamp chestnut oak. Different responses were attributed to the timing of root production: root growth began early for cherrybark oak so spring flooding severely affected this species. Growth in overcup oak began later and ended earlier than the other species tested, allowing the species a means of avoiding flood stress.","US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Ctr Forested Wetlands Res, Charleston, SC 29414 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Louisiana Agr Expt Stn, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Burke, MK (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Ctr Forested Wetlands Res, 2730 Savannah Highway, Charleston, SC 29414 USA.",mburke@fs.fed.us,,,,,,51,19,19,0,17,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2003,250,1,,,,,141,153,,10.1023/A:1022848303010,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,658XJ,WOS:000181746100014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dechassa, N; Schenk, MK; Claassen, N; Steingrobe, B",,,,"Dechassa, N; Schenk, MK; Claassen, N; Steingrobe, B",,,"Phosphorus efficiency of cabbage (Brassica oleraceae L. var. capitata), carrot (Daucus carota L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,cabbage; carrot; morphological root characteristics; observed and predicted P uptake; phosphorus efficiency; potato,ROOT HAIRS; SOIL; PLANTS; ACQUISITION; FIELD; AVAILABILITY; SIMULATION; ADAPTATION; DIFFUSION; MODEL,"Plant species and genotypes within the same species may differ in phosphorus efficiency. The objective of this research was to study phosphorus efficiency of cabbage (Brassica oleraceae L.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and to quantify the contribution of morphological root characteristics to P uptake of the plant species. An experiment was conducted in a glasshouse with six P levels: 0, 12, 27, 73, 124 and 234 mg P kg(-1) soil, and with six replications. Cabbage attained 80% of its maximum yield already at the level of no P supply, whereas carrot and potato reached only 4 and 16% of their highest yields respectively at this level of P supply. This indicated that cabbage was P-efficient compared to carrot and potato. Root/shoot ratio (cm root g(-1) shoot d. m.) increased in the order of cabbage < carrot < potato, and was enhanced at lower P levels. Root hair length was not affected by P level, and averaged 0.22, 0.03 and 0.18 mm for cabbage, carrot, and potato, respectively. Predicting P uptake by a mechanistic simulation model revealed that root hairs contributed about 50% to the total P uptake of cabbage and potato, but only 0.3% to that of carrot. The relationship between the observed P uptake and the predicted P uptake of the plants revealed that model parameters explained nearly 4/5th of the total P uptake of carrot and potato, but only 2/5th of that of cabbage. This showed that the P uptake of cabbage was strongly under-predicted, whereas that of carrot and potato was predicted well. Therefore, it was hypothesised that cabbage may have the ability to mobilise and take up soil P additionally by other root mechanisms such as exudation of organic acids.","Univ Hannover, Inst Pflanzenernahrung, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; Alemaya Univ Agr, Dept Plant Sci, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Chem, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Schenk, MK (reprint author), Univ Hannover, Inst Pflanzenernahrung, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany.",schenk@mbox.pflern.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,44,64,68,3,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2003,250,2,,,,,215,224,,10.1023/A:1022804112388,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,658XP,WOS:000181746600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kemp, E; Adam, P; Ashford, AE",,,,"Kemp, E; Adam, P; Ashford, AE",,,Seasonal changes in hair roots and mycorrhizal colonization in Woollsia pungens (Cav.)

Based on the patterns of root system structure and resource utilization, the species we examined could be classified as 1) legumes, 2) high-nitrogen rhizomatous C-3 species, and 3) a separate gradient of differentiation from tall- to short-statured species (i.e. tallgrass to shortgrass species). Legumes depleted water evenly throughout the soil profile, with little capacity for acquisition of inorganic nitrogen throughout the 1m soil profile. The three rhizomatous species had shallow fine root distributions, a large relative investment in shallow rhizomes, and moisture and NO3- levels were low in shallow soils, but high at depth. Tallgrass species maintained a large standing root biomass of high-density, low-nitrogen fine roots, and acquire nitrogen and water from a large, deep volume of soil, in which inorganic nitrogen is present in low concentrations. Root systems of shortgrass species lacked coarse belowground biomass, had fine roots that were finer than those of the tallgrass species, and had a shallow root distribution. There was little support for functional dichotomies between the C-3 and C-4 species or between the grasses and forbs. For example, Solidago rigida (C-3 forb) and Andropogon gerardii (C-4 grass) were more similar to each other than to other C-3 forbs or C-4 grasses, respectively. Across all species and depths examined, there were strong relationships between the amount of fine root biomass present in a unit of volume of soil and the depletion of soil water and nitrogen, but there were no relationships with coarse belowground biomass. This reaffirms that differentiation of coarse and fine root biomass is as important as differentiating stems and leaves in evaluating plant allocation and ecosystem functioning.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Craine, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009; Wedin, David A/K-4093-2012","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910",,,,55,73,83,4,89,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2003,165,1,,,,,85,100,,10.1023/A:1021414615001,,,16,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,622RA,WOS:000179659700008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ashman, MR; Hallett, PD; Brookes, PC",,,,"Ashman, MR; Hallett, PD; Brookes, PC",,,"Are the links between soil aggregate size class, soil organic matter and respiration rate artefacts of the fractionation procedure?",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil aggregates; soil organic carbon; respiration rates; aggregate fractionation procedures,MICROBIAL BIOMASS; CULTIVATED SOILS; CARBON; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; TILLAGE,"Our aim was to see how variations in aggregate fractionation procedures influence the chemical and biological properties of different sized soil aggregates. Soil was fractionated using two different physical procedures: (1) slaking to simulate a major wetting stress in the field or (2) shaking to simulate mechanical disruption by tillage followed by wet sieving. In the slaked treatment, macro-aggregates (< 250 mum dia) contained about 17% more soil organic C and had about 30% faster rates of respiration. This was in contrast to the shaken treatment where micro-aggregates (< 250 mum dia) contained about 12% more soil organic C and had about 14% faster rates of respiration. The biological and chemical properties of different sized aggregates were used to describe two different models. These were the aggregate heirarchy model and one based on maximum biological activity at soil surfaces. Our results suggest that the chemical and biological properties of aggregates depend on the fractionation procedure. On this basis we suggest that the observed relationships between aggregate size and other properties, for example biological activity, must be interpreted in terms of the disruptive mechanisms used to fractionate aggregated soil. Our results suggest that the aggregate hypothesis has serious weaknesses: the aggregates measured being largely an artefact of the chosen method of separation. We therefore suggest that future work should also consider biological activities at soil pore surfaces. It is at the surface of these channels that parameters such as oxygen supply, plant roots, root exudates and fresh organic matter inputs first interact with the soil.

In the forest the influence of wood ash or liquid fertiliser treatments on the uptake was studied. A rapid uptake of the (NH4)-N-15 (NO3)-N-15 tracer into the fine roots was observed. Within 1 day of application about 50% of the maximum delta(15)N value observed was measured and within 1 week as much as 70-90%. The N-15 enrichment in fine roots was not affected by wood ash and liquid fertiliser treatments applied in the previous year. delta(15)N increased continuously until 2 months after N-15 application and decreased to 60% of its maximum value within 1 year. Nine months after the tracer application, an analysis of delta(15)N distribution throughout the root system was conducted. The delta(15)N values were highest in roots of the topsoil compared to roots at deeper soil layers, and higher in fine roots than in larger roots. The N-15 was not translocated within the root system. The laboratory experiment, using Norway spruce seedlings, aimed at describing short-term (NO3)-N-15 uptake and assimilation into free amino acids with 2 mM or 20 mM nitrate application. The N-15 was detected within 4 h to I day in the amino acids Glu, Gln, Asp of roots, while in Asn, Ala and Ser and in the shoots, the N-15 was retrieved at the earliest after 1 day. The enrichment factor in the amino acids increased to a maximum within 3-7 days, depending on the nitrate concentration applied.","Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; Univ Nancy 1, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR INRA UHO Interact Arbres Microorganisms, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Res Stn Eschikon, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland","Brunner, I (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",,"CHALOT, Michel/A-1113-2012; Brunner, Ivano/J-8661-2014; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009","CHALOT, Michel/0000-0001-8614-0917; Brunner, Ivano/0000-0003-3436-995X; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651",,,,50,11,11,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Rotation periods and relative high harvest and transport costs make the eventual trade of carbon offsets an attractive option to complement wood production. Although root biomass constitutes an important component of total carbon storage in a pine plantation, the difficulties in measuring root biomass often lead to the omission of this component in estimating carbon sequestration. In this work we carried out field research on samples of roots from two differently aged stands of similar site quality to develop regression equations relating root dry weight, root volume, and carbon storage as functions of tree diameter (at breast height). Results show that root biomass and volume can be highly explained by this variable. There were not significative differences between the regression equations obtained from 10- and 20-year-old stands. Total biomass at stand level was 8.3 and 144.5 Mg ha(-1) for 10- and 20-year-old plantations, respectively. Root-shoot ratios calculated for sampled trees ranged in average 0.21-0.24 and 0.23-0.25 for stands. This is in accordance with other studies on temperate conifers biomass. Some inferences about root carbon storage at stand level are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using the example of 38 oak-stands in Baden-Wuerttemberg, we showed the antagonistic effect of soil acidity on soil structure: at pH(KCl)<3,8 the stabilizing effect of Al3+-ions on soil colloids apparently causes high volumes of macro pores, even if the rates of new formation of macro pores is low. At pH(KCl)>6, where a stabilizing effect of high calcium activities on soil colloids and high rates of biogenic macro-pore genesis can be expected, we also found high air filled porosities. In contrast to this, at pH(KCl) 4-6 only low volumes of macro pores could be found. These findings show that in A-horizons of forest soils the presence of flocculating cations is the key factor of a high air filled porosity, whereas the rate of pore formation is apparently of minor importance. Moreover, the soil function as a rooting space is rather controlled by soil structure (measured by the volume of macro pores and by diffusion-coefficients) than by soil chemical parameters such as base- and aluminium-saturation.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Bodenkunde & Waldernahrungslehre, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany","Gaertig, T (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Bodenkunde & Waldernahrungslehre, D-7800 Freiburg, Germany.",Thorsten.Gaertig@bodenkunde.uni-freiburg.de; Ernst.Hildebrand@bodenkunde.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,16,4,4,0,0,J D SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, D-60322 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",Feb-52,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

Our study was undertaken on the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina installation during the second and the fifth growing seasons following loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation establishment. We used the in situ soil core incubation method to assess net N mineralization, and collections were conducted monthly from March to December in 1993 and 1996. The largest differences in N mineralization resulted from soil type differences between blocks. Organic matter removal did not affect N mineralization in either year; however, compaction reduced N mineralization during both years. Vegetation control had a pronounced positive effect on N mineralization and was only slightly less important as compared with soil type. Mineralization rates in year 5 were 80% less than in year 2. We hypothesized that the high N mineralization rates in year 2 may be related to a decrease in the input of soluble organic C following harvest (reducing immobilization), a quick mineralization of microbial N, fluctuating soil temperature and water conditions, and fine roots and litter biomass input following harvest.","Weyerhaeuser Co, So Forestry Res, Hot Springs, AR 71902 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Nevada, Dept Environm & Resource Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Li, QC (reprint author), Weyerhaeuser Co, So Forestry Res, POB 1060, Hot Springs, AR 71902 USA.",,,,,,,48,62,67,0,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The aim of this study was to measure the growth rate of terricolous lichens as it is a key parameter involved in productivity of these ecosystems and an important part of lichen tolerance to reindeer grazing. Furthermore, the natural succession and the long-term effects of reindeer grazing on lichen community characteristics in two contrasting habitats were investigated as well as the interactions between lichen cover and mosses and vascular plants. Biomass and coverage measurements were conducted in a lichen woodland and in a subarctic heath with grazed and ungrazed areas in northern Finland. Measurements spanning over 13 yr of undisturbed development show that the growth rate of Cladina stellaris can be as high as > 0.17 g g(-1) produced annually, although in average growth rates were much lower. During the succession of ground vegetation, C. stellaris, C. rangiferina, C. mitis and Cetraria nivalis increased in biomass in fenced areas and were reduced most in biomass by reindeer in unprotected areas. Reindeer grazing and trampling seem to change the vegetation towards a type that is dominated by small dwarf shrubs, bare soil and minute-cup lichens (Cladonia spp.). Removing the lichen layer by reindeer may reduce natural regeneration of pine trees as implied by increasing numbers of pine seedlings with increasing lichen cover.","Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland; Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-90401 Oulu, Finland","den Herder, M (reprint author), Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",michael.denherder@joensuu.fi,,"Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit/0000-0002-8928-6951",,,,50,57,61,4,53,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2003,26,1,,,,,3,12,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03211.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642HE,WOS:000180797500001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Donovan, LA; Richards, JH; Linton, MJ",,,,"Donovan, LA; Richards, JH; Linton, MJ",,,Magnitude and mechanisms of disequilibrium between predawn plant and soil water potentials,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,apoplastic solutes; Chrysothamnus nauseosus; Great Basin desert; California; hydraulic conductance; hydraulic lift; nighttime transpiration; predawn water potential; Sarcobatus vermiulatus; water relations,VAPOR-PRESSURE DEFICIT; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTANCE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; SHRUBS; ROOTS; STRESS; EQUILIBRIUM; RESISTANCE; LIMITATION; EXPOSURE,"Predawn plant water potential (Psi(w), measured with leaf psychrometers) and surrogate measurements made with the pressure chamber (termed Psi(pc) here) are used to infer comparative ecological performance, based on the expectation that these plant potentials reflect the wettest soil Psi(w) accessed by roots. There is growing evidence, however, that some species exhibit substantial predawn disequilibrium (PDD), defined as plant Psi(w) or Psi(pc) at predawn substantially more negative than the Psi(w) of soil accessed by roots. In the western Great Basin desert, the magnitude of PDD calculated as soil Psi(w) minus predawn leaf Psi(w) was as large as 1.4 and 2.7 MPa for two codominant shrub species, Chrysothamnus nauseosus and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, respectively. The magnitude of PDD calculated as soil Psi(w) minus predawn Psi(pc) was smaller, up to 0.6 and 2.1 MPa for Chrysothamnus and Sarcobatus, respectively. For both species, mechanisms contributing to PDD included night-time transpiration and putative leaf apoplastic solutes, but not hydraulic conductance limitations. Hydraulic lift also occurred in both species and likely contributed to PDD for Sarcobatus. Finding large magnitude PDD in field populations emphasizes that species differences in predawn plant Psi(w) or Psi(pc), do not necessarily reflect differences in accessible soil 41, and rooting depth, nor does a low predawn plant T, or Psi(pc) value necessarily mean that soil Psi(w), is also low. Mechanisms contributing to PDD affect relationships between plants and soil resources, as well as the potential for plant plant interactions.","Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Eastern New Mexico Univ, Dept Biol, Portales, NM 88130 USA","Donovan, LA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,"Donovan, Lisa/H-4754-2016","Donovan, Lisa/0000-0001-9814-0666",,,,42,114,121,2,64,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2003,84,2,,,,,463,470,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0463:MAMODB]2.0.CO;2,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,654FB,WOS:000181482600019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Staddon, PL; Thompson, K; Jakobsen, I; Grime, JP; Askew, AP; Fitter, AH",,,,"Staddon, PL; Thompson, K; Jakobsen, I; Grime, JP; Askew, AP; Fitter, AH",,,Mycorrhizal fungal abundance is affected by long-term climatic manipulations in the field,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizas; climate change; drought; global environmental change; warming,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; PLANTAGO-LANCEOLATA; HYPHAL PRODUCTION; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ROOT PRODUCTION; GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; ELEVATED CO2; COLONIZATION; SOIL,"Climate change treatments - winter warming, summer drought and increased summer precipitation - have been imposed on an upland grassland continuously for 7 years.

Mycorrhizal fungal colonisation of roots and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) density in the soil were both affected by the climatic manipulations, especially by summer drought. Both winter warming and summer drought increased the proportion of root length colonised (RLC) and decreased the density of external mycorrhizal hyphal. Much of the response of mycorrhizal fungi to climate change could be attributed to climate-induced changes in the vegetation, especially plant species relative abundance. However, it is possible that some of the mycorrhizal response to the climatic manipulations was direct - for example, the response of the EMH density to the drought treatment.

In contrast, the other compounds without the carboline were less active in reducing aphid acceptance. In a probing bioassay, individual substances were either neutral or stimulatory to aphids, indicating that the reduced settling was probably not due to direct effects on aphids, but rather due to effects on the plant. This was confirmed in olfactometer assays, in which aphids were repelled by odors from barley plants following treatment with a mixture containing all four chemicals.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Rothamsted Res, Div Biol Chem, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Glinwood, R (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, POB 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Ninkovic, Velemir/E-7677-2011; Glinwood, Robert/A-2489-2009","Ninkovic, Velemir/0000-0001-9276-7169; Glinwood, Robert/0000-0001-5082-5076",,,,31,39,41,2,34,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

The adaptations that make these species successful in their restricted habitat may incur a cost, and decrease their success in more common habitats. We compared growth, biomass allocation and root morphology of two narrowly endemic Hakea species (Proteaceae) of Mediterranean south-western Australia with those of five more widespread congeners, in a glasshouse study. The rare Hakea species occur in endangered winter-wet shrublands that grow on skeletal (0-20 cm deep) soils overlying massive ironstone rock, whereas their common congeners occur nearby on deeper wetland and non-wetland soils. 2 The ironstone endemics differed consistently from their widespread congeners in some important root characteristics. During early development they allocated relatively more biomass to their roots, and had a higher specific root length due to a lower average root diameter and a lower root mass density. Therefore, when compared at the same plant mass, the ironstone endemics had a considerably greater total root length. 3 The ironstone endemics also favoured root growth in deeper layers of the substrate: they invested up to 64% of their root mass in the bottom 10 cm of 40-cm-deep pots, vs. 35% for common species. Only in the ironstone endemics did the extension of the main root axis continue at the same rate after reaching the bottom of the pot. 4 We suggest that the observed differences are the consequence of evolutionary trade-offs, and represent specializations of the endemic species to increase the chances of getting access to water before the onset of severe summer drought in these habitats. However, while adaptive in a shallow-soil habitat, these traits may reduce success on deeper soils by compromising both below-ground and above-ground competitive abilities.","Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Poot, P (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",ppoot@agric.uwa.edu.au,"Poot, Pieter/B-3457-2011; Lambers, Hans/A-1544-2008","Lambers, Hans/0000-0002-4118-2272; Poot, Pieter/0000-0001-7721-0696",,,,37,46,48,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The endomycorrhizal fungus only stimulated plant growth in the sandy soil. Moreover, arbuscular mycorrhizal infection enhanced the nodulation process in both culture substrates. Beside the stimulatory effects of the mycorrhizosphere on both rhizobia development, fungal symbiosis induces two different dynamics of each bacterial strains in the sand-grown plants. These results suggest specific relationships could occur during the development of the tripartite symbiosis, at physiological and molecular level. From a practical point of view, the role of arbuscular mycorrhizas in improving nodulation and N-2 fixation is universally recognized. The fungal symbiosis could modify the development of bacterial inoculants along the root systems. This effect is of particular interest in the controlled inoculation of selected rhizobia.","IRD, Unite Rech IBS, Dakar, Senegal; IRD, Microbiol Lab, Dakar, Senegal","Duponnois, R (reprint author), IRD, Unite Rech IBS, BP 1386, Dakar, Senegal.",,"Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016","Andre, Stephane/0000-0002-2667-6709",,,,39,11,12,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

Little is known, however, about whether the presence of different AMF species leads to differences in plant community structure or invasion success by introduced species. To investigate the effects of AMF species on community structure and invasion, we created replicate microcosms containing soil inoculated with one of three different AMF species (Glomus spurcum Pfeiffer, Walker & Bloss, Scutellospora erythropa (Koske & Walker) Walker & Sanders, or Scutellospora verrucosa (Koske & Walker) Walker & Sanders) or a mixture of all three AMF species. Seeds of seven naturally co-occurring plant species (Ageratum conyzoides L., Cyperus compressus L., Chamaecrista nictitans (L.), Crotalaria incana L., Hyptis pectinata (L.) Poit., Sida rhombifolia L., Melinis repens (Willd.) Zizka) in Hawai'i were sown equally into these microcosms, which were placed on outdoor benches. Plant community development was monitored over a season. Mid-way through the experiment, an invader (Bidens pilosa L.) was added to the established communities to determine whether mycorrhizal species identity affected invasion success. Final aboveground and belowground phytomass were used to assess plant community differences among treatments. Although the identity of the dominant plant species (Melinis repens) remained the same in all treatments, community dominance, community productivity, plant species richness, Shannon index of diversity, and invasion success all varied with AMF species identity. Invasion success was not inversely related to species richness or diversity. Instead, increased richness, diversity, and invasion success all appeared to be related to decreased dominance by M. repens in the presence of certain AMF species. These results indicate that the composition of the AMF community belowground can influence the structure of the plant community aboveground, and may play a role in facilitating or repelling invasion.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Stampe, ED (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,51,64,72,1,65,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2003,100,2,,,,,362,372,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12006.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,660VN,WOS:000181854900017,,,,,10/31/19S,"Brookshire, BL; Garrett, HE; Robison, TL",,"VanSambeek, JW; Dawson, JO; Ponder, F; Loewenstein, EF; Fralish, JS",,"Brookshire, BL; Garrett, HE; Robison, TL",,,Effects of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae and seed source on nursery-grown black walnut seedlings,"13TH CENTRAL HARDWOOD FOREST CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS",USDA FOREST SERVICE GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT NORTH CENTRAL,,English,Proceedings Paper,13th Central Hardwood Forest Conference,"APR 01-03, 2002","Univ Illinois, Urbana Champaign, IL","Dept Nat Resources & Enviornm, Ill Soc Amer Foresters, USDA Forest Serv, N Cent Res Stn",Univ Illinois,,AGROFORESTRY,"A nursery study was established in Missouri to evaluate the effects of endomycorrhizal inoculation and seed source on the growth of black walnut seedlings.

However, the study clearly demonstrates variation in walnut growth responses with changes in endomycorrhizal symbiont and seed source.

Treatments included a natural grazed herbaceous fallow, a natural ungrazed herbaceous fallow and three planted tree fallows (Acacia polyacantha Willd. ssp. campylacantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.), Senna siamea Lam. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.), which were protected against grazing. Because tree species influenced light interception in different ways, as well as having different root patterns, they had different effects on the herbaceous stratum in terms of species composition and biomass. The grazed herbaceous fallow maintained the greatest species richness. Protection against grazing or the introduction of tree species associated with the absence of grazing induced both a progressive evolution to a particular species composition. The ungrazed herbaceous fallow consisted mainly of Andropogon gayanus Kunth, which provided the greatest biomass (8 t dry matter ha(-1) at the end of the fallow period). E. camaldulensis provided little shade and the lowest fine root mass in the top layer allowing the growth of A. gayanus and thus a greater herbaceous biomass (3.5 t DM ha(-1)) than that found under the other tree species. Under the heavy shade of A. polyacantha, the herbaceous stratum consisted mainly of annual Pennisetum spp. (2.2 t DM ha(-1)) and showed the greatest N concentration (1.3%), probably due to N(2) fixation by the tree species. After the fourth year, despite the relatively open tree canopy, S. siamea, which showed the highest fine root mass, had a strong depressive effect on the herbaceous stratum.","Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, Dept Foret CATIE, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica; World Wide Fund Nat Int, Garoua, Cameroon; Inst Agr Res Dev, Garoua, Cameroon","Harmand, JM (reprint author), Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, Dept Foret CATIE, Apdo 31, Turrialba 7170, Costa Rica.",jean-michel.harmand@cirad.fr,,,,,,24,6,7,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

(which is the keystone tree species in the Mediterranean environment) potted seedlings were grown for 90 days at two CO2 concentrations, ambient and +400 mumol mol(-1). Half of each group was sprayed once a week with deionized (pH 5.6) or acidified (pH 2.5) water. Elevated CO2 enhanced growth: shoot and leaf sprouting, shoot length, total leaf area, total and individual leaf mass, stem, and fine root mass were increased. Acid rain increased leaf and shoot turnover by stimulating both abscission and sprouting and, because abscission was more common than sprouting, the result was growth inhibition. The trend of these results was visible after 30-40 days. Total leaf area was increased by the increase in leaf number at elevated CO2, and decreased by the reduction in leaf size in the acid treatments. Elevated CO2 favored biomass partitioning to stems, whereas acid rain did not modify allocation. Root-to-shoot ratio was not significantly affected. Despite the elevated CO2-enhanced growth of acid-stressed holm oak seedlings, significant CO2 x pH interactions were recorded only in cases where the effect of acidity was null (biomass allocation to stem) or positive (shoot and leaf sprouting). Thus, we conclude that short-term CO2 enrichment did not alleviate the negative effect of acid rain on holm oak growth and that a strong acid load may inhibit the CO2-promoted biomass partitioning to stems.","CNR, IPAF, I-50144 Florence, Italy","Paoletti, E (reprint author), CNR, IPAF, P Cascine 28, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",,,"Paoletti, Elena/0000-0001-5324-7769; MANES, Fausto/0000-0002-4563-4272",,,,52,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1474-8177,,0-08-044317-6,DEV ENVIRONM SCI,,,2003,3,,,,,,375,389,,,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BY69M,WOS:000189440800021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sharma, J; Zettler, LW; van Sambeek, JW; Ellersieck, MR; Starbuck, CJ",,,,"Sharma, J; Zettler, LW; van Sambeek, JW; Ellersieck, MR; Starbuck, CJ",,,Symbiotic seed germination and mycorrhizae of federally threatened Platanthera praeclara (Orchidaceae),AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLUSTER-ANALYSIS METHOD; FUNGI; NOV,"In vitro culture of mycotrophic leaf-bearing seedlings of federally threatened Platanthera praeclara Sheviak and Bowles, a terrestrial orchid native to the midwestern prairies, is reported for the first time.

Streptomyces strains were introduced around seeds at the time of planting. Hyphal filaments and spore chains were observed by scanning electron microscopy on roots of alfalfa seedlings receiving the streptomycete amendment. Streptomyces strain densities on leaves decreased 10-100-fold over an 8-week period, while densities on roots remained constant over time. The Streptomyces strains also colonized alfalfa root nodules. We then tested the ability of 15 antibiotic-producing strains of Streptomyces to inhibit in vitro growth of Phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis Malbr. & Roum., the causal agent of spring blackstem and leaf spot of alfalfa. The majority of the Streptomyces strains inhibited growth of three diverse strains of P. medicaginis. In a detached leaf assay, one Streptomyces strain decreased leaf spot symptoms caused by R medicaginis when inoculated onto leaves 24h before the pathogen. Two Streptomyces strains decreased defoliation caused by P medicaginis when the streptomycetes were introduced around seeds at the time of planting. We also examined inhibitory activity of Streptomyces strains against 11 strains of S. mehloti. Eight of the 15 Streptomyces strains inhibited in vitro growth of five or more of the S. meliloti strains, while four Streptomyces strains had no effect on growth of any test strains. In a growth chamber assay, two of six Streptomyces strains, when inoculated into the planting mix, significantly reduced plant dry weight compared to the treatment with S. meliloti alone, but did not significantly reduce the number of nodules. These results suggest that careful selection of Streptomyces isolates for use in biological control of plant diseases will limit the potential negative impacts on rhizobia.

The rate of increase in the specific volume of pores less than or equal to30 mum diameter with %C was measured by the water retention of aggregates at 10 kPa suction, and was 50% more for the sandy soil than for the silty soil. The difference is ascribed to the dominance of mycorrhizal fungi under trees compared with bacteria under grass. Both agents are presumed to link particles together through acidic polysaccharide gel. Subsequent air-drying then leaves pores stable to wetting and drying. It is suggested that the increase in the plastic limit of silty soils is mainly due to pores stabilised in this way.

Time domain reflectometry was used to measure changes in the soil's volumetric water content, and heat-pulse was used to monitor locally the rates of sap flow in the trunk and roots of the tree. The tree's distribution of root-length density and supporting data to characterise the soil's hydraulic properties were determined for the purpose of modelling soil water movement in the root-zone under an apple tree. Experimental data are compared against the output from a numerical model of the soil water balance that uses Richards' equation for water flow, and uses a distributed macroscopic sink term for root uptake. In general, there was a very good agreement between the measured and modelled results. The apple trees consumed some 70 L of water per day during the middle of summer. The daily water use declined to about 20 L per day with the onset of autumn, coinciding with a reduced evaporative demand and an increasing number of rain days. Water movement in the root-zone soil was dominated by the water uptake via surface roots. Large changes in soil water content were also associated with each irrigation event. Our experimental data support the contention that more frequent irrigation in smaller doses will result in less water percolating through the root-zone. Such an irrigation strategy should make more efficient use of water by minimising the leaching losses. It will also be helpful for environmental protection by reducing the percolation losses of water and solute beyond the grasp of the roots.","HortRes Inst, Environm & Risk Management Grp, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Green, SR (reprint author), HortRes Inst, Environm & Risk Management Grp, Private Bag 11-030, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",,"Clothier, Brent E/H-3124-2013; Green, Steve/I-3938-2013; Vogeler, Iris/P-2761-2019","Clothier, Brent E/0000-0003-1901-0324; Green, Steve/0000-0002-4020-3430; Vogeler, Iris/0000-0003-2512-7668",,,,40,35,38,2,11,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",Apr-73,,,AUST J SOIL RES,Aust.

Many induced responses, however, are known to be systemic and thus it is likely that responses induced by AG phytophages affect belowground (BG) phytophages feeding on the same plant, and vice versa. The awareness that interactions between AG and BG phytophages may be an important aspect in the evolution of induced responses came only recently and little research has been done to date. In this review we first summarise ecological studies that show how AG phytophages may affect BG phytophages, and vice versa. Then we focus on mechanisms governing interactions between AG and BG induced responses, such as cross-talk between signals. We chose the genus Nicotiana and the family Brassicaceae as two examples of plant groups that have been well studied for their induced responses both AG and BG - but not in concert - and explore how interactions between AG and BG induced compounds may link multitrophic interactions associated with these plants. We propose that future research on AG and BG interactions should focus on: 1).

A recent analysis showed that some of these equations might overestimate belowground net primary production (NPPB). The objectives of this study were to update the compilation of root biomass and turnover data, to recalculate the regression equations and to evaluate the impact of the new equations on CBM-CFS2 estimates of net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP). We updated all equations based on 635 pairs of aboveground and belowground data compiled from published studies in the cold temperate and boreal forests. The new parameter for the equation to predict total root biomass for softwood species changed only slightly, but the changes for hardwood species were statistically significant. A new equation form, which improved the accuracy and biological interpretation, was used to predict fine root biomass as a proportion of total root biomass. The annual rate of fine root turnover was currently estimated to be 0.641 of fine root biomass. A comparison of NPP estimates from CBM-CFS2 with results from field measurements, empirical calculations and modeling indicated that the new root equations predicted reasonable NPPB values. The changes to the root equations had little effect on NEP estimates.","Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; ESSA Technol Ltd, Vancouver, BC V6J 5C6, Canada","Li, Z (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, 5320-122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",zli@nrcan.gc.ca,,"Kurz, Werner/0000-0003-4576-7849",,,,89,146,163,0,45,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The Toolbox is based on the FullCAM model that describes temporal change in carbon stocks in biomass, litter (including slash remaining after harvest) and soil. The model has been calibrated for Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus. The simplest way to estimate above-ground biomass C is to scale the pattern of volume growth to mass of biomass components (wood, bark, branches, foliage) and their C content. Field measures of volume at a known age are needed to guide selection of an appropriate yield curve for each site. Alternatively, the FullCAM model can apply either empirical or process-based growth models which can then also be used to make predictions. Coarse root biomass is predicted from root:shoot ratios. Changes in litter and soil C stocks are predicted using calibrated models that calculate the difference between litter inputs and loss of C by decay. The model allows an uncertainty (error) analysis to be performed. This is expressed as the probability that estimates of forest C stocks fall within a certain range.","CSIRO, Forestry & Forest Prod, Canberra, ACT 2604, Australia","Snowdon, P (reprint author), CSIRO, Forestry & Forest Prod, POB E4008, Canberra, ACT 2604, Australia.",,"Polglase, Philip/D-7025-2011; Paul, Keryn I/A-6773-2011; Booth, Trevor/B-5514-2011","Paul, Keryn I/0000-0003-4125-929X; ",,,,13,0,0,0,0,C S I R O,EAST MELBOURNE,"PO BOX 89 (EAST ALBERT ST), EAST MELBOURNE, 3002, AUSTRALIA",,,0-643-06529-6,,,,2003,,,,,,,65,72,,,,,8,Environmental Sciences; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BBZ01,WOS:000228331900008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Morikawa, CK; Saigusa, M",,,,"Morikawa, CK; Saigusa, M",,,Effect of continuous application of low-acidulent fertilizer on acidification of an Andisol and plant growth,COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,acidification; aluminum toxicity; chloride; low-acidulent fertilizer; sulfate,SOIL ACIDIFICATION; SULFUR; PH,"Our objective was to prevent the soil acidification caused by the NH4+ and the accumulation of SO42- and Cl- using a low acidulent urea based fertilizer applied in an Andisol that initial pH was adjusted to pH5 (named LAF5) or pH6 (named LAF6) in comparison with the continuous application of a rapidly soluble ammonium based fertilizer (RSF) applied on the same soils (named RSF5 and RSF6, respectively). Komatsuna (Brassica campestris var. maruha) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were used as test plants. After three successive Komatsuna cultivations, barley seedlings were grown for 7 days to evaluate the degree of soil acidification. A rate of 0.2 g N kg(-1) soil of each fertilizer was applied in each Komatsuna culture. No accumulation of sulfate and chloride ions was found in the soil continuously treated with the LAF However, the continuous applications of RSF accumulated both sulfate and chloride, and lowered the soil pH remarkably compared to those of LAF. Initial soil extractable SO42- contents in pH5 and pH6 treatments were 510 and 573 mg kg(-1), respectively. After three Komatsuna cultivations, the soil extractable SO42- in RSF5 and RSF6 treatments increased to 2833 and 2374 mg kg-(1) in RSF5 and RSF6 treatments, respectively; and changed to 407 and 635 mg kg(-1) in LAF5 and LAF6 treatments. The continuous application of low acidulent fertilizers lowered the soil pH of 0.22 and 0.41 units in LAF5 and LAF6 treatments, respectively, and the continuous RSF application lowered the soil pH of 0.89 and 0.77 units, in RSF5 and RSF6 treatments, respectively. Both dry matter and root length of barley were drastically reduced in the RSF treatment and showed typical symptoms of aluminum toxicity, i.e., brown roots and deformed root tips.

We examined whether the soil community associated with P. scrotina trees has continued negative effects on seedling growth. P. serotina seedlings and saplings were harvested after being followed for 1-3 years in the field, and above- and belowground biomasses were measured. Linear regression models including distance to adult P. serotina tree, conspecific seedling density. and seedling age explained 13.9% of the variation in biomass. Distance and age were positively correlated with total biomass, while density as negatively correlated with total biomass. A similar model for saplings established prior to the beginning of the study, and of unknown age, predicted 11.3% of the variation in total biomass, with distance to adult positively correlated with biomass. To separate the effects of distance from density and remove confounding environmental factors, seedlings were grown in the greenhouse at high or low density in soil collected 0-5 m or 25-30 m from adult P. serotina trees. Half of the soil collected at each distance was sterilized by autoclaving. The experiment was repeated in 1998 and 1999, and in both years there was a significant sterilization-by-distance interaction, Sterilization of soil collected close to the tree resulted in higher root: shoot ratios, while sterilization of soil collected away from the tree resulted in lower root:shoot ratios, This suggests that soil biota vary with distance to adults and that elimination of soil biota changes plant allocation patterns differentially with distance. Distance-dependent effects of soilborne pathogens may continue beyond seedling mortality and suppress juvenile growth. Reduced growth could increase an individual's, chance of later mortality, suggesting that initial escape front damping-off pathogens close to parental trees does not ensure longer-term survival.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Packer, A (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",,,,,74,100,106,0,35,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2003,84,1,,,,,108,119,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0108:SPAPSS]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642FC,WOS:000180792700010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Callaway, RM; Mahall, BE; Wicks, C; Pankey, J; Zabinski, C",,,,"Callaway, RM; Mahall, BE; Wicks, C; Pankey, J; Zabinski, C",,,Soil fungi and the effects of an invasive forb on grasses: Neighbor identity matters,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Avena; California grasslands; Centaurea; competition; fungi; indirect interactions; invasion; mycorrhizae; Nassella; soil fungi,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; PRAIRIE GRASSES; CARBON TRANSFER; PLANTS; COMMUNITY; CALIFORNIA; FIELD; ROOTS; PHOSPHORUS,"We studied the effects of soil fungi on interactions between Centaurea melitensis, an exotic invasive weed in central California, and two co-occurring grasses, Nassella pulchra and Avena barbata, The fungicide benomyl reduced the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in plant roots but did not affect non-AM fungi. Centaurea plants grown alone were >50% smaller with the resident microbial community intact than when benomyl was applied. When grown with Nassella, the effect of benomyl was reversed. Centaurea grew almost five times larger with the resident microbial community intact. Fungicide had no effect on the biomass of Centaurea grown with Avena, but biomass of Centaurea was significantly lower when grown with Avena than when grown with Nassella or alone. Photosynthetically fixed carbon may have been transferred from Nassella via soil fungi to Centaurea, constituting a form of soil fungi-mediated parasitism, but such a transfer did not occur from Avena to Centaurea. Second. Nassella may have been more inhibited by soil pathogens in the presence of Centaurea than when alone. and the inhibition of Nassella may have released Centaurea from competition. A third possibility is that Nassella has strong positive effects on the growth of Soil fungi. but the positive feedback of beneficial soil fungi to Nassella is less than the positive feedback to Centaurea. Regardless of the mechanism, the difference in soil fungicide treatment effects on competition between Centaurea and Nassella vs. Centaurea and Avena has important implications for the invasion of California grasslands.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,,,,,,33,81,87,2,71,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2003,84,1,,,,,129,135,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0129:SFATEO]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642FC,WOS:000180792700012,,,,,10/31/19B,"Kang, LH; Ma, HB",,"Wei, RP; Xu, D",,"Kang, LH; Ma, HB",,,Interaction of associative nitrogen-fixation bacteria with Eucalyptus,"EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS: RESEARCH , MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT",,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Eucalyptus Plantations,"SEP   01, 2002-SEP 06, 2003","Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,"This study investigated the interaction of Klebsiella oxytoca NG13/pMC73A with Eucalyptus.

Examination of an evolutionary stability concept which is called neighborhood invader strategy (NIS) shows that it may be impossible for an ESS to be established through dynamic selection even if it is a CSS and no polymorphisms occur. We will examine the NIS concept and its implications for two evolutionary game models: root-shoot allocation in plant competition and Lotka-Volterra competition. In the root-shoot model we show that an ESS will be attained through dynamic selection if it is a NIS.

The greatest root expansion distances regarding single tree positions were found in 35-year-old stands and in larger gaps.

Cleaners have small territories, which the majority of reef fish species actively visit to invite inspection of their surface, gills, and mouth. Clients benefit from the removal of parasites while cleaners benefit from the access to a food source. Some client species (choosy clients) have large home ranges that cover several cleaning stations, whereas other clients have small ranges and have access to one cleaning station only (resident clients). Field observations, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments revealed that whether or not a client has choice options influences several aspects of both cleaner and client behavior. Cleaners give choosy clients priority of access. Choosy clients switch partners if cheated by a cleaner (= cleaner feeds on mucus/scales), whereas resident clients punish cheats. Cleaners and resident clients, but not choosy clients, build up relationships before normal cleaning interactions take place. Cleaners are particularly cooperative if choosy clients are bystanders of an interaction but less so when resident clients are bystanders. When it comes to the frequency of cheating by cleaner fish, however, partner choice options are overrun by client control mechanisms: predatory clients are far less often cheated than nonpredatory clients, irrespective of choice options. Future research needs to focus more on empirical testing of game theory so that this new information can be used to formulate deductive models.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England",,,"Noe, Ronald/C-4482-2008; Noe, Ronald/N-3259-2019","Noe, Ronald/0000-0003-1976-0555; ",,,,44,69,69,1,16,M I T PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"FIVE CAMBRIDGE CENTER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,0-262-08326-4,DAHL WS ENV,,,2003,,,,,,,167,184,,,,,18,"Psychology, Biological; Evolutionary Biology; Psychology; Sociology",Psychology; Evolutionary Biology; Sociology,BAA85,WOS:000221380500009,,,,,10/31/19B,"Allen, MF; Rincon, E",,"GomezPompa, A; Allen, MF; Fedick, SL; JimenezOsornio, JJ",,"Allen, MF; Rincon, E",,,The changing global environment and the lowland Maya: Past patterns and current dynamics,LOWLAND MAYA AREA: THREE MILLENNIA AT THE HUMAN-WILDLAND INTERFACE,,,English,Proceedings Paper,21st Symposium in Plant Biology,"JAN 18-20, 2001","UNIV CALIF, RIVERSIDE DEPT BOTANY & PLANT SCI, RIVERSIDE, CA","Univ Calif Riverside, Dean Coll Humanities & Sopcial Sci, Univ Calif Riverside, Dean Coll Nat & Agr Sci, Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, UC MEXUS","UNIV CALIF, RIVERSIDE DEPT BOTANY & PLANT SCI",,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE,,"Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",,rincon@servidor.unam.mx,,,,,,16,9,12,0,4,FOOD PRODUCTS PRESS,BINGHAMTON,"10 ALICE ST, BINGHAMTON, NY 13904-1580 USA",,,1-56022-971-3,,,,2003,,,,,,,13,29,,,,,17,Archaeology; Area Studies; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Archaeology; Area Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BX82U,WOS:000186576700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dinkla, IJT; Janssen, DB",,,,"Dinkla, IJT; Janssen, DB",,,Simultaneous growth on citrate reduces the effects of iron limitation during toluene degradation in Pseudomonas,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONTINUOUS-CULTURE; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PUTIDA PWW0; KINETICS; RHIZOSPHERE; STRAINS; PLASMID; PATHWAY; ACID,"Rhizoremediation has been suggested as an attractive bioremediation strategy for the effective breakdown of pollutants in soil. The presence of plant root exudates such as organic acids, sugars, and amino acids that may serve as carbon sources or biosynthetic building blocks and the limited bioavailability of iron may influence the degradation of pollutants in the rhizosphere. To test the effect of such compounds on hydrocarbon degradation, trace concentrations of yeast extract or mixtures of organic acids and amino acids were added to continuous cultures of Pseudomonas putida mt2 and P. putida WCS358 (TOL) growing on toluene. By addition of these compounds increased growth yields and higher specific growth rates on toluene were obtained. The effects of iron limitation on the substrate utilization pattern of both strains were tested by growing the strains on a mixture of toluene and the readily degradable carbon source citrate while the iron concentration was varied. Simultaneous use of both substrates under carbon-limited as well as iron-limited conditions was observed. Growth yields were less reduced and iron requirement was lower during iron-limited growth in the toluene + citrate grown cultures compared to cultures in which toluene was used as the sole carbon source. The kinetic properties of the cells for toluene degradation were less hampered by the lack of iron when citrate was used as an additional carbon source. The results indicate that the availability of low concentrations of natural organic compounds, such as produced in the rhizosphere, may positively influence the degradative performance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria.","Univ Groningen, Dept Biochem, Groningen Biomol Sci & Biotechnol Inst, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Janssen, DB (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Dept Biochem, Groningen Biomol Sci & Biotechnol Inst, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",D.B.Janssen@chem.rug.nl,,,,,,34,14,15,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

The Vertical Flux Model (VFM) used depends on land-use, but for pastured areas, pine plantations and native bushland is based on WAVES, a detailed biophysical model linking transpiration, and soil-water uptake to climate and soil conditions. Application of WAVES requires a number of parameters that characterise the vegetation and soil hydraulic properties, some of which can only be determined approximately. Uncertainty in the model input parameters would affect the accuracy of recharge estimates. This paper investigates the sensitivity of groundwater recharge estimates to a wide range of vegetation parameters, climate conditions and soil hydraulic properties. Sensitivity analysis indicates that estimated groundwater recharge is relatively sensitive to leaf area index (LAI), light extinction coefficient and the maximum rooting depth of the vegetation, soil water holding capacity and, of course, the rainfall.","Water Corp WA, Leederville, WA 6007, Australia","Xu, C (reprint author), Water Corp WA, Leederville, WA 6007, Australia.",,"Silberstein, Richard/D-6886-2011","Silberstein, Richard/0000-0002-9704-782X",,,,9,0,0,0,0,UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,NEDLANDS,"NEDLANDS, WA, AUSTRALIA",,,1-74052-098-X,,,,2003,,,,,,,177,182,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources",Computer Science; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,BY81Z,WOS:000189470800030,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rose, KL; Graham, RC; Parker, DR",,,,"Rose, KL; Graham, RC; Parker, DR",,,Water source utilization by Pinus jeffreyi and Arctostaphylos patula on thin soils over bedrock,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,water source; delta O-18; stable isotopes; Jeffrey pine; Greenleaf manzanita,WEATHERED GRANITIC BEDROCK; SUMMER PRECIPITATION; SOUTHWESTERN OREGON; ROOT DISTRIBUTION; DOUGLAS-FIR; FOREST; ROCK; MORPHOLOGY; PONDEROSA; PLANTS,"Stable isotopes were used to evaluate water sources for co-occurring Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev & Balf.) and greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Greene) in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, where soils averaged only 75 cm thick but were underlain by up to 5 in of weathered granitic bedrock. Soils and underlying weathered bedrock were sampled three times during both the 1997 and 1998 growing seasons, in 25 cm increments, from 0 to 400 cm or until hard bedrock was reached, and plant stem tissue was sampled simultaneously. Extracted water from the soil/bedrock substrate and plant tissue was analyzed for delta(18)O and/or deltaD, and depth of water source was determined by inference in conjunction with moisture status of the substrate. Water source utilization over the growing seasons for both plants generally followed a pattern similar to that observed for water depletion. Predominant water use was initially from the surface soils. Progressively deeper water sources, including weathered bedrock to a depth of several meters, were exploited as the season progressed and the overlying substrate was depleted of moisture. Early in the growing season, stable isotope values were slightly lower for pine than for manzanita (e.g., average deltaD in June 1997 was 81parts per thousand, for pine and -77parts per thousand for manzanita), and suggest that the functional rooting depth for pine may have been slightly greater than for manzanita. In September 1997, manzanita deltaD values averaged -57parts per thousand while pine values averaged -85parts per thousand, indicating that manzanita opportunistically utilized summer precipitation while pine used more dependable bedrock water. In 1998, soils remained moist through July due to a late snowfall. Unlike the previous year, pine and manzanita deltaD values were not significantly different in mid- and late-growing season, and both plants exploited bedrock-derived water as soil water was depleted. Water held within bedrock was essential for meeting plant transpirational requirements over the summer drought.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Soil & Water Sci Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Santa Ana Reg Water Qual Control Board, Riverside, CA 92501 USA","Graham, RC (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Soil & Water Sci Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,41,57,69,1,37,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2003,134,1,,,,,46,54,,10.1007/s00442-002-1084-4,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,636XK,WOS:000180482400007,12647178,,,,10/31/19J,"Jones, RH; Mitchell, RJ; Stevens, GN; Pecot, SD",,,,"Jones, RH; Mitchell, RJ; Stevens, GN; Pecot, SD",,,Controls of fine root dynamics across a gradient of gap sizes in a pine woodland,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,compensatory growth; ingrowth core; minirhizotron; mixed life form; Pinus palustris,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; LONGLEAF PINE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; CANOPY GAPS; NITROGEN; GROWTH; ECOSYSTEMS; RESPONSES; MORTALITY,"Controls of fine dynamics were investigated in a Pinus palustris Mill. (longleaf pine) woodland subjected to two understory vegetation treatments (control versus removed) and four overstory treatments (no gap control, and canopy gaps of three sizes with constant total gap area per stand). Fine root (<2 mm diameter) dynamics were measured over I I months using ingrowth cores (all treatments) and minirhizotrons (understory removed in no clap control and large gap treatments only). At the fine (microsite) spatial scale, pine and non-pine root mass production responded negatively to each other (P=0.033). Each life form was significantly (Pless than or equal to0.028) related to nearby overstory density, and pine root production compensated for reductions in non-pine roots if understory vegetation was removed. Soil moisture and NO3 mineralization rate were negatively related to pine root mass production (ingrowth cores; P<0.001 and P=0.052) and positively related to pine root length production, mortality and turnover (minirhizotrons; P from <0.001 to 0.078). Temperature variance was negatively related to pine root lifespan (P<0.001) and positively related to pine root turnover (P=0.003). At the ecosystem scale, pattern of overstory disturbance (gap size and number) had no significant effect on non-pine, pine, or total root production. However, the presence of gaps (versus the no-gap control) increased non-pine root mass production (ANOVA, P=0.055) in natural understory conditions, and reduced pine root mass production (P=0.035) where the understory was removed. Ecosystem-wide pine root length production, mortality and turnover were positively related to weekly soil temperature (Pless than or equal to0.02). In natural systems, fine root dynamics are highly variable and strongly affected by biotic factors. Roots quickly close belowground gaps because one life form (pine or non-pine) compensates for the absence of the other. When understory vegetation is removed, however, pine roots respond to the local abiotic environment, particularly moisture and NO3.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Joseph W Jones Ecol Res Ctr Ichauway, Newton, GA 31770 USA","Jones, RH (reprint author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,53,46,54,3,19,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2003,134,1,,,,,132,143,,10.1007/s00442-002-1098-y,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,636XK,WOS:000180482400018,12647190,,,,10/31/19J,"Watt, M; Evans, JR",,,,"Watt, M; Evans, JR",,,"Phosphorus acquisition from soil by white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.), species with contrasting root development",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,cluster roots; proteoid roots; root architecture; root development; soil phosphorus; soybean; white lupin,PROTEOID ROOTS; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; RHIZOSPHERE; EXCRETION; ALUMINUM; EXTRACTS,"White lupin and soybean have contrasting root morphologies: white lupin develops proteoid or cluster roots, roots with discreet clusters of short, determinate branch roots (rootlets) while soybean develops a more fibrous root system with evenly distributed, longer branch roots. Growth and P acquisition by white lupin and soybean were compared in a soil high in bound, total P, with or without additional inorganic P applied in solution. Additional P increased biomass by 25% and doubled total P in soybean. In contrast, white lupin did not respond to additional P in biomass or total P. However added P decreased cluster development on proteoid roots indicating that white lupin sensed the added P. The reduction in cluster weight per plant was exactly countered by an increase in dry weight of other roots. Soybean root development responded to P application, proliferating branch roots with active meristems in the upper portion of the soil profile where P was applied, and reducing root weight to plant weight by 13%. White lupin did not proliferate roots in response to P application. When P was not added to soil, soybean and lupin acquired similar P per unit root dry weight. However, white lupin accumulated 4.8 times more P per unit root length, suggesting that P acquisition in these plants involved other mechanisms such as the exudation of P solubilizing compounds. Soybean accessed P by developing more root length thus colonising more soil volume than white lupin and, therefore, was better able to take advantage of the added P. Pericycle and root tip meristem activities were critical to the differences in root development between white lupin and soybean, and therefore their responses to plant and soil P.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Environm Biol Grp, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Watt, M (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Environm Biol Grp, GPO Box 475, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",michelle.watt@csiro.au,"Evans, John Richard/C-8424-2009; Watt, Michelle/I-6226-2016; Watt, Michelle/F-8941-2010","Evans, John Richard/0000-0003-1379-3532; Watt, Michelle/0000-0001-7843-0957; ",,,,19,33,34,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2003,248,2-Jan,,,,,271,283,,10.1023/A:1022332700686,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,646AG,WOS:000181012200023,,,,,10/31/19J,"Solaiman, MZ; Abbott, LK",,,,"Solaiman, MZ; Abbott, LK",,,Phosphorus uptake by a community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in jarrah forest,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizas; community; forest; morphotypes; phosphate; soil,HYACINTHOIDES NON-SCRIPTA; MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER; INOCULUM LEVELS; INFECTIVITY; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; SOIL; BIODIVERSITY,"Communities of indigenous arbusuclar mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are expected to alter phosphorus uptake and biomass productivity of plants according to characteristics of the life cycles of the fungi present and the way they interact with each other inside roots and with host plants. Differences in the relative abundance of AM fungi inside roots could influence P uptake if the fungi present differ in effectiveness at accessing P and transferring it to the plant. However, it is difficult to assess the contribution of AM fungi under field conditions. We investigated P uptake, from point sources of P placed 2, 4 and 6 cm from roots, by plants colonised by a community of AM fungi in jarrah forest soil. Roots were retained within a mesh bag to prevent them from growing towards the point source of P. The relative abundance of morphotypes of fungi inside roots and the P status of plants were assessed after 12 and 16 weeks. First, a bioassay was carried out in undisturbed forest soil cores using two host plants, a forest understorey plant Phyllanthus calycinus Labill and the annual pasture species subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneaum L.), to assess the infectivity of the indigenous community of AM fungi. Roots of both bioassay host plants were colonised in similar proportions by morphotypes of AM fungi resembling Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora and fine endophytes. In this bioassay, there were positive correlations between the proportion of root length colonised and plant biomass and P uptake for P. calycinus, but not for subterranean clover. In the experiment assessing the capacity of P. calycinus to access P placed at increasing distances from the root, shoot P content and concentration in P. calycinus were greater when P was placed 2 cm compared with 4 and 6 cm from roots. The length of hyphae in the vicinity of the point source of P decreased with increasing distance from the plant. The extent to which the individual AM fungi were involved in P uptake is not known. The Glomus morphotype was dominant at both times of sampling.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Abbott, LK (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",labbott@cyllene.uwa.edu.au,"Abbott, Lynette K/F-7489-2011; Solaiman, Zakaria/C-9645-2010","Abbott, Lynette K/0000-0001-8586-7858; Solaiman, Zakaria/0000-0001-7014-7532",,,,39,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2003,248,2-Jan,,,,,313,320,,10.1023/A:1022372228545,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,646AG,WOS:000181012200027,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cahill, JF; Casper, BB",,,,"Cahill, JF; Casper, BB",,,Canopy gaps are sites of reduced belowground plant competition in a productive old field,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Abutilon theophrasti; favorable microsite; root competition; root gaps; succession,ABUTILON-THEOPHRASTI MALVACEAE; BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION; TROPICAL WET FOREST; FINE-ROOT BIOMASS; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; DISTURBANCES; SIZE; VEGETATION; GRASSLANDS,"Whether small gaps in the aboveground vegetation of productive old fields correspond to gaps in belowground plant biomass, and whether such ""root gaps"" result in a reduction of competition for soil resources is not known.

Associated with the decrease in root biomass was a 25% reduction in the intensity of belowground competition within gaps compared to the surrounding matrix vegetation. These differences could not be attributed to variation in soil properties, as gap and matrix soils did not differ in any of the physical or chemical properties measured. These results indicate that the increased plant growth commonly observed within gaps may be partly due to reduced belowground competition, independent of any advantage gained from increased light availability. By providing areas of low belowground competitive intensity, gaps in this field could allow poor belowground competitors to exist with in old fields, thus increasing community diversity.","Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Cahill, JF (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",,"Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015","Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516",,,,39,7,8,1,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JAN,2003,164,1,,,,,29,36,,10.1023/A:1021228204599,,,8,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,620BY,WOS:000179514300003,,,,,10/31/19S,"Ganatsas, PP; Tsakaldimi, MN",,"Lekkas, TD",,"Ganatsas, P.

In situ studies on root development of mature trees have a long history despite the fact that these are difficult to be carried out due to many practical problems and the high labor cost. The aim of this study was to examine the root distribution and root type of mature trees of a Mediterranean coniferous species Pinus brutia Ten., under adverse ecological conditions named shallow soil, high mechanical resistance of the underground bedrock and low water availability. A soil transect of 2 km was studied in the peri-urban artificial forest of Thessaloniki, following the excavation performed during the works of ring-road extension. The forest stands were approximately 65 years old, dominated by the species Pinus brutia. In order to assess root spatial distribution, twenty seven soil vertical profile walls were taken from nine tree stumps and at three different spaces from each representative tree: i) at the point that the stump ends (0 m distance from the stump), ii) 0.75 m from the stump, and iii) 1.50 m from the stump, distance that corresponds to the half of the tree spacing in the planting row. Each vertical soil profile wall was divided into square grid cells of 25 cm(2) for the upper soil layers (0-30 cm) and 100 cm(2) for the deeper soil layers (> 30 cm) and the number of roots belonging to three diameter classes (between 0.1 and 1 mm, 1 and 10 mm, and over 10 mm) were counted in each grid cell. Root system architecture was estimated from observations on twelve selected stumps. In order to describe above-ground stand growth, the tree characteristics (tree height and diameter at breast height) were estimated before the road works. The findings of the study showed a change in root distribution of 65-year old Pinus brutia trees and confirmed that the root system is highly affected by the stress factors of soil (absence of sufficient soil depth, mechanical resistance of underground bedrock). The highest root density of fine, medium and coarse roots was observed in the upper soil layers (0-30 cm). Mean fine root density (FRD) values decreased sharply with soil depth, regardless of the distance from the tree stump. The density of coarse roots (CRD) showed a clear negative relationship with the distance out from the tree contrary to the fine root density which found lower under the stump. The stress factors of soil caused a deflection of the typical pine root system, restricted the root penetration in the deeper soil layers and obliged the root to elongate towards the surface soil layers with more available water. This root restriction and deformation strongly affected the stand growth which was found extremely limited.","Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece","Ganatsas, PP (reprint author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, POB 262, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",,"Tsakaldimi, Marianthi/E-2808-2010",,,,,17,6,6,1,9,UNIV AEGEAN,ATHENS,"VOULGAROKTONOU 30, ATHENS 114 72, GREECE",1106-5516,,960-7475-24-0,PROC INT CONF ENV SC,,,2003,,,,,,,216,223,,,,,8,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BEX23,WOS:000239952800029,,,,,10/31/19S,"Profeti, G; Travaglia, C; Carla, R",,"Owe, M; DUrso, G; Toulios, L",,"Profeti, G; Travaglia, C; Carla, R",,,Detecting and monitoring aquacultural patterns through multitemporal SAR imagery analysis,"REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY IV",PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE),,English,Proceedings Paper,"Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems and Hydrology IV","SEP 22-25, 2002","AGIA PELAGIA, GREECE",SPIE,,shrimp farms; pattern identification; change detection; SAR; speckle reduction,,"The inventory and monitoring of aquaculture areas are essential tools for decision-making at a governmental level in developing countries. With the use of satellite imagery, these tasks can be performed in an accurate, rapid and objective way. This approach is also economically viable, as the worth of aquaculture far outweighs its cost. This paper describes a methodology for identifying and monitoring shrimp farms by means of multi-temporal satellite SAR data. SAR offer all-weather capabilities, an important characteristic since shrimp farms exist in tropical and subtropical areas. Moreover, the backscatter effect created by the dykes surrounding the ponds produces a typical pattern which allows the interpreter to distinguish them from other types of water-covered surfaces. However, the presence of speckle noise limits the interpretability of SAR imagery. To increase it, a multi-temporal set of four scenes covering the study area was processed by using a method that enhances time-invariant spatial features and reduces speckle without compromising the geometrical resolution of the images. The enhanced SAR imagery has proved to be valuable in identifying shrimp farm patterns with a field-tested accuracy of more than 90 percent. The methodology reported in this study has been tested with the ground truth obtained under operative conditions in Sri Lanka, thanks to the support of the FAO TCP/SRL/6712 project.","CNR, Ist Fis Applicata, I-50127 Florence, Italy","Profeti, G (reprint author), CNR, Ist Fis Applicata, Via Panciatichi 64, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",,,"CARLA, ROBERTO/0000-0002-4267-4762",,,,16,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-4661-0,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2003,4879,,,,,,410,418,,10.1117/12.462496,,,9,Ecology; Remote Sensing; Soil Science; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing; Agriculture; Water Resources,BW50D,WOS:000182227200043,,,,,10/31/19B,"Fravolini, A; Hultine, KR; Koepke, DF; Williams, DG",,,USDA,"Fravolini, A; Hultine, KR; Koepke, DF; Williams, DG",,,Role of soil texture on mesquite water relations and response to summer precipitation,"SANTA RITA EXPERIMENTAL RANGE: 100 YEARS (1903 TO 2003) OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS",USDA FOREST SERVICE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RESEARCH STATION PROCEEDINGS,,English,Proceedings Paper,Conference on Santa Rita Experimental Range,"OCT 30-NOV 01, 2003","Tucson, AZ","USDA Nat Resources Conservat Serv, USDA Agr Res Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Univ Arizona, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Univ Arizona, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Int Arid Lands Consortium, Arizona State Land Dept, Soc Range Management",,,SHRUBS; DROUGHT; DESERT,"In the and Southwest United States, monsoon precipitation plays a key role in ecosystem water balance and productivity. The sensitivity of deeply rooted plants to pulses of summer precipitation is, in part, controlled by the interaction between soil texture, precipitation intensity, and plant rooting depth and activity. In this study we evaluated the water relations of a leguminous tree species Prosopis velutina Wont. (velvet mesquite) occurring across three different aged soils varying in soil texture during two consecutive summers that substantially differed in the amount of monsoonal precipitation (1999 and 2000). We predicted that mesquite trees occurring on different textured geomorphic surfaces would be exposed to different levels of premonsoon water deficit and would not respond equally to summer precipitation. During both years, predawn and midday leaf water potentials were more negative on coarse textured soils than on medium and fine textured soils before the onset of the monsoon, indicating that plant water status is less favorable during drought on coarse-textured soils. However, leaf water potentials recovered rapidly on coarse-textured soils in response to monsoonal precipitation. These results suggest that mesquite sensitivity to future changes in winter and summer precipitation may not be uniform across the landscape, and that the interaction between precipitation and soil-plant hydraulic properties need to be better understood to realistically predict impacts of land cover change on ecosystem carbon and water balance.","Univ Arizona, Dept Renewable Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Fravolini, A (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Renewable Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,20,7,7,0,3,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPTL STN",FT COLLINS,"FT COLLINS, CO 80526 USA",,,,US FOR SERV RMRS-P,,,2003,,30,,,,,125,129,,,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BY79M,WOS:000189464800013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dhanai, CS; Uniyal, AK; Todaria, NP",,,,"Dhanai, CS; Uniyal, AK; Todaria, NP",,,Source variation in Albizia chinensis (Osbeck) Mer.: Seed and seedling characteristics,SILVAE GENETICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Albizia chinensis; seed source; variation; seed; germination; seedling; heritability; altitude; correlation,TRAITS; INDIA,"Effect of source (altitude as well as geographic) variation in seed morphological characteristics, germination percentage and various seedling traits among and within 13 seed sources of Albizia chinensis were examined.

After 18 months it was clear that survival in contaminated soil was greatest in the two strains originally isolated from that contaminated soil, and also by two of the strains originally isolated from uncontaminated soil. The latter two strains were also the only ones that showed changes in their plasmid profiles. The remaining isolates had the lowest populations, and their plasmid profiles were unchanged and similar to the parent strains. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The solution is complex, but if the length scales (Z(r) and Z(m); see APPENDIX for list of symbols) are equated a simple analytical expression can be obtained. This model is used to investigate relationship between a critical air-filled porosity (theta(m)) and the other parameters; viz temperature (T), O-2 concentration in the bulk soil (C*), O-2 concentration at the root surface (C-r), root length density (L), the ratio of root radius (a) to the water film radius (R), microbial respiration (M-o), and length scales (Z(m) and Z(r)) related to the depth to which microbial and plant respiration are active in the model using sensitivity analysis. The model shows that theta(m) is not very sensitive to the O-2 concentration at the root surface (C-r), or the ratio of root radius (a)/ water film radius (R), but is sensitive to all the other parameters in some part of their range. The results indicate that indices used to define soil aeration; O-2 diffusion rate (ODR) or O-2 flux, O-2 concentration, or air-filled porosity, which have been previously used, are related and a single critical value for these is unlikely. If a constant critical value exists for one of these indexes it cannot exist for the other two. It is also shown that it is highly unlikely that a universal critical parameter related to soil aeration exists for any of these parameters. It is concluded that more parameters than ODR, O-2 concentration, or air-filled porosity need to be measured if progress in soil aeration research is to be made.","CSIRO, Land & Water, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia; CSIRO, Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Cook, FJ (reprint author), CSIRO, Land & Water, 120 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.",,"Knight, John/A-3795-2008; Cook, Freeman/A-1238-2008","Knight, John/0000-0001-7170-7482; Cook, Freeman/0000-0001-6044-2079; Knight, John/0000-0003-1967-0218",,,,36,34,34,1,28,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Mutualistic interactions generate positive feedbacks on abundance and therefore are not thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity. Here, I report evidence of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the composition of their mutualistic fungal symbionts, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Negative feedback results from asymmetries in the delivery of benefit between plant and AM fungal species in which the AM fungus that grows best with the plant Plantago lanceolata is a poor growth promoter for Plantago. Growth of Plantago is, instead, best promoted by the AM fungal species that accumulate with a second plant species, Panicum sphaerocarpon. The resulting community dynamic leads to a decline in mutualistic benefit received by Plantago, and can contribute to the coexistence of these two competing plant species.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jbever@indiana.edu,,,,,,37,235,249,4,162,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In eastern North America, five sites were established in deciduous forests to provide measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) using micro-meteorological methods, and measures of major carbon pools and fluxes, using a combination of forest mensurational, eco-physiological, and other biometric methods. The five study sites, part of the AmeriFlux network, ranged across 10degrees of latitude and 18degrees of longitude, but were all of similar age, canopy height, and stand basal area. Here we present a cross-site synthesis of annual carbon storage estimates, comparing meteorological and biometric approaches, and also comparing biometric estimates based on analyses of autotrophic carbon pools and heterotrophic carbon fluxes (net ecosystem production, NEP) versus those based on measurements of change in two major carbon pools (DeltaC). Annual above-ground net primary production (ANPP) varied nearly two-fold among sites and was strongly correlated with average annual temperature and with annual soil nitrogen mineralization (N-min). Estimates of NEP ranged from 0.7 Mg C per hectare per year in northern lower Michigan to 3.5 Mg C per hectare per year in central Indiana, and were also well correlated with N-min. There was less variation among sites in estimates of DeltaC (range, 1.8-3.2 Mg C per hectare per year). In general, DeltaC more closely matched NEE than did NEP, but there was no systematic pattern among sites in over- versus under-estimation of the biometric compared to the meteorologically based measures. Root and soil carbon dynamics were significant sources of uncertainty in our biometric measures and represent a prerequisite area of study needed for accurate estimates of forest carbon storage.

In a literature review of mature forests worldwide, Raich and Nadelhoffer ( 1989) suggested that total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) could be estimated from the difference between annual rates of soil respiration and abovearound litterfall. Here we analyze new measurements of soil respiration and litterfall, including data from the Ameriflux network. Our results generally agree with Raich and Nadelhoffer's previous work. A regression analysis of data from mature forests produced the following relationship: annual soil respiration = 287 + 2.80 x annual litterfall. This regression slope indicates that, on average, soil respiration is roughly three times aboveground litterfall-C, which further implies that TBCA is roughly twice annual aboveground litterfall-C. These inferences are based on the uncertain assumption of soil C stocks being at steady state. Nevertheless, changes in soil C would have to be very large to modify the conclusion that TBCA is generally much larger than litterfall. Among only mature temperate hardwood forests, however, the correlation between litterfall and soil respiration was poor, and the correlation among years for a single site was also poor. Therefore, the regression cannot be relied upon to provide accurate estimates of soil respiration or TBCA for individual sites. Moreover, interannual variation in TBCA, short-term changes in C stocks, or different temporal scales controlling leaf litter production and soil respiration may cause important deviations from the global average. The regression slope for data from young forests is steeper, possibly indicating proportionally greater TBCA, but the steady-state assumption is more problematic for young forests. This method for estimating TBCA may be most appropriate where interannual variation is averaged over several years of observations and where a near-steady-state assumption of soil, litter, and root C stocks is least problematic.

Unfortunately, managing these weeds may also affect biodiversity adversely. A recent example occurred when glyphosate, a herbicide used to control the highly invasive weed, bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), accidentally drifted over a small population of an endangered shrub, Pimelea spicata. Following concerns that the affected population would not recover and, thereby, cause the local extinction of P. spicata, we conducted a series of glasshouse and field experiments to explore the impacts of glyphosate on this endangered species. Seedlings and young plants of P. spicata, in which the tap root was undeveloped, were killed by a single application of glyphosate. Older plants with a well developed tap root also died back initially, but about 50% of individuals re-sprouted. This re-growth was associated with a significant decrease in tap root diameter, implying that further disturbance, including repeated treatment with glyphosate, would kill plants by impairing their potential for recovery. Unlike some sclerophyllous native shrubs, the tolerance of P. spicata to glyphosate was limited, even when its growth was slowed artificially by limiting water availability. Winter applications of glyphosate to manage infestations of bitou bush will impact adversely on populations of P. spicata and may also affect the other rare and endangered species whose survival is threatened by this species, even though some natives are unaffected by the herbicide. Protecting native biodiversity from bitou bush will involve sustainable weed management that minimises impacts on non-target native species.

Such root dynamics are difficult to analyze without very fine-scaled temporal observations. To capture the behavior of short-lived and rapidly disappearing roots, we sampled minirhizotron tubes weekly for 11 months in a Pinus palustris Mill. woodland. Fine root (less than or equal to 2 mm diameter) length production and length mortality during this period were 1.57 +/- 0.23 mm.cm(-2) (mean +/- SE) and 1.19 +/- 0.17 mm.cm(-2), respectively. Depending on the type of estimate used, rapid disappearance accounted for between 21 and 37% of total fine root mortality. Rapidly disappearing roots had relatively short life-spans. a median of just 10.5 clays. Monthly sampling of the same data set underestimated length production by 15%, overestimated median root life-span by 60%, and obscured causes of root loss. If short-lived roots are not accounted for. total net primary productivity in temperate forests may be underestimated by as much as 10%.

Previous studies have shown that arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) enhance the growth of the invasive forb Centaurea maculosa when growing with native grass species. Using (CO2)-C-13 , we tested the hypothesis that this enhancement is explained by carbon transfer from native species to C. maculosa via mycorrhizal hyphal linkages. 2. A C. maculosa plant was paired with one of five native species - three grasses (Festuca idahoensis , Koeleria cristata and Pseudoroegneria spicata) and two forbs (Achillea millefolium and Gaillardia aristata)-in pots that separated the plants with either a mesh barrier (28 mum, excludes fine roots but not hyphae) or a membrane barrier (0.45 mum, excludes roots and hyphae). 3. (CO2)-C-13 was added to the atmosphere of either Centaurea or the native species after 20 weeks' growth. A 25 min pulse application was followed by 7 days' growth and subsequent harvest. 4. The biomass response of C. maculosa was consistent with previous experiments: C. maculosa was larger when growing in mesh barrier pots, when hyphae were able to access the opposite side of the pot; in mesh barrier pots only, biomass varied with neighbouring species. Native plant biomass did not vary between mesh- vs membrane-barrier pots. 5. There was no evidence of carbon transfer, either from the native plant to C. maculosa or in the reverse direction. 6. Centaurea maculosa contained significantly more phosphorus in mesh-divided pots, but this depended on the neighbouring plant. The P concentration in C. maculosa was significantly higher in mesh-divided pots when growing with a grass and not a forb. Native species contained more P in mesh-divided pots than membrane-divided pots, and P concentration differed between species (higher in forbs than grasses), but did not vary between mesh- and membrane-divided pots. 7. Our study suggests that C. maculosa is able to exploit its mycorrhizal symbiosis more effectively than the native grassland species. The mechanism for this appears to be luxury consumption of P through efficient utilization of extra-radical hyphae, but that effect is dependent on neighbouring species, and occurs when growing with a grass neighbour. 8. Although no single study can disprove the carbon-transfer hypothesis, our work suggests that AM-mediated neighbour effects are the result of mycorrhizal networks that increase species' access to P. Whether the synergistic effects of neighbours are due to complementarity of AM fungal symbionts utilized by different plant species, or have to do with the structure of AM networks that develop more extensively with multiple host plants, remains to be investigated.","Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Zabinski, CA (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",cathyz@montana.edu,"Quinn, Lauren/F-9742-2010","Quinn, Lauren/0000-0002-9349-9191",,,,46,97,106,1,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The data were used in conjunction with empirical models to determine which variables could be used to predict soil efflux in forests of contrasting ages and disturbance histories. Both stands experienced similar meteorological conditions with moderately cold wet winters and hot dry summers. Soil CO2 efflux at both sites showed large inter-annual variability that could be attributed to soil moisture availability in the deeper soil horizons (O site) and the quantity of summer rainfall (Y site). Seasonal patterns of Soil CO2 efflux at the O site showed a strong positive correlation between diel mean soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature at 64 cm depth whereas diel mean soil efflux at the Y site declined before maximum soil temperature occurred during summer drought. The use of diel mean soil temperature and soil water potential inferred from predawn foliage water potential measurements could account for 80% of the variance of diel mean soil efflux across 3 years at both sites, however, the functional shape of the soil water potential constraint was site-specific. Based on the similarity of the decomposition rates of litter and fine roots between sites, but greater productivity and amount of fine litter detritus available for decomposition at the O site, we would expect higher rates of soil CO2 efflux at the O site.

We analyse the rate at which plant-soil feedback develops in the root zone of the clonal dune grass Ammophila arenaria. 2 Ammophila arenaria grows vigorously when it can form new roots in newly deposited windblown beach sand. The colonization zone is hypothesized to provide an enemy-free space, with root pathogens and parasites possibly contributing to degeneration of A. arenaria when deposition stops. 3 We quantified root biomass and plant parasitic nematode densities in new and 1-year-old root zones, as well as in degenerate stands, in the field at monthly intervals. Each month, we studied the biomass production of Ammophila seedlings in controlled conditions in sterilized and non-sterilized soil from the different sampling sites, with and without nematicides. 4 Colonization of newly deposited sand by the endoparasitic nematodes Heterodera arenaria and Pratylenchus spp. within 1 month of root formation coincided with a negative feedback in the bioassays. Nematicides counteracted growth reduction significantly, but their effectiveness decreased in soil samples collected later in the growing season. 5 In older layers, roots and nematodes were already present before the sampling started. Growth reduction in unsterilized sand was observed at all sampling events, but was not counteracted by nematicides. 6 In the field, root biomass of A. arenaria in the newly colonized sand increased throughout the growing season, despite the development of a negative plant-soil feedback. 7 We conclude that the development of negative plant-soil feedback in the root zone of A. arenaria closely follows the colonization of newly deposited sand by roots and then by the endoparasitic nematode species Heterodera arenaria. There seems to be a shift in organisms causing this feedback during the first growing season, but root biomass nevertheless increases. However, in older root layers and in the degenerate stand, ongoing negative plant-soil feedback may contribute to a gradual decrease in root biomass.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Multitroph & Plant Micoorganism Interact, Ctr Terr Ecol, Heteren, Netherlands","van der Putten, WH (reprint author), NIOO CTO, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",,,,68,67,69,2,60,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We investigated the effect of fungicide treatment on seedlings and juveniles of the lithophytic orchid Lepanthes rupestris. As mycorrhizas, endophytes and pathogens coexist in orchids, fungicide treatment might have either a positive or negative effect on growth and survival of plants. 2 The experimental design included benomyl-treated, propiconazole-treated, and control plots. Each treatment consisted of about 140 2 x 2 cm plots divided among eight rocks, with one seedling or juvenile (occasionally two) per plot. Fungicides were applied every 2 weeks and plants were censused and measured every 3 months for 8-9 months. 3 Propiconazole-treated plants had higher mortality, significantly fewer leaves, significantly fewer fungal colonies in their roots, and significantly fewer degraded pelotons than did control plants. Benomyl-treated plants had significantly lower mortality than controls and significantly fewer fungi in leaves than control plants, and did not differ in number of degraded pelotons. There was little or no recruitment in any treatment. 4 Few potentially mycorrhizal fungi were isolated. Guignardia, Colletotrichum and Xylaria, which are generally endophytes, pathogens and/or saprotrophs, were more common. There was evidence of antagonism between Colletotrichum and Xylaria and between Colletotrichum and Guignardia. 5 Results suggest that fungi have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of L. rupestris plants. However, conclusions about the importance of mycorrhizas are complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of a range of orchid-fungus interactions.","Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Rio Piedras, PR 00931 USA; Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Humacao, PR 00791 USA","Bayman, P (reprint author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, POB 23360, Rio Piedras, PR 00931 USA.",,"Tremblay, Raymond L/Q-3763-2019","Tremblay, Raymond L/0000-0002-8588-4372",,,,47,44,52,1,22,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In the first year, we sampled newly emergent seedlings of the understory treelet Faramea occidentalis and the canopy emergent Tetragastris panamensis, from mixed seedling carpets at each of two sites. The following year we sampled surviving seedlings from these cohorts. The roots of 48 plants were analysed using AM fungal-specific primers to amplify and clone partial small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Over 1300 clones were screened for random fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) variation and 7% of these were sequenced. Compared with AM fungal communities sampled from temperate habitats using the same method, the overall diversity was high, with a total of 30 AM fungal types identified. Seventeen of these types have not been recorded previously, with the remainder being similar to types reported from temperate habitats. The tropical mycorrhizal population showed significant spatial heterogeneity and nonrandom associations with the different hosts. Moreover there was a strong shift in the mycorrhizal communities over time. AM fungal types that were dominant in the newly germinated seedlings were almost entirely replaced by previously rare types in the surviving seedlings the following year. The high diversity and huge variation detected across time points, sites and hosts, implies that the AM fungal types are ecologically distinct and thus may have the potential to influence recruitment and host composition in tropical forests.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; CEH Oxford, Oxford, England; Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Husband, R (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Young, Peter/C-1446-2012; Turner, Sarah/K-4683-2012; Gallery, Rachel E/I-2169-2014","Young, Peter/0000-0001-5259-4830; Turner, Sarah/0000-0002-8937-6922; ",,,,49,259,283,7,130,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

To improve estimates of root turnover, we present a method to distinguish current- from prior-year allocation of carbon (C) to roots in global change experiments by using changes in C-13:C-12 ratios (delta(13)C values) resulting from application of C-13-depleted, tank-derived CO2. In a 4-year study examining effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on reconstructed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga mensiezii) ecosystems, delta(13)C patterns of fine roots and foliage were measured yearly. Native soil of low nitrogen (N) content was used, so plant N supply relied on natural soil N processes. Under these N-limited conditions, elevated CO2 or temperature did not affect the proportion of fine root C derived from current- year photosynthate. Regression analyses showed that 75% of fine root C originated from current- year photosynthate. The method is useful as an independent measure of the contribution of current- year photosynthate to root C and could be used to improve estimates of root C budgets with concurrent measurements of root C pools. We calculated a C-13 enrichment of root C relative to foliar C of 2%. This enrichment agrees with prior measurements of the enrichment of heterotrophic versus autotrophic plant tissues and must be accounted for when using shifts in foliar delta(13)C to calculate inputs of plant C into the soil. This enrichment probably contributes to the progressive enrichment in C-13 with increasing depth in soil profiles.","US EPA, Natl Res Council, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Hobbie, EA (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, CSRC, EOS, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",,,,,,,43,29,32,0,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2002,247,2,,,,,233,242,,10.1023/A:1021580232181,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,624EH,WOS:000179747000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Botha, WJ; Bloem, JF; Law, IJ",,,,"Botha, WJ; Bloem, JF; Law, IJ",,,Bradyrhizobium sp (Lupinus) in the winter rainfall region of South Africa,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bradyrhizobium sp (Lupinus); Lupinus angustifolius; inoculation; genomic fingerprinting; soil rhizobia,NODULATION; RHIZOBIA; STRAINS; SOIL; INOCULATION; ORNITHOPUS; LEGUMES; DNA,"Widespread cultivation of lupin has resulted in the establishment of effective populations of Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus) in the winter rainfall region of the Western Cape, South Africa. To determine whether inoculation increased yields of Lupinus angustifolius L., field trials were carried out at five sites in this region. Populations ranged from 380 rhizobia g(-1) in a moderately alkaline (pH 7.6) soil to >5,000 rhizobia g(-1) in four moderately acid (pH 5.5-5.8) soils. Soil isolates were generally similar to the inoculant strain WU425 in nitrogen-fixing effectiveness but several were significantly less effective. Average effectiveness of isolates from certain soils differed significantly. Although inoculation failed to appreciably increase nodule occupancy by WU425 in acid soils containing high populations of rhizobia, nodule occupancy was increased to 98% in the low population alkaline soil. The latter site was later abandoned because of disease. At the other sites, analysis of seed dry mass and protein content showed that yields were not significantly increased by either inoculation, nitrogen fertiliser (45 kg N ha(-1)) or molybdenum applications. Analysis of genomic DNA by PCR fingerprinting showed that WU425 (isolated in Western Australia) and serologically related strains from other cultures clustered separately from the soil isolates. Isolates from the four acid soils were genomically diverse, whereas isolates from the alkaline soil formed a homogeneous cluster. Further investigation is required to determine the benefit of inoculation in alkaline soils of the winter rainfall region of the Western Cape.","ARC, Plant Protect Res Inst, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Law, IJ (reprint author), ARC, Plant Protect Res Inst, Private Bag X134, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,30,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Accordingly, global CO budgets have been reasonably well documented. Atmospheric CO consumption by soils contributes significantly to these budgets, with the magnitude of the sink generally considered to reflect a balance between microbial uptake and abiological production. However, assays of live fine roots showed that diverse intact plants produced carbon monoxide at net rates ranging from 2 to 3000 mmug gdw(--1) d(--1) . CO production was greater for legumes than nonlegumes, and primarily associated with nodules. Excised roots from woody and herbaceous plants produced CO at comparable rates. CO production rates were similar for roots of intact plants and roots excised from those plants. The magnitude of net CO fluxes from roots was determined in part by the balance between simultaneous production and consumption. Surface sterilization of roots indicated that CO consumption was due, in part, rhizoplane CO-oxidizing bacteria, but maximum CO consumption rates were typically only a small fraction of net production rates. Assays in a Brazilian agroecosystem indicated that root CO production affects soil-atmosphere CO exchange. Estimates of global CO production rates indicated that roots contribute about 170-260 Tg CO to the soil atmosphere annually, an amount comparable to current estimates of atmospheric CO uptake by soils, and much larger than estimates of net abiological soil CO production.","Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA","King, GM (reprint author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.",,,"Crosby, Heidi/0000-0002-0360-0779",,,,39,21,21,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

This study aimed to increase our understanding of both the functional responses and restoration potential of mesic meadow systems in central Nevada, USA. Nitrogen addition and clipping treatments were used to examine grazing effects, while aeration and revegetation were included to evaluate potential restoration treatments. Belowground response was determined by examining gravimetric soil water content and rooting depth and activity. Aboveground response was determined for two key mesic meadow species, Carex nebrascensis and Poa pratensis, by quantifying gas exchange and water relations. Large yearly and seasonal differences among water tables largely determined the rooting activity and depth in these mesic meadows and influenced treatment responses. Little rooting activity occurred within or at the surface of the water table and rooting depth increased as water table level lowered during the growing season. In general, nitrogen addition decreased rooting activity and depth relative to controls. It resulted in less negative water potentials and photosynthetic rates that were higher early in the growing season, but lower later in the growing season. The effects of nitrogen addition could be attributed to accelerated phenology and earlier senescence. Clipping resulted in less negative plant water potentials in Carex and Poa, and Poa had higher photosynthetic rates immediately after clipping but only for certain dates and comparisons. Aeration increased rooting activity and depth where there was no confounding effect of water table. Also, predawn and midday water potentials were generally less negative for Carex and Poa in aerated plots. Establishment on the revegetation plots was dominated by annual and early seral species and, consequently, these plots exhibited reduced rooting depth and activity early in the growing season and high root turnover. Results indicate that water table depth and its effects on soil water are dominant factors in determining the functional processes and recovery potentials of these riparian meadows. Clipping had minimal effects on above- and belowground responses, perhaps because clipping was performed late in the growing season after plants had begun to senescence. Nitrogen addition decreased rooting activity and altered phenology, indicating deleterious effects. Aeration was effective at overcoming some of the negative affects of overgrazing and may be an effective restoration treatment. However, revegetation may have limited potential due to establishment constraints of the dominant species.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Reno, NV 89512 USA; Univ Nevada, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Reno, NV 89512 USA","Chambers, J (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 920 Valley Rd, Reno, NV 89512 USA.",,,,,,,42,16,20,0,34,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,NOV,2002,163,1,,,,,77,91,,10.1023/A:1020372220163,,,15,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,597TL,WOS:000178236800007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kuzyakov, Y",,,,"Kuzyakov, Y",,,Separating microbial respiration of exudates from root respiration in non-sterile soils: a comparison of four methods,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,separation methods; root respiration; rhizosphere respiration; rhizodeposition; root exudates; C-14 pulse labeling; Lolium perenne; C turnover,LOLIUM-PERENNE; RHIZOSPHERE RESPIRATION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; CARBON TURNOVER; RHIZODEPOSITION; TRANSLOCATION; RELEASE; PLANTS; FLOWS,"Partitioning the root-derived CO2 efflux from the soil into actual root respiration (RR) and microbial respiration of exudates and root residues is very important for determining the carbon (C) and energy balance of soils. Studies based on artificial root environments like hydroponics or sterile soils give unrealistic figures for C partitioning and are unsuitable for predicting C flows under natural conditions. To date, only four methods have been suggested to separate RR and rhizomicrobial respiration in non-sterile soils: (1) the isotope dilution method, (2) the model rhizodeposition technique, (3) modeling of (CO2)-C-14 efflux dynamics, and (4) the exudate elation procedure. All four methods are based on the pulse labeling of shoots in a (CO2)-C-14 atmosphere and subsequent monitoring of (CO2)-C-14 efflux from the soil. However, the basic assumptions and principles of these methods, as well as the results observed in the original papers, all differ from one another. This study describes the separation of RR of Lolium perenne grown on a loamy Haplic Luvisol from microbial respiration of rhizodeposits by means of all four methods under the same experimental conditions. In spite of alternative principles, the isotope dilution and the (CO2)-C-14 dynamics methods show a similar level of RR: accordingly 39 and 45% of total root-derived CO2 efflux were accounted for by RR. The remainder is rhizomicrobial respiration. The exudate elution method, which underestimates the total rhizodeposition, shows that at least 19% of root-derived CO2 is produced by exudate decomposition. The microbial respiration of rhizodeposits calculated using the model rhizodeposition technique is also underestimated. The exudate elution method is the only procedure allowing physical separation of both C flows. The assumptions and principles of all four methods are reviewed and the effects of possible shortcomings on the separation results are discussed. In conclusion, RR contributes about 40-50% to the root-derived CO2 efflux. The remaining 50-60% comprise the microbial decomposition of root exudates and other rhizodeposits. The longer the period of monitoring the CO2 efflux after the pulse labeling is, the higher the contribution of rhizomicrobial respiration to the total root-derived CO2 efflux from soil.

Microbial biomass C (MBC) and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarkers for total biomass, bacteria, and fungi were used as indicators of soil microbial community abundance and structure. In soil 20 years after reclamation FAME total microbial biomass, bacterial and fungal biomarkers, MBC and soil organic matter (SOM) averaged only 20, 16, 28, 44 and 36% of values found in undisturbed soils. In contrast to undisturbed soils, FAME biomarkers and MBC of reclaimed soils exhibited spatial correlation up to 42 cm. Reclaimed soils also exhibited localized enrichment of bacterial, fungal, and total microbial biomass, as well as depletion of inorganic N concentrations, around plant bases (< 10 cm), suggesting relatively poor soil exploration by roots and microorganisms compared to the undisturbed ecosystem. Strong spatial stratification of undisturbed SOM and soil NH4+ pools was found with highest concentrations on the leeward side of shrubs, likely due to localized changes in microclimate and plant litter deposition. This indicates that shrub cover plays a central role in the establishment of site heterogeneity and regulation of ecological processes, such as C and N mineralization and immobilization, which has important implications for reclamation.

Isolates representative of the diverse 16S rRNA groups from the various soils were selected for sequence analysis of the first 750 bp of the 16S rRNA. Compatible rhizobia were detected in only 15 out of 55 soils, and were present generally in soils with more than 10% clay, and those from low-lying areas. Populations were small, generally much less than 50 cells g(-1) soil. The rhizobia nodulating S. sesban were genetically diverse, with isolates bearing 16S rRNA sequences similar to those of rhizobia belonging to the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Allorhizobium. About 1% of the isolates recovered had sequences with close homology with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Despite the wide phylogenetic distribution of the rhizobial isolates, the Mesorhizobium group was dominant in all soils examined, accounting for 90% of the isolates on average, with individual soil populations usually being comprised of two genera.

We measured rates of denitrification, potential denitrification, N2O fluxes, NH3 volatilization, and net mineralization in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem with elevated CO2 (Free Air Carbon Enrichment technology) over 2 y. All measurements were performed on soil under four different cover types: Larrea tridentata; Lycium spp.; Pleuraphis rigida; and plant interspaces. The mean rate of denitrification was 161 +/- 96 mug N m(-2) d(-1). Field fluxes of N2O occurred sporadically, with a mean of 30 +/- 20 mug N m(-2) d(-1). Rates of NH3 volatilization experienced less variability than did N2O fluxes, with a mean of 120 +/- 45 mug N m(-2) d(-1). Mean potential denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was 146 +/- 8 mg N m(-2) d(-1). Rates of net mineralization were highest in soil under L. tridentata and Lycium spp. (398 +/- 108 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and lowest in the plant interspaces (129 +/- 28 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). There was no effect of elevated CO2 on N2O fluxes. or mineralization rates. There was a 39% increase in NH3 volatilization with elevated CO2 during March 2000. Potential DEA increased by 193% with elevated CO2 in October 1999 and decreased by 45% in March 2001. These results suggest that NH3 volatilization may be a more important component of aridland gaseous N emissions than previously thought, and that the potential for high DEA does not necessarily induce large fluxes of N2O under natural conditions, especially in aridlands where rainfall primarily occurs in winter when soil temperatures can limit microbial activity. This study also suggests that the effects of elevated CO2 on soil microbial activity may not be consistent for all seasons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To test this idea, we studied microbial activity beneath trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) growing under experimental atmospheric CO2 (ambient and 522.7 muL L-1) and O-3 (ambient and 54.5 nL L-1). To assess changes in microbial community function, we measured microbial biomass, respiration, and the metabolism of root-derived substrates using BIOLOG GN microplates. We also measured the activity of phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, a-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase enzymes, which are involved in plant and fungal litter decomposition. Microbial biomass and respiration were not significantly altered by elevated CO2 and O-3. Cellobiohydrolase activity significantly increased under elevated CO2; however, this response was eliminated by elevated O-3. N-acetylglucosaminidase activity also increased under elevated CO2, but elevated O-3 did not significantly alter this response. We found no difference in the metabolism of amino acids, organic acids, and simple carbohydrates, suggesting our experimental treatments did not alter the use of these substrates by soil microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that changes in plant growth in response to elevated CO2 and O-3 alters microbial metabolism in soil.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Toledo, Dept Earth Ecol & Environm Sci, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,47,97,118,2,56,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Net primary productivity (NPP) of a closed-canopy Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand was assessed. for three years in a free-air CO2-enrichment (FACE) experiment. NPP increased 21 % in. stands exposed to elevated CO2, and there was no loss of response over time. Wood increment increased significantly during the first year of exposure, but subsequently most of the extra C was allocated to production of leaves and fine roots. These pools turn over more rapidly than wood, thereby reducing the potential of the forest stand to sequester additional C in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Hence, while this experiment provides the first evidence that CO2 enrichment can increase productivity in a closed-canopy deciduous forest, the implications of this result must be tempered because the increase in productivity resulted, in faster cycling of C through the system rather than increased C storage in wood. The fate of the additional C entering the soil system and the environmental interactions that influence allocation need further investigation.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Nevada, Dept Environm & Resource Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Norby, RJ (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",,"Wullschleger, Stan/B-8297-2012; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012; Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011; Hanson, Paul J.

The ""reoccurring rhizosphere"" for first-, second- and third-order roots of select loblolly pines (Pinus taeda L.) were examined on sandy, loamy sand and sandy loam soils. A significant carbon build up next to the root orders was confirmed for the sandy and loamy sand soils. The carbon build up was substantial (55% increase) next to the first-order roots of the sandy soil. However, the sandy loam soil did not display a significant amount of carbon build up next to the root orders. Extraction of the soil samples with supercritical freon-22 showed that the additional carbon in the ""reoccurring rhizosphere"" was highly soluble. Approximately 60% of the total soil carbon was extracted from the sandy and loamy sand soils, while approximately 40% was extracted from the sandy loam soil. A qualitative comparison of the extracts by liquid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the ""reoccurring rhizosphere"" region had a higher relative proportion of labile materials (i.e. carbohydrates, proteins, etc.) than the bulk soil. This information coupled with the high solubility in supercritical freon-22 suggests that the carbon build up in the ""reoccurring rhizosphere"" region of loblolly pines may be transient in nature.

Root water uptake is a key process in the circulation of water in forest ecosystems. Until recently, water absorption by tree fine roots could not be measured in situ in undisturbed soil. 2. We present a new technique that allows continuous recording of the water absorption of fine root endings in mature stands without altering soil structure, hydrology or mycorrhizal infection. 3. The approach combines miniature sap-flow gauges mounted on small-diameter tree roots (3-4 mm) with a complete extraction and visual surface analysis of the adjacent absorbing fine root endings. This technique yields continuous data on water absorption per fine root surface area, and allows analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of root water uptake in the rhizosphere of forests. 4. We present the results of laboratory and field calibration experiments with Fagus sylvatica L. roots (3-4 mm), which show a good agreement between gauge flow data and synchronous gravimetric flow measurements for flows between 2 and >50 g h(-1) . Gauge readings were unreliable during low flows (<2 g h(-1) ) at night. In these periods, which cover approximate to10% of daily flow, we used an empirically derived linear relationship between root temperature difference and flow. 5. Measurements on F. sylvatica root endings during 10 summer days showed daily water absorption maxima ranging between 0.20 (rainy days) and 0.58 mmol m(-2) root surface area s(-1) (bright or overcast days). The corresponding daily maxima of leaf transpiration rate were approximate to10 times higher (2-4 mmol m(-2) leaf area s(-1) ). 6.

Prior attempts to explain shifts in root and shoot competition along gradients have generally assumed an additive interaction between the two competitive forms, using an experimental design which does not fully separate both above- and belowground processes. At the most basic level, few field studies have separated root and shoot competition, and we have limited knowledge about both the relative importance of these processes, and how they interact to affect plant growth in the field. Presented here are findings front a field study in which root and shoot competition were experimentally separated by using root exclusion tubes and neighbor tiebacks in an early successional community. Individuals of four species (Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Rumex crispus, and Plantago lanceolata) were grown at two levels of fertilization with full competition, aboveground competition only, belowground competition only, or neither above- nor belowground competition. Competition was measured as competitive response, which is the natural log of the relative biomass of a target plant grown with competition compared to growth without competition. In contrast to predictions from current models of productivity-competition relationships, but in agreement with other experimental studies, there was no change in the strengths or root, shoot, or total competition with a modest increase in productivity. Despite no effect of fertilization on the strength of competition, the form of interaction between root and shoot competition varied both as a function of species identity and fertilization. For both of the rosette forming species, the combined effects of root and shoot competition were less than predicted assuming no interaction (a ""negative interaction""), with one species switching from a negative to an additive interaction with fertilization. The fact that fertilization caused a shift in the root-shoot interaction, but not in the total strength of root and shoot competition, suggests that the root-shoot interaction is itself a highly labile variable. If root-shoot interactions are common in natural systems, then simply measuring the strength of one form of competition in no way provides any information about the overall importance of that competitive form to plant growth.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Cahill, JF (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",jc.cahill@ualberta.ca,"Shankar, EM/G-6444-2011; Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015; Shankar, Esaki M/B-3132-2019","Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516; Shankar, Esaki M/0000-0002-7866-9818",,,,60,74,86,3,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2002,99,1,,,,,101,112,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990111.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,609BQ,WOS:000178883100011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Marschner, P; Neumann, G; Kania, A; Weiskopf, L; Lieberei, R",,,,"Marschner, P; Neumann, G; Kania, A; Weiskopf, L; Lieberei, R",,,Spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community structure in the rhizosphere of cluster roots of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.),PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,bacteria; cluster roots; community structure; DGGE; fungi; organic acids; rhizosphere; white lupin,ACID-PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY; PROTEOID ROOTS; DNA FRAGMENTS; PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; PCR; ACQUISITION; INTERFACE,"White lupin was grown in a quartz sand-soil mix with poorly available Ca phosphate.

After confirming their nodulation and nitrogen-fixing abilities, they were identified,by 16S rRNA gene analysis as Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium gallicum, and Rhizobium galegae. Using these local isolates, the distribution of the activities of both NAD(+)-dependent (DME: EC 1.1.1.39) and NADP(+)-dependent (TME: EC 1.1.1.40) malic enzymes was surveyed. The malic enzyme activities were present in all the isolated rhizobia and in other 17 local Bradyrhizobium strains in Thailand. In almost all the rhizobia, the DME activity predominated whereas the TME activity predominated only in the Rhizobium gallicum strains that were major symbionts of Sesbania rostrata. Southern hybridization analysis was performed to survey the distribution of the malic enzyme genes among the local rhizobia, which are similar to those of B. japonicum. DNA probes (ME1 for DME and ME2 for TME) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerated primers from conserved regions of the protein sequences of bacterial malic enzymes. Southern blot analysis with ME1 as a probe showed a single band in about half of the isolates, especially in B. japonicum and R. leguminosarum strains, suggesting the wide distribution of such DME genes among local rhizobia. In contrast, Southern blot analysis with ME2 as a probe detected a single band only in five B. japonicum strains, suggesting that the TME genes, which are similar to those of B. japonicum, would be unique in a group of B. japonicum.","Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agro Ind, Dept Biotechnol, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand; Biol Nigrogen Fixat Resource Ctr, Soil Sci Div, Dept Agr, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Chiang Mai 50000, Thailand; Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Life Sci, Kagawa 7610795, Japan","Tajima, S (reprint author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agro Ind, Dept Biotechnol, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand.",,,,,,,31,4,4,0,6,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Drier conditions may affect several plant and soil microbial processes, including soil emissions of CO2, CH4, NO, and N2O. We report here unanticipated results of a pilot study that was initiated to test the feasibility of a larger-scale throughfall exclusion experiment. In particular, soil drying caused a switch from net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by soils in the control plot to net CH4 emission from soils in the experimentally dried plot. This result is surprising because production of CH4 requires anaerobic microsites, which are uncommon in dry soil. A plausible explanation for increased CH4 emissions in the dried plot is that dry soil conditions favor termite activity and increased coarse root mortality provides them with a substrate. Another surprise was,that both NO and N2O fluxes were elevated several years after initiation of the drying experiment. Apparently, a pulse of N availability caused by experimental drying persisted for at least 3 years. As expected, CO2 emissions were lower in the dried plots, which is consistent with lower rates of root growth observed in root in-growth cores placed in the dried plots. More work is needed to test these explanations and to confirm these phenomena, but these results demonstrate that changes in climate could have unanticipated effects on biogeochemical processes in soils that we do not adequately understand.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Inst Pesquisas Ambiental Amazonia, BR-66035170 Belem, Para, Brazil; Int Ctr Res Agroforestry, Nairobi, Kenya; Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Davidson, EA (reprint author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",edavidson@whrc.org,"Cattanio, Jose Henrique/B-6176-2015; Davidson, Eric A/K-4984-2013","Cattanio, Jose Henrique/0000-0001-8335-9593; Davidson, Eric A/0000-0002-8525-8697; Verchot, Louis/0000-0001-8309-6754",,,,37,29,30,1,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

I-214 (cv. Italica) and P. 'popularis 35-44' (P. popularis). Relative growth rates of leaf area (RGR(A)) and shoot height (RGR(H)) Of cv. Italica and P popularis were severely restricted by increasing salinity, whereas in P euphratica both were not significantly inhibited. Salinised trees of P euphratica experienced 10% leaf area loss during a 30-day study, however, cv. Italica and P. popularis shed over 50% of their initial surface area. Leaf necrosis of the two salt-sensitive genotypes (cv. Italica and P. popularis) was attributed to excessive salt accumulation and reduced water loss. The rapid built-up of leaf salt in these two genotypes was mainly the result of high ion concentrations in the transpiration stream. An artificially generated lower shoot-to-root ratio, which was reached by removing approximately 50% of total leaf area from shoots of cv. Italica and P popularis prior to the salt treatment did not enhance their salinity tolerance since root-to-shoot salt fluxes were largely independent of water flow. Compared with cv. ltalica and P. popularis, P. euphratica maintained considerably higher unit leaf transpiration rates with lower salt concentrations in the transpiration stream during the period of salt stress. Therefore, salt tolerance of P. euphratica likely depends on its ability to restrict salt transport to leaves. X-ray microanalysis of root compartments showed that there was genotypic difference in the pattern of ion compartmentation. Cv. Italica exhibited a greater capacity to accumulate salt in cortical vacuoles compared with P. popularis, even though both were considered as salt-sensitive genotypes. P euphratica was more effective than the other two genotypes to block apoplasmic ion transport and sequester Cl- in cortical vacuoles at high salinity. These limited ion loading into the xylem during radial transport, and thus contributed to the restriction of subsequent axial transport. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results showed that the dual inoculation significantly improved plant growth for all provenances. When the plants were transferred into 20 1 pots filled with a nonsterilized soil, the positive effect on the plant growth of the dual inoculation disappeared and no significant difference was recorded between the plants inoculated with the fungus alone and those inoculated with both Bradyrhizobium and the ectomycorrhizal fungus. However, the microbial biomass, the nitrogen contents, the number of nodules per plant and the structure of the nematode communities were significantly influenced by the A. mangium provenances and the microbial treatments. The impact of controlled mycorrhization of different A. mangium provenances on soil biofunctioning is discussed in terms of plant growth, microbial and nematode biodiversity.

To examine the geographic and vertical patterns of delta(13)C under mature rain forest vegetation, we measured the isotopic composition of leaf litter, roots, and mineral soil profiles in 35 plots located in a 140,000-ha study region in northeastern Costa Rica. We hypothesized that soil carbon isotopic composition would be closely coupled to the signature of detrital inputs (the average delta(13)C of forest floor and fine-root biomass) and that the increase in delta(13)C with depth would be related to abiotic variables that influence soil carbon turnover rates. The correlations between surface soil isotopic composition (0-10 cm) and biophysical factors varied across the landscape. In multiple regression analyses, combinations of soil particle-size distribution and soil C/N ratio explained between 60% and 82% of the variation in surface soil isotopic composition for different regions in the landscape, but the isotopic composition of litter and roots did not explain any additional variation. The isotopic composition of litter, roots, and surface soils (0-20 cm) was fairly similar over large, regional gradients of elevation and edaphic properties (the range of variation was 2.6parts per thousand), but diverged considerably at depths below 20 cm (up to 5.8parts per thousand differences). These large regional differences in the isotopic composition of soil C at depth are attributed to variation in soil carbon turnover rates across the landscape. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the factors that may stabilize mutualistic interactions is when individuals preferentially reward more mutualistic (beneficial) behaviour and/or punish less mutualistic (more parasitic) behaviour. We develop a model that shows how such sanctions provide a fitness benefit to the individuals that carry them out. Although this approach could be applied to a number of symbioses, we focus on how it could be applied to the legume-rhizobia interaction. Specifically, we demonstrate how plants can be selected to supply preferentially more resources to (or be less likely to senesce) nodules that are fixing more N-2 (termed plant sanctions). We have previously argued that appreciable levels of N-2 fixation by rhizobia are only likely to be selected for in response to plant sanctions. Therefore, by showing that plant sanctions can also be favoured by natural selection, we are able to provide an explanation for the stability of the plant-legume mutualism.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell Anim & Populat Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","West, SA (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Cell Anim & Populat Biol, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"West, Stuart A/M-3608-2014; Toby, Kiers/H-4819-2017; Pen, Ido/F-2478-2010","West, Stuart A/0000-0003-2152-3153; Toby, Kiers/0000-0002-0597-1653; ",,,,49,124,128,1,67,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1010-061X,,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

However, this has not been shown for achlorophyllous orchids associating with species of Rhizoctonia , a complex of basal lineages of hymenomycetes that are the most common orchid partners. We analysed Neottia nidus-avis , an achlorophyllous orchid symbiotic with a Rhizoctonia , to identify its symbionts by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. Analysis of 61 root systems from 23 French populations showed that N. nidus-avis associates highly specifically with a group of species of Sebacinaceae. Their diversity emphasizes the need for further investigations in the Sebacinaceae systematics. Sebacinoid ITS sequences were often identical within orchid populations and a trend to regional variation in symbionts was observed. Using ITS and intergenic spacer (IGS) polymorphism, we showed that each root system harboured a single species, but that several genets colonized it. However, no polymorphism of these markers was found among portions of each root: this is consistent with the putative mode of entry of the fungus, i.e. from the rhizome into roots but not repeatedly from the soil. In addition, ectomycorrhizae were always found within the N. nidus-avis root systems: 120 of the 144 ectomycorrhizae typed by ITS sequencing were colonized by a sebacinoid fungus identical in ITS sequence to the respective orchid symbiont (even for the IGS polymorphism in some cases). Because sebacinoids were demonstrated recently to be ectomycorrhizal, the orchid is likely to derive its resources from surrounding trees, a mycorrhizal cheating strategy similar to other myco-heterotrophic plants studied to date.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat, CNRS, IFR 1541, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Lehrstuhl Spezielle Bot & Mykol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; INRA, Ctr Rech Forestieres Nancy, Equipe Microbiol Forestiere, Unite Rech Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Selosse, MA (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat, CNRS, IFR 1541, 43 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",,"WeiSS, Michael/F-6206-2012","WeiSS, Michael/0000-0002-4869-9186; Jany, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-9132-2555",,,,49,163,179,0,23,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

This is in contrast to earlier studies at this site that showed inoculum levels to be significantly higher at 2 m from the forest edge, within the rooting zone of forest trees. We hypothesize that the difference here is due either to (i) competition between native ectomycorrhizal fungi and the ectomycorrhizal fungi present on the spruce at planting or (ii) more homogeneous levels of inoculum in the mineral soil exposed by mounding. Fewer native fungi colonized these seedlings than the nonmycorrhizal seedlings from earlier studies, which had been planted between the mounds.","Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Jones, MD (reprint author), Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184; Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126",,,,47,17,19,1,11,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The six species studied were trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch.), and willow (Salix spp.). Stands ranged in age from 4 to 130 years and were categorized as well or poorly drained. Stem diameter ranged from 0.1 to 23.7 cm. Stem diameter was measured at both the soil surface (D-0) and breast height (DBH). The relationship between biomass and diameter, fitted on a log-log scale, changed significantly at similar to3 cm DBH, suggesting that allometry differed between saplings and older trees. To eliminate this nonlinearity, a model of form log(10) Y = a + b(log(10) D) + c(AGE) + d(log(10) D x AGE) was used, where D is stem diameter, AGE is stand age, and the cross product is the interaction between diameter and age. Most aboveground biomass equations (N = 326) exhibited excellent fits (R-2 > 0.95). Coarse root biomass equations (N = 205) exhibited good fits (R-2 > 0.90). Both D-0 and DBH were excellent (R-2 > 0.95) sapwood area predictors (N = 413). Faster growing species had significantly higher ratios of sapwood area to stem area than did slower growing species. Nonlinear aspects of some of the pooled biomass equations serve as a caution against extrapolating allometric equations beyond the original sample diameter range.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Bond-Lamberty, B (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426",,,,49,148,180,2,74,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The goal of this study was to extend such analyses to the belowground structure of vegetation by determining the biotic and abiotic factors that influence vertical root distributions in them soil, including soil, climate, and plant properties. The analysis used a database of vertical root profiles from the literature with 475 profiles from 209 geographic locations. Since most profiles were not sampled to the maximum rooting depth, several techniques were used to estimate the amount of roots at greater depths, to a maximum of 3 in in some systems. The accuracy of extrapolations was tested using a subset of deeply (>2 m) sampled or completely sampled profiles. Vertical root distributions for each profile were characterized by the interpolated 50% and 95% rooting depths (the depths above which 50% or 95% of all roots were located). General linear models incorporating plant life-form dominance, climate, and soil variables explained as much as 50% of the variance in rooting depths for various biomes and life-forms. Annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation together accounted for the largest proportion of the variance (12-16% globally and 38% in some systems). Mean 95% rooting depths increased with decreasing latitude from 80degrees to 30degrees but showed no clear trend in the tropics. Annual PET, annual precipitation, and length of the warm season were all positively correlated with rooting depths. Rooting depths in tropical vegetation were only weakly correlated with climatic variables but were strongly correlated with sampling depths, suggesting that even after extrapolation, sampling depths there were often insufficient to characterize root profiles. Globally, >90% of all profiles had at least 50% of all roots in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile (including organic horizons) and 95% of all roots in the upper 2 m. Deeper rooting depths were mainly found in water-limited ecosystems. Deeper 95% rooting depths were also found for shrublands compared to grasslands, in sandy soils vs. clay or loam soils, and in systems with relatively shallow organic horizons compared with deeper organic horizons.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Schenk, HJ (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Wrigley Inst Environm Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",schenk@wrigley.usc.edu,"Schenk, H.

Pinus ponderosa occurs in a range of contrasting environments in the western USA. Xeric populations typically have lower leaf : sapwood area ratio (A (L) /A (S) ) and higher whole-tree leaf specific hydraulic conductance (K (L) ) than mesic populations. These climate-driven shifts in hydraulic architecture are considered adaptive because they maintain minimum leaf water potential above levels that cause xylem cavitation. 2. Using a common garden study, we examined whether differences in biomass allocation and hydraulic architecture between P. ponderosa populations originating from isolated outcrops in the Great Basin desert and Sierran montane environments were caused by ecotypic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity. To determine if populations were genetically differentiated and if phenotypic and genetic differentiation coincided, we also characterized the genetic structure of these populations using DNA microsatellites. 3. Phenotypic differentiation in growth, biomass allocation and hydraulic architecture was variable among populations in the common garden. There were no systematic differences between desert and montane climate groups that were consistent with adaptive expectations. Drought had no effect on the root : shoot and needle : stem ratio, but reduced seedling biomass accumulation, leaf area ratio, A (L) /A (S) and K (L) . Stem hydraulic conductance (K (H) ) was strongly size-dependent, and was lower in droughted plants, primarily because of lower growth. 4. Although microsatellites were able to detect significant non-zero (P < 0.001) levels of differentiation between populations, these differences were small and were not correlated with geographic separation or climate group. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations were low (<5%), and almost all the genetic variation (>95%) resided within populations, suggesting that gene flow was the dominant factor shaping genetic structure. 5. These results indicate that biomass allocation and hydraulic differences between desert and montane populations are not the result of ecotypic differentiation. Significant drought effects on leaf : sapwood allocation and K (L) suggest that phenotypic differentiation between desert and montane climates could be the result of phenotypic plasticity.","Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Mol Biol Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Maherali, H (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90340, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",maherali@duke.edu,,,,,,69,32,34,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The study sites are shown to be representative of the environment and structure of the eucalypt woodlands in the defined study area. Mean basal area increment for all live woody plants in 30 long-term sites, with an average initial basal area of 11.86 +/- 1.38 (SE) m(2) ha(-1), was 1.06 m(2) ha(-1) over a mean 14 years timeframe. The majority of the measurement period, commencing between 1982 and 1988, was characterized by below-average rainfall. The increase in live tree basal area was due primarily to growth of existing trees (3.12 m(2) ha(-1) ) rather than establishment of new plants (0.25 m(2) ha(-1) ) and was partly offset by death (2.31 m(2) ha(-1)). A simple but robust relationship between stand basal area and stand biomass of all woody species was developed for the eucalypt dominant woodlands. Analysis of above-ground carbon stocks in live and standing dead woody plants gave a mean net above-ground annual carbon increment for all 57 sites of 0.53 t C ha(-1) y(-1), similar to values estimated elsewhere in world savannas. Published root : shoot ratios were used to infer C flux in woody root systems on these sites. This results in an estimated sink in above- and below-ground biomass of 18 Mt C y(-1) over the eucalypt woodlands studied, and potentially up to 35 Mt C y(-1) if extended to all grazed woodlands in Queensland. It is suggested that introduction of livestock grazing and altered fire regimes have triggered the change in tree-grass dominance in these woodlands. Thus, change in carbon stocks in the grazed woodlands of Queensland is identified as an important component of human-induced greenhouse gas flux in Australia, equivalent in magnitude to c.25% of the most recently published (1999) total estimated national net emissions. The latter inventory takes into account emissions from land clearing, but does not include the sink identified in the present study. This sequestration also represents a small but significant contribution to the global terrestrial carbon sink.","Queensland Beef Ind Inst, Dept Primary Ind, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; Queensland Dept Nat Resources & Mines, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia","Burrows, WH (reprint author), Queensland Beef Ind Inst, Dept Primary Ind, POB 6014,CQ Mail Ctr, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",,,,,,,54,129,137,2,34,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The leaf area of plants in fragments also increased at half the rate it did in continuous forest sites. 3 It appears that the normal dry season stresses to which forest understorey plants are exposed are greatly exacerbated in fragments, causing plants to shed shoots and leaves. 4 The observed shifts in size could help explain why populations in fragments are more skewed towards smaller demographic stage classes than those in continuous forest. These shifts in size structure could also result in reduced abundances of flowering plants, as reproduction in H. acuminata is positively correlated with shoot number. 5 Fragmentation-related changes in growth rates resulting from abiotic stress may have significant demographic consequences.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; INPA, PDBFF, Biol Dynam Forest Fragments Project, BR-69011970 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Ecol, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil","Bruna, EM (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,"Bruna, Emilio M/H-2769-2012; Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Bruna, Emilio M/0000-0003-3381-8477; Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,54,25,27,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

For decades, the paradigm has been that the biomass of fine roots of trees turns over several times a year, which together with large inputs of above-ground litter leaves little room for the contribution from root respiration. Here, we combine the results of a recent tree girdling experiment with the C budget of the classic Swedish Coniferous Forest (SWECON) project, in which root growth and turnover were estimated to be high. We observe that such a high rate of root turnover requires an unlikely high C use efficiency for root growth, and is not consistent with the 1:1 relation between root: heterotrophic respiration obtained in the girdling experiment. Our analysis suggests that 75% of the C allocated to roots is respired, while 25% is used for growth, and hence that root growth and turnover were grossly overestimated in the SWECON study.","SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, Sect Soil Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; SLU, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Hogberg, P (reprint author), SLU, Dept Forest Ecol, Sect Soil Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719",,,,16,83,112,3,53,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2002,132,4,,,,,579,581,,10.1007/s00442-002-0983-8,,,3,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,591EE,WOS:000177866100012,28547644,,,,10/31/19J,"Hertel, D; Leuschner, C",,,,"Hertel, D; Leuschner, C",,,"A comparison of four different fine root production estimates with ecosystem carbon balance data in a Fagus-Quercus mixed forest (vol 239, pg 237, 2002)",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Correction,,,,,,,,,"Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hertel, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,1,1,1,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2002,245,2,,,,,335,335,,,,,1,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,603GT,WOS:000178551200013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Yamakawa, T; Ishizuka, J",,,,"Yamakawa, T; Ishizuka, J",,,Effect of nodulation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Shinorhizobium fredii on xylem sap composition of Peking (Glycine max L.

In fine roots from mineral soils, significantly positive correlations between fine root elements and the soil pH occurred for Ca and Mg, as well as for the Ca/Al molar ratio, while significantly negative correlations occurred for the micronutrients and the heavy metals, in particular for Cu and Pb. In fine roots from the organic layer, most of the fine root elements were not or only weakly correlated with the pH, as well as the Ca/Al molar ratio. Fine root starch concentrations were highly significant positive correlated with the fine root elements Al, Fe, and Mo, whereas the fine root 'vitality' was it with P and K.

Cowpea bradyrhizobia in 20 soils in Ghana were enumerated and isolates from nodules of cowpea grown in these soils were examined in sand for symbiotic effectiveness. The 100 isolates examined varied greatly with estimated values for effectiveness, relative to an uninoculated control, ranging from 23.5 to 118%. The isolates thus ranged from ineffective to highly effective, but with most of them (68%) being ranked as moderately effective and with the highly effective ones constituting only 26% of the 100 isolates studied. The results obtained raise an important question, whether the 26% highly effective bradyrhizobia are capable of satisfying optimum N requirements from symbiotic N-2 fixation. Diversity of the isolates in symbiotic effectiveness was again revealed when compared to the fertilized N control or with a standard strain of Bradyrhizobium sp. Some of the isolates had high N-2 fixing capabilities that were comparable to the N fertilized plants with the equivalent of 70 kg/ha of inorganic N, with some of them showing superiority in symbiotic effectiveness relative to the standard strain. These data suggest that native isolates are a potentially useful source of strains for preparing highly effective cowpea inoculants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Total biomasses of cedar. hemlock, and salal roots in the forest floor and upper mineral soil were 817, 620, and 187 g.m(-2), respectively. Hemlock and salal fine roots were concentrated in the upper forest floor, while cedar fine roots were evenly distributed through the profile. Salal and hemlock fine root densities (g.m(-3)) in the forest floor and mineral soil were positively correlated, as were salal and cedar root biomass distributions (g.m(-2)). Only salal and hemlock root densities were significantly correlated with N concentrations. Hemlock root densities were negatively correlated with total N, and salal root densities were negatively correlated with total N and soluble organic N. Based on fine root densities, hemlock and salal probably compete for resources in the upper forest floor, whereas cedar accesses resources in the lower organic and mineral soil horizons. The differences in the vertical distributions of cedar, hemlock, and salal fine roots may partly explain the co-occurrence and different productivities of the three species in cedar-hemlock forests.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; BA Blackwell & Associates, N Vancouver, BC V7H 3B5, Canada","Prescott, CE (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 3037-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,,,,,,65,38,42,1,17,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Within this paper, this process is referred to as mineralization and the resultant stabilized or essentially stabilized refuse is referred to as ""aged refuse."" The aged refuse contains a wide spectrum and large quantity of microorganisms, which have a strong decomposition capability for refractory organic matter present in some wastewaters, such as leachate. In this study, aged refuse excavated from two to ten year old closed landfill compartments in Shanghai Refuse Landfill (SRL) was characterized in terms of particulate distribution by screening, and a biofilter consisting of ten year old aged refuse was then used for biofiltration of leachate sampled from the landfill. Typically, 400 kg of screened aged refuse with limiting diameter less than 15 mm was used as biofiltration materials in a round shaped biofilter with 80 cm inner diameter and 80 cm height. Leachate with initial chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and NH3-N concentrations of 3,000-7,000, 540-1,500, and 500-800 mg/L, respectively, was passed through the biofilter. As a result. the corresponding concentrations in the effluent were reduced to lower than 100-350, 10-200, and 10-25 mg/L, respectively, 90-99% removal for these parameters at a hydraulic load of 80-200 L/m(3) refuse/day. The color of the effluent became slightly gray, in comparison with the heavy brownish color of the influent. The treatment efficiencies heavily depend on hydraulic load, BOD/COD ratios in the leachate, and preliminary treatment of the aged refuse. A variety of leachates with various BOD/COD ratios was tested. It was found that the effluent deteriorated when BOD/COD ratios were lower than 0.1-0.2. Increase of hydraulic load resulted in a decrease of removal efficiencies. Removal of stone, plastics, and glass, etc., from the aged refuse improved the treatment. A pilot test was conducted at SRL and the experimental results obtained at laboratory scale were verified.","Tongji Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Zhao, YC (reprint author), Tongji Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,22,65,101,3,27,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9372,,,J ENVIRON ENG-ASCE,J.

Height growth of D. nigra was similar in both soils and six months after inoculation Bradyrhizobium did not affect the D. nigra height growth, but it did improve dry mass and especially in the nitrogen content of plants grown in eucalyptus soil. The success of the delayed inoculation with BHICB- DN 15 confirms its competitive ability ""vis-a-vis"" indigenous soil rhizobia. Co-inoculation of BHICB-DN 15 and mycorrhizal fungi did not increase plant dry weight, nitrogen and phosphorus content or mycorrhizal colonization.

Sugar maple saplings and E. americanum plants were planted together in pots placed in the ground of a maple forest in 1999. Ectomycorrhizal yellow birches (Betula alleghaniensis) were added as control plants. In spring 2000, during leaf expansion of sugar maple saplings, the leaves of E. americanum were labelled with (CO2)-C-14. Seven days after labelling, radioactivity was detected in leaves, stem and roots of sugar maples. Specific radioactivity in sugar maples was 13-fold higher than in yellow birches revealing the occurrence of a direct transfer of C-14 between the AM plants. The quantity of C-14 transferred to sugar maple saplings was negatively correlated with the percentage of C-14 allocated to the storage organ of E. americanum. A second labelling was performed in autumn 2000 on sugar maple leaves during annual growth of E. americanum roots. Radioactivity was detected in 7 of 22 E. americanum root systems and absent in yellow birches. These results suggest that AM fungi connecting different understorey species can act as reciprocal C transfer bridges between plant species in relation with the phenology of the plants involved.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie & Geomat, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Lerat, S (reprint author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Pavillon Vachon, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Lapointe, Line/P-8797-2016","Lapointe, Line/0000-0001-8544-1443",,,,26,48,58,1,35,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2002,132,2,,,,,181,187,,10.1007/s00442-002-0958-9,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,580PL,WOS:000177242900004,28547350,,,,10/31/19J,"Taylor, AFS",,,,"Taylor, AFS",,,Fungal diversity in ectomycorrhizal communities: sampling effort and species detection,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,community structure; ectomycorrhizas; fungal distribution; species richness; vertical distribution,PINUS-MURICATA FOREST; NORWAY SPRUCE FOREST; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SOIL; ECOLOGY; HETEROGENEITY; BIODIVERSITY; VARIABILITY; POPULATION; PATTERNS,"A number of recent review articles on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community diversity have highlighted the unprecedented increase in the number of publications on this ecologically important but neglected area. The general features of these species-rich, highly dynamic and complex communities have been comprehensively covered but one aspect crucial to our assessment of diversity, namely the sampling of ECM communities has received less attention. This is a complex issue with two principal components, the physical sampling strategy employed and the life cycle traits of the ECM fungi being examined. Combined, these two components provide the image that we perceive as ECM diversity. This contribution will focus primarily on the former of these components using a recent study from a pine forest in central Sweden to highlight some sampling problems and also to discuss some features common to ECM communities. The two commonly used elements of diversity, species richness and community evenness, present rather different problems in the assessment of ECM diversity. The applicability of using current measures of abundance (number or percentage of root tips colonised) to determine community evenness is discussed in relation to our lack of knowledge on the size of individual genets of ECM fungi. The inherent structure of most ECM communities, with a few common species and a large number of rare species, severely limits our ability to accurately assess species richness. A discussion of theoretical detection limits is included that demonstrates the importance of the sampling effort (no. of samples or tips) involved in assessing species richness. Species area abundance plots are also discussed in this context. It is suggested that sampling strategy (bulk samples versus multiple collections of single tips) may have important consequences when sampling from communities where root tip densities differ. Finally, the need for studies of the spatial distribution of ECM on roots in relation to small-scale soil heterogeneity and of the temporal aspects of ECM community dynamics is raised.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Taylor, AFS (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, POB 7026, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,44,157,168,2,66,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,19,28,,10.1023/A:1020279815472,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Horton, TR",,,,"Horton, TR",,,Molecular approaches to ectomycorrhizal diversity studies: variation in ITS at a local scale,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,intraspecific variation; ITS; PCR; RFLP; Tricholoma,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GENETIC-VARIATION; NORWAY SPRUCE; RIBOSOMAL DNA; FUNGI; IDENTIFICATION; FORESTS; AMPLIFICATION; REGION,"In most ectomycorrhizal (EM) community studies involving molecular identification methods there is a poor correspondence between fungi that appear dominant as sporocarps and those that appear dominant on EM roots and the species richness belowground is higher than that above ground. As a consequence, many fungi from root tip samples remain unidentified. In most studies, genetic data from multiple samples of an EM morphotype collected from various sampling locations are compared to genetic data from one to a few sporocarps of each species for identification purposes. The mismatch between above- and belowground species richness may be influenced by these different sampling efforts. To address this, intra-specific variation in the ITS region first investigated in Karen et al. (1997) is revisited here, but at a spatial scale in which variation is expected to be low. Sporocarps were collected across a 7 km region of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area in western North America. ITS-RFLP data are presented for 3-18 sporocarps from each of 44 EM species in 18 genera. A total of 311 sporocarps were analyzed. Fifty-three ITS-RFLP types were observed. Of the 44 species, 38 (86% of total) yielded a single, species specific, RFLP type. No 2 species had the same RFLP type. Polymorphic ITS-RFLP types were observed in six species (14%). The following three species had two ITS-RFLP types with one type dominating: Inocybe lacera, Laccaria proxima, and Rhizopogon subcaerulescens. The following three species had three RFLP types with no type dominating: Laccaria laccata, Lactarius deliciosus, and Tricholoma flavovirens. A phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences in Tricholoma revealed that two of the RFLP types in T. flavovirens were apparently the result of intra-specific variation, while the third RFLP type was likely a cryptic species. All the other RFLP types observed in Tricholoma represented unique phylogenetic species. These results suggest that ITS-RFLP data from single samples (sporocarp or EM) are robust for characterizing most of the species at this scale. However, restriction endonucleases detect a limited amount of existing nucleotide variation and thus have limited value to detect cryptic species. Therefore, additional analyses of sequence data should be added to the RFLP matching technique to identify unknown RFLP types. These data also suggest that polymorphic RFLP types within species do not adequately explain the mismatch between above- and belowground views of EM species richness.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Horton, TR (reprint author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 350 Illick Hall, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",,,"Horton, Tom/0000-0002-2112-9618",,,,35,87,93,0,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,29,39,,10.1023/A:1020268020563,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Berch, SM; Allen, TR; Berbee, ML",,,,"Berch, SM; Allen, TR; Berbee, ML",,,"Molecular detection, community structure and phylogeny of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ericaceae; ericoid mycorrhizal fungi; Epacridaceae; Gaultheria shallon; phylogeny; salal,RIBOSOMAL DNA; GAULTHERIA SHALLON; CALLUNA-VULGARIS; DIVERSITY; ENDOPHYTES; ROOT; SPRUCE,"Through traditional culturing and molecular characterization, we have determined that five putative species and 2 polyphyletic assemblages of fungi produce ericoid mycorrhizae in Gaultheria shallon, other Ericaceae and Epacridaceae.

Evolutionary implications are discussed, referring to different possibilities of the influence of AMF on the colonization of the terrestrial habitat by plants.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Bot, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Schussler, A (reprint author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Bot, FB10,Schnittspahnstr 10, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",,"SchuSSler, Arthur/F-1681-2011",,,,,41,53,70,1,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,75,83,,10.1023/A:1020238728910,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Requena, N; Mann, P; Hampp, R; Franken, P",,,,"Requena, N; Mann, P; Hampp, R; Franken, P",,,"Early developmentally regulated genes in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae: identification of GmGIN1, a novel gene with homology to the C-terminus of metazoan hedgehog proteins",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; development; gene regulation; Glomus mosseae; hedgehog proteins,SUPPRESSION SUBTRACTIVE HYBRIDIZATION; POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; AUTOPROCESSING DOMAIN; COLONIZING ROOTS; DISPLAY ANALYSIS; LIBRARIES,"The life cycle of the obligate biotrophic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi comprises several well-defined developmental stages whose genetic determinants are still unknown. With the aim of understanding the molecular processes governing the early developmental phase of the AM fungal life cycle, a subtractive cDNA library was constructed using a suppressive subtractive hybridization technique. The library contains more than 600 clones with an average size of 500 bp. The isolated cDNAs correspond to genes up-regulated during the early development of the AM fungus Glomus mosseae versus genes expressed in extraradical hyphae. The expression of several of the isolated genes was further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Among the isolated clones, a novel gene named GmGIN1 only expressed during early development in G. mosseae was found. The full-length GmGIN1 cDNA codes for a protein of 429 amino acids. The most interesting feature of the deduced protein is its two-domain structure with a putative self-splicing activity. The N-terminal domain shares sequence similarity with a novel family of GTP binding proteins while the C-terminus has a striking homology to the C-terminal part of the hedgehog protein family from metazoa. The C-terminal part of hedgehog proteins is known to participate in the covalent modification of the N-terminus by cholesterol, and in the self-splicing activity which renders the active form of the protein with signalling function. We speculate that the N-terminal part of GmGIN1, activated through a similar mechanism to the hedgehog proteins, has GTP-binding activity and participates in the signalling events prior to symbiosis formation.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Dept Physiol Ecol Plants, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; Univ Marburg, Dept Microbiol, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Requena, N (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Dept Physiol Ecol Plants, Auf Morgenstelle 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,"Requena Sanchez, Natalia/I-4738-2016","Requena Sanchez, Natalia/0000-0001-5406-0015",,,,31,46,50,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,129,139,,10.1023/A:1020249932310,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ezawa, T; Smith, SE; Smith, FA",,,,"Ezawa, T; Smith, SE; Smith, FA",,,P metabolism and transport in AM fungi,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; P metabolism; polyphosphate; P transport; V-ATPase; vacuoles,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; POLYPHOSPHATE METABOLISM; INORGANIC POLYPHOSPHATE; INTRARADICAL HYPHAE; NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; H+-ATPASE; GIGASPORA-MARGARITA; CARBON METABOLISM,"The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is mutualistic, based on reciprocal transfer of P from the fungus to the plant and carbon from the plant to the fungus. Thus P is a most important `currency' in the symbiosis. After absorbing P from the soil solution, the fungi first incorporate it into the cytosolic pool, and the excess P is transferred to the vacuoles. The vacuolar P pool probably plays a central role in P supply to the plant. The main forms of inorganic P in fungal vacuoles are orthophosphate and polyphosphate, but organic P molecules may also be present. Long distance translocation of P from the site of uptake in the external mycelium to the site of transfer to the plant is probably achieved via transfer of vacuolar components. This transport would be mediated either by protoplasmic streaming or the motile tubular vacuole-like system. The site of release of P into the interfacial apoplast and thence to the plant is most probably the fungal arbuscules. The biochemical and biophysical processes involved in P metabolism and transfer between cellular compartments in the symbiosis are currently not well understood. Some recent investigations of substrate specificities of phosphatase-type enzymes in AM fungi and other eukaryotic microorganisms, however, have shed new light on earlier results and permit the construction of a hypothetical scheme of P-flow, including possible regulatory factors. Steps in this scheme are experimentally testable and should stimulate future research.","Nagoya Univ, Univ Farm, Aichi 4700151, Japan; Univ Adelaide, Waite Agr Res Inst, Dept Soil & Water, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; Univ Adelaide, Waite Agr Res Inst, Ctr Plant Root Symbioses, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia","Ezawa, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Univ Farm, Togo Cho, Aichi 4700151, Japan.",,"Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/B-7735-2012; Smith, Frank Andrew/D-4665-2013","Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/0000-0001-6188-7635; ",,,,77,85,107,5,46,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,221,230,,10.1023/A:1020258325010,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Staddon, PL; Heinemeyer, A; Fitter, AH",,,,"Staddon, PL; Heinemeyer, A; Fitter, AH",,,Mycorrhizas and global environmental change: research at different scales,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; diversity; enhanced [CO(2)]; mycorrhizas; natural communities; warming,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; HYACINTHOIDES-NON-SCRIPTA; VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA; CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM; SPORE GERMINATION; PHOSPHORUS INFLOW; HYPHAL PRODUCTION,"Global environmental change (GEC), in particular rising atmospheric CO(2) concentration and temperature, will affect most ecosystems. The varied responses of plants to these aspects of GEC are well documented. As with other key below-ground components of terrestrial ecosystems, the response of the ubiquitous mycorrhizal fungal root symbionts has received limited attention. Most of the research on the effects of GEC on mycorrhizal fungi has been pot-based with a few field (especially monoculture) studies. A major question that arises in all these studies is whether the GEC effects on the mycorrhizal fungi are independent of the effects on their plant hosts. We evaluate the current knowledge on the effects of elevated CO(2) and increased temperature on mycorrhizal fungi and focus on the few available field examples. The value of using long-term and large-scale field experiments is emphasised. We conclude that the laboratory evidence to date shows that the effect of elevated CO(2) on mycorrhizal fungi is dependent on plant growth and that temperature effects seen in the past might have reflected a similar dependence. Therefore, how temperature directly affects mycorrhizal fungi remains unknown. In natural ecosystems, we predict that GEC effects on mycorrhizal fungal communities will be strongly mediated by the effects on plant communities to the extent that community level interactions will prove to be the key mechanism for determining GEC-induced changes in mycorrhizal fungal communities.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Staddon, PL (reprint author), Riso Natl Lab, Plant Res Dept, Postbox 49, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",philip.louis.staddon@risoe.dk,,"Heinemeyer, Andreas/0000-0003-3151-2466",,,,68,64,68,1,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,253,261,,10.1023/A:1020285309675,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600025,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bever, JD",,,,"Bever, JD",,,Host-specificity of AM fungal population growth rates can generate feedback on plant growth,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; community dynamics; feedback; host-specificity; population growth rates,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SOIL PATHOGENS; OLD FIELD; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; GRASSLAND; TREE; BIODIVERSITY; MAINTENANCE,"While the mutualistic interaction between plants and AM fungi is of obvious importance to ecosystem processes, the factors influencing the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within this interaction are poorly understood. The mutual interdependence of plant and AM fungal relative growth rates could generate complex dynamics in which the composition of the AM fungal community changes due to association with host and this change in fungal composition then differentially feeds back on plant growth. I first review evidence for feedback dynamics and then present an approach to evaluating such complex dynamics. I specifically present evidence of host-specific differences in the population growth rates of AM fungi. Pure cultures of AM fungi were mixed to produce the initial fungal community. This community was then distributed into replicate pots and grown with one of four co-occurring plant species. Distinct compositions of AM fungal spores were produced on different host species. The AM fungal communities were then inoculated back onto their own host species and grown for a second growing season. The differentiation observed in the first generation was enhanced during this second generation, verifying that the measure of spore composition reflects host-specific differences in AM fungal population growth rates. In further work on this system, I have found evidence of negative feedback through two pairs of plant species. The dynamic within the AM fungal community can thereby contribute to the coexistence of plant species.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Jordan Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,38,133,155,4,70,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2002,244,2-Jan,,,,,281,290,,10.1023/A:1020221609080,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,594ZD,WOS:000178081600028,,,,,10/31/19J,"Veselkin, DV",,,,"Veselkin, DV",,,Distribution of fine roots of coniferous trees over the soil profile under conditions of pollution by emissions from a copper-smelting plant,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,conifers; fine roots; soil pollution; heavy metals,ALUMINUM TOXICITY; RED SPRUCE; SEEDLINGS; ACID,"The distribution of fine conducting roots of Siberian spruce, Siberian fir, and Scotch pine over the soil profile was studied in the taiga ecosystems polluted with heavy metals and SO2.

Plants were inoculated with two strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti [the wild type (WT) strain GR4 and its genetically modified (GM) derivative GR4(pCK3)]. In combination with these inoculations, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Glomus mosseae, was compared to a non-mycorrhizal control supplemented with phosphate. The effects of AM on plant growth were greatest when no nitrogen was added to the soil. Nitrogen fertilization reduced these effects according to the S. meliloti strain involved. Growth responses of mycorrhizal plants coinoculated with the GM strain were affected less negatively than those of mycorrhizal plants associated with the WT strain. These results were not related to differential colonization by AM. Increasing nitrogen concentrations reduced mycorrhizal infection and nodule formation was drastically inhibited in mycorrhizal plants by the addition of 4 and 8 mmol N kg(-1) soil. Nevertheless, AM symbiosis increased nodule formation in the absence of N fertilization. In non-mycorrhizal plants, however, N fertilizer application did not significantly affect shoot and root growth or nodule formation. Although the P content was higher in P-fertilized, non-mycorrhizal plants than in mycorrhizal ones AM colonization significantly improved P use efficiency. The N content and use efficiency were also highest in mycorrhizal plants. However, the most relevant result regarding NR activity was the varying distributions in mycorrhizal plant shoots and roots as affected by the particular Sinorhizobium strain. The root portion was enhanced by the GM strain, while the WT strain increased the shoot portion. This change in the distribution pattern of root and shoot NR activities was unaffected by N concentrations in the soil. Protein content was substantially higher in mycorrhizal plants. The protein distribution pattern in shoot and root was also highly influenced by mycorrhizal colonization, which enhanced the root portion. Increased nitrogen supply lowered the protein content in both shoot and root tissues. This effect was greatest in AM colonized plants. These results suggest that high N fertilization levels are detrimental to mycorrhizal legume plants. However, under stress conditions (e.g. high N levels) mycorrhizal legumes nodulated by the GM Sinorhizobium strain displayed a physiological response which was better than those nodulated by the WT strain.

Phage activity was detected in 47% of the soil samples tested. Most of the positive responses were observed in soils of localities inhabited by host legumes of indicator bacterial strains and their close relatives. The results suggest that rhizobiophages are maintained in the vicinity of their target host populations and are spread through the man-made introduction of host legumes and their rhizobia. Diversity among phage isolates was assessed by studying the plaque traits on their indicator bacterial strains, and variation in morphology using transmission electron microscopy. Except for plaque size, the variation in the plaque traits was rather narrow. Based on the variability pattern, the 64 phages were grouped into I I plaque types. In contrast to plaque characteristics, the diversity in morphological characters was high and phage isolates differ from the rhizobiophages reported from Indian soils; the Indian phages of Azorhizobium caulinodans strain ORS571 are different from the Senegal isolates. Based on the morphological diversity, the phages are grouped into Bradley's basic four phage groups (A1, B1, B2 and C1) and three families, Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae. This pattern of grouping is reflected in cluster formation based on the variability in plaque and morphological characters. The host range of the phage isolates is rather narrow and restricted to their indicator strains and their close relatives due to marked genetic divergence among rhizobia due to legume host specialization and ecological conditions. The phages can be used for typifying closely related stem-nodulating rhizobia and other rhizobia, which are promiscuous within sesbanias. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The functional complexity of decomposer system was manipulated by (1) allowing either microfauna (fine mesh) or microfauna + mesofauna (coarse mesh) to enter the initially defaunated systems, and (2) treating half of the lysimeters with wood ash. To test whether altering functional complexity of the decomposer community is related to the system's ability to resist disturbance, the lysimeters were later on disturbed with drought. Ecosystem function, measured as leaching of mineral N and dissolved organic C (DOC) and primary production, and the structure and biomass of soil fauna and soil microbial communities were analysed. We hypothesised that reduced functional complexity of soil decomposer communities retards system functioning which results in impaired ability of soil systems to resist disturbance. Fine mesh was effective in reducing biomass of mesofauna, especially that of microarthropods, in the lysimeters. Leaching of N from the lysimeters and microbial communities were unaffected by the mesh size. Before drought, more DOC was leached from the lysimeters with fine mesh. Pine seedling development was poorer in the lysimeters with coarse mesh than in those with fine mesh. Wood ash, independently of the mesh size, increased number of nematodes and leaching of NO3--N (only after drought), decreased leaching of NH4+-N and changed microbial community structure. The conditions for the pine seedlings were less favourable in the ash-treated than in the ash-free soils as indicated by the higher root-to-shoot ratio in the former lysimeters. The system's ability to resist disturbance was not affected by the treatments. Our results suggest that the abiotic factors (e.g. moisture, pH) overrode the biotic factors in the lysimeters with respect to ecosystem functioning, and that the changes in the structure and biomass of soil fauna were not reflected as changes in system functioning.

Mesh windows on the facing pot sides allowed the penetration of hyphae but not roots. The effect of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav.) in the hyphal compartment and of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on plant growth and P-32 transfer between plants was investigated. In addition, the effect of mechanical disruption of the hyphal compartment on mycorrhizal plants was studied. AMF did not affect plant growth, although infection levels were high. Earthworms generally increased shoot and root growth; this effect did not appear to be related to location of earthworm activity. P-32 transfer from the dying root system of labelled 'donor' plants to unlabelled 'receiver' plants was increased where earthworm activity was evident between pots, whereas mechanical disruption eliminated the effect of AMF on P-32, transfer between mycorrhizal plants. Magnitude of transfer was only related to AMF colonisation levels in the donor plant in the absence of earthworms or mechanical disruption. These results suggest that movement of P-32 into the hyphal compartment via the donor AMF mycelium was more important in influencing transfer magnitude than direct transfer via AMF hyphal interconnections between the two plants. Uptake of P-32 by the receiver AMF hyphae appears to have been increased by earthworm activity in the hyphal compartment; it is proposed that earthworm-mediated mobilisation of P-32, partly contained within the donor AMF mycelium, led to enhanced P-32 availability in the hyphal compartment.

Coarse roots ranged from 0.65 to 4.45 cm in diameter, whereas fine roots were less than 5 mm in diameter. To discriminate between maintenance and growth respiration, root respiration rates were measured during aboveground growing periods and dormant periods. An additional measurement of coarse root respiration was made during spring leaf flush, to evaluate the effect of mobilization of resources for leaf expansion on root respiration. Fine roots respired at much higher rates than coarse roots, with a mean rate at 15 degreesC of 1290 mumol CO2 m(-3) s(-1) during the growing period, and 660 mumol CO2 m(-3) s(-1) during the dormant period. The temperature response of fine root respiration rate was nonlinear: mean Q(10) was 3.90 for measurements made at 5-15 degreesC and 2.19 for measurements made at 15-25 degreesC. Coarse root respiration rates measured at 15 degreesC in late fall (dormant season) were higher (370 mumol CO2 m(-3) s(-1)) than rates from roots collected at leaf flush and early summer (200 mumol CO2 m(-3) s(-1)). The higher respiration rates in late fall, which were accompanied by decreased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations, suggest that respiration rates in late fall included growth expenditures, reflecting recent radial growth. Neither bud flush nor shoot growth of the trees caused an increase in coarse root respiration or a decrease in TNC concentrations, suggesting a limited role of coarse roots as reserve storage organs for spring shoot growth, and a lack of synchronization between above- and below-ground growth. Pooling the data from the coarse and fine roots showed a positive correlation between nitrogen concentration and respiration rate.","Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Ctr Enhances Forest Management, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Desrochers, A (reprint author), Alberta Pacific Forest Ind Inc, Box 8000, Boyle, AB T0A 0M0, Canada.",,"Landhausser, Simon M/F-9910-2016; DesRochers, Annie/B-8431-2015","Landhausser, Simon M/0000-0002-4466-1607; DesRochers, Annie/0000-0002-4653-4062; Lieffers, Victor/0000-0001-6939-4093",,,,49,63,84,0,28,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,2002,22,10,,,,,725,732,,10.1093/treephys/22.10.725,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,575JF,WOS:000176942600006,12091154,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Kosola, KR; Dickmann, DI; Parry, D",,,,"Kosola, KR; Dickmann, DI; Parry, D",,,Carbohydrates in individual poplar fine roots: effects of root age and defoliation,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,expandable-wall minirhizotron; herbivory; laparascopic sampling; Populus x canadensis; starch,PLANT-TISSUES; LIFE-SPAN; SYSTEM; STARCH; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; DEMOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; NITROGEN,"Late-summer starch accumulation in fine roots of poplars (Populus x canadensis Moench.) defoliated by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) lagged behind that in fine roots of undefoliated trees. If starch concentration declines with age, defoliation-induced changes in root system age structure could be partly responsible for this difference. To test this hypothesis, we measured fine-root starch and soluble sugar concentrations in roots of known age from trees in defoliated and undefoliated plots. There was a significant interaction between the effects of defoliation and root type (white, brown, or dead) on fine root soluble sugar concentration because of the high concentration of soluble sugars in white roots from trees in undefoliated plots. Both root starch and soluble sugar concentrations were variable among individuals of each age class. The population frequency distributions for starch and soluble sugar concentrations were both right-skewed, and fit by exponential functions. These data are most consistent with direct defoliation effects on a labile and dynamic pool of carbohydrates in poplar fine roots, rather than indirect defoliation effects on root system age structure.","Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Kosola, KR (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Hort, 1575 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,"Kosola, Kevin/R-3724-2019",,,,,25,18,18,0,18,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,2002,22,10,,,,,741,746,,10.1093/treephys/22.10.741,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,575JF,WOS:000176942600008,12091156,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Titus, JH; Titus, PJ; Nowak, RS; Smith, SD",,,,"Titus, JH; Titus, PJ; Nowak, RS; Smith, SD",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizae of Mojave Desert plants,WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; Mojave desert; seasonality; burrows; Nevada Test Site; River Mountains; mycorrhizal inoculum potential,WINTER ANNUALS; FUNGI; SOIL; GRASSLAND; NEVADA; COLONIZATION; INFECTIVITY; ECOSYSTEMS; MORPHOLOGY; RESPONSES,"Roots of 15 Mojave Desert plant species were assessed for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization in spring and autumn 1999.

The measurements were used to validate transpiration estimates obtained from a multi-layer gas exchange model that included the modeling of the within-canopy radiation regime and the thermal balance of the leaves. The comparison between modeled and measured hourly transpiration showed no bias in the predictions, and an r(2) value of 0.80. Because of the close coupling between transpiration and photosynthesis built in the model, these results suggest that modeled estimates of photosynthesis should also be well-related to actual rates at the stand-level. The transpiration data were also used to adjust an empirical transpiration model based on the Penman-Monteith equation in which the canopy conductance term was replaced by a function of global radiation, vapor pressure deficit and soil water depletion. This empirically-fitted model captured 85% of the variation observed in the data, including the effect of soil water depletion during a late-season drought. The soil water modifier included within this equation was compared with other soil water modifier functions obtained from the literature. The comparison highlights two difficulties in the derivation of soil water modifiers applicable outside experimental areas. The first is in the determination of rooting depth so that mass balances of soil water content can be carried out. The second is in the determination of soil physical properties so that absolute values of moisture contents can be translated into relative values of water availability.

Selective cutting had no negative effect on the mycorrhizal community structure of yellow birch and sugar maple. This may be because of the quick regeneration of the mycorrhizal hosts coupled with the minor levels of soil disruption and relatively small gap size at the study sites. Greater colonization levels in the gaps versus uncut areas were observed in the 2- to 3-year-old maples but not in the 2- to 3-year-old birch seedlings.

Soil characteristics influence plant communities in part through water relations. Hypothetically, finer textured soils in arid climates should be associated with more negative plant and soil water potentials during drought, greater resistance of xylem to cavitation, and shallower root systems than coarse soils. 2. These hypotheses were tested by comparing the water relations of Great Basin shrubs growing in sand versus loam soils. The eight study species (Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Chrysothamnus parryi, Tetradymia glabrata, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex confertifolia, Grayia spinosa and Sarcobatus vermiculatus) varied in typical rooting depth and vegetative phenology. 3. Xylem pressures for a species were, on average, 1.1 MPa more negative in the loam versus the sand site, despite greater precipitation at the loam site. Root xylem at the loam site was, on average, 0.9 MPa more resistant to cavitation than at the sand site for the same species, There was a strong trend for shallower rooting depths at the loam versus the sand site. Within a species, roots were consistently more vulnerable to cavitation than stems, and experienced more cavitation during the growing season. 4. Over most of the summer there was much more cavitation at the loam site than at the sand site. More than 80% loss of xylem conductivity (PLC) was estimated in shallow roots of three species at the loam site by the end of July, with two of the three showing extensive leaf drop and branch mortality. Transpiration rate was negatively correlated with PLC, with a tendency for lower gas-exchange rates in loam versus sand. 5. At the sand site, cavitation resistance was negatively correlated with estimated rooting depth. Drought-deciduous species had the shallowest root systems and greatest resistance to cavitation. In contrast, two species with phreatophytic tendencies were summer-active and were the most vulnerable to cavitation. 6. The cavitation resistance of roots determines the minimum water potential permitting hydraulic contact with soil. Differences in cavitation resistance of roots between desert species may contribute to differences in sensitivity of gas exchange to soil drought, ability to perform hydraulic lift. and response to late summer rain pulses.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Hacke, UG (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257 S 1400 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Hacke, Uwe/M-7719-2015","Hacke, Uwe/0000-0001-5983-3582",,,,38,192,217,2,85,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The hypothesis is tested that functional limitations, possibly related to the risk of disruptive xylem embolism, maintain the leaf water potential of trees within a safety range. This strategy would particularly apply to conifers. 2. It is also hypothesized that homeostasis in water transport is achieved by a combination of short-term stomatal regulation and the optimal allocation of resources between transpiring foliage, conductive sapwood and absorbing roots. 3. The implications of this hypothesis for responses of plant structure to the environment are explored from a theoretical viewpoint, focusing in particular on the effects of temperature, vapour pressure deficit and soil water availability and texture. 4. A comparison with published data sets confirms model predictions of greater allocation to transpiring foliage with increasing temperature, and lower allocation with increasing vapour pressure deficit and soil drought. Allocation to fine roots would respond more strongly to drought, and the effect would be magnified by coarse soil textures. 5. The applicability of the model to other taxa remains to be determined, and the extent to which the observed structural adjustment is the result of phenotypic plasticity or long-term adaptation is still unclear.","CNR, IMGPF, I-50134 Florence, Italy; Univ Edinburgh, IERM, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Basilicata, DPV, I-85100 Potenza, Italy","Magnani, F (reprint author), CNR, IMGPF, Via A Vannucci 13, I-50134 Florence, Italy.",,"Borghetti, Marco/C-4262-2012; Magnani, Federico/A-2448-2011","Borghetti, Marco/0000-0003-3159-6655; Magnani, Federico/0000-0003-4479-0916",,,,52,66,68,0,25,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Net CO2 exchange can be estimated on an annual basis, using eddy-covariance techniques or from ecological inventories of C fluxes to and from a forest. Here we present an intercomparison of annual estimates of C exchange in a mixed hardwood forest in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest, Indiana, USA for two years, 1998 and 1999. Based on eddy-covariance measurements made at 1.8 times canopy height from a tower, C uptake by the forest was 237 and 287 g C m(-2) y(-1) for 1998 and 1999, respectively. For the same time period, biometric and ecophysiological measures and modelled estimates of all significant carbon fluxes within deciduous forests were made, including: change in living biomass, aboveground and belowground detritus production, foliage consumption, and forest floor and soil respiration. Using this ecological inventory method for these same two time periods, C uptake was estimated to be 271 and 377 g C m(-2) y(-1) , which are 14.3% and 31.4% larger, respectively, than the tower-based values. The relative change between this method's annual estimates is consistent with that of the eddy-covariance based values. Our results indicate that the difference in annual C exchange rates was due to reduced heterotrophic soil respiration in 1999.","Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Atmospher Sci Program, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Ehman, JL (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,"Schmid, Hans Peter E/I-1224-2012; Hanson, Paul J.

The effects of elevated CO2 on belowground processes have so far attracted limited research and they are assumed to be controlled by indirect effects through changes in plant physiology and chemistry. In this study, we investigated the effects of a 4-year exposure to elevated CO2 (ambient + 400 mumol mol(-1) ) in open top chambers under Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) seedlings on soil microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification. Potential denitrification (DP) and potential N-2 O emissions were significantly higher in soils from the elevated CO2 treatment, probably regulated indirectly by the changes in soil conditions (increased pH, C availability and NO3 (-) production). Net N mineralization was mainly accounted for by nitrate production. Nitrate production was significantly larger for soil from the elevated CO2 treatment in the field when incubated in the laboratory under elevated CO2 (increase of 100%), but there was no effect when incubated under ambient CO2 . Net nitrate production of the soil originating from the ambient CO2 treatment in the field was not influenced by laboratory incubation conditions. These results indicate that a direct effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil microbial processes might take place. We hypothesize that physiological adaptation or selection of nitrifiers could occur under elevated CO2 through higher soil CO2 concentrations. Alternatively, lower microbial NH4 assimilation under elevated CO2 might explain the higher net nitrification. We conclude that elevated atmospheric CO2 has a major direct effect on the soil microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification despite generally higher soil CO2 concentrations compared to atmospheric concentrations.","Univ Liege, Dept Life Sci, Inst Plant Biol B22, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Carnol, M (reprint author), Univ Liege, Dept Life Sci, Inst Plant Biol B22, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",m.carnol@ulg.ac.be,"Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358",,,,50,32,53,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

A nursery study was conducted over 2 years to evaluate the effect of seasonally variable soil moisture on the rooting pattern of shallow-rooted shrub broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae Britt and Rusby). Plants irrigated during the spring-summer, but grown under rainout shelters in the winter (S) produced more roots in the upper 30 cm of soil than plants receiving natural precipitation (N), or plants irrigated in the winter, but grown under rainout shelters in the spring-summer (W). Plants irrigated in the winter, but grown under the rainout shelter in the spring-summer had 45-47% more roots (p<0.05) extended below the 30 cm soil layers in the early spring than the other treatments. These well-developed deeper roots provided 75% of plant evapo-transpirational water use for the winter irrigation treatment. This altered root distribution also enabled the plants to produce above-ground biomass similar to that of plants receiving natural precipitation. Our data suggest that the root deployment pattern of snakeweed can be altered by variations in seasonal precipitation, which may help explain the competitive relationship between snakeweed and the shallow-rooted native grasses.

Limnopithecus evansi) and oreopithecine apes (Mabokopithecus clarki, M. pickfordi), and galagids (Komba winamensis). Specific habitat preferences can be interpreted from large collections of primate fossils in different kinds of paleosols (pedotypes). Fossiliferous drab-colored paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Yom pedotype) are like modem soils of seasonally waterlogged depressions (dambo). Their crumb structure and abundant fine root-traces, as well as scattered large calcareous rhizoconcretions indicate former vegetation of seasonally wet, wooded grassland. Other fossiliferous paleosols are evidence of nyika bushland (Ratong), and early-successional riparian woodland (Dhero). No fossils were found in Mogo paleosols interpreted as saline scrub soils. Very shallow calcic horizons (in Yom, Ratong, and Mogo paleosols) and Na-montmorillonite (in Mogo) are. evidence of dry paleoclimate (300-500 mm MAP = mean annual precipitation). This is the driest paleoclimate and most open vegetation yet inferred as a habitat for any Kenyan Miocene apes or monkeys. Victoriapithecus was abundant in dambo wooded grassland (Yom) and riparian woodland (Dhero), a distribution like that of modem vervet monkeys. Kenyapithecus ranged through all these paleosols, but was the most common primate in nyika bushland paleosols (Ratong),,. comparable to baboons and macaques today. Mabokopithecus was virtually restricted to riparian woodland paleosols (Dhero), and Simiolus had a similar, but marginally wider, distribution. Habitat preferences of Mabokopithecus and Simiolus were like those of modem colobus monkeys and mangabeys. A single specimen of Komba was found in dambo wooded grassland paleosol (Yom), a habitat more like that of the living Senegal bushbaby than of rainforest galagids. A shift to non-forest habitats may explain the terrestrial adaptations of Victoriapithecus, basal to the cercopithecid radiation, and of Kenyapithecus, basal to the hominoid radiation. Both taxa are distinct from earlier Miocene arboreal proconsulines, oreopithecines and galagids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A genomic library of total DNA extracted from the fungal spores, representative of the bacterial genome. was used to investigate the prokaryotic genome. PCR experiments with primers designed on the Burkholderia mcpA-like gene and Southern blot analysis demonstrate that they actually belong to the genome of G. margarita endosymbiont. The expression of the mcpA-like gene in the fungal spores was demonstrated by RT-PCR experiments. The detailed comparative analysis of the bacterial MCPs available in databases allowed to draw a possible evolutionary pathway leading to the present-day mcpA genes. Accordingly. the ancestor of the mcpA-like genes was the result of a domain shuffling event involving two ancestral mini-genes encoding a PAS-PAC and a MA domains, respectively, followed by the elongation of the PAS-PAC moiety. The following evolutionary divergence involved not only point mutations, but also larger rearrangements (insertions and deletions) at the 3' end of the gene.","Univ Turin, Dipartimento Biol Vegetale, I-10125 Turin, Italy; Ctr Studio Micol Terreno, CNR, I-10125 Turin, Italy; Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Bonfante, P (reprint author), Univ Turin, Dipartimento Biol Vegetale, Viale Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",,,"Bonfante, Paola/0000-0003-3576-8530",,,,27,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0022-2844,,,J MOL EVOL,J.

We reanalyse various data on water use by individual trees and argue that a common relationship can be used to estimate annual water use by tree stands along the NATT from ca. 600 mm mean annual rainfall to at least 1600 rum. Where rainfall is less than 600 mm, trees of a given size use less water than at sites where rainfall is higher. We use these relationships to relate water use at the stand scale with mean annual rainfall along the NATT. From this we show that the empirical data imply that the minimum depth of sandy soil that needs to be exploited by trees declines with increasing aridity along the NATT from more than 5 m to less than I m. This finding is consistent with other observations and the pattern that with increasing aridity, an increasing proportion of rainfall coming from isolated storms rather than from periods of extended monsoon activity.","CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, Cooperat Res Ctr Trop Savannas, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; No Terr Univ, Fac Sci Informat Technol & Educ, Cooperat Res Ctr Trop Savannas, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Cook, GD (reprint author), CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, PMB 44, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia.",,"O'Grady, Anthony/B-8148-2011; Liedloff, Adam/D-7004-2011; Hutley, Lindsay B/A-7925-2011; Cook, Garry D/F-9270-2010","Hutley, Lindsay B/0000-0001-5533-9886; ",,,,29,34,34,0,9,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,LANNA,"MALMEN, S-740 11 LANNA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

These findings raised the possibility that more diverse ecosystems might store more carbon as a result of increased photosynthetic inputs. However, carbon inputs will not only remain in plant biomass, but twill be translocated to the soil via root exudation, fine root turnover, and litter fall. Thus, we must consider not just plant productivity (NPP), but also net productivity of the whole ecosystem (NEP), which itself measures net carbon storage. We currently know little about how plant diversity could influence soil processes that return carbon back to the atmosphere, such as heterotrophic respiration and decomposition of organic matter. Nevertheless, it is clear that any effects on such processes could make NPP a poor predictor of whole-ecosystem productivity, and potentially the ability of the ecosystem to store carbon. We examine the range of mechanisms by which plant diversity could influence net ecosystem productivity, incorporating processes involved with carbon uptake (productivity), loss (autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration), and residence time within the system (decomposition rate). Understanding the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem carbon dynamics must be made a research priority if we wish to provide information relevant to global carbon policy decisions. This goal is entirely feasible if we utilize some basic methods for measuring the major fluxes of carbon into and out of the ecosystem.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Catovsky, S (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",,"Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011","Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716",,,,59,49,55,4,80,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2002,97,3,,,,,443,448,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970315.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,576JZ,WOS:000177002200015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pronk, AA; De Willigen, P; Heuvelink, E; Challa, H",,,,"Pronk, AA; De Willigen, P; Heuvelink, E; Challa, H",,,Development of fine and coarse roots of Thuja occidentalis 'Brabant' in non-irrigated and drip irrigated field plots,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,diffusion parameters; eastern white cedar; root length density; root growth and proliferation; shoot : root ratio,DOUGLAS-FIR STANDS; SANDY SOILS; GROWTH; DENSITY; NETHERLANDS; BIOMASS; MODEL,"Aboveground dry mass, total root dry mass and root length density of the fine roots of Thuja occidentalis `Brabant' were determined under non- and drip-irrigated field conditions.

It was hypothesized that this life history trait results in optimal conditions for willow growth and survival. To test this hypothesis, a greenhouse experiment was conducted using 1.2-m-long black willow cuttings (posts) with a basal diameter of 5 cm. Cuttings were subjected to three soaking treatments (0, 3, and 10 days) and then grown under four soil moisture regimes (control, drought, permanently flooded, and intermittently flooded). Growth, biomass, and survival were recorded. Results showed that soaking posts for 10 days was most beneficial in the control soil moisture regime, enhancing root, shoot, leaf, and total biomass production. Shoot abundance and growth were also enhanced by 10 days of soaking in the control and permanently flooded moisture regimes. Finally, survival increased significantly in control and drought moisture regimes in response to the 10-day soaking treatment. Results clearly demonstrated that soaking had significant effects on willow post success when evaluated across all soil moisture regimes. Posts subjected to the 10-day soaking treatment consistently had greatest growth and biomass and displayed a doubling of the survival rate. Therefore, soaking willow cuttings before planting is a simple, inexpensive technique that may be used to bolster streambank restoration success.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; ARS, Natl Sedimentat Lab, USDA, Oxford, MS 38655 USA","Schaff, SD (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Savannah River Ecol Lab, PO Drawer E, Aiken, SC 29802 USA.",,,,,,,26,20,22,1,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Plantation trees can promote seed dispersal by attracting dispersers and creating favorable site conditions, leading to increased germination and establishment of indigenous trees. Subsequently, plantation trees can be harvested for profit or left to senesce, leaving a native tree community. We evaluated the effect of vine, grass, and shrub cutting (weeding) over a 3-year period on regeneration of indigenous trees subsequent to the removal of plantation softwoods in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Counter to what would be expected if weeding released trees from competition, we found no difference in the total number of stems or in the stems greater than 10 cm diameter at breast height between control and weeded plots; there were more stems greater than 1 cm diameter at breast height in the control plots. For species found in both control and weeded plots, the maximum size of individuals did not differ. At the end of the study, 61 species were found in the control plots and 43 species were found in the weeded plots, and in both types of plots the three most abundant species were the same. The number of species and stems classified as early or middle successional species did not differ between weeded and control plots. The fact that weeding did not promote regeneration of indigenous trees after the removal of plantation trees illustrates the importance of evaluating and field-testing potential management options.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA","Chapman, CA (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",cachapman@zoo.ufl.edu,"Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019","Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140",,,,38,24,25,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Seedlings of the hypernodulating mutants NOD1-3, NOD2-4 and their parent cv. Williams were treated or not treated (control) with a 100 muM-SA solution at 5 d before the inoculation of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110. The nodule dry weight and the number of nodules of the wild type soybean Williams exhibiting autoregulation drastically decreased by the addition of 100 muM SA. The decrease in the nodule number was not caused by the reduction of the rhizobium number in the medium. Salicylic acid inhibited only early nodule formation and did not affect the growth of formed nodules. The inhibitory effect of SA on the nodulation of NOD1-3 and NOD2-4 was significantly less pronounced than that in Williams. These results indicate that SA is directly involved in signal transmission in the autoregulation, and that SA or the SAR induced by SA stimulates the autoregulation of nodulation in soybean.","Akita Prefecutal Univ, Fac Bioresource Sci, Akita 0100195, Japan; Niigata Univ, Fac Agr, Niigata 9502181, Japan","Sato, T (reprint author), Akita Prefecutal Univ, Fac Bioresource Sci, Akita 0100195, Japan.",,"ohtake, norikuni/V-4041-2019",,,,,32,26,30,0,2,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Coleoptera; Curculionidae). The adult of this species feeds on the leaves of the plant. However, root feeding by the larvae is more insidious. An experiment is described that was designed to test the hypothesis that root nodule herbivory by early instar larvae of S. lepidus reduces the assimilation of C by plants of white clover. White clover plants were grown ( larvae) in individual growth chambers and the net carbon (C) assimilation by each plant was estimated by monitoring CO2 flux in the chambers. White clover plants which had been infested with larvae had a significantly (P < 0.01) reduced biomass when compared with the control plants and tended to have a smaller root:shoot ratio (0.68 versus 0.78). The number of nodules on the clover roots were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by the weevil infestation. The diurnal pattern of the mean C flux during the experiment shows that 44 +/- 2.5% less C was assimilated during the light period, and 39 +/- 3.3% less C was lost in respiration during the dark phase, by the infested plants. Significant treatment differences in net C accumulation were evident only towards the end of the study period with the control plants showing a significant (P < 0.05) net gain of C from day 19 onwards. This study demonstrates the initial impact of specialised nodule herbivory on the clover plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper reports a practical method for quantifying age-NPP relationships using existing normal yield tables, biomass equations, and measurements of fine-root turnover and litterfall. Applying this method, we developed mean age-NPP relationships for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) stands in Ontario. We define ""mean age-NPP relationship"", as the changes in NPP that occur with age under long-term mean environmental conditions. These relationships indicate that NPP at more productive sites culminates to a higher value and at an earlier age and also declines more rapidly thereafter. A further component analysis indicates that the decrease in biomass growth of woody tissues is the main contributor to the decline with age. Finally, error assessment suggests that the uncertainty in NPP estimates can be substantially reduced with a better quantification of fine-root turnover and litterfall, which are the two dominant NPP components, particularly in the later stages of stand development. With new techniques now available, more accurate measurement of these components is possible, and thus strongly recommended.","Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Applicat Div, Ottawa, ON K1A 0Y7, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada","Chen, WJ (reprint author), Canada Ctr Remote Sensing, Applicat Div, 588 Booth St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0Y7, Canada.",,,,,,,52,69,73,1,23,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

At the northern edge of the Great Plains, the amount of heterogeneity in soils reciprocally transplanted between prairie and aspen forest can change within a single growing season, suggesting that heterogeneity is strongly influenced by vegetation. Here we examine several mechanisms by which fine roots could influence soil resource heterogeneity. We measured the total length, spatial pattern, and turnover of fine roots in both prairie and forest using minirhizotrons installed horizontally 10 cm below the soil surface. The total length of fine roots in forest (0.7 cm/cm(2)) was significantly less than that in prairie (1.4 cm/cm(2)), which may contribute to more spatially variable resource uptake in forest. The coefficient of variation of root length was significantly higher in forest (92%) than in prairie (65%). Semivariograms showed that the scale of patchiness of root length was significantly greater in forest (8-12 cm) than in prairie (3-4 cm). Lastly, the rate of fine root turnover was significantly higher in forest (49%) than in prairie (20%). Turnover may contribute to spatial variability because a system with high rates of root turnover would appear to have high spatial variability at any given time. Root mortality was also significantly higher in forest than prairie. In summary, many aspects of root distributions and dynamics were consistent with relatively high heterogeneity in forest soil resources. The greater total root length in prairie may account for the significantly higher intensity of root competition in grasslands than forests and contribute to the exclusion of woody plants from prairies. Trees may be able to overcome this resistance by both causing and benefiting from higher levels and scales of soil resource heterogeneity.","Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Partel, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",,"Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011; Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012","Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138",,,,25,49,49,0,38,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2002,83,5,,,,,1199,1203,,10.2307/3071934,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543YK,WOS:000175131300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ramoliya, PJ; Pandey, AN",,,,"Ramoliya, PJ; Pandey, AN",,,"Effect of increasing salt concentration on emergence, growth and survival of seedlings of Salvadora oleoides (Salvadoraceae)",JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,salinization of soil; salvadora oleoides; seedling emergence; seedling growth; salt tolerance; adaptation,SALINITY; TOLERANCE; PLANTS,"Effect of salinization of soil on emergence, growth and physiological attributes of seedlings of Salvadora oleoides Decne.

Seed germination exhibited a negative relationship with increasing concentration of salt; however, results further suggested that this tree species is salt tolerant at seed germination stage. Seedlings survived and grew up to soil salinity 16.5 mOmega(-1)cm(-1), which suggests that this species is salt tolerant at seedling stage too. Elongation of stem and root was retarded by increasing salt stress. Roots penetrated moist as well as dry sub-soils to an equal depth. Among the tissues, young roots and stem were most tolerant to salt stress and were successively followed by leaf and old roots. Leaf tissue exhibited maximum reduction in dry mass production in response to increasing salt stress. However, production of young roots was found to be continuous and plants apparently use this process as an avoidance mechanism to remove excess ions and delay onset of ion accumulation in this tissue. This phenomenon, designated 'fine root turnover', assumes an importance for the mechanisms of salt tolerance. The ability of this plant to thrive in dry regions is further conferred by the xeromorphic features of its leaves.

Oak foliage, stems, roots and ectomycorrhizae were sampled over 3 years and were analyzed for C-13 composition. The aboveground tissue C-13 equilibrated to the novel C-13 signal in the first season, while the belowground components displayed extremely slow integration of the new C. Roots taken from ingrowth cores showed that 33% of the C in newly formed roots originated from a source other than recent photosynthesis inside the chamber. In this highly fire-prone system, the oaks re-establish primarily by resprouting from large rhizomes. Remobilization from belowground C stores may support fine roots and mycorrhizae for several years into stand re-establishment and, therefore, may explain why below-round tissues contain less of the new photosynthate than expected. Though it has been shown that long-term cycles of C storage are theoretically advantageous for plants in systems with frequent and severe disturbances, such patterns have not been previously examined in wild systems.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Langley, JA (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Sci Biol, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,"Hungate, Bruce/F-8991-2011","Hungate, Bruce/0000-0002-7337-1887",,,,33,56,62,1,25,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2002,131,4,,,,,542,548,,10.1007/s00442-002-0932-6,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,562UU,WOS:000176218000009,28547549,,,,10/31/19J,"Battistoni, F; Platero, R; Noya, F; Arias, A; Fabiano, E",,,,"Battistoni, F; Platero, R; Noya, F; Arias, A; Fabiano, E",,,Intracellular Fe content influences nodulation competitiveness of Sinorhizobium meliloti strains as inocula of alfalfa,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,iron starvation; rhizobia; competitiveness; alfalfa; Sinorhizobium; siderophores; nodule occupancy,IRON TRANSPORT-SYSTEMS; RHIZOBIUM-LEGUMINOSARUM; SIDEROPHORES; ETLI,"Rhizobia, as well as most soil bacteria, frequently face variable Fe conditions.

The soil was a sandy loam with 9% clay, 1.6-4.0% organic matter (OM) and pH 5.8-7.2. Sewage sludge, artificially enriched with four concentrations of each heavy metal or combinations was applied in 1982 and again in 1986 to some of the plots. Ni and Zn + Ni treatments did not have significant effects on the soil nematode assemblages. Some of the Cu, Zn + Cu and Zn treatments had adverse effects, which correlated with the following changes in their structure, decrease in genus/family richness, decrease in maturity indices (MI and MI(2-5)) of the free-living nematode assemblages, reduction or elimination of the persisters (K-strategists) in favor of colonizers (r-strategists), decrease or elimination of omnivorous nematodes (Order Dorylaimida, Suborder Dorylaimma) and predatory nematodes (Order Dorylaimida, Suborder Mononchina). The increase in plant-feeding nematodes in the Zn treated plots may be due to the negative effects of the heavy metals on some of their antagonists (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi, root-nodule bacteria from Rhizobium spp.) and the elimination of predacious nematodes in these treatments. Some bacterial-feeding nematodes were found to increase, which was related to the indirect long-term effects of the heavy metals (e.g., lower competition and reduced predation pressure). The most common responses of the nematode communities to soil heavy metal pollution were found to be in agreement with the trends expected in stressed ecosystems and communities, predicted by the hypothesis that stress forces ecosystems into an early stage of development.

Spore density and association of vesicular root system with arbuscular mycorrhizal structure groups such as vesicles, arbuscules, and hyphae were used to assess and compare the responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to plant cover and their abiotic environment. Different plant cover significantly affected arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization and spore density. Higher spore density tended to be correlated with higher arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization under A. herba-alba and A. halimus, and vice versa for Z. dumosum and H. scoparia. At the tested soil depths, the highest arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization at the 20-30 cm depth did not coincide with higher spore density at the 10-20 cm depth. Sampling depth had a significant effect on spore density and the percentage of total arbuscular colonization. Spore density was positively correlated with vesicular colonization and negatively correlated with arbuscular colonization. Soil total soluble N exhibited a negative effect on spore density, while soil water content and organic matter content did not exhibit a significant correlation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization and spore density.","Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; NW Sci & Technol Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Life Sci, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Steinberger, Y (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",,,,,,,32,22,47,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

All models assume a monotonously decreasing function describing the distribution of the fine-root biomass of a subject tree depending on the distance to the trunk of the tree. To the contrary, the models differ in the maximum distance from the stem where roots can be found. There were high correlations between the observed and the predicted fine-root biomasses for all models in a part of the stand where the trees are distributed less uniformly and where root biomasses are most heterogeneous. In a section with medium stand density, the model of diameter at breast height dependent root spread yields higher correlation coefficients compared with the fixed-distance approach of the two other models. Significant correlations between model predictions of root distributions and measured soil water potential supported the validity of the models.

The concentration of phenolic compounds in fine roots increased approximately 2-fold during the later stages of the season, and the total phenolic content of dead fine roots reached a maximum value of 38 mg/g dry weight. The late-season increase in total phenolics was primarily due to accumulation of three different flavones (morusin, morusinol; and kuwanon C). These three flavones were shown to support the growth of the bacterium Burkholderia sp. LB400, a degrader of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Thus, it has been established that, upon death, the fine roots of mulberry can serve as a source of substrate for PCB-degrading bacteria.

However, vitality of mature oak stands have decreased in the last decade. Symptoms of fine root degeneration as well as soil structure deficiencies in the upper layer have been observed. This study tested the working hypothesis that deficiencies in soil gas permeability reduce fine root formation and thereby reduce stress tolerance of trees. Topsoil gas diffusivity, root density and oak vitality were assessed for 36 oak stands with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.). The relationship between topsoil gas diffusivity, soil respiration and soil CO2 concentration were also investigated. Evidence that root density decreases significantly with decreasing soil gas permeability was found, which is representative for oak stands at southwest Germany. Heavily damaged oak stands have been found only at sites suffering from soil aeration deficiencies. Although, we observed decreased soil respiration in compacted soils, CO2 concentration in soil was up to three times higher on these sites. High Soil CO2 concentrations indicate insufficient soil aeration rather than high biological activity. Insufficient soil aeration is apparently an important factor causing oak decline. It cannot be, therefore, concluded from the oak's ability to open up dense subsoils that they can be used for the restoration of stands with compacted topsoils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, many direct seedings of beech seeds provided unsatisfactory results without a clear explanation for this lack of success. In order to identify the main factors determining seed germination under the canopy of pure Norway spruce stands, three different treatments of direct seeding were tested. These treatments were: (i) direct seeding without additional measure (control), (ii) direct seeding and liming, and (iii) direct seeding covered with beech leaf litter. The experiment consists of two stands. Direct seeding was carried out on six plots per treatment and stand. Each plot includes 81 sample units of 0.5 m(2) upon each of which 15 g of seeds were sown. The germinative capacity of the seeds was pre-determined (68%). Germination of the seeds was recorded repeatedly from May to September 1997. On the related sample units canopy density was measured and fine root biomass of the overstorey trees was estimated. There was a significant difference in seedling number between the two stands. The number of seedlings did not increase by liming (coincident with seeding). In contrast, the covering of seeds with leaf litter caused a remarkable and significant increase in the number of germinated seeds. As ANCOVA showed, models including canopy density or estimated fine root biomass of the overstorey trees explained 72 and 52% of the variation in mean seedling number per plot. As canopy density as well as estimated fine root biomass determine the water content of the soil. it can be assumed that the germination of beech seeds originating from direct seedings under the canopy of pure spruce stands depends to a great extent on soil moisture at the time when the direct seeding is carried out, as well as the weeks following seeding. For this reason, direct seedings in very dense stands are not recommended against the background of this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Karst.; Fagus sylvatica L.,FOREST STANDS; BEECH,"PROGNAUS is an individual tree growth model, containing a major sub-model which depicts basal area growth as a function of tree size, competition and a set of diagnostic site variables. The coefficients of this model have previously been estimated using the data from the Austrian National Forest (ANF) inventory. The examination of 60 new sample plots in two Austrian growth districts showed that the increment of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in pure spruce stands was overestimated by this model while it was underestimated in mixed species stands with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). In order to adapt PROGNAUS to account for this effect, the data of the 60 plots were used to modify PROGNAUS by adding quantitative soil characteristics and the percentage of Not-way spruce as variables. The markedly improved model accounts for the effect that in a given stand, below a certain competition level, Norway spruce grows better in the pure stand than in an otherwise comparable mixed species stand. These small spruce trees in mixed stands have a shallow rooting system and therefore suffer from water stress, which is caused by the competing European beech with its higher water consumption. and deeper rooting system. Adding the Norway spruce proportion as an independent variable into the original model and re-parameterising it with the data of the ANF inventory, reveals that this effect can be generalised to some extent, but differs in magnitude depending on the geological substrate.

To test this idea, we traced the course of C through the soil microbial community using soils from the free-air CO2 and O-3 enrichment site in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. We added either C-13-labeled cellobiose or C-13-labeled N-acetylglucosamine to soils collected beneath ecologically distinct temperate trees exposed for 3 years to factorial CO2 (ambient and 200 mu1 1(-1) above ambient) and O-3 (ambient and 20 mu1 1(-1) above ambient) treatments. For both labeled substrates, recovery of C-13 in microbial respiration increased beneath plants grown under elevated CO2 by 29% compared to ambient; elevated O-3 eliminated this effect. Production of C-13-CO2 from soils beneath aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and aspen-birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) was greater than that beneath aspenmaple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Phospholipid fatty acid analyses (C-13-PLFAs) indicated that the microbial community beneath plants exposed to elevated CO2 metabolized more C-13-cellobiose, compared to the microbial community beneath plants exposed to the ambient condition. Recovery of C-13 in PLFAs was an order of magnitude greater for N-acetylglucosamine-amended soil compared to cellobiose-amended soil, indicating that substrate type influenced microbial metabolism and soil C cycling. We found that elevated CO2 increased fungal activity and microbial metabolism of cellobiose, and that microbial processes under early-successional aspen and birch species were more strongly affected by CO2 and O-3 enrichment than those under late-successional maple.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Tennessee, Ctr Environm Biotechnol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Phillips, RL (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 430 E Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012; Phillips, Rebecca/G-6175-2015","Phillips, Rebecca/0000-0003-3881-9065; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,53,123,150,1,31,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2002,131,2,,,,,236,244,,10.1007/s00442-002-0868-x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,550NT,WOS:000175509700009,28547691,,,,10/31/19J,"Hamilton, JG; DeLucia, EH; George, K; Naidu, SL; Finzi, AC; Schlesinger, WH",,,,"Hamilton, JG; DeLucia, EH; George, K; Naidu, SL; Finzi, AC; Schlesinger, WH",,,Forest carbon balance under elevated CO2,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon dioxide; free-air CO2 enrichment; Pinus taeda; global carbon cycle; carbon sequestration,NET ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY; INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; LOBLOLLY-PINE PLANTATION; FINE-ROOT RESPIRATION; MAINTENANCE RESPIRATION; UNITED-STATES; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; TISSUE CONSTRUCTION; PICEA-ENGELMANNII; TEMPERATE FOREST,"Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology was used to expose a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest to elevated atmospheric CO2 (ambient + 200 mu1 1(-1)). After 4 years, basal area of pine trees was 9.2% larger in elevated than in ambient CO2 plots. During the first 3 years the growth rate of pine was stimulated by similar to26%. In the fourth year this stimulation declined to 23%. The average net ecosystem production (NEP) in the ambient plots was 428 gC m(-2) year(-1), indicating that the forest was a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO, stimulated NEP by 41%. This increase was primarily an increase in plant biomass increment (57%). and secondarily increased accumulation of carbon in the forest floor (35%) and fine root increment (8%). Net primary production (NPP) was stimulated by 27%, driven primarily by increases in the growth rate of the pines. Total heterotrophic respiration (R-h) increased by 165%, but total autotrophic respiration (R-a) was unaffected. Gross primary production was increased by 18%. The largest uncertainties in the carbon budget remain in separating below ground heterotrophic (soil microbes) and autotrophic (root) respiration. If applied to temperate forests globally, the increase in NEP that we measured would fix less than 10% of the anthropogenic CO2 projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. This may represent an upper limit because rising global temperatures, land disturbance, and heterotrophic decomposition of woody tissues will ultimately cause an increased flux of carbon back to the atmosphere.","Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","DeLucia, EH (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 265 Morrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",delucia@uiuc.edu,"Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016","Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533",,,,71,176,199,2,85,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2002,131,2,,,,,250,260,,10.1007/s00442-002-0884-x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,550NT,WOS:000175509700011,28547693,,,,10/31/19J,"Dell'Orto, M; Pirovano, L; Villalba, JM; Gonzalez-Reyes, JA; Zocchi, G",,,,"Dell'Orto, M; Pirovano, L; Villalba, JM; Gonzalez-Reyes, JA; Zocchi, G",,,Localization of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in Fe-deficient cucumber roots by immunodetection,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,immunolocalization; iron-deficiency; PM H+-ATPase; proton extrusion; rhizosphere acidification; root hairs,TRANSFER-CELL-FORMATION; RHIZODERMAL TRANSFER CELLS; IRON-DEFICIENCY; STRESS-RESPONSE; PROTON EFFLUX; IMMUNOCYTOLOCALIZATION; MECHANISM; REDUCTASE,"As in several Strategy I plants, iron-deficiency induces in cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L.) roots a strong increase in the PM (plasma membrane) H+-ATPase activity with a consequent acidification of the rhizosphere. This increase is mainly due to enhanced synthesis of the enzyme even though other regulatory mechanisms have not yet been ruled out. As it was found in many other dicot species, in Fe-deficient cucumber roots we found a strong development of short lateral roots and swollen root tips; furthermore an enhanced H+ extrusion was particularly confined to the subapical swollen zone. Analysis of the root tissue structure by optical and electron microscopy showed a strong proliferation of root hairs at the subapical level and some ultrastructural modifications in the external layers. The structural localization of the PM H+-ATPase studied by immunohistochemistry showed that the increase of the PM protein is not simply due to a greater number of root tips in Fe-deficient plants but also to an increased enzyme content in each tip; moreover, the enhanced H+ extrusion seems to be functionally coupled to the root hairs formation. Northern analysis of PM H+-ATPase mRNA extracted from apical root segments using a cDNA probe specific for the PM H+-ATPase of cucumber roots suggests that the modulation of the enzyme synthesis occurs at the transcriptional level.","Univ Milan, Dipartimento Prod Vegetale, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Univ Cordoba, Dept Biol Celular Fisiol & Immunol, Cordoba, Spain","Zocchi, G (reprint author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Prod Vegetale, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",,"Gonzalez-Reyes, Jose A/K-1367-2014","Gonzalez-Reyes, Jose A/0000-0003-1918-5490",,,,17,24,26,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2002,241,1,,,,,11,17,,10.1023/A:1016030514200,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,566EY,WOS:000176415100002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bent, E; Breuil, C; Enebak, S; Chanway, CP",,,,"Bent, E; Breuil, C; Enebak, S; Chanway, CP",,,Surface colonization of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia [Dougl.

This exudation occurs through proteoid root clusters, with citrate being the predominant organic acid released. The occasional detection of malate in whole root exudates suggests that this acid would also be released, but from tissues other than root clusters. To investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of exudation, citrate and malate exudation and concentration were measured in whole roots and root sections of white lupin, from seedling emergence to plant senescence due to P starvation. Both organic acids were detected in whole root exudates of P-stressed plants, and they were released at similar rates throughout the experiment. Malate was predominantly exuded from apices of both seedling taproots and proteoid roots, whereas citrate exudation was restricted to proteoid root clusters. Studies directed to address the association between carboxylate exudation and concentration in proteoid root clusters showed a non-linear response for citrate, within the range of 7 to 23 mumol g(-1) fresh weight. This association was further assessed by altering citrate concentration in the whole root. Adding P to 24-day-old P-starved plants reduced citrate concentration and exudation to the level of the control P-fed plants, demonstrating that citrate exudation and concentration are associated. Malate exudation and concentration did not correlate significantly. Results indicate that citrate release by P-starved white lupin would occur whenever a certain threshold of citrate concentration is attained, and that the sites, the rates and the span of transient exudation depend on the physiological age of the tissue.","Inst Invest Agropecuarias Carillanca, Dept Prod Vegetal, Temuco, Chile; Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile; Univ Concepcion, Dept Mol Biol, Concepcion, Chile","Penaloza, E (reprint author), Inst Invest Agropecuarias Carillanca, Dept Prod Vegetal, Casilla 58-D, Temuco, Chile.",epenaloz@carillanca.inia.cl,,,,,,26,28,28,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2002,241,2,,,,,209,221,,10.1023/A:1016148222687,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,572MN,WOS:000176778900005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gill, RA; Burke, IC; Lauenroth, WK; Milchunas, DG",,,,"Gill, RA; Burke, IC; Lauenroth, WK; Milchunas, DG",,,Longevity and turnover of roots in the shortgrass steppe: influence of diameter and depth,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bouteloua gracilis; minirhizotron; root dynamics; root mortality; rooting profiles,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FORESTS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; FINE ROOTS; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; MINIRHIZOTRON TECHNIQUE; SOIL-WATER; DYNAMICS; ECOSYSTEMS; PATTERNS; TEMPERATURE,"We used minirhizotrons to determine patterns of root longevity and turnover for the perennial bunchgrass Bouteloua gracilis in the shortgrass steppe of eastern Colorado, USA. We hypothesized that root longevity would be partially controlled by root diameter, following previously observed patterns in woody plants. In addition, we hypothesized that root turnover would be greatest in surface soil horizons and decrease with depth due to variation in soil moisture availability and temperature. Root longevity was correlated with root diameter. Median life span of roots > 0.4 mm was approximately 320 days, while roots < 0.2 mm had a median life span of 180 days. There was approximately a 6% decrease in the likelihood of mortality with a 0.10-mm increase in root diameter, controlling for the effect of depth in the soil profile. Root length production and mortality were highest in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile and decreased with depth. However, because root length density also decreased with depth, there were no significant differences in turnover rate of root length among sampling intervals. Turnover was approximately 0.86 yr(-1) based on root length production, while turnover was 0.35 yr(-1) using root length mortality as a measurement of flux. The imbalance between turnover estimates may be a consequence of the time the minirhizotrons were in place prior to imaging or may result from our lack of over-winter measures of mortality. Our work suggests that Bouteloua gracilis roots have complex life history strategies, similar to woody species. Some portion of the root system is highly ephemeral, while slightly larger roots persist much longer. These differences have implications for belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles in the shortgrass steppe.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27705 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Gill, RA (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",rgill@wsu.edu,"Burke, Ingrid/A-1420-2009","Burke, Ingrid/0000-0003-4717-6399",,,,60,62,72,5,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2002,159,2,,,,,241,251,,10.1023/A:1015529507670,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,552TV,WOS:000175636900010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lakzian, A; Murphy, P; Turner, A; Beynon, JL; Giller, KE",,,,"Lakzian, A; Murphy, P; Turner, A; Beynon, JL; Giller, KE",,,"Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae populations in soils with increasing heavy metal contamination: abundance, plasmid profiles, diversity and metal tolerance",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,metal toxicity; sewage sludge; pollution; zinc; microbial ecology; Rhizobium; plasmids; metal tolerances; diversity,FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM; BIOVAR TRIFOLII; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; PAST APPLICATIONS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; FIELD POPULATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNITIES; SURVIVAL; BACTERIA,"Populations of Rhizobium leguminosartan bv. viciae were investigated from plots of a long-term sewage Sludge experiment in Braunschweig Germany, which represented a gradient of increasing metal contamination.

Whereas plasmid profiles indicated considerable changes in strains with increasing metal contamination, one ITS group (group 1) was present in all plots. Isolates from ITS group 1 contained only three to four plasmids in the control plots but those from the most contaminated plots had eight to nine plasmids. There was a marked increase in metal tolerance of isolates belonging to ITS group 1 as metal contamination increased, which was associated with the increase in the number of plasmids carried. However, another ITS group (group 2), which had only three large plasmids was present only in the most contaminated plot. Isolates from this group had less tolerance to Zn than many isolates from the uncontaminated plots.

Potential of seed and seedling root exudates for proliferation of Bradyrhizobium japonicum PNT119 was evaluated in the soybean cvs. Enrei and Tachinagaha. In both cultivars, seed exudates showed a higher potential than root exudates. In the seed exudates, a low-molecular high-polarity fraction including sugars and amino acids showed a higher potential than both high-molecular fraction and low-molecular low-polarity fraction. The correlations between the sugar or amino acid contents of seed exudates and the number of root nodule primordia at 7 d after sowing were investigated among 12 soybean cultivars. When seeds were inoculated with a low rhizobium. density, a high correlation coefficient was detected between them. However, there was no positive correlation in the plants inoculated with a high rhizobium density. These results suggest that the amount of low molecular substances in the seed exudates determines the number of root nodule primordia through rhizobium proliferation around seed and young roots when the rhizobium density is the limiting factor. The genetic trait relating to seed coat secretion should be considered as a possible key factor contributing to adequate root nodulation in soybean seedlings cultivated in fields with a low rhizobium density.","Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Iizuka, M (reprint author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.",,"yokoyama, tadashi/G-1095-2013",,,,,26,6,6,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Whole-plant relative growth rate and root/shoot and lateral/structural root ratios were also evaluated. Net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were markedly decreased by all of the salt treatments. Growth was also strongly depressed by all salt treatments, especially lateral root growth. Leaf water potential decreased soon after salinity stress was imposed, whereas there was a lag of several weeks before leaf osmotic potential decreased in response to the salt treatments. After 5 weeks of salinization, leaf turgor of salt-treated plants was similar to that of controls. Although Ne+ + Cl- contributed little to the salt-induced changes in osmotic potential at full turgor (Psi(piFT)), the contributions of K+, mannitol (Man) and glucose (Glc) to Psi(piFT) markedly increased as external salinity increased. Salt accumulation was negligible in the youngest leaves, which mostly accumulated soluble carbohydrates and K+: in contrast, old leaves served as storage sinks for Na+ and Cl-. Photosynthetic performance of salt-treated plants fully recovered once salt was leached from the root zone, with the recovery rate depending on the severity of the salt stress previously experienced by the plants. Recovery of gas exchange occurred even though the leaves still had a salt load similar to that detected in leaves at the end of the 5-week salinity period, and had markedly lower concentrations of K+ and soluble carbohydrates than control leaves. We conclude that salt-induced water stress primarily controlled gas exchange of salt-treated P. latifolia leaves, whereas the salt load in the leaves did not cause irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus.","CNR, Ist Propagazione Specie Legnose, I-50018 Florence, Italy","Tattini, M (reprint author), CNR, Ist Propagazione Specie Legnose, Via Ponte Formicola 76, I-50018 Florence, Italy.",tattini@ipsl.fi.cnr.it,"Tattini, Massimiliano/K-1238-2019","Tattini, Massimiliano/0000-0001-5434-8860",,,,72,44,48,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2002,22,6,,,,,403,412,,10.1093/treephys/22.6.403,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,546NM,WOS:000175280200005,11960765,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"El Karkouri, K; Martin, F; Mousain, D",,,,"El Karkouri, K; Martin, F; Mousain, D",,,Dominance of the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizopogon rubescens in a plantation of Pinus pinea seedlings inoculated with Suillus collinitus,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Pinus pinea L.; plantation; ectomycorrhizal diversity; PCR-RFLP; rDNA (ITS),ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MURICATA FOREST; DIVERSITY; WILDFIRE; SPECIFICITY; TREES,"We examined the below-ground mycorrhizal diversity of P. pinea seedlings inoculated with S. collinitus six years after outplanting in a disturbed site, located at La Petite-Camargue (Gard, France).

The mechanisms underlying the coexistence of AM and EM are not well understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the two types of mycorrhizae are separated along a soil depth gradient. Vertical distribution of EM and AM colonization in roots of R tremuloides ramets (within a boreal mixedwood 3-year-old clear-cut) was assessed at three different rooting depths (i.e. 0-5, 5-10 and > 10 cm) and compared to edaphic properties in the adjacent soil. We predicted that EM colonization would be more abundant in the shallow organic soils and AM colonization would be more abundant in deeper mineral soils. Significantly fewer EM root tips were found in the >10 cm soil depth than in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths. Vesicle, AM hyphae and total fungal colonization were significantly lower in the top 5 cm of the soil than in the 5-10 and >10 cm depths. Overall EM root tip mantle formation approximately averaged 86%, while overall AM colonization averaged 6%. A significant negative correlation between EM and AM fungal colonization over all the depths was found (Spearman correlation, r = -0.314, P < 0.05). Results of this study support our hypothesis that EM and AM are preferentially partitioned at different soil depths. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Higher AMF colonization of roots after I I months of cultivation in the cellulose amended treatment was found compared to the unamended treatment.

A positive effect of cellulose on the total length of extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium at the second harvest was observed. Significant changes in amounts of bacterial CFU and of the saprophytic fungus Penicillium pinophilum in the substrate amended with cellulose were recorded after I I months of cultivation. No significant changes in total and oxidizable carbon in AMF-inoculated substrate were found. The contribution of AMF extraradical mycelium to the total content of organic matter in the substrate represented less than 2%.

So far, the majority of studies have considered these links from the microbial point of view, usually with single plants or very simple plant communities. Here, we report the interactions between two components of the soil food web, root-feeding insects and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and their effects on the structure and development of early successional plant communities. We use long-term field experiments that employ manipulations of these organisms, both singly and in combination. Both groups have strong effects on plant community structure, with root-feeding insects increasing and AM fungi decreasing plant species richness. Root-feeding insects appear to accelerate the process of early succession, while AM fungi retard it. There are strong interactions between the insects and fungi. The effect of insects is greatest when AM fungi are present. It is suggested that this is a consequence of plant physiology, rather than any direct interaction between the groups involved. Meanwhile, AM fungi have their greatest effect on plant communities when insects are absent, suggesting that there is some disruption of the symbiosis by the invertebrates, In developing plant communities, the rate and direction of the succession is therefore determined by the relative abundance of these two members of the soil food web. The next challenge will be to understand the roles of other members of the subterranean web in terms of their interactions with insects and AM fungi and effects on plant community development.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ Reading, Dept Agr, Ctr Agrienvironm Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","Gange, AC (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,41,39,43,0,37,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

In general, biosolids increased shoot biomass of both species, which was partly a result of the increased soil NO3-N concentrations that followed biosolids application. More biomass was allocated to the roots of the grasses when biosolids and irrigation levels were low. In contrast, more biomass was allocated to the shoots when biosolids and irrigation levels were high. Shoot biomass production and soil NO3-N concentrations were enhanced more by the spring application of biosolids than by the summer application.

In previous work, we showed that each plant species is associated with a single genus or a set of closely related genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here we show that the level of specificity is much higher. We used a molecular phylogenetic approach to contrast specificity patterns among eight plant lineages and three fungal genera. We relied on fungal nuclear internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) sequence data obtained from 161 basidiocarps and 85 monotropoid roots representing 286 sampled plants screened using restriction length polymorphisms. From the phylogenetic placement of fungal symbionts in fungal phylograms, we found that three basal (Sarcodes, Pterospora, Pleuricospora) and one derived lineage (Allotropa) of plants target narrow clades of closely related species groups of fungi, and four derived lineages (Monotropa hypopithys species group, Pityopus) target more distant species groups. Within most plant lineages, geography and photobiont association constrain specificity. Specificity extended further in Pterospora andromedea, in which sequence haplotypes at the plastid trn L-F region of 73 plants were significantly associated with different fungal species groups even in sympatry. These results indicate that both the macro- and microevolution of the Monotropoideae are tightly coupled to their mycorrhizal symbionts.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bidartondo, MI (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,58,110,115,0,47,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

DNA was extracted directly from plant roots, soil or isolated AMF spores, and prominent bands resulting from AMF-specific DGGE profiles were excised for sequence analysis. This strategy provided a robust means of detecting and identifying AMF-like species without the use of trap plant cultivation methods. A number of Glomus-like and Scutellospora-like sequences was detected, including a putatively novel Glomus species, and differences were observed in the dominant AMF-like populations detected in healthy vs. degenerating stands of A. arenaria and in bulk sand dune soil. It has previously been suggested that plant pathogens, such as fungi and nematodes, may contribute to the decline of A. arenaria. Although no causal relationship can be drawn between the observed differences in the dominantly detected AMF-like populations and the vitality of plant growth, these results indicate that mutualistic interactions between this plant and AMF should not be overlooked when examining the role of soil-borne microorganisms in vegetation dynamics. In addition, there were discrepancies observed between the AMF-like groups detected in spore populations vs. direct 18S rDNA analysis of root material, corroborating previous suggestions that spore inspection alone may poorly represent actual AMF population structure.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Embrapa Agrobiol Ant Rod Rio SP, Seropedica, RJ, Brazil","Kowalchuk, GA (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Boterhoeksestr 48, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",,"Kowalchuk, George/C-4298-2011; de Souza, Francisco/I-1961-2013; van Veen, Johannes A/C-3697-2011",,,,,59,129,145,1,51,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Study sites included six coniferous forests, dominated by Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus ponderosa, and Juniperus occidentalis, and ranged in location from the Pacific coast to the eastern side of the Cascade Mountains (a 250-km transect). Mean annual precipitation across these sites ranged from 227 to 2,760 mm. Overall delta(13)C(R) varied from -23.1 to -33.1parts per thousand, and within a single forest, it varied in magnitude by 3.5-8.5parts per thousand. Mean annual delta(13)C(R) differed significantly in the forests and was strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation. The carbon isotope ratio of carbon stocks (leaves, fine roots, litter, and soil organic matter) varied similarly with mean precipitation (more positive at the drier sites). There was a strong link between delta(13)C(R) and the vapor saturation deficit of air (vpd) 5-10 days earlier, both across and within sites. This relationship is consistent with stomatal regulation of gas exchange and associated changes in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination. Recent freeze events caused significant deviation from the 513 delta(13)C(R) versus vpd relationship, resulting in higher than expected delta(13)C(R) values.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Stable Isotope Ratio Facil Environm Res, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Bowling, DR (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Stable Isotope Ratio Facil Environm Res, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203",,,,71,264,279,1,71,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2002,131,1,,,,,113,124,,10.1007/s00442-001-0851-y,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,538QD,WOS:000174825800015,28547501,,,,10/31/19J,"Gessler, A; Kreuzwieser, J; Dopatka, T; Rennenberg, H",,,,"Gessler, A; Kreuzwieser, J; Dopatka, T; Rennenberg, H",,,Diurnal courses of ammonium net uptake by the roots of adult beech (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce (Picea abies) trees,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbohydrates; N compounds; organic acids; regulation; xylem flow,SOLUBLE N-COMPOUNDS; NO3 UPTAKE; SOYBEAN PLANTS; HIGH LOADS; ATMOSPHERIC AMMONIA; FIELD CONDITIONS; LOLIUM-PERENNE; NITRATE UPTAKE; AMINO-ACIDS; NITROGEN,"Differences in ammonium net uptake by the roots of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) trees between day and night were examined during the growing seasons in 1995 and 1996 using the depletion technique. In addition, diurnal courses of ammonium net uptake of both species were analysed in five sets of uptake experiments in May and September 1997 and were related (1) to the content of carbohydrates, organic acids and total soluble non protein N (TSNN) in the fine roots, and (2) to xylem flow densities and soil temperature. During the growing seasons 1995 and 1996, ammonium net uptake of beech was significantly lower during the night than during the day at 5 of 8 dates of measurement. On average, uptake rates during the night amounted to 50% of the uptake rates during the day. In spruce, the mean values of ammonium net uptake rates determined were similar between day and night during both growing seasons. In beech, the assessment of diurnal courses showed highest ammonium uptake rates during noon and in the afternoon and minima at midnight. In May 1997, comparable, but less pronounced diurnal patterns of ammonium uptake were observed in spruce, whereas in September 1997, ammonium uptake by spruce was constant during the day. Since no distinct differences in carbohydrate and organic acid contents in fine roots were observed during the diurnal courses and since the addition of sucrose into the artificial soil solutions root tips were exposed to did not alter ammonium uptake, depression of uptake by C- and/or energy limitation during night could be excluded. The TSNN contents in the fine roots of beech (May and September 1997) and spruce (May 1997) showed a diurnal pattern inverse to ammonium uptake. It is concluded that the enrichment of TSNN compounds during night that is apparently caused by a reduction of xylem transport is responsible for the down-regulation of ammonium net-uptake.","Inst Forstbot & Baumphysiol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany","Gessler, A (reprint author), Inst Forstbot & Baumphysiol, Flughafen 17, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",,"Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Rennenberg, Heinz/A-2083-2013","Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Rennenberg, Heinz/0000-0001-6224-2927",,,,37,38,38,0,16,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2002,240,1,,,,,23,32,,10.1023/A:1015831304911,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,560UG,WOS:000176099300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Valladares, F; Villar-Salvador, P; Dominguez, S; Fernandez-Pascual, M; Penuelas, JL; Pugnaire, FI",,,,"Valladares, F; Villar-Salvador, P; Dominguez, S; Fernandez-Pascual, M; Penuelas, JL; Pugnaire, FI",,,Enhancing the early performance of the leguminous shrub Retama sphaerocarpa (L.)

Boiss, a leafless leguminous shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and North-West Africa that has generated interest for revegation of dry Mediterranean habitats. Our main objective was to optimise the formation of root nodules under nursery conditions and to evaluate their influence on the first year of seedling growth in comparison with standard fertilisation. Seedlings of R. sphaerocarpa from two Spanish localities were grown under two levels of fertilisation, and half of each were inoculated with rhizobia isolated from adult Retama, Cytisus and Adenocarpus plants in the field. Although some promiscuity was observed, nodulation was significantly successful with specific rhizobia. At the end of the experiment, highly fertilised plants were taller and heavier and exhibited larger photosynthetic rates than either nodulated or non-nodulated plants under low fertilisation. High fertilisation enhanced seedling growth but inhibited both the nodulation and the nitrogenase activity of the nodules. Thus, physiological differences between nodulated and non-nodulated plants were observed in the low but not in the high fertilisation treatment. Nitrogen uptake and use was enhanced by root nodules, which translated into enhanced photosynthesis and growth. Since inoculation is simple, environmentally friendly and cheap, and nodulated plants are more likely to overcome transplant stress than non-nodulated ones, our results suggest that inoculation together with low, background fertilisation (instead of high fertilisation) should be used when producing high quality seedlings of this autochthonous Mediterranean shrub.","CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Minist Medio Ambiente, DGCONA, Ctr Nacl Mejora Forestal El Serranillo, E-19004 Guadalajara, Spain; CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Valladares, F (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Ciencias Medioambientales, Serrano 115 Dpdo, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",,"Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/L-1380-2014; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008","Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/0000-0001-9338-4530; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827",,,,37,31,33,0,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2002,240,2,,,,,253,262,,10.1023/A:1015752320773,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,559BU,WOS:000176005400005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sanches, MC; Valio, IFM",,,,"Sanches, MC; Valio, IFM",,,Seedling growth of climbing species from a southeast Brazilian tropical forest,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,growth; shade tolerance; tropical climbers,TREE SEEDLINGS; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CHARACTERISTICS; SPECTRAL QUALITY; SHADE-TOLERANCE; LIGHT QUALITY; MORPHOLOGY; PLANTS; IRRADIANCE; QUEENSLAND; SURVIVAL,"Climbers are considered heliophytes.

The initial growth of the seedlings was followed under two conditions: at the margin and under the canopy of a mesophyllous tropical forest (22degrees 49'55'' S-47degrees 06'33'' W). The climbers showed high rates of growth in sunlight when compared to those under canopy. Most of the species presented higher growth of the shoot than roots but in general no significative differences between root/shoot were found in both treatments. Bidens, Cissus, Mutisia and Pithecoctenium showed a very high mortality rate under canopy but, most of the studied species survived under deep shaded forest for approximately 100 days.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Fisiol Vegetal, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Sanches, MC (reprint author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Fisiol Vegetal, C Postal 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",,,,,,,37,9,10,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2002,159,1,,,,,51,59,,10.1023/A:1015561819506,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,552TP,WOS:000175636400005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Moynahan, OS; Zabinski, CA; Gannon, JE",,,,"Moynahan, OS; Zabinski, CA; Gannon, JE",,,Microbial community structure and carbon-utilization diversity in a mine tailings revegetation study,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,microbial community; soil microbes; arbuscular mycorrhizae; mine waste reclamation; heavy metals,CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; HEAVY-METALS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ORGANIC-MATTER; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; SOIL; RECLAMATION; BIOMASS; COLONIZATION,"Restoration of metals-contaminated environments requires a functional microbial community for successful plant community establishment, soil development, and biogeochemical cycling. Our research measured microbial community structure and carbon-utilization diversity in treatment plots from a mine waste revegetation project near Butte, Montana. Treatments included two controls (raw tailings) either (1) with or (2) without tilling, (3) shallow-tilled lime addition, (4) deep-tilled lime addition, (5) lime slurry injection, (6) topsoil addition, and (7) an undisturbed area near the tailings. Microbial community structural differences were assayed by plate counts of heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and bacterial endospores, and quantification of arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization. Metabolic diversity differences were assessed by carbon-utilization profiles generated with Biolog microtiter plates. Heterotrophic bacteria counts were significantly higher in the limed and topsoil treatment plots than the control plots, and the actinomycete and fungal counts increased in the tilled control plot as well. Endospore counts were significantly higher in the topsoil addition and the undisturbed plots than the other treatment plots. Carbon-utilization activity was very low in untreated plots, intermediate in lime-treated plots, and very high in topsoil and undisturbed plots. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) colonization levels of two grass species showed low levels of colonization on control, shallow-limed, and lime slurry-injected plots, and high levels on the deep-limed and topsoil-addition plots. Plant and soil system components increased across the treatment plots, but individual components responded differently to changing environmental conditions.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Moynahan, OS (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,,,,,,49,70,82,2,69,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

We conducted a study to determine which of the following two topsoil management strategies resulted in less of a negative impact to the soil and vegetation resources and better promoted site restoration on in situ uranium wellfields (1) removal of topsoil from an entire wellfield and stockpiling until mining activity is complete; or (2) leaving the majority of topsoil on the wellfield and allowing it to be exposed to disturbance associated with wellfield development activity (primarily heavy vehicle traffic). Our study compared selected soil properties from areas on in situ uranium wellfields managed by the two strategies stated above and with adjacent, relatively undisturbed sites. Vegetation reestablishment was assessed on sites where topsoil was left in place. Results indicated that levels of vehicular traffic on wellfields did not cause significant soil compaction and that removal and stockpiling of topsoil results in more negative impacts than disturbance inflicted when topsoil is left in place.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Stahl, PD (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",,,,,,,43,20,20,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

A better understanding of the mechanism of inhibition of symbiosis establishment in these soils, and its alleviation by minimal liming, could aid in the solution of this problem. White clover (Trifolium repens L.) seedlings were planted in two model systems (deepots or plates), utilizing an air-dried, nonsterile Ultisol limed from pH,, 4.71 (nil lime) to 4.99, and inoculated with effective rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii). Both model systems demonstrated the stimulatory effect of low-level liming (soil pH increase) on nodulation 14 days after planting (DAP) and before differences in shoot mass responses were apparent. Examination of roots grown in soil plates (similar to 1/5 volume of deepots) at 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 DAP revealed a significant (v = 0.90; P less than or equal to 0.05) nodulation response to soil pH, but only at 14 DAP. However, the consistent pattern of nodulation responses to soil pH, almost throughout the entire growth period, suggests that nodulation was being stimulated by low-level liming as early as 6 to 8 DAP. With the exception of small differences toward the end of the experiment (12-14 DAP), root development (total length, diameter, volume, surface area, tip, and fork number) was unaffected by soil pH. Root length, sorted into eight diameter classes, was similarly unresponsive to soil pH. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of symbiosis establishment in our soil plate model system occurs at the cellular (root hair and/or nodule primordium) level, rather than at the tissue (root) level. From a practical (field) perspective, our finding that the rhizobial level interacted with soil pH on nodulation intensity suggests that the development of either a more acidic soil-tolerant plant cultivar or rhizobial strain would lead to a more rapid and robust symbiosis in infertile, acidic soils.","USDA, ARS, NAA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, Beaver, WV 25813 USA","Staley, TE (reprint author), USDA, ARS, NAA, Appalachian Farming Syst Res Ctr, 1224 Airport Rd, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",tstaley@afsrc.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,18,3,3,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,MAR,2002,167,3,,,,,211,221,,10.1097/00010694-200203000-00006,,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,533MX,WOS:000174535200006,,,,,10/31/19
