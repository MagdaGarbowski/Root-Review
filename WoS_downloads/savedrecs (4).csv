Variation in root communities has been attributed to plant host effects and microbial host preferences, as well as to factors pertaining to soil conditions, microbial biogeography and the presence of viable microbial propagules. To address hypotheses regarding the influence of plant host and soil biogeography on root fungal and bacterial communities, we designed a trap-plant bioassay experiment. Replicate Populus, Quercus and Pinus plants were grown in three soils originating from alternate field sites. Fungal and bacterial community profiles in the root of each replicate were assessed through multiplex 454 amplicon sequencing of four loci (i.e., 16S, SSU, ITS, LSU rDNA). Soil origin had a larger effect on fungal community composition than did host species, but the opposite was true for bacterial communities. Populus hosted the highest diversity of rhizospheric fungi and bacteria. Root communities on Quercus and Pinus were more similar to each other than to Populus. Overall, fungal root symbionts appear to be more constrained by dispersal and biogeography than by host availability.","[Bonito, Gregory] Royal Bot Gardens, Melbourne, Vic 3141, Australia; [Bonito, Gregory; Reynolds, Hannah; Nelson, Jessica; Hodkinson, Brendan P.; Vilgalys, Rytas] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Robeson, Michael S.; Tuskan, Gerald; Schadt, Christopher W.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Bonito, G (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Melbourne, Vic 3141, Australia.",Gregory.Bonito@rbg.vic.gov.au,"Schadt, Christopher/M-8746-2019; Robeson, Michael Scott/J-5211-2019; Tuskan, Gerald/A-6225-2011; Schadt, Christopher W./B-7143-2008","Schadt, Christopher/0000-0001-8759-2448; Robeson, Michael Scott/0000-0001-7119-6301; Tuskan, Gerald/0000-0003-0106-1289; Schadt, Christopher W./0000-0001-8759-2448; Vilgalys, Rytas/0000-0001-8299-3605","Genomic Science Program, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science - Biological and Environmental Research as part of the Plant Microbe Interfaces Scientific Focus Area; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0832858, DEB-1011504, DEB-1145511]; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","This research was sponsored by the Genomic Science Program, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science - Biological and Environmental Research as part of the Plant Microbe Interfaces Scientific Focus Area (http://pmi.ornl.gov).

We aimed at linking the fungal community structure with soil enzymatic activities in the rhizospheres of several plants associating with mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular, ecto- and ericoid) and growing along a soil developmental gradient on the forefield of an alpine glacier. Fungal communities in roots and in rhizosphere soils were assessed using a site-tailored set of quantitative PCR assays with fluorescent hydrolysis probes. Enzymatic activities of mycorrhizal roots and rhizosphere soils were assessed using fluorogenic substrates. In this study we addressed: i) whether and how the structure of fungal communities and enzymatic activities in rhizosphere soils change along the soil developmental gradient, ii) whether the type of mycorrhiza shows a clear relationship to the pattern of enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere, and iii) how the structure of fungal communities and enzymatic activities in rhizosphere soils is related to plant species abundances along the soil chronosequence. The results suggest that plant identity affected the structure of both ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in rhizosphere soil and roots, whereas the community of non-mycorrhizal fungi was rather dictated by the soil developmental stage. Both plant identity and associated mycorrhizal fungi affected the enzymatic activity in the rhizosphere soil. Species-specific elevations of rhizosphere enzyme activities were detected for Salix helvetica (chitinase and alpha-glucosidase), Rhododendron ferrugineum (alpha-glucosidase and sulfatase), and Agrostis gigantea (phosphatase and xylosidase). These results indicate different functional roles played by different types of mycorrhizal symbiosis in a young alpine ecosystem. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We test the hypothesis that this intensification is driven by increasing photosynthate carbon allocation to mycorrhizal mycelial networks using (CO2)-C-14-tracer experiments with representative tree-fungus mycorrhizal partnerships. Trees were grown in either a simulated past CO2 atmosphere (1500 ppm)-under which EM fungi evolved-or near-current CO2 (450 ppm). We report a direct linkage between photosynthate-energy fluxes from trees to EM and AM mycorrhizal mycelium and rates of calcium silicate weathering. Calcium dissolution rates halved for both AM and EM trees as CO2 fell from 1500 to 450 ppm, but silicate weathering by AM trees at high CO2 approached rates for EM trees at near-current CO2. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the involvement of EM-associating forest trees in strengthening biological feedbacks on the geochemical carbon cycle that regulate atmospheric CO2 over millions of years.","[Quirk, Joe; Andrews, Megan Y.; Leake, Jonathan R.; Beerling, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Andrews, Megan Y.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Banwart, Steve A.] Univ Sheffield, Kroto Res Inst, Sheffield S3 7HQ, S Yorkshire, England","Quirk, J (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.quirk@sheffield.ac.uk,"Quirk, Joe/R-7942-2017; Beerling, David J/C-2840-2009; Banwart, Steven/B-3915-2016","Quirk, Joe/0000-0002-0625-8323; Beerling, David J/0000-0003-1869-4314; Banwart, Steven/0000-0001-7223-6678; Leake, Jonathan/0000-0001-8364-7616","NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E015190/1, NE/C521001/1]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [RPG-250]; ERC (CDREG) [322998]","We acknowledge NERC awards, NE/E015190/1 and NE/C521001/1; The Leverhulme Trust (RPG-250) and ERC (CDREG, 322998).",,19,20,21,1,53,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

So far most studies that have investigated horse chestnut trees have observed their above ground characteristics, whereas the roots structure and symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal arbuscular fungi have been poorly recognized. Therefore, our objective was to perform a detailed study of horse chestnut fine roots and the extent of their colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in urban and rural environments. In the urban area two different study sites were selected: one in the street and the second in city parks. Two rural sites comprised the roadside verges planted with horse chestnut trees in open countryside. The chemical composition of soils revealed significant differences between study sites. The biometric parameters of fine roots are only partly related to soil characteristics. The results revealed a lack of a clear negative effect of the urban environment on fine root parameters, which may suggest a high degree of plasticity in this species in response to heterogeneity of the soil. At all study sites the fine roots of horse chestnut were colonized by arbuscular fungi (AM) and fungal endophytes. Trees from all study sites revealed a similar range of AM colonization. Significant differences were found only between one rural and one urban park site. The results from urban and rural sites revealed horse chestnut as a tree species well adapted to both rural and urban conditions and presented well-established mycorrhizal symbiosis with arbuscular fungi.

Recent research has indicated that individual orchid plants may associate with several fungi concurrently, implying that to study mycorrhizal associations in orchids the fungal community should be assessed, rather than the presence of individual dominant fungal species or strains. High-throughput sequencing methods, such as 454 pyrosequencing, are increasingly used as the primary tool for such analyses. However, many studies combine universal primers from previous phylogenetic or ecological studies to generate amplicons suitable for 454 pyrosequencing without first critically evaluating their performance, potentially resulting in biased fungal community descriptions. Here, following in silico primer analysis we evaluated the performance of different combinations of existing PCR primers to characterize orchid mycorrhizal communities using 454 pyrosequencing by analysis of both an artificially assembled community of mycorrhizal fungi isolated from diverse orchid species and root samples from three different orchid species (Anacamptis morio, Ophrys tenthredinifera and Serapias lingua). Our results indicate that primer pairs ITS3/ITS4OF and ITS86F/ITS4, targeting the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region, outperformed other tested primer pairs in terms of number of reads, number of operational taxonomic units recovered from the artificial community and number of different orchid mycorrhizal associating families detected in the orchid samples. Additionally, we show the complementary specificity of both primer pairs, making them highly suitable for tandem use when studying the diversity of orchid mycorrhizal communities.","[Waud, Michael; Busschaert, Pieter; Ruyters, Stefan; Lievens, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Waud, Michael; Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, Div Plant Ecol & Systemat, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","Lievens, B (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, Campus Nayer, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium.",hans.jacquemyn@bio.kuleuven.be; bart.lievens@kuleuven.be,"Lievens, Bart/B-3339-2019; Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Ruyters, Stefan/G-2770-2011","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Ruyters, Stefan/0000-0002-2353-7615",European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [260601 - MYCASOR],"We would like to thank Rein Brys for assisting in the collection of orchid samples, Stefan Van Kerckhove for DNA extractions from both fungal isolates and orchid samples and the staff of Genomics Core, UZ Leuven for technical assistance during 454 pyrosequencing.

By investigating the xylem anatomy of branches and coarse roots, and measuring branch axial hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation in 4-year-old field-grown aspen plants of five demes (Populus tremula L. and Populus tremuloides Michx.) differing in growth rate, we tested the hypotheses that (i) demes differ in wood anatomical and hydraulic properties, (ii) hydraulic efficiency and safety are related to xylem anatomical traits, and (iii) aboveground productivity and hydraulic efficiency are negatively correlated to cavitation resistance. Significant deme differences existed in seven of the nine investigated branch-related anatomical and hydraulic traits but only in one of the four coarse-root-related anatomical traits; this likely is a consequence of high intra-plant variation in root morphology and the occurrence of a few 'high-conductivity roots'. Growth rate was positively related to branch hydraulic efficiency (xylem-specific conductivity) but not to cavitation resistance; this indicates that no marked trade-off exists between cavitation resistance and growth. Both branch hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency significantly depended on vessel size and were related to the genetic distance between the demes, while the xylem pressure causing 88% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P-88 value) was more closely related to hydraulic efficiency than the commonly used P-50 value. Deme-specific variation in the pit membrane structure may explain why vessel size was not directly linked to growth rate. We conclude that branch hydraulic efficiency is an important growth-influencing trait in aspen, while the assumed trade-off between productivity and hydraulic safety is weak.","[Hajek, Peter; Leuschner, Christoph; Hertel, Dietrich; Schuldt, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, F-33405 Talence, France","Hajek, P (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Grisebachstr 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",phajek@gwdg.de,"Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015; Delzon, Sylvain/R-9538-2018","Delzon, Sylvain/0000-0003-3442-1711",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; 'Niedersachsisches Vorab',The work has been financially supported by funding from the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony and the 'Niedersachsisches Vorab' within the framework of the 1b-Cluster of excellence 'Functional Biodiversity Research'.,,74,25,25,0,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,2014,34,7,,,,,744,756,,10.1093/treephys/tpu048,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,AQ7JV,WOS:000342991300007,25009155,,,,10/31/19J,"Christoffersen, BO; Restrepo-Coupe, N; Arain, MA; Baker, IT; Cestaro, BP; Ciais, P; Fisher, JB; Galbraith, D; Guan, XD; Gulden, L; van den Hurk, B; Ichii, K; Imbuzeiro, H; Jain, A; Levine, N; Miguez-Macho, G; Poulter, B; Roberti, DR; Sakaguchi, K; Sahoo, A; Schaefer, K; Shi, MJ; Verbeeck, H; Yang, ZL; Araujo, AC; Kruijt, B; Manzi, AO; da Rocha, HR; von Randow, C; Muza, MN; Borak, J; Costa, MH; de Goncalves, LGG; Zeng, XB; Saleska, SR",,,,"Christoffersen, Bradley O.; Restrepo-Coupe, Natalia; Arain, M.

We used a network of eddy covariance towers in Brazil coupled with ancillary measurements to address these questions With respect to the magnitude and seasonality of E, models have much improved in equatorial tropical forests by eliminating most dry season water limitation, diverge in performance in transitional forests where seasonal water deficits are greater, and mostly capture the observed seasonal depressions in E at Cerrado However, many models depended universally on either deep roots or groundwater to mitigate dry season water deficits, the relative importance of which we found does not vary as a simple function of climate or vegetation In addition, canopy stomatal conductance (g's) regulates dry season vegetation demand for water at all except the wettest sites even as the seasonal cycle of E follows that of net radiation In contrast, some models simulated no seasonality in gs, even while matching the observed seasonal cycle of E. We suggest that canopy dynamics mediated by leaf phenology may play a significant role in such seasonality, a process poorly represented in models Model bias in gs and E, in turn, was related to biases arising from the simulated light response (gross primary productivity, GPP) or the intringic water use efficiency of photosynthesis (iWUE). We identified deficiencies in models which would not otherwise be apparent based on a simple comparison of simulated and observed rates of E. While some deficiencies can be remedied by parameter tuning, in most models they highlight the need for continued process development of belowground hydrology and in particular, the biological processes of root dynamics and leaf phenology, which via their controls on E, mediate vegetation-climate feedbacks in the tropics.

Whereas in most basidiomycete fungi the number and kind of nuclei is strictly regulated to be two per cell, in Termitomyces mycelia the number of nuclei per cell is highly variable. We hypothesised that natural selection on these fungi not only occurs between mycelia, but also at the level of nuclei within the mycelium. We test this hypothesis using in vitro tests with five nuclear haplotypes of a Termitomyces species. Results: First, we studied the transition from a mixture of five homokaryons (mycelia with identical nuclei) each with a different nuclear haplotype to heterokaryons (mycelia with genetically different nuclei). In vitro cultivation of this mixture for multiple asexual transfers led to the formation of multiple heterokaryotic mycelia, and a reduction of mycelial diversity over time. All heterokaryotic mycelia contained exactly two types of nucleus. The success of a heterokaryon during in vitro cultivation was mainly determined by spore production and to a lesser extent by mycelial growth rate. Second, heterokaryons invariably produced more spores than homokaryons implying that homokaryons will be outcompeted. Third, no homokaryotic 'escapes' from a heterokaryon via the formation of homokaryotic spores were found, despite extensive spore genotyping. Fourth, in contrast to most studied basidiomycete fungi, in Termitomyces sp. no nuclear migration occurs during mating, limiting the scope for nuclear competition within the mycelium. Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrate that in this species of Termitomyces the scope for selection at the level of the nucleus within an established mycelium is limited. Although 'mate choice' of a particular nuclear haplotype is possible during mating, we infer that selection primarily occurs between mycelia with two types of nucleus (heterokaryons).","[Nobre, Tania; Koopmanschap, Bertha; Aanen, Duur K.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Genet Lab, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Baars, Johan J.

Although basidiomycetes clearly have a role in HS degradation, much less is known about the effect of HS on fungal traits. We studied the alteration of physiological, biochemical, and morphological characteristics of Trametes maxima in the presence of HS. Both complete medium and minimal (C-limited) medium mimicking natural environmental conditions were used. Adding HS led to increased biomass yield, but under C-limited conditions the effect was more apparent. This result indicated that HS were used as an additional substrate and agreed with data showing a greater penetration of tritium-labeled HS into the cell interior under C-limited conditions. Humic substances induced ultra-structural changes in fungal cells, especially under C limitation, including reducing the thicknesses of the hyphal sheath and cell wall. In the minimal medium, cellular respiration increased nearly three-fold under HS application, while the corresponding effect in complete medium was lower. In addition, in the presence of inhibitors, HS stimulated either the cytochrome or the alternative pathway of respiration, depending on presence or absence of glucose in the medium. Our results suggest that, under conditions mimicking the natural environment, HS may play three major roles: as a surplus substrate for fungal growth, as a factor positively affecting cell morphology, and as an activator of physiological respiration.","[Klein, Olga I.; Isakova, Elena P.; Deryabina, Yulia I.; Kulikova, Natalia A.; Stepanova, Elena V.; Koroleva, Olga V.] Russian Acad Sci, AN Bach Inst Biochem, Moscow 119602, Russia; [Kulikova, Natalia A.; Badun, Gennadii A.; Chernysheva, Maria G.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia","Kulikova, NA (reprint author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia.",knat@darvodgeo.ru,"Kulikova, Natalia A./P-3783-2014; Klein, Olga/N-3592-2016; Badun, Gennadii/D-3492-2015; Chernysheva, Maria/M-3831-2019; Chernysheva, Maria G/J-2945-2013; Chernysheva, Maria/L-5404-2018","Kulikova, Natalia A./0000-0003-0143-2908; Badun, Gennadii/0000-0002-9792-8432; Chernysheva, Maria/0000-0001-5040-9937; Chernysheva, Maria G/0000-0001-5040-9937; Chernysheva, Maria/0000-0001-5040-9937","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian FederationMinistry of Education and Science, Russian Federation [8111]","The study was supported by The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, project 8111.",,58,6,7,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

In recent years, plant-soil feedback that can, for example, be caused by below-ground microorganisms has been suggested to play a role in maintaining plant coexistence and to be a potential driver of the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Most of the studies addressing these topics have focused on the species level. However, in addition to interspecific interactions, intraspecific interactions might be important for the structure of natural communities. Here, we examine intraspecific coexistence and intraspecific diversity effects using 10 natural accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We assessed morphological intraspecific diversity by measuring several above-and below-ground traits. We performed a plant-soil feedback experiment that was based on these trait differences between the accessions in order to determine whether A. thaliana experiences feedback at intraspecific level as a result of trait differences. We also experimentally tested the diversity-productivity relationship at intraspecific level. We found strong differences in above-and below-ground traits between the A. thaliana accessions. Overall, plant-soil feedback occurred at intraspecific level. However, accessions differed in the direction and strength of this feedback: Some accessions grew better on their own soils, some on soils from other accessions. Furthermore, we found positive diversity effects within A. thaliana: Accession mixtures produced a higher total above-ground biomass than accession monocultures. Differences between accessions in their feedback response could not be explained by morphological traits. Therefore, we suggest that they might have been caused by accession-specific accumulated soil communities, by root exudates, or by accession-specific resource use based on genetic differences that are not expressed in morphological traits. Synthesis. Our results provide some of the first evidence for intraspecific plant-soil feedback and intraspecific overyielding. These findings may have wider implications for the maintenance of variation within species and the importance of this variation for ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the need for an increased focus on intraspecific processes in plant diversity research to fully understand the mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem functioning.","[Bukowski, Alexandra R.; Petermann, Jana S.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Petermann, Jana S.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Bukowski, AR (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",alexandra.bukowski2@gmail.com,"Petermann, Jana/E-2130-2013","Petermann, Jana/0000-0002-3898-5656",,,,71,17,17,0,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Concerning these issues, much progress has been made during the past few years, but this information has not found its way into the forest and soil models. In this paper, state-of-the-art insight into ectomycorrhizal functioning and basic values are described in a manner transparent to nonspecialists and modelers, together with the existing models and model strategies.

Yet, geographically extensive forest inventories have been under-exploited in previous model data fusion efforts. Inventory observations of forest growth, mortality, and biomass integrate processes across a range of timescales, including slow timescale processes such as species turnover, that are likely to have important effects on ecosystem responses to environmental variation. However, the large number (thousands) of inventory plots precludes detailed measurements at each location, so that uncertainty in climate, soil properties, and other environmental drivers may be large. Errors in driver variables, if ignored, introduce bias into model-data fusion. We estimated errors in climate and soil drivers at U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots, and we explored the effects of these errors on model data fusion with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory LM3V dynamic global vegetation model. When driver errors were ignored or assumed small at FIA plots, responses of biomass production in LM3V to precipitation and soil available water capacity appeared steeper than the corresponding responses estimated from FIA data. These differences became nonsignificant if driver errors at FIA plots were assumed to be large. Ignoring driver errors when optimizing LM3V parameter values yielded estimates for fine-root allocation that were larger than biometric estimates, which is consistent with the expected direction of bias. To explore whether complications posed by driver errors could be circumvented by relying on intensive study sites where driver errors are small, we performed a power analysis. To accurately quantify the response of biomass production to spatial variation in mean annual precipitation within the eastern United States would require at least 40 intensive study sites, which is larger than the number of sites typically available for individual biomes in existing plot networks. Driver errors may be accommodated by several existing model data fusion approaches, including hierarchical Bayesian methods and ensemble filtering methods; however, these methods are computationally expensive. We propose a new approach, in which the TBM functional response is fit directly to the driver-error-corrected functional response estimated from data, rather than to the raw observations.","[Lichstein, Jeremy W.; Zhang, Tao] Univ Florida, Dept Bot, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Golaz, Ni-Zhang; Sarmiento, Jorge L.] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Malyshev, Sergey; Shevliakova, Elena; Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sheffield, Justin] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Birdsey, Richard A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Newtown Sq, PA 19073 USA","Lichstein, JW (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Bot, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jlichstein@ufl.edu,"Zhang, Nina/F-3609-2014; Shevliakova, Elena/J-5770-2014; Malyshev, Sergey/N-6422-2019","Malyshev, Sergey/0000-0001-6259-1043; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630","USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [09-JV-11242306-051, 11-JV-11242306-059]; U.S. DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64157]; Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative; BP; Ford; NOAA GFDLNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","We thank the USDA Forest Service (09-JV-11242306-051 and 11-JV-11242306-059), the U.S. DOE (DE-FC02-06ER64157), the Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative (sponsored by BP and Ford), and the NOAA GFDL for funding.

Previous work has demonstrated reduced N2O emissions in regenerating secondary stands compared to mature forests, yet the importance of species composition in regulating N2O production in young forests remains unclear. We measured N2O fluxes beneath four native tree species planted in replicated, 21-yr-old monodominant stands in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica in comparison with nearby mature forest and abandoned pasture sites at two time points (wetter and drier seasons). We found that species differed eight-fold in their production of N2O, with slower growing, late-successional species (including one legume) promoting high N2O fluxes similar to mature forest, and faster growing, early successional species maintaining low N2O fluxes similar to abandoned pasture. Across all species, N2O flux was positively correlated with soil nitrate concentration in the wetter season and with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) in the drier season. However, the strongest predictor of N2O fluxes was fine-root growth rate, which was negatively correlated with N2O emissions at both time points. We suggest that tree-specific variation in growth habits creates differences in both N demand and soil water conditions that may exert significant control on N2O fluxes from tropical forests. With the advent of REDD+ and related strategies for fostering climate mitigation. via tropical forest regrowth and plantations, we note that species-specific traits as they relate to N2O fluxes may be an important consideration in estimating overall climate benefits.","[Weintraub, Samantha R.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Weintraub, Samantha R.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, INSTAAR, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Russell, Ann E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Weintraub, SR (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",weintrsr@colorado.edu,"Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361; Weintraub, Samantha/0000-0003-4789-5086","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0703561, 1119223]; Organization for Tropical Studies; Rowe Fund [443, 1258]","We thank Ricardo Bedoya, Marlon Hernandez, Flor Cascante, and Eduardo Paniagua for their assistance with field and laboratory analyses, Philip Dixon for advice on statistical analyses, and Jim Raich for sharing data on fine-root growth.

We used a multi-faceted approach to explore single and combined impacts of elevated CO2 and warming on root carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in a temperate, semiarid, native grassland at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment experiment. To investigate the indirect, moisture mediated effects of elevated CO2, we included an irrigation treatment. We assessed root standing mass, morphology, residence time and seasonal appearance/disappearance of community-aggregated roots, as well as mass and N losses during decomposition of two dominant grass species (a C-3 and a C-4). In contrast to what is common in mesic grasslands, greater root standing mass under elevated CO2 resulted from increased production, unmatched by disappearance. Elevated CO2 plus warming produced roots that were longer, thinner and had greater surface area, which, together with greater standing biomass, could potentially alter root function and dynamics. Decomposition increased under environmental conditions generated by elevated CO2, but not those generated by warming, likely due to soil desiccation with warming. Elevated CO2, particularly under warming, slowed N release from C-4-but not C-3-roots, and consequently could indirectly affect N availability through treatment effects on species composition. Elevated CO2 and warming effects on root morphology and decomposition could offset increased C inputs from greater root biomass, thereby limiting future net C accrual in this semiarid grassland.","[Carrillo, Yolima; Pendall, Elise] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Carrillo, Yolima; Pendall, Elise] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Carrillo, Yolima; Dijkstra, Feike A.] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Dept Environm Sci, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia; [Carrillo, Yolima; Pendall, Elise] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [LeCain, Dan; Morgan, Jack A.; Blumenthal, Dana] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Crops Res Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Waldron, Sarah] USDA ARS, No Great Plains Res Lab, Mandan, ND 58554 USA","Carrillo, Y (reprint author), Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, UWS Hawkesbury Campus,Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",y.carrillo@uws.edu.au,"Dijkstra, Feike A/H-2182-2012","Dijkstra, Feike A/0000-0002-6191-6018; Pendall, Elise/0000-0002-1651-8969",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1021559 DEB]; USDA-CSRES Soil Processes Program [2008-35107-18655]; US Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) through the Terrestrial Ecosystem Science program; Western Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Northern Arizona University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT100100779],"We thank David Smith, Erik Hardy and Matthew Parsons for their technical assistance and Joanne Newcomb, Jennifer Bell, Hannah Munn, Courtney Ellis, Christine Rumsey, Jana Heisler-White, Sun Wei, Lyndsy Soltau, Lindsay Ross, Lana MacDonald, Janet Chen for assistance in the field and in the laboratory.

Consistent with theory, both cheating and discrimination against cheaters are ubiquitous features of mutualisms. Several recent studies have confirmed that host species differ in the extent that they are able to discriminate against cheaters, suggesting that cheating may be stabilized by the existence of susceptible hosts (dubbed ""givers""). We use an evolutionary game-theoretical approach to demonstrate how discriminating and giver hosts associating with mutualist and cheater partners can coexist. Discriminators drive the proportion of cheaters below a critical threshold, at which point there is no benefit to investing resources into discrimination. This promotes givers, who benefit from mutualists but allow cheater populations to rebound. We then apply this model to the plant-mycorrhizal mutualism and demonstrate it is one mechanism for generating host-specific responses to mycorrhizal fungal species necessary to generate negative plant-soil feedbacks. Our model makes several falsifiable, qualitative predictions for plant-mycorrhizal population dynamics across gradients of soil phosphorus availability and interhost differences in ability to discriminate. Finally, we suggest applications and limitations of the model with regard to coexistence in specific biological systems.","[Steidinger, Brian S.; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Steidinger, BS (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bsteidin@indiana.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919434, DEB-1050237, ROI-GM092660]","We would like to acknowledge the helpful advice of M.

The objective of this paper was to determine whether these observed reductions in standing root length were due to reduced root production rates or due to enhanced root mortality rates in response to the presence of either pavement. We measured both fine root production and root death over a 15-month period using biweekly nondestructive observations of the root zones at four depths. In addition, we used proportional hazards analysis to determine how the presence of pavement affected chances of root mortality. We found that new root production was more negatively affected by the presence of either pavement than root mortality while chances of root mortality were increased by the presence of pavement, leading to much reduced standing net root length in paved plots at any given time. Surprisingly, even though root production and mortality were strongly altered by pavement, there was no significant effect on tree diameter growth. These results suggest that while Sweetgum root dynamics are negatively affected by pavement, there is enough plasticity within this species to adapt to altered root zone dynamics without affecting aboveground growth.","[Volder, Astrid; Viswanathan, Bhavana] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hort Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Watson, W.

The carbon balance module simulated changes in the carbon storage in living biomass, dead organic matter and products. Carbon releases from timber harvesting, transporting and manufacturing were included in the carbon balance, as well as the substitution, recycling and reuse effects of different types of wood products (avoided releases from fossil fuels due to the use of wood). Prediction models were developed for the initial pools of wood products and dead organic matter. The results show that collecting branches, stumps and coarse roots for bioenergy improves the carbon balance very little during the first 30 years of biofuel harvesting. This is because decreased carbon balance of forest soil partially cancels the positive substitution effects of fuel feedstock harvesting. Using high thinnings and continuous cover management instead of low thinnings, clear felling and artificial regeneration have an immediate positive effect on the carbon balance. This is because the sizes of the wood product and living biomass pools increase, and manufacturing releases decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated species composition and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and white oak (Quercus fabri) growing in Xiangtan manganese mining area in China. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that soil Mn, Cu, Cd and several other soil cofactors related to manganese mining activities simultaneously structured the ectomycorrhizal community; in addition, a strong host effect was observed. The pine ectomycorrhizal community was dominated by four taxa (Atheliaceae, Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, and Cenococcum), while the oak community was dominated by Thelephoraceae and Cenococcum. The relative abundance of Atheliaceae was positively correlated with soil manganese concentrations while that of Russulaceae decreased with increasing soil manganese.

The specific effects by priming of SOC depend on the amount and frequency of C inputs. Most previous priming studies have investigated single C additions, but they are not very representative for litterfall and root exudation in many terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated effects of C-13-labeled glucose added to soil in three temporal patterns: single, repeated, and continuous on dynamics of CO2 and priming of SOC decomposition over 6 months. Total and C-13 labeled CO2 were monitored to analyze priming dynamics and net C balance between SOC loss caused by priming and the retention of added glucose-C. Cumulative priming ranged from 1.3 to 5.5mgCg(-1) SOC in the subtropical, and from -0.6 to 5.5mgCg(-1) SOC in the tropical soils. Single addition induced more priming than repeated and continuous inputs. Therefore, single additions of high substrate amounts may overestimate priming effects over the short term. The amount of added glucose C remaining in soil after 6months (subtropical: 8.1-11.2mgCg(-1) SOC or 41-56% of added glucose; tropical: 8.7-15.0mgCg(-1) SOC or 43-75% of glucose) was substantially higher than the net C loss due to SOC decomposition including priming effect. This overcompensation of C losses was highest with continuous inputs and lowest with single inputs. Therefore, raised labile organic C input to soils by higher plant productivity will increase SOC content even though priming accelerates decomposition of native SOC. Consequently, higher continuous input of C belowground by plants under warming or elevated CO2 can increase C stocks in soil despite accelerated C cycling by priming in soils.","[Qiao, Na; Schaefer, Douglas; Zou, Xiaoming; Xu, Xingliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Na] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Blagodatskaya, Evgenia; Xu, Xingliang; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Blagodatskaya, Evgenia; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Zou, Xiaoming] Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Trop Ecosyst Studies, San Juan, PR 00931 USA; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Soil Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Xu, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",xuxingl@hotmail.com,"Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/L-7177-2017","Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/0000-0002-8284-4017; Zou, Xiaoming/0000-0001-9023-3067","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41071209, 30970535]; Knowledge Innovation Foundation Program for Outstanding Young Scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-QN302]; Strategic Pilot Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050203-02]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship","We thank Dr. Lu Qiao for her help in the field.

In this study, we compare the effect of living and dead Lupinus polyphyllus L. roots on the small-scale distribution of cellulase, chitinase and phosphatase activity in soil. Soil zymography, a novel in situ method, was used to analyze extracellular cellulase, chitinase and phosphatase activity in the presence of i. living L. polyphyllus roots prior to shoot cutting and ii. dead/dying roots 10, 20 and 30 days after shoot cutting. After shoot cutting, cellulase and chitinase activities increased and were highest at the root tips. The areas of high cellulase and phosphatase activity extend up to 55 mm away from the root. Moreover, we observed microhotspots of cellulose, chitinase, and phosphatase activity up to 60 mm away from the next living root. The number and activity of microhotspots of chitinase activity was maximal 10 days after shoot cutting. The study showed that young root detritus stimulates enzyme activities stronger than living roots. Soil zymography allowed identification of microhotspots of enzyme activity up to several cm away from living and dying roots, which most likely were caused by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","[Spohn, Marie] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Soil Ecol, D-95448 Gottingen, Germany; [Spohn, Marie; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temp Ecosyst, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Spohn, M (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Soil Ecol, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Gottingen, Germany.",marie.spohn@uni-bayreuth.de; kuzyakov@gwdg.de,"Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Spohn, Marie/R-3048-2016","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Spohn, Marie/0000-0002-1010-7317",,,,35,43,46,7,125,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2014,379,2-Jan,,,,,67,77,,10.1007/s11104-014-2041-9,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,AG1HQ,WOS:000335166300005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Selami, N; Auriac, MC; Catrice, O; Capela, D; Kaid-Harche, M; Timmers, T",,,,"Selami, Nawel; Auriac, Marie-Christine; Catrice, Olivier; Capela, Delphine; Kaid-Harche, Meriem; Timmers, Ton",,,Morphology and anatomy of root nodules of Retama monosperma (L.)Boiss.,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bradyrhizobium; Microscopy; Nitrogen fixation; Nodule structure; Retama monosperma,SPHAEROCARPA; INFECTION; PERFORMANCE; NODULATION; TRANSPORT; SYMBIOSIS; RHIZOBIA; GENES; L.,"In spite of the importance of Retama species for dune stabilization and re-vegetation and the contribution to the bio-fertilization of semi-arid and arid ecosystems, the symbiotic interaction of Retama species with rhizobia remains largely unstudied.

We collected nodules from coastal areas nearby Oran (Algeria) and studied in detail their anatomy and ultrastructure by light and electron microscopy. First, we confirmed the likely identity of the microsymbiont as B. retamae and found that nodules of R. monosperma belong to the genistoid type of indeterminate nodules. Infection threads, typical for most nodules of legumes, are absent in nodules of R. monosperma and bacterial spread is associated with plant cell division. The nitrogen fixation zone is homogenous with only invaded cells and a network of non-invaded cells found in many nodules, is absent. Moreover, endoreduplication does not take place in bacteroids in nodules of R. monosperma. The features observed in this study are compared to the morphology and anatomy of nodules of other legumes and the possible consequences for nodule functioning and the mode of infection during the establishment of the interaction are discussed.","[Selami, Nawel; Kaid-Harche, Meriem] Univ Sci & Technol Oran Mohamed Boudiaf, Dept Biotechnol Vegetales, Lab Prod Valorisat Vegetales & Microbienne LP2VM, El Mnaour 31000, Oran, Algeria; [Auriac, Marie-Christine; Catrice, Olivier; Capela, Delphine; Timmers, Ton] INRA, LIPM, UMR441, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Auriac, Marie-Christine; Catrice, Olivier; Capela, Delphine; Timmers, Ton] CNRS, LIPM, UMR2594, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Timmers, T (reprint author), INRA, LIPM, UMR441, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",Ton.Timmers@toulouse.inra.fr,,,"French Laboratory of Excellence project ""TULIP"" [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02]","We thank Frederic Debelle for critically reading the manuscript.

This study's aims were to quantify and gain insights into the ways in which roots respond to changes in solution Ca. Root elongation rate (RER) of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) seedlings was determined at 0.05 to 15 mM Ca for up to 24 h both without and with added K, Mg, or Na. Root tip concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, and Na were determined and binding of cations by root tips estimated by subsequent Cu sorption. Transfer from higher to lower Ca solutions (and with added K at high Ca) resulted in RER a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 2 mm h(-1) within minutes. This was attributed to greater cell wall relaxation through lower Ca binding aided by a decrease to pH a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 5.1 in solution. Transfer to higher Ca solutions, which remained at similar to pH 5.6, led to an equally rapid decrease in RER to similar to 0.5 mm h(-1), an effect ascribed to greater cell wall binding of Ca. Thereafter, a gradual increase in RER to similar to 1.8 mm h(-1) occurred over 24 h, an effect likely due to reduced cell wall Ca binding as shown by decreasing Cu sorption at a rate of 0.027 mmol Cu kg(-1) FM h(-1) over 24 h. The kinetics of changes in RER and cations in root tips suggest that roots respond to changes in solution Ca through effects on cell wall relaxation of the rhizodermis and outer cortex in the elongation zone.","[Blamey, F.

The genetics and phylogeny of this group of fungi have long been debated. Nuclear markers are the main tools used for phylogenetic analyses, but they have sometimes proved difficult to use because of their extreme variability. Therefore, the attention of researchers has been moving towards other genomic markers, in particular those from the mitochondrial DNA. In this study, 46 sequences of different AMF isolates belonging to two main clades Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae have been obtained from the mitochondrial gene coding for the Cytochrome c Oxidase I (COI), representing the largest dataset to date of AMF COI sequences. A very low level of divergence was recorded in the COI sequences from the Gigasporaceae, which could reflect either a slow rate of evolution or a more recent evolutionary divergence of this group. On the other hand, the COI sequence divergence between Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae was high, with synonymous divergence reaching saturated levels. This work also showed the difficulty in developing valuable mitochondrial markers able to effectively distinguish all Glomeromycota species, especially those belonging to Gigasporaceae, yet it represents a first step towards the development of a full mtDNA-based dataset which can be used for further phylogenetic investigations of this fungal phylum.

The aim was to assess whether life-history strategies influence AMF successional dynamics and assemblages. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) seedlings, grown in a mesocosm system, were colonized by either the AMF hyphae coming from a living rosemary plant, or from spores germinating in soil. The AMF community established in the plantlets was monitored every 3 months during 2 years, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of genes coding for rDNA. The two different sources of AMF propagules resulted in a different initial community colonizing rosemary roots. AMF propagating from hyphae attached to living mycorrhizal-roots seemed to colonize faster and were season-dependent. AMF taxa originating from soil-borne propagules were most frequent over time and exhibit the dominant colonization strategy in this system. The evolution of the AMF community also revealed different strategies in succession. AMF associated with rosemary evidenced contrasting life-history strategies in terms of source of inoculum for new colonization and hence survival. The observed successional dynamics of AMF have implications for understanding the ecological processes in Mediterranean environments and seasonality of colonization processes.","[Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro; Palenzuela, Javier; Miguel Barea, Jose; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst Dept, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Lopez-Garcia, A (reprint author), CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst Dept, C Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",lopez.garcia.alvaro@gmail.com,"Azcon, Concepcion/H-5873-2015; Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/J-9190-2014; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015","Azcon, Concepcion/0000-0003-3041-8566; Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/0000-0001-8267-3572; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718","Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Spanish Government under the Plan Nacional de I+D+I [CGL-2009-08825]","A.

The contribution of VOCs to plant development and immunity was assessed by comparing the effectiveness of WT and Delta ppt1 mutant strains of T. virens in the formation of lateral roots and protection conferred against Botrytis cinerea. VOCs released by T. virens and Delta ppt1 mutant were compared by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plants exposed to volatiles from WT T. virens showed 2-fold increase in fresh weight when compared to axenically-grown seedlings, which correlated with increased root branching and enhanced expression of the jasmonic acid-responsive marker pLox2:uidA as well as accumulation of jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide. T. virens produced a series of hydrocarbon terpenes, including the sesquiterpenes beta-caryophyllene, (-)-beta-elemene, germacrene D, tau-cadinene, delta-cadinene, alpha-amorphene, and tau-selinene and the monoterpenes beta-myrcene, trans-beta-ocimene, and cis-beta-ocimene that were absent in TvPPT1 mutant.

We conducted an 8-year field experiment examining the effect of experimental N deposition on plant growth, soil carbon dioxide efflux, and net ecosystem production (NEP) in a subtropical Chinese fir forest. The quantities of N added were 0 (control), 60, 120, and 240 kg ha(-1) year(-1). NEP was lowest under ambient conditions and highest with 240 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1) treatment. The net increase in ecosystem carbon (C) storage ranged from 9.2 to 16.4 kg C per kg N added in comparison with control. In addition, N deposition treatments significantly decreased heterotrophic respiration (by 0.69-1.85 t C ha(-1) year(-1)) and did not affect plant biomass. The nitrogen concentrations were higher in needles than that in fine roots. Our findings suggest that the young Chinese fir forest is carbon source and N deposition would sequester additional atmospheric CO2 at high levels N input, mainly due to reduced soil CO2 emission rather than increased plant growth, and the amount of sequestered C depended on the rate of N deposition.","[Fan, Houbao; Wu, Jianping; Liu, Wenfei; Yuan, Yinghong; Huang, Rongzhen; Liao, Yingchun; Li, Yanyan] Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China","Wu, JP (reprint author), Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, 289 Tianxiang Rd, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China.",hbfan@nit.edu.cn; jpwu@nit.edu.cn; liuwf729@126.com; yhyuan@nit.edu.cn; huangrz@nit.edu.cn; liaoyingc@163.com; liyanyan@nit.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200406, 31060109, 30771714, 31360175]; Jiangxi Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20122BAB204021]; Education department of Jiangxi Province [KJLD12097]","We are grateful to Prof. Bruce Jaffee and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

However, an increased effort is needed to understand their role and behavior in abandoned burned areas. We investigated tree performance of pre-inoculated Quercus rubra seedlings on a site with fire history and monitored fungal persistence and succession dynamics of the ectomycorrhizal community established. Nursery grown Q. rubra seedlings inoculated with a mixture of 6 ECM fungi (Cenococcum geophilum, Hebeloma crustuliniforme, H. mesophaeum, H. velutipes, Paxillus involutus and Scleroderma citrinum) were transplanted to Serra da Cabreira, Northern Portugal. Non-inoculated control oak seedlings were also transplanted. Two years after planting, biometric and mycorrhizal parameters were determined. The presence of the inoculated ECM fungi and the dominant ECM fungal community established was assessed by DGGE-cloning. Results showed that the bioinoculants improved the growth performance of outplanted oak seedlings, promoting a c.a. 1.6-fold increase in height and a 2.9-fold increase in the number of ECM root tips. After two years, H. mesophaeum, H. velutipes, P. involutus and S. citrinum persisted in the root system of inoculated plants. Ordination analysis demonstrated that ECM fungal communities of inoculated and non-inoculated samples were significantly different. The present work reinforces the benefits of using nursery inoculated plants in forest reclamation processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show from both foliage and soil N-15 natural abundance values and from a 12-year in situ N-15 addition experiment, that black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), two widespread species of the Canadian boreal forest, take up N at different depths. While black spruce takes up N from the organic soil, jack pine acquires it deeper within the highly N-depleted mineral soil. Systematic difference in foliar N-15 natural abundance between the two species across seven sites distributed throughout the eastern Canadian boreal forest shows that N spatial partitioning is a widespread phenomenon. Distinct relationships between N-15 and N concentration in leaves of both species further emphasize their difference in N acquisition strategies. This result suggests that such complementary mechanisms of N acquisition could facilitate tree species coexistence in such N-depleted habitats and could contribute to the positive biodiversity-productivity relationship recently revealed for the eastern Canadian boreal forest, where jack pine is present. It also has implications for forest management and provides new insights to interpret boreal forest regeneration following natural or anthropogenic perturbations.","[Houle, D.; Moore, J. -D.; Ouimet, R.] Minist Ressources Nat, Direct Rech Forestiere, Quebec City, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada; [Houle, D.] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Montreal, PQ H2Y 2E7, Canada; [Marty, C.] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Fac Sci, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B8, Canada","Houle, D (reprint author), Minist Ressources Nat, Direct Rech Forestiere, 2700 Rue Einstein, Quebec City, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada.",Daniel.Houle@mrn.gouv.qc.ca,,,,,,42,16,16,7,66,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2014,95,5,,,,,1127,1133,,10.1890/14-0191.1,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AI3DU,WOS:000336740500002,25000744,,,,10/31/19J,"McLauchlan, KK; Craine, JM; Nippert, JB; Ocheltree, TW",,,,"McLauchlan, Kendra K.; Craine, Joseph M.; Nippert, Jesse B.; Ocheltree, Troy W.",,,Lack of eutrophication in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem over 27 years,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,eutrophication; grassland; Konza Prairie; nitrogen deposition; precipitation; tallgrass prairie,FOLIAR NITROGEN ISOTOPES; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; N AVAILABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; DEPOSITION,"Many North American grasslands are receiving atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition at rates above what are considered critical eutrophication thresholds. Yet, potential changes in grassland function due to anthropogenic N deposition are poorly resolved, especially considering that other dynamic factors such as land use and precipitation can also affect N availability. To better understand whether elevated N deposition has altered ecosystem structure or function in North American grasslands, we analyzed a 27-year record of ecophysiological, community, and ecosystem metrics for an annually burned Kansas tallgrass prairie. Over this time, despite increasing rates of N deposition that are within the range of critical loads for grasslands, there was no evidence of eutrophication. Plant N concentrations did not increase, soil moisture did not decline, forb diversity did not decline, and the relative abundance of dominant grasses did not shift toward more eutrophic species. Neither aboveground primary productivity nor N availability to plants increased. The fates of deposited N in grasslands are still uncertain, and could include management losses through burning and grazing. However, evidence from this grassland indicates that eutrophication of North American grassland ecosystems is not an inevitable consequence of current levels of N deposition.","[McLauchlan, Kendra K.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Craine, Joseph M.; Nippert, Jesse B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Ocheltree, Troy W.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","McLauchlan, KK (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",mclauch@ksu.edu,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244; Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X; McLauchlan, Kendra/0000-0002-6612-1097",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0823341],"We thank the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Program for collecting, archiving, and sharing data and samples.

In our previous study, nitrobenzene showed genotoxic effect on soybean and tobacco plants at concentrations in the culture medium higher than 10 mg/L. The genotoxicity of nitrobenzene has been hypothesized to be multifactorial and reflective of the generation of free radicals; however, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the induction of genotoxicity and the production of free radicals in young seedlings of V. faba exposed to nitrobenzene, nitrobenzene + Vitamin C, and the controls (distilled water or Vitamin C). Micronucleus and chromosome aberration assays performed on root and leaf tissue of V. faba seedlings exposed to nitrobenzene (25 mg/L) demonstrated genotoxic effects which were partly reduced by Vitamin C at 25 mg/L. Increases in lipid peroxidase, O2aEuro cent-, H2O2, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were also observed in these tissues along with an attenuation of their induction by Vitamin C. Concomitant occurrence of genotoxicity and the generation of free radicals that are attenuated in the presence of Vitamin C, a scavenger of cellular free radicals, indicate that reactive oxygen species may contributes to genotoxicity of nitrobenzene in V. faba. These results are valuable for further understanding the genotoxicity mechanism of nitrobenzene.","[Guo, Donglin; Ma, Jun; Su, Wenyue; Xie, Baoming; Guo, Changhong] Harbin Normal Univ, Key Lab Mol & Cytogenet, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Harbin 150025, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Guo, CH (reprint author), Harbin Normal Univ, Key Lab Mol & Cytogenet, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Harbin 150025, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",kaku_2008@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province [C201004]; National Major Project for Cultivation of Transgenic Crops [2011ZX08004-002]; Aid Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Heilongjiang Province [2010TD10]; Harbin Normal University [KJTD2011-2]; Scientific Research of Heilongjiang Provincial Education Department [12521143]","We thank Dr Colleen MacMillan for her invaluable assistance in reviewing the manuscript.

Spatial variation also affects comparisons among ecosystems, as when quantifying effects of disturbances on ecosystem carbon dynamics. However, spatial variability of soil CO2 efflux is still unknown and difficult to predict. We quantified the effects of silvicultural practices (prescribed fire and harvesting) on spatial variability of soil CO2 efflux in a mixed conifer forest from the central Sierra Nevada in California, USA. Soil CO2 efflux was measured using a portable chamber system, on 20-29 locations in four treatment sites: an untreated control, a prescribed fire site (burned in 2002 and 2009) and two clear cut sites harvested in 2010. In one of the harvested sites the soils were mechanically ripped to reduce soil compaction, a common practice done on industrial timber forest lands in the Sierra Nevada. Results showed that disturbance increased spatial variability of soil CO2 efflux. Coefficient of variability increased from an annual average of 32% at the control site to 37% at the burned site, and 49-51% at the harvested sites (without and with soil ripping, respectively), mirroring post-disturbance increases in spatial variability of soil temperature and soil water content. Because of the post-harvest increase in spatial variability, the ability to detect differences became lower, and the number of samples needed to obtain a value representative of the full population mean (within a 10% range) increased by 100%, from 60 to 120 samples. To reduce uncertainty in our soil CO2 efflux treatment estimates, more than 10-15 randomly selected locations per study site were necessary. Spatial variability of soil CO2 efflux at our sites was not affected by distance between measurement locations, was correlated to fine root and litter biomass at the control site, negatively correlated to soil bulk density at the fire site, and un-correlated to soil temperature and water content at all sites. The increase of spatial variability in soil CO2 efflux after disturbance and the requirement for a sufficient number of measurement locations should be considered when quantifying carbon dynamics of disturbed ecosystems, or assessing effects of different forest management practices.

This remains one of the largest gaps in knowledge of terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, we synthesize data on gross and net primary production and their components, and soil respiration and its components, from a global forest database, to determine mechanisms governing belowground carbon allocation and their relationship with soil respiration partitioning and soil respiration responses to climatic factors across global forest ecosystems. Our results revealed that there are three independent mechanisms controlling belowground carbon allocation and which influence soil respiration and its partitioning: an allometric constraint; a fine-root production vs. root respiration trade-off; and an above- vs. belowground trade-off in plant carbon. Global patterns in soil respiration and its partitioning are constrained primarily by the allometric allocation, which explains some of the previously ambiguous results reported in the literature. Responses of soil respiration and its components to mean annual temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen deposition can be mediated by changes in belowground carbon allocation. Soil respiration responds to mean annual temperature overwhelmingly through an increasing belowground carbon input as a result of extending total day length of growing season, but not by temperature-driven acceleration of soil carbon decomposition, which argues against the possibility of a strong positive feedback between global warming and soil carbon loss. Different nitrogen loads can trigger distinct belowground carbon allocation mechanisms, which are responsible for different responses of soil respiration to nitrogen addition that have been observed. These results provide new insights into belowground carbon allocation, partitioning of soil respiration, and its responses to climate in forest ecosystems and are, therefore, valuable for terrestrial carbon simulations and projections.","[Chen, Guangshui; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guangshui; Robinson, David] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland","Chen, GS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",gschen@fjnu.edu.cn,"Robinson, David/C-2112-2009; Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013","Robinson, David/0000-0003-3504-5981; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31130013, 30972347]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT0960]; Science Foundation of the Fujian Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2010J06009]","We thank all site investigators, their funding agencies, the various regional flux networks (Afriflux, AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, CarboAfrica, CarboEurope-IP, ChinaFlux, Fluxnet-Canada, KoFlux, LBA, NECC, OzFlux, TCOS-Siberia, USCCC), and the Fluxnet project, whose support is essential for obtaining the measurements without which the type of integrated analyses conducted in this study would not be possible.

Conventional wisdom has it that the ephemeral layer primarily depends on early spring snowmelt water for germination and development. However, this hypothesis has never been subjected to rigorous testing. Location Southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert, a cold desert and a natural habitat of ephemeral plants (the inter-sand dune lowland), in the far northwest of China and around the geographical centre of the Eurasian continent. Methods At the end of the snow cover season between 2009 and 2011, four different snow treatments (0, 50, 100 and 200% snow cover, with 100% representing the natural amount of snow) were applied, using five replicates. Seedling establishment, species diversity and plant growth, population, cover and productivity were monitored throughout or sampled at the end of the growing season. Results The ephemeral plant germination and seedling density were significantly influenced by changes in snow cover. Germination, density of mature ephemeral plants and plant coverage rose as snow cover depth increased. However, the height, rooting depth, numbers of lateral roots and above-ground biomass of individual plants decreased as snow cover increased, and plant size was negatively correlated with plant density. At the ephemeral layer level, above-ground biomass showed no significant variation between snow treatments. There was also no significant difference in species richness among the snow treatments. Conclusions Increased snow resulted in higher plant density of ephemerals. However, this high density induced strong competition, reducing the body size of individual plants. By the end of the growing season, snow treatments did not induce significant changes in primary productivity of the ephemeral layer. Primary productivity or growth after seedling establishment depended mainly on rainfall that occurred after the snow had melted, not on snowmelt water itself. Thus conventional wisdom was shown to be only partially true. Snow was important to these ephemeral plants, but its role was limited to seedling establishment.","[Fan, Lian-Lian; Tang, Li-Song; Wu, Lin-Feng; Ma, Jian; Li, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lian-Lian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",qilian830404@yahoo.com.cn; Tangls@ms.xjb.ac.cn; emwlftc@163.com; majian@ms.xjb.ac.cn; liyan@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"973 Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB421102, 2009CB825102]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [4117049]","We thank all staff at Fukang Station of Desert Ecology for their excellent field support.

Here, we hypothesize that microorganisms are most likely to play a role in plant-soil feedback loops when they possess an affinity for a particular plant and the capacity to consistently affect the growth of that plant for good or ill. We characterized microbial communities using whole-community DNA fingerprinting from multiple ""home-and-away"" experiments involving giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida L.) and common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and we looked for affinity-effect relationships in these microbial communities. Using canonical ordination and partial least squares regression, we developed indices expressing each microorganism's affinity for ragweed or sunflower and its putative effect on plant biomass, and we used linear regression to analyze the relationship between microbial affinity and effect. Significant linear affinity-effect relationships were found in 75 % of cases. Affinity-effect relationships were stronger for ragweed than for sunflower, and ragweed affinity-effect relationships showed consistent potential for negative feedback loops. The ragweed feedback relationships indicated the potential involvement of multiple microbial taxa, resulting in strong, consistent affinity-effect relationships in spite of large-scale microbial variability between trials. In contrast, sunflower plant-soil feedback may involve just a few key players, making it more sensitive to underlying microbial variation. We propose that affinity-effect relationship can be used to determine key microbial players in plant-soil feedback against a low ""signal-to-noise"" background of complex microbial datasets.","[Lou, Yi; Yannarell, Anthony C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Clay, Sharon A.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Davis, Adam S.] ARS, USDA, Global Change & Photosynth Res Unit, Urbana, IL USA; [Dille, Anita; Ramirez, Analiza H.

Our aim was to partition the respiration of newly grown extramatrical ectomycorrhizal mycelium (ECM) and fine roots (and their associated microorganisms) in a young Norway spruce forest. Ingrowth mesh bags of 16 cm diameter and 12 cm height were placed in the upper soil and left for 12-16 months in 2010 and 2011. The 2 mm mesh size allowed the ingrowth of ECM and fine roots whereas a 45 mu m mesh size allowed only the ingrowth of ECM. The mesh bags were filled with either homogenized EA horizon soil, pure quartz sand (QS) or crushed granite (CG, only 2011), each with five replicates. Controls without any ingrowth were established for each substrate by solid plastic tubes (2010) and by 1 mu m mesh bags (2011). Fluxes of CO2 from the mesh bags and controls were measured biweekly during the growing season by the closed chamber method. The contribution of ECM to soil respiration was largest in the QS treatments, reaching cumulatively 1.2 and 2.2 Mg C ha(-1) 6 months(-1) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. For EA and CG treatments, the cumulative respiration from ECM was larger than from controls, however the differences being not statistically significant. The respiration of newly grown fine roots in QS amounted to 1.0 Mg C ha(-1) in 2010, but could not be identified in 2011 since fluxes from 2 mm and 45 mu m mesh bags were similar. The correlation of total root length in single QS mesh bags to CO2 fluxes was poor. The contribution of fine root respiration was also not detectable in the EA and CG treatment. No correlation was found between the autumnal biomass of newly grown ECM and its cumulative respiration. Our results suggest a substantial contribution of newly grown ECM to soil respiration. Respiration of ECM might be larger than respiration of fine roots.","[Neumann, Jonny; Matzner, Egbert] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Dept Soil Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Matzner, E (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Dept Soil Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",egbert.matzner@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,29,9,10,1,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2014,378,2-Jan,,,,,73,82,,10.1007/s11104-013-2018-0,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,AF2AC,WOS:000334514000005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Verburg, PSJ; Kapitzke, SE; Stevenson, BA; Bisiaux, M",,,,"Verburg, Paul S.

In addition, increased nitrogen (N) deposition may occur due to increased urban development. This study addressed the effects of water and N availability on C allocation in arid land soil-plant systems. Columns filled with Mojave Desert topsoil containing Larrea tridentata seedlings with two treatment levels each of N and soil moisture were labeled by exposure to C-13-enriched CO2. Increased soil moisture increased plant biomass, total C-13 uptake, C-13 levels in leaves, soil organic matter, and soil respiration, decreased relative C allocation to stems but increased allocation to soil organic matter. Increased soil N availability increased N uptake but decreased C allocation to soil respiration presumably due to decreased substrate supply for microbes. There was no detectable label in carbonate C, suggesting that this pool does not significantly contribute to ecosystem C fluxes. Our study indicates that increased water availability causes increased C uptake with increased C allocation to soil organic matter in Larrea tridentata-dominated communities while increased N deposition will have a minimal impact on C sequestration.","[Verburg, Paul S.

Specifically, we investigated how the degree of colonization affects growth of these species and assessed potential allelopathic effects of T. sebifera on the two native species. A field study and a greenhouse experiment were used to determine the degree of AMF colonization on focal woody species. Seedling growth of these species was compared between active (fungicide untreated) and AMF-suppressed (fungicide treated) soils in the greenhouse experiment. In a second greenhouse experiment, we tested the potential allelopathic effects of T. sebifera on the native species by growing the natives in soils from T. sebifera invaded or uninvaded regions, with and without activated carbon (AC). The invasive species, Triadica sebifera, exhibited a higher degree of AMF colonization compared to the native species and significantly higher total biomass in active soils compared to AMF-suppressed soils. Seedling biomass and AMF colonization of native B. halimifolia and M. cerifera did not differ between T. sebifera invaded and uninvaded soils, irrespective of the application of AC. Results suggest that invasive T. sebifera benefits from the presence of AMF, which might facilitate establishment of this invader. Results also suggest that allelopathy is not a likely mechanism of T. sebifera invasion in coastal transition ecosystems. A higher degree of AMF colonization, relative to native co-occurring species, may partly explain the successful invasion of T. sebifera into coastal plant communities of the southeastern USA.","[Paudel, Shishir; Baer, Sara G.; Battaglia, Loretta L.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Paudel, Shishir; Baer, Sara G.; Battaglia, Loretta L.] So Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Paudel, S (reprint author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",paudelshishir@gmail.com,"Paudel, Shishir/H-6813-2019","Paudel, Shishir/0000-0002-0794-5096",,,,62,6,7,2,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2014,378,2-Jan,,,,,337,349,,10.1007/s11104-014-2026-8,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,AF2AC,WOS:000334514000024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Yang, Q; Fu, Y; Wang, YQ; Wang, Y; Zhang, WH; Li, XY; Reng, YQ; Zhang, J",,,,"Yang, Qin; Fu, Yan; Wang, Yong-qing; Wang, Yun; Zhang, Wen-hua; Li, Xing-yuan; Reng, Yong-Quan; Zhang, Jie",,,Genetic diversity and differentiation in the critically endangered orchid (Amitostigma hemipilioides): implications for conservation,PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Orchidaceae; Amitostigma hemipilioides; Genetic diversity; Population differentiation; ISSR; Conservation genetics,POPULATION-SIZE; CHANGNIENIA-AMOENA; DECEPTIVE ORCHID; RAPD DIVERSITY; SOUTH-KOREA; PATTERNS; CONOPSEA; BIOLOGY; SLIPPER; CHINA,"Amitostigma hemipilioides is an endangered terrestrial orchid endemic to China. In the Southwestern China, the species is found restricted growing in the karst limestone or rock in the edge of farmland, moist hillsides or river. In the present study, the genetic diversity and differentiation was estimated within and among habitats, populations and groups of this species by ISSR markers. Using 13 polymorphic primers, an intermediate level of genetic diversity was found at the species level and population level with the percentage of polymorphic bands (P) of 64.7 and 50.9 %, Shannon index of diversity (I) of 0.3873 and 0.2949, respectively. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the high level of population differentiation was presented with 45.63 % relative to the total genetic variation residing among eight populations. It was noteworthy that as much as 69.17 % of the total diversity was most likely attributed to the difference among the populations in fragmentation habitat conditions, while 16.32 % of the total diversity could be attributed to the difference among the populations in stable and favorable habitat conditions. The in situ conservation is a top strategy, thus the mycorrhizal fungi and pollinators are protected by protecting habitat and avoiding fragmentation which is helpful to the cycle of this endangered orchid species and recovery of its wild populations. In addition, to maintaining the germplasm bank of this species, the ex situ conservation by habitat simulation and reintroduction has been considered in the living collection at Kaili University ecological garden and Yuntai Mountain scenic spot using the plants collected in this study.","[Yang, Qin; Zhang, Wen-hua; Li, Xing-yuan; Reng, Yong-Quan; Zhang, Jie] Kaili Univ, Coll Environm & Life Sci, Kaili 556000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yan] Qiandongnan Vocat & Tech Coll, Kaili 556000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong-qing] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yun] Tourist Adm, Shibing 556200, Guizhou, Peoples R China","Yang, Q (reprint author), Kaili Univ, Coll Environm & Life Sci, Kaili 556000, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",yangqin1028518@126.com; wangyqcnd@163.com,,,"Department of Science and TechnologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [[2012]3175, [2012]2300]; Kaili University of the Department of Education of Guizhou Province","This work was supported by the projects of social research (Grant No. [2012]3175) and natural science research (Grant No. [2012]2300) of the Department of Science and Technology, and the key support subject of botany of Kaili University of the Department of Education of Guizhou Province.",,35,8,9,0,50,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0378-2697,1615-6110,,PLANT SYST EVOL,Plant Syst.

(Jatropha) as agrofuel is currently increasing in tropical and sub-tropical regions. This plant and other Jatropha species are well known for synthetising various toxicants. However, the effects of Jatropha plantation on soil microbiota have barely been investigated. We sampled three sites planted with Jatropha for 1, 2 and 15 years in Senegal, together with their adjacent fallow plots, to test whether Jatropha could have detrimental effects on microbial activity and diversity. We further hypothetised that the extent of the effects of Jatropha would be correlated to plantation age. We observed that the genetic structure of the fungal community, and especially its Glomeromycota component, was strongly affected by Jatropha in all sites. The composition of the total bacterial community, especially of the nitrogen-fixing community, was also impacted but only in 2 sites out of 3, Besides, in situ catabolic potentials shifted similarly in response to Jatropha growth. Despite these microbial shifts, we cannot conclude to a negative impact as diversity indices (catabolic potentials, genetic profiles) were not lowered. Additionally, no cumulative effect was evidenced between the youngest and the oldest Jatropha plantations, indicating that microbial shifts occurred rapidly and lasted over the long term. Further studies dedicated to the functional implications of such structural shifts are needed since the genetic structure of essential microbial communities such as mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria were proved sensitive to Jatropha.

It is difficult to separate effects of precipitation per se from those mediated indirectly through changes in species composition. As such, afforestation (the intentional planting of woody species) in terrestrial ecosystems provides an ecological opportunity to assess the relative importance of climate and vegetation controls on ecosystem processes. We investigated the impacts of 35years of afforestation on ecosystem N dynamics, in ecosystems ranging from arid shrub-steppe to closed-canopy forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Sites of natural vegetation and adjacent sites planted with a single exotic species, Pinus ponderosa, were identified in five precipitation regimes along a continuous gradient of 250-2200mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). We evaluated C and N parameters of vegetation and soil, as well as natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 in leaves, roots, ectomycorrhizae (EcM) and soils. In natural vegetation, most leaf traits (%N, C:N ratios, leaf mass per area, delta N-15 values) demonstrated strong significant relationships with MAP, while these relationships were nearly absent in afforested sites. In addition, the EcM of native southern beech and pine trees were significantly enriched in N-15 relative to leaves at all sites where they were present. While soil C and N pools in both vegetation types increased with MAP, overall pool sizes were significantly reduced in afforested sites. Synthesis. Observed relationships between leaf traits and precipitation in natural vegetation may be driven largely by shifts in species composition and plant-soil interactions, rather than direct effects of precipitation. Our results suggest that a change in the species composition of the dominant vegetation is sufficient to alter C and N cycling independently of climate constraints: pine afforestation homogenized N dynamics across sites spanning an order of magnitude of MAP. These results highlight the important control of ectomycorrhizal associations in affecting C and N dynamics. Additionally, they serve to demonstrate that altering natural species composition alone is sufficient to cause large, detectable impacts on N turnover independently of direct climate effects.","[Hess, Laura J.

In this study, we applied a step-wise modeling procedure to test the relative effects of taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional diversity on macrophytes community productivity along water depth gradient. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants and measured 16 functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. Results showed that there was a significant decrease in taxonomic diversity, functional identity (i.e., stem dry mass content, leaf [C] and leaf [N]), and functional diversity (i.e., floating leaf, mean Julian flowering date and rooting depth) with increasing water depth. For the multiple-trait functional diversity (FD) indices, functional richness decreased, while functional divergence increased with water depth gradient. Macrophyte community productivity was strongly determined by functional trait composition within community, but not significantly affected by taxonomic diversity. Community-weighted means (CWM) showed a two times higher explanatory power relative to FD indices in determining variations in community productivity. For nine of sixteen traits, CWM and FD showed significant correlations with community productivity, although the strength and direction of those relations depended on selected trait. Furthermore, functional composition in a community affected productivity through either additive or opposite effects of CWM and FD, depending on the particular traits being considered. Our results suggested both mechanisms of mass ratio and niche complementarity can operate simultaneously on variations in community productivity, and considering both CWM and FD would lead to a more profound understanding of traits-productivity relationships.","[Fu, Hui; Zhong, Jiayou; Yuan, Guixiang] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Nanchang 330029, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Ni, Leyi; Xie, Ping; Cao, Te] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, Wuhan 430027, Peoples R China","Zhong, JY (reprint author), Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Nanchang 330029, Peoples R China.",jiayou@jxsl.gov.cn; caote@ihb.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31300398, 31270508, 41230853]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of ChinaNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2012ZX07105-004]","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31300398, 31270508, 41230853) and the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2012ZX07105-004).",,34,24,26,1,76,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Riparian plant communities along lowland streams are characterised by high species richness due to their system-specific environmental gradients. As these streams and their hydrological gradients are mainly rain-fed, they are sensitive to precipitation changes. We conducted a literature survey and meta-analysis to examine the effects of an increase in summer drought on: (i) riparian plant biomass; (ii) riparian seedling survival and (iii) riparian plant species composition and richness. We also aimed to determine whether hydrological thresholds related to drought tolerance can be distinguished for riparian plant species. ISI Web of Knowledge was searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and 23 papers were found that met our criteria and contained quantitative study results. To detect overall responses of biomass and seedling survival, a random-effects model was applied using Comprehensive Meta-analysis (TM) software. Regression curves were then fitted to response ratio data relating the effects on drought-impacted groups to those on control groups. Our results showed that a drought duration of approximately >30days strongly reduces riparian plant biomass and that a duration of approximately >30-35days and high drought intensities (starting from 3 to 4cm water table decline per day) can be detrimental for riparian seedling survival. Especially Populus and Salix seedlings showed a reduced survival in response to drought, in contrast to Tamarix seedlings, which have the ability to rapidly and expansively elongate their roots. The data also revealed that an increase in drought conditions rapidly leads to a decline of riparian species richness and an increased presence of species adjusted to drier conditions. Riparian groundwater level, surface water permanence and certain plant traits, especially plasticity in rooting depth, were mentioned most frequently as factors determining species responses. Very few studies mentioned hydrological thresholds, such as critical values for ground- and/or surface water levels, and so far these results have proved difficult to generalise. Our meta-analysis has shown that the projected increase in the duration and intensity of drought periods, especially intense droughts lasting more than 30days, can be expected to narrow the riparian wetland zone with typical hydric species and accelerate riparian wetland species losses in the near future. This may require extra efforts in terms of management and restoration of species-rich riparian areas.","[Garssen, Annemarie G.; Verhoeven, Jos T.

A pan-tropical review of recorded drought-related tree mortalities in more than 100 monitoring plots before, during and after drought events suggested a higher drought-vulnerability of trees in South-East Asian than in Amazonian forests. Here, we present the results of a replicated (n=3 plots) throughfall exclusion experiment in a perhumid tropical rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this first large-scale roof experiment outside semihumid eastern Amazonia, 60% of the throughfall was displaced during the first 8months and 80% during the subsequent 17months, exposing the forest to severe soil desiccation for about 17months. In the experiment's second year, wood production decreased on average by 40% with largely different responses of the tree families (ranging from -100 to +100% change). Most sensitive were trees with high radial growth rates under moist conditions. In contrast, tree height was only a secondary factor and wood specific gravity had no influence on growth sensitivity. Fine root biomass was reduced by 35% after 25months of soil desiccation while fine root necromass increased by 250% indicating elevated fine root mortality. Cumulative aboveground litter production was not significantly reduced in this period. The trees from this Indonesian perhumid rainforest revealed similar responses of wood and litter production and root dynamics as those in two semihumid Amazonian forests subjected to experimental drought. We conclude that trees from paleo- or neotropical forests growing in semihumid or perhumid climates may not differ systematically in their growth sensitivity and vitality under sublethal drought stress. Drought vulnerability may depend more on stem cambial activity in moist periods than on tree height or wood specific gravity.","[Moser, Gerald] Univ Giessen, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Moser, Gerald; Schuldt, Bernhard; Hertel, Dietrich; Horna, Viviana; Coners, Heinz; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Barus, Henry] Tadulako Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Palu 94118, Sulawesi Tengah, Indonesia","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,"Moser, Gerald/F-8085-2011; Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015","Moser, Gerald/0000-0002-0030-2370; Barus, Henry/0000-0003-2351-2132",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 552],"This study was part of the German-Indonesian collaborative research project ""SFB 552: Stability of Rain Forest Margins in Indonesia"" funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Ungulate impacts on plant communities have been considered mostly from an above-ground perspective. However, understanding below-ground effects of these invasive herbivores is critical as they may drive feedbacks to above-ground ecosystem components. We measured growth responses of seedlings of five common tree species in a greenhouse experiment in soils collected from 26 plots fenced to exclude invasive ungulates for at least 17years and from paired, unfenced control plots. We then further investigated soil-mediated effects of ungulates on one tree species, Melicytus ramiflorus, by partitioning these effects into soil abiotic and biotic components, as well as measuring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) root infection. Biomass of seedlings of all five species was greater in soils from within exclosures, although this was only significant for two species. These soil-mediated effects were partially driven by changes in physical and chemical soil properties; soil bulk densities were lower inside exclosures than in controls. Effects of invasive ungulates on seedling biomass of M.ramiflorus were positively related to effects on per cent AMF root infection. The biomass of M.ramiflorus seedlings was positively related to the AMF infection of its roots, which in turn was related to greater organic matter content and lower bulk density of soils from within exclosures. Results for M.ramiflorus indicated that soil-mediated effects of ungulates on seedling biomass were of abiotic origin, but were mediated by the biotic soil component, that is, through effects on AMF. Synthesis. Invasive herbivores may potentially impact on plant performance and community structure not only directly but also indirectly through influencing soil abiotic and biotic properties. Our results show that shifts in plant-soil interactions and feedbacks represent important but understudied pathways by which invasive ungulates can have wide-ranging impacts on forest ecosystems. Future studies should consider the importance of soil-mediated effects of invasive ungulates relative to direct effects of herbivory.","[Kardol, Paul; Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Dickie, Ian A.; St John, Mark G.; Bonner, Karen I.; Bellingham, Peter J.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Husheer, Sean W.] New Zealand Forest Surveys, Napier, New Zealand","Kardol, P (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Paul.Kardol@slu.se,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128","Wallenberg Scholars award; New Zealand Department of Conservation's 'Wild Animal Control for Emissions Management' research programme [4081]; Core funding for Crown Research Institutes from New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","We thank J.

We evaluated the diversity, composition, host and tissue affiliations, and geographic structure of fungal endophytes associated with common aquatic plants in lentic waters in northern Arizona, USA. Endophytes were isolated in culture from roots and photosynthetic tissues during two growing seasons. A total of 226 isolates representing 60 putative species was recovered from 9,600 plant tissue segments. Although isolation frequency was low, endophytes were phylogenetically diverse and species-rich. Comparisons among the most thoroughly sampled species and reservoirs revealed that isolation frequency and diversity did not differ significantly between collection periods, among species, among reservoirs, or as a function of depth. However, community structure differed significantly among reservoirs and tissue types. Phylogenetic analyses of a focal genus (Penicillium) corroborated estimates of species boundaries and informed community analyses, highlighting clade- and genotype-level affiliations of aquatic endophytes with both sediment- and waterborne fungi, and endophytes of proximate terrestrial plants. Together these analyses provide a first quantitative examination of endophytic associations in roots and foliage of aquatic plants and can be used to optimize survey strategies for efficiently capturing fungal biodiversity at local and regional scales.","[Sandberg, Dustin C.; Battista, Lorna J.; Arnold, A.

Previous mycological works focused on macrofungi (e.g. agarics, polypores) and mycorrhizae in Alnus acuminata forests, while fungal diversity in other parts of the Yungas has remained mostly unexplored. We carried out Ion Torrent sequencing of ITS2 rDNA from soil samples taken at 24 sites along the entire latitudinal extent of the Yungas in Argentina. The sampled sites represent the three altitudinal forest types: the piedmont (400-700m a.s.l.), montane (700-1500m a.s.l.) and montane cloud (1500-3000m a.s.l.) forests. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 4108126 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that fungal community composition correlates most strongly with elevation, with many fungi showing preference for a certain altitudinal forest type. For example, ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi were most diverse in the montane cloud forests, particularly at sites dominated by Alnus acuminata, while the diversity values of various saprobic groups were highest at lower elevations. Despite the strong altitudinal community turnover, fungal diversity was comparable across the different zonal forest types. Besides elevation, soil pH, N, P, and organic matter contents correlated with fungal community structure as well, although most of these variables were co-correlated with elevation. Our data provide an unprecedented insight into the high diversity and spatial distribution of fungi in the Yungas forests.","[Geml, Jozsef; Semenova, Tatiana A.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Geml, Jozsef; Semenova, Tatiana A.; Wicaksono, Christian Y.] Leiden Univ, Fac Sci, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Pastor, Nicolas; Fernandez, Lisandro; Becerra, Alejandra G.; Nouhra, Eduardo R.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, CONICET, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Pacheco, Silvia] Fdn ProYungas, RA-4107 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina","Geml, J (reprint author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, Darwinweg 2,POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Jozsef.Geml@naturalis.nl,"Geml, Jozsef/C-2223-2018","Geml, Jozsef/0000-0001-8745-0423; Becerra, Alejandra Gabriela/0000-0002-9055-5223","Eduardo Nouhra (SECYT Universidad Nacional de Cordoba) [26/11, 162/12, 124/13]; Jozsef Geml's Naturalis personal research budget; Alberta Mennega Foundation; Naturalis Research Initiative","Financial supports for the fieldwork were provided by Eduardo Nouhra (SECYT Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, 26/11; 162/12; 124/13), Jozsef Geml's Naturalis personal research budget and a fieldwork support grant awarded to Jozsef Geml by the Alberta Mennega Foundation.

Synzoochory is an intermediate dispersal type between endo and ectozoochory in which propagules are deliberately transported (usually in the mouth) but with no ingestion or gut passage involved. We present empirical evidence of synzoochoric mutualism between the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes and cryptogams (one fern and seven moss species). Two species (Lophosoria quadripinnata and Ancistrodes genuflexa) constituted the bulk of nest biomass, and another six moss species were present in lesser quantity. The hummingbird was selective when collecting nest material so that the nests contained a higher density of reproductive structures (that could be dispersed further) than natural patches of the cryptogam species. Even after one year, the nests maintained half of the original reproductive structures (sporangia, sporophytes) and biomass, constituting an important dispersal source. These results show a new type of mutualism in which mosses could be dispersed throughout longer distances (several km) by hummingbirds and to higher positions (particularly for ground-living species, promoting dispersal potential). The hummingbird benefits from collecting cryptogam material for nest building, and cryptogams benefit from the concentration and relocation of diaspore sources into more effective recruiting sites. Similar mutualistic relationships could be a general phenomenon, of importance in many ecosystems.","[Osorio-Zuniga, Felipe] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Univ Chile, Depto Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Rydin, Hakan] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolut, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Osorio-Zuniga, F (reprint author), Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, 20A Inverleith Row, Edinburgh EH3 5LR, Midlothian, Scotland.",fonturbel@gmail.com,"Fonturbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009","Fonturbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT),"We are grateful to M.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil salinity on AMF root colonization, spore count, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) and community structure in Saemangeum reclaimed land, South Korea. Soil samples were collected and grouped into five distinct salt classes based on the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extracts (ECse). Mycorrhizal root colonization, spore count and GASP were measured under different salinity levels. AMF community structure was studied through three complementary methods; spore morphology, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Results revealed that root colonization (P < 0.01), spore count (P < 0.01) and GRSP (P < 0.01) were affected negatively by soil salinity. Spore morphology and T-RFLP data showed predominance of AMF genus Glomus in Saemangeum reclaimed land. T-RFLP and DGGE analysis revealed significant changes in diversity indices between non (ECse < 2 dS/m) and extremely (ECse > 16 dS/m) saline soil and confirmed dominance of Glomus caledonium only in soils with ECse < 8 dS/m. However, ribotypes of Glomus mosseae and Glomus proliferum were ubiquitous in all salt classes. Combining spore morphology, T-RFLP and DGGE analysis, we could show a pronounced effect in AMF community across salt classes. The result of this study improve our understanding on AMF activity and dominant species present in different salt classes and will substantially expand our knowledge on AMF diversity in reclaimed lands.

Hosts can minimize infection by less-effective symbionts (partner choice) and can divest of uncooperative bacteria after infection (sanctions). Yet, such host-control traits are predicted to be context dependent, especially if they are costly for hosts to express or maintain. Legumes form symbiosis with rhizobia that vary in symbiotic effectiveness (nitrogen fixation) and can enforce partner choice as well as sanctions. In nature, legumes acquire fixed nitrogen from both rhizobia and soils, and nitrogen deposition is rapidly enriching soils globally. If soil nitrogen is abundant, we predict host control to be downregulated, potentially allowing invasion of ineffective symbionts. We experimentally manipulated soil nitrogen to examine context dependence in host control. We co-inoculated Lotus strigosus from nitrogen depauperate soils with pairs of Bradyrhizobium strains that vary in symbiotic effectiveness and fertilized plants with either zero nitrogen or growth maximizing nitrogen. We found efficient partner choice and sanctions regardless of nitrogen fertilization, symbiotic partner combination or growth season. Strikingly, host control was efficient even when L. strigosus gained no significant benefit from rhizobial infection, suggesting that these traits are resilient to short-term changes in extrinsic nitrogen, whether natural or anthropogenic.","[Regus, John U.; Gano, Kelsey A.; Hollowell, Amanda C.; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",joels@ucr.edu,"Sachs, Joel/AAB-9348-2019","Sachs, Joel/0000-0002-0221-9247",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1150278]; Mildred E.

In this work, Scenedesmus residues were evaluated as substrates for biogas production and compared to raw biomass (SB). Microalgae residues were generated after the extraction of amino acids (SRA) and lipids (SRL). The influence of the processes applied on physicochemical properties and anaerobic biodegradability of microalgal biomass was studied in batch digestion tests. Co-digestion of microalgae residues with carbon rich substrates was also assessed by studying synergisms and kinetics of the discontinuous process. Methane yields of SRA and SRL in mono-digestion were 272.8 +/- 7.3 L-CH4 kgVS(-1) and 212.3 +/- 5.6 L-CH4 kgVS(-1), respectively, increasing that of SB (140.3 +/- 29.4 L-CH4 kgVS(-1)). Kinetics of the process was also improved after the extraction of amino acids and lipids. Improvements were attributed to the disruption of microalgae cell walls and the increase in the solubilization of the organic matter. The amino acid extraction process improved the digestion process in a higher extent than lipid extraction because of its higher hydrolytic effect on biomass. Co-digestion influence on methane yield depended on the co-substrates used. However, co-digestion improved kinetics of the process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Black and white spruce trees (Picea mariana and Picea glauca) are widely planted in the eastern boreal forest of Canada and are known to develop substantial adventitious root systems. In this study, we compared root development and growth of 17-year-old trees that had been planted at two different depths (ground level vs 10-12 cm) to see if partial stem burial would hasten adventitious root development, and in turn, growth. Root number (total and adventitious), root total area, rooting depth, year of root formation, tree height and basal diameter were measured in black and white spruce trees. Both species developed adventitious root systems, and adventitious roots size and area were greater for deeply planted trees than for trees planted at ground level. The number of adventitious roots and the speed of adventitious root development were greater for deeply planted black spruce but not for deeply planted white spruce, compared with trees planted at ground level. For the latter, site conditions could explain the absence of a planting depth response. Deep planting increased tree height and basal diameter of white spruce, but only height for black spruce trees. However, tree growth was related to total root cross-sectional area (not just adventitious roots), underscoring the importance of both types of roots for tree growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As they played just a minor role in the age class forest, the growth behaviour of strongly released trees is rather unexplored. Here we show how retention cutting, presently spreading in the boreal of Quebec province, affects stem and coarse root growth of remained single black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton]. Increment cores from roots and stems of 125 trees show that retention cutting triggers coarse root growth of the remaining trees. Compared with reference trees retention trees accelerate root in relation to stem growth. Mean and variability of the root-stem allometry significantly rise after retention cutting. The found acceleration of root in relation to stem growth means mechanical stabilisation of the retention trees and corroborates the retention cutting method. Evaluation of silvicultural treatments can be incomplete and misleading as long as they are just based on aboveground reactions and neglect root growth.","[Pretzsch, Hans; Heym, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Pinna, Samuel] Consortium Foresterie Gaspesie Les Iles, Gaspe, PQ G4X 1E1, Canada; [Schneider, Robert] UQAR, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Chaire Rech Foret Habitee, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Pretzsch, H (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",H.Pretzsch@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014; Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868",Bavarian Research Alliance in the Bavaria-Quebec cooperation program; Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources; Group Lebel Inc.; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This project has received a grant from the Bavarian Research Alliance in the Bavaria-Quebec cooperation program.

In many regions water availability will decline with climate change, exposing small seedlings to a greater likelihood of drought. In this study, 17 leaves, stem, root, and whole-plant traits of ten woody Mediterranean species were measured under favourable growing conditions and seedling drought survival was evaluated during a simulated dry-down episode. The aims of this study were: i) to assess drought survival of different species, ii) to analyse which functional traits predict drought survival time, and iii) to explain species distribution in the field, based on species drought survival and drought strategies. Drought survival time varied ten-fold across species, from 19 to 192 days. Across species, drought survival was positively related to the rooting depth per leaf area, i.e., the ability to acquire water from deeper soil layers while reducing transpiring leaf area. Drought survival time was negatively related to species ability to grow quickly, as indicated by high relative growth and net assimilation rates. Drought survival also explained species distribution in the field. It was found that species were sorted along a continuum, ranging between two contrasting species functional extremes based on functional traits and drought performance. One extreme consisted of acquisitive fast-growing deciduous species, with thin, soft metabolically active leaves, with high resource use and vulnerability to drought. The opposite extreme consisted of conservative slow-growing evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, deep roots, a low transpiring area, and low water use, resulting in high drought survival and drought tolerance. The results show that these drought strategies shape species distribution in this Mediterranean area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Particularly during the period of establishment, the susceptibility to drought stress of saplings is increased because of incompletely developed root systems and reduced access to soil water. Here, we subjected beech saplings (Fagus sylvatica L.) to different levels of drought stress. Beech saplings were planted in rhizotrons, which were installed in the soil of a Norway spruce forest before bud burst. Soil moisture was manipulated in the following year during May to September. We measured photosynthetic net CO2 uptake, volume production of fine roots, and rhizosphere respiration during the growing season. Biometric parameters of the fine-root system, biomass, and nonstructural carbohydrates were analyzed upon harvest in October. Photosynthesis and rhizosphere respiration decreased with increasing drought-stress dose (cumulated soil water potential), and cumulative rhizosphere respiration was significantly negatively correlated with drought-stress dose. Fine-root length and volume production were highest at moderate soil drought, but decreased at severe soil drought. The proportion of fine-roots diameter < 0.2mm and the root-to-shoot ratio increased whereas the live-to-dead ratio of fine roots decreased with increasing drought-stress dose. We conclude that the belowground C allocation as well as the relative water-uptake efficiency of beech saplings is increased under drought.","[Zang, Ulrich; Matzner, Egbert; Borken, Werner] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany; [Goisser, Michael; Haeberle, Karl-Heinz; Matyssek, Rainer] Tech Univ Munich, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Zang, U (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany.",ulrich.zang@uni-bayreuth.de,,,"Bavarian State Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry","We thank U.

The results showed that at the both P rates, dual-inoculation treatment stimulated the hyphal growth and increased the shoot P content. IRB could accelerate mycorrhizal colonization, and showed a positive effect on plant biomass and P uptake at both P levels. Compared to sole-IRB or GM treatment, the dual inoculation treatment increased the soil available P content at both P rates (p < 0.05), which was in the following order: the dual IRB+GM > the sole IRB > the sole GM > control for soil SMP content at low P rate, whilst the dual IRB+GM > the sole IRB approximate to the sole GM > control treatment at high P rate. Compared with the IRB treatment, the GM treatment significantly decreased the soil available P content and the MBP content at low P rate, but made no difference at high P rates. The soil MBC in dual-inoculation treatment was greatest under the high P level, while the highest soil MBC was the sole-GM treatment under the low P level. The sole GM treatment showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher soil MBC than that of sole IRB at low P rate (p < 0.05), while there was no significant differences between sole IRB and sole GM at high P rate. Our results suggested that the interaction between GM and IRB had synergetic effect on the mobilization of Fe(III)-fixed P and their relationship could be regulated by the turnover of MBP. The fact that plants acquired more P via mycorrhizal pathway in the GM-IRB system suggested that the three symbiont of plant-GM-IRB had great ecological and functional significance for P activity in tropical and subtropical soil.","[Zhang, Shirong; Wang, Rongping; Li, Shuyi; Ding, Xiaodong] Guangdong Inst Ecoenvironm & Soil Sci, Guangdong Publ Lab Environm Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lin; Feng, Gu] China Agr Univ, Dept Ecol, Key Lab Plant Nutr, Minist Agr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Ding, XD (reprint author), Guangdong Inst Ecoenvironm & Soil Sci, Guangdong Publ Lab Environm Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xiaodongding2004@163.com,,,"State Nature Science Foundation of China [31201693]; Science Foundation of Guangdong provinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [S2012040006938]; Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Academy of Sciences [rcjj201202, qnjjsq201102]","We acknowledge the financial support from the State Nature Science Foundation of China (31201693), the Science Foundation of Guangdong province (S2012040006938) and the Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Academy of Sciences (rcjj201202; qnjjsq201102).",,62,2,3,2,43,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

The amount of root litter input is depending on estimates of turnover times from different techniques. Turnover times from fine-root cameras (minirhizotrons) often yield 75% higher root litter input estimates than turnover times estimated with the bomb-radiocarbon signature of fine roots. We introduce a generic framework for the analysis of fine-root C-14 with different survival functions. So far, mostly an exponential function has been used to estimate the turnover time and mean age of fine roots. In the context of the introduced survival function framework we clarify the terms turnover time, mean residence time, mean longevity, and mean age, which are commonly used in studies of root turnover. Using a unique time series of fine-root C-14 (Froberg 2012), we test if survival functions other than the exponential function are better in accordance with turnover-time estimates commonly found with other methods. A survival function that corresponds to a two-pool model was best in agreement with minirhizotron-based estimates (mean residence time of 1.9 y). We argue that using fine-root C-14 and minirhizotron time-to-death data together would give the best constraints on fine-root turnover. At the same time this could allow quantifying systematic biases inherent to both techniques.","[Ahrens, Bernhard; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Ahrens, B (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",bernhard.ahrens@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Ahrens, Bernhard/P-1790-2018; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011","Ahrens, Bernhard/0000-0001-7226-6682; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112",ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2007-StG-208516],"We are grateful to Marion Schrumpf, Emily Solly, Thomas Wutzler, and Mats Froberg for very helpful comments on the manuscript.

However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (g(s)), mid-day leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (K-L.p), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, K-L.p was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in K-L.p was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in K-L.p. The post-fire increase in K-L.p was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher K-L.p in burned sites was manifested as an increase in gs rather than an increase in Psi(leaf). Post-fire increases in gs should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.","[Schafer, Jennifer L.; Breslow, Bradley P.; Hollingsworth, Stephanie N.; Hoffmann, William A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hohmann, Matthew G.] US Army Corps Engineers, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Champaign, IL 61826 USA","Schafer, JL (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, 2115 Gardner Hall,Box 7612, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",jlschafe@ncsu.edu,,,US Army Engineer Research and Development CenterUnited States Department of Defense; North Carolina State University [W9132T-11-2-0007],This research was supported by a cooperative agreement between the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center and North Carolina State University (W9132T-11-2-0007 to W.A.H.).,,61,4,4,1,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2014,34,4,,,,,404,414,,10.1093/treephys/tpu015,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,AH1PA,WOS:000335892100008,24682534,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Ky-Dembele, C; Tigabu, M; Bayala, J; Oden, PC",,,,"Ky-Dembele, Catherine; Tigabu, Mulualem; Bayala, Jules; Oden, Per Christer",,,Inter- and intra-provenances variations in seed size and seedling characteristics of Khaya senegalensis A.

Juss were studied at INERA in Burkina Faso. Nursery grown seedlings from four provenances in Burkina Faso were used for the study. The studies revealed significant variability in all traits evaluated. Seed length and weight significantly varied among provenances and families within provenances, where Bopiel and Koyenga had the highest mean values. Height and root collar diameter of 1 year old seedlings significantly varied among families within provenances. Except leaf biomass ratio and carbon isotope ratio which varied significantly among provenances but not among families within provenances, all other seedling biomass traits-total plant biomass, stem biomass ratio, leaf biomass ratio, root biomass ratio, root shoot ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf area ratio were significantly affected by provenances and families within provenances. The magnitude of variation due to family effect ranged from 65 to 93 % for seed size traits, and from 4.5 to 17.8 % for seedling characters. Estimates of family heritability were moderate to high (0.67-0.95) for seed traits, but low to moderate (0.19-0.59) for seedling characters, indicating that much of the total variation in seed traits is due to the genetic effect. The two most prominent provenances, Koyenga and Bopiel, with higher seed size and greater seedling growth could be considered for an eventual K. senegalensis improvement program in Burkina Faso.","[Ky-Dembele, Catherine; Bayala, Jules] World Agroforestry Ctr, West Africa & Cent Reg Off Sahel Node, Bamako, Mali; [Tigabu, Mulualem; Oden, Per Christer] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Ky-Dembele, C (reprint author), World Agroforestry Ctr, West Africa & Cent Reg Off Sahel Node, BP E5118, Bamako, Mali.",C.Dembele@cgiar.org,,"Tigabu, Mulualem/0000-0003-2471-1168",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"Funding for this study was provided by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).

However, the dynamics in soil water availability for tree transpiration (T-t) cannot be easily deduced from conventional measurements of soil water content (SWC), notably because T-t is influenced by soil water potential ((s)) that, in turn, depends on soil characteristics. Using tree sap flow and water potential and deriving depth-dependent soil water retention curves, we quantified the transpirable soil water content' (tSWC) and its seasonal and inter-annual variations in a semi-arid Pinus halepensis forest. The results indicated that tSWC varied in time and with soil depth. Over one growing season T-t was 57% of rain and 72% of the infiltrated SWC. In early winter, T-t was exclusively supported by soil moisture at the top 10cm (tSWC=11mm), whereas in spring (tSWC>18mm) and throughout the dry season, source water for T-t shifted to 20-40cm, where the maximum fine root density occurs. Simulation with the soil-plant-atmosphere water and energy transport model MuSICA supported the idea that consistent tSWC at the 20-40cm soil layer critically depended on limited water infiltration below 40cm, because of high water retention below this depth. Quantifying tSWC is critical to the precise estimation of the onset and termination of the growing season (when tSWC>0) in this semi-arid ecosystem.

Vegetation growth and development are mainly controlled by water availability on semi-arid regions, where a moisture gradient determines the transition between the densely vegetated riparian zone and the semi-arid upland. To reproduce this spatial distribution, a mathematical model named RibAV is presented. Its conceptualization is based on the main ecohydrological modelling approaches and field expertise. The implementation of RibAV that is proposed in this paper allows the simulation of the distribution of three plant functional types [herbaceous riparian vegetation (HRV), woody riparian vegetation (WRV) and terrestrial vegetation (TV)] within the riparian zone. An evapotranspiration index (E-idx) obtained through RibAV is used as a criterion for plant absence/presence prediction. Two permanent river reaches of semi-arid Mediterranean basins, the Terde reach (Mijares River, Spain) and the Lorcha reach (Serpis River, Spain), have been selected as case studies for the calibration and validation of the model, respectively. Several criteria based on the confusion matrix were used to analyse the efficiency of RibAV on the prediction of plant distribution. The satisfactory performance of the model establishing the distribution of the riparian vegetation types and the limit between this zone and the bordering upland are demonstrated in this paper; the strength of the E-idx to classify plant functional types in riparian semi-arid environments is additionally proven.

The mortality rates of the stem-inoculated seedlings differed significantly from controls, but those of the seedlings infected via soil infestation did not differ. For both types of inoculation, the lesions were longer, and wilting symptoms were more severe in the seedlings inoculated with H.annosum than in control seedlings. For stem inoculation, biomass allocation did not differ significantly between the infected and control seedlings.

While most comparisons use the average or mean parameter to represent measured properties, other aspects of the distribution, including the variance of the properties may assist in a more robust assessment of site recovery. Our purpose was to compare soil properties in different ages of reclaimed soils with those in reference areas by incorporating the potentially different distributions according to areas. On two sampling dates, in consecutive years, we examined soil properties on a chronosequence of reclaimed natural gas pipelines spanning recovery ages of <1-54 years, obtaining data on soil moisture, organic carbon, nitrogen, electrical conductivity, pH, and microbial abundance. To make the comparisons, we analyzed our data with a Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model and obtained posterior predictive distributions for the soil properties. This allowed us to probabilistically quantify the extent to which a soil property from a reclaimed treatment was similar to that from an undisturbed reference. We found that the posterior predictive variance of most soil properties was particularly sensitive to disturbance and reclamation, especially, within the first few years of recovery. Response of this variance to disturbance, reclamation, and recovery was not necessarily accompanied by a shift in the posterior predictive mean value of the property. Patterns for all soil properties changed over time, with posterior predictive distributions of soil properties generally becoming more similar to those of the undisturbed reference sites as recovery time increased. We suspect these trends in altered variability coincide with the degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil properties that results following disturbance and reclamation, which is also coupled to patterns of vegetation recovery.

Parameters relating to root development were measured. Root initiation, total root length (RL), and dry mass (DM), as well as root: shoot relationships in Salix clones exceeded that of Populus clones in all media. For Salix clones RL and DM were highest in S. matsudana x pentandra and for Populus clones RL and DM were generally higher in hybrid clones having P. trichocarpa parentage. Mean RL and DM for all clones were generally greater in the low bulk density soil than in the high bulk density soil. There were a greater proportion of thinner roots in the low bulk density soil than in the high bulk density soil. There were significant differences in root initiation, RL, and DM among clones within each genus. Increasing soil bulk density significantly reduced root development in both Salix and Populus clones.

This study aims at identifying root morphological traits which confer the most resistance to soil during shearing. Three species used for slope stabilisation (Ricinus communis L., Jatropha curcas L. and Rhus chinensis Mill.) were grown for 10 months in large shear boxes filled with silty clay similar to that found in Yunnan, China. Direct shear tests were then performed and compared to fallow soil. Root systems were excavated and a large number of traits measured. Shear strength and deformation energy were enhanced by the presence of roots. Regardless of confining pressure, R. communis conferred most resistance due to its taprooted system with many vertical roots. J. curcas possessed oblique and vertical roots which created fragile zones throughout the soil profile. The least efficient root system was R. chinensis which possessed many horizontal lateral roots. Soil mechanical properties were most influenced by (i) density of roots crossing the shear plane, (ii) branching density throughout the soil profile, (iii) total length of coarse roots above the shear plane and (iv) total volume of coarse roots and fine root density below the shear plane. During failure, fine, short and branched roots slipped through soil rather than breaking. Root morphological traits such as density, branching, length, volume, inclination and orientation influence significantly soil mechanical properties.","[Ghestem, Murielle] AgroParis Tech, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Veylon, Guillaume; Bernard, Alain] IRSTEA, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France; [Vanel, Quentin] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Stokes, Alexia] INRA, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France","Ghestem, M (reprint author), AgroParis Tech, UMR AMAP, TA A51 PS2, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",murielle.ghestem@developpement-durable.gouv.fr,,"Veylon, Guillaume/0000-0001-9977-4572; stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911",INRA (Jeune Equipe)Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA); CNRS (Ecopente project); Ingecotech (CATAR project),"We thank Francois Pailler and Jerome Nespoulous (INRA, UMR AMAP), Laurent Peyras, Nadia Benhamed, Faustine Byron, Yves Gremeaux, Guillaume Nunes (IRSTEA), for help with measurements and shear tests.

The aim of this work is providing new field data on soil reinforcement by roots after trees cutting. The present work investigated c (r) decay in a mixed Silver Fir-Norway Spruce (Abies alba Mill. Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand in the Italian Alps over a period of 3 years after felling by monitoring the two c (r) driving variables: root tensile resistance and root density. Results showed that a significant difference in root resistance occurred only 3 years after felling, whereas the decrease in the number of roots was significant in the second year. The degradation process was more rapid in shallower layers and for thinner roots, as a consequence of the pattern of biological activity rate. The reduction of c (r) after felling was, for a reference profile depth of 70 cm, 55 % in the first 2 years and another 16 % in the third year. The findings of this study, providing new data on the decrease of c (r) after felling, can be introduced into geotechnical models allowing a better estimation of the stability of forest hillslopes.","[Vergani, C.; Chiaradia, E.

In the current study, the co-accumulation of microbial residues and organic matter was investigated in a mature, 15-year-old on-farm tillage experiment (mouldboard plough (MBT), grubber (GRT), no tillage (NT)) on four different arable silt-loam sites in central and southern Germany at 0 to 40 cm soil depth. The GRT and NT treatments increased the stocks of SOC (+7 %) and microbial biomass C (+20 %) in comparison with the MBT treatment. The differences between the GRT and NT were small, but there were more positive effects for the GRT treatment in most cases. Our results indicate significant tillage effects in loess-derived silt loams suitable for rain-fed sugar beet production, although strong site-specific differences occurred for most of the soil chemical and microbiological properties analysed. In the GRT and NT treatments, the increased stocks of SOC were not caused by the preferential accumulation of fungal residues at 0-5 cm depth, whereas ergosterol-free biotrophic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was promoted at the expense of saprotrophic fungi at 30-40 cm depth. Our results suggest that the relationship between saprotrophic fungi and AMF is an important factor for tillage-induced changes in microbial turnover of SOC.","[Murugan, Rajasekaran; Joergensen, Rainer Georg] Univ Kassel, Dept Soil Biol & Plant Nutr, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; [Koch, Heinz-Josef] Inst Sugar Beet Res, D-37079 Gottingen, Germany","Murugan, R (reprint author), Univ Kassel, Dept Soil Biol & Plant Nutr, Nordbahnhofstr 1a, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",raja.murugan15@gmail.com,,,German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG),"The technical assistance of Gabriele Dormann is highly appreciated.

The response of the soil carbon cycle to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration has far reaching consequences for the ecosystem carbon balance under future climatic conditions. We report on work carried out in the Swiss free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, where we used in situ (CO2)-C-13 labelling to determine whether elevated CO2 (+230 mu L L-1) concentration changes the fate of recently assimilated carbon in the soil microbial community. 2. Elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) concentration had an overall positive effect on microbial abundance (P < 0.001) with the gram-negative bacteria showing significantly increased quantities. 3. Gram-negative bacteria and saprotrophic fungi tended to utilize a higher amount of recently assimilated carbon under eCO(2). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) utilized plant-assimilated carbon within 1 day after the (CO2)-C-13 pulse and C-13 uptake patterns in AMF suggest that carbon transfer is faster under eCO(2) concentration than under ambient CO2 (aCO(2)). Additionally, the respiration of recently assimilated carbon was significantly higher under eCO(2) than aCO(2) concentration. 4. Our data suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration accelerated and increased the utilization of recently assimilated carbon by the microbial community without changing the microbial community composition drastically. 5. We conclude that a higher standing soil microbial biomass under eCO(2) concentration was the key cause for the higher carbon flow through the plant-soil system. Carbon utilization by microbial functional groups was only little affected by a decade of CO2 enrichment.","[Staddon, Philip L.; Reinsch, Sabine; Ambus, Per; Jakobsen, Iver] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Staddon, Philip L.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Olsson, Pal A.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Luescher, Andreas] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Luescher, Andreas] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Forage Prod Grassland Syst, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","Reinsch, S (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",sare@kt.dtu.dk,"Luscher, Andreas/E-2944-2018; Ambus, Per/B-2514-2015; Reinsch, Sabine/J-6731-2017; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Ambus, Per/0000-0001-7580-524X; Reinsch, Sabine/0000-0003-4649-0677; Staddon, Philip/0000-0002-7968-3179; Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535; Andreas, Luescher/0000-0001-8158-1721",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council,"We thank the European Commission for awarding P.

We compared two encroachers, Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), with the less invasive live oak (Quercus fusiformis) to ascertain whether soil depth or species-specific water use strategy is most important in determining transpirational losses on shallow soils underlain by fractured limestone bedrock on the Edwards Plateau. Sap fluxes, leaf water potentials, soil moisture and meteorological information were monitored during spring 2009 at three sites with differing soil depths and were used in a non-spatial soil-vegetation-atmosphere water transfer model to predict different rooting depths. Sap flux responses and soil water stress were compared using multivariate statistical analysis. At two relatively deep-soil savanna sites, we found that dominant tree species had similar water use behaviour. However, at the shallow-soil forest containing Ashe juniper and live oak, juniper transpiration was much higher early in the season than oak transpiration, indicating that juniper benefited more from early spring rainfall than oaks. The model predicts that maximum rooting depths for the woody vegetation were mostly constrained by site soil depths. This study provides new evidence that these species perform similarly on shallow soils and that their water use is restricted by soil depth. The only species-specific strategy found important in determining transpirational losses was juniper's ability to withstand low soil water potentials in very shallow soils.

A network approach considers multiple mutualistic interactions within a functional type and has been largely nonmechanistic, with little attention to the fitness consequences of specific interactions. Alternatively, consumer-resource approaches have explicitly characterized the mechanisms and fitness consequences of resource exchange, but have not been extended to functionally divergent partners. First, we merge these approaches using graphical models to define the multiple mutualist effects (MMEs) that occur when a focal species has multiple partner mutualists. This approach mirrors food web research that has been advanced by studies of multiple predator effects as well as by detailed investigations of modules nested within larger networks. Second, we define the pathways through which a focal mutualist and two or more partner species could interact, reviewing examples of MMEs that span a range from positive to negative fitness effects. Third, given the potential for nonadditivity demonstrated by the existing literature, we pose new hypotheses for species-interaction outcomes by examining factors such as the extent of overlap in rewards exchanged among partners and their resulting network topologies. Our synthesis illustrates how the consideration of MMEs can improve the ability to predict the outcomes of losses or gains of mutualisms from ecosystems.","[Afkhami, Michelle E.; Stachowicz, John J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Afkhami, ME (reprint author), Univ Toronto, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",michelle.afkhami@utoronto.ca,,,"Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation; Center for Population Biology; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1011635, DEB 0918267, DEB 1145588, OCE 0850707, OCE 1234345]","We thank C.

In this work, interconversion between OH-tetraBDEs and MeO-tetraBDEs in young pumpkins was experimentally proven. Conversion ratios were higher for pumpkins exposed to OH-BDEs than for those exposed to MeO-BDEs. Twelve PBDE analogues showed different metabolic potential. The largest biotransformation ratio (12.4%) was observed for the transformation from 4-OH-BDE-42 to 4-MeO-BDE-42. The lowest interconversion ratios were found between 2'-OH-BDE-68 and 2'-MeO-BDE-68. Transformation products were mainly found in roots. Fewer metabolites were detected in stems, while no metabolites were detected in shoots. Root exudates were found to make only a small contribution to the conversion between OH- and MeO-PBDEs.

However, our knowledge of the connection between plant development, root exudation and microbiome assemblage is limited. Here, we analyzed the structure of the rhizospheric bacterial community associated with Arabidopsis at four time points corresponding to distinct stages of plant development: seedling, vegetative, bolting and flowering. Overall, there were no significant differences in bacterial community structure, but we observed that the microbial community at the seedling stage was distinct from the other developmental time points. At a closer level, phylum such as Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and specific genera within those phyla followed distinct patterns associated with plant development and root exudation. These results suggested that the plant can select a subset of microbes at different stages of development, presumably for specific functions. Accordingly, metatranscriptomics analysis of the rhizosphere microbiome revealed that 81 unique transcripts were significantly (P<0.05) expressed at different stages of plant development. For instance, genes involved in streptomycin synthesis were significantly induced at bolting and flowering stages, presumably for disease suppression. We surmise that plants secrete blends of compounds and specific phytochemicals in the root exudates that are differentially produced at distinct stages of development to help orchestrate rhizosphere microbiome assemblage.","[Chaparro, Jacqueline M.; Badri, Dayakar V.; Vivanco, Jorge M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ctr Rhizosphere Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Chaparro, JM (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, Ctr Rhizosphere Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",j.vivanco@colostate.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0950857],"Work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation to JMV (MCB-0950857).

Besides abiotic conditions, microbial community structure and the accessibility of SOM to the decomposer community are hypothesized to control SOM decomposition and thus have a crucial role in SOM accumulation in buried soils. We surveyed the microbial community structure in cryoturbated soils from nine soil profiles in the northeastern Siberian tundra using high-throughput sequencing and quantification of bacterial, archaeal and fungal marker genes. We found that bacterial abundances in buried topsoils were as high as in unburied topsoils. In contrast, fungal abundances decreased with depth and were significantly lower in buried than in unburied topsoils resulting in remarkably low fungal to bacterial ratios in buried topsoils. Fungal community profiling revealed an associated decrease in presumably ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The abiotic conditions (low to subzero temperatures, anoxia) and the reduced abundance of fungi likely provide a niche for bacterial, facultative anaerobic decomposers of SOM such as members of the Actinobacteria, which were found in significantly higher relative abundances in buried than in unburied topsoils. Our study expands the knowledge on the microbial community structure in soils of Northern latitude permafrost regions, and attributes the delayed decomposition of SOM in buried soils to specific microbial taxa, and particularly to a decrease in abundance and activity of ECM fungi, and to the extent to which bacterial decomposers are able to act as their functional substitutes.","[Gittel, Antje; Torsvik, Vigdis L.; Schleper, Christa] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway; [Gittel, Antje; Schnecker, Joerg; Wild, Birgit; Richter, Andreas; Schleper, Christa; Urich, Tim] Austrian Polar Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Barta, Jiri; Kohoutova, Iva; Capek, Petr; Santruckova, Hana] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Mikutta, Robert; Gentsch, Norman; Shibistova, Olga; Guggenberger, Georg] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Bodenkunde, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Owens, Sarah; Gilbert, Jack] Argonne Natl Lab, Inst Genom & Syst Biol, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Owens, Sarah] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Jack] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schnecker, Joerg; Wild, Birgit; Richter, Andreas] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Div Terr Ecosyst Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hannisdal, Bjarte] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway; [Maerz, Joeran] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Div Ecosyst Modelling, Geesthacht, Germany; [Lashchinskiy, Nikolay] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Siberian Bot Garden, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Shibistova, Olga] Russian Acad Sci, VN Sukachev Inst Forest, Siberian Branch, Akademgorodok, Russia; [Schleper, Christa; Urich, Tim] Univ Vienna, Dept Ecogen & Syst Biol, Div Archaea Biol & Ecogen, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Gittel, A (reprint author), Ctr Geomicrobiol, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",antjegittel80@gmail.com; tim.urich@univie.ac.at,"Richter, Andreas/D-8483-2012; Wild, Birgit/E-6476-2012; Schnecker, Jorg/E-6546-2012; Capek, Petr/I-1518-2016; Lashchinskiy, Nikolay/I-5409-2018; Urich, Tim/J-8241-2016; Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013","Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3282-4808; Wild, Birgit/0000-0002-9611-0815; Schnecker, Jorg/0000-0002-5160-2701; Capek, Petr/0000-0001-9362-6384; Guggenberger, Georg/0000-0002-6962-8264; Urich, Tim/0000-0002-5718-1354; Lasinskii, Nikolai/0000-0003-1085-1987",Research Council of Norway as a part of the International Program CryoCARB (Long-term Carbon Storage in Cryoturbated Arctic Soils) [NFR-200411]; EU Action program (Austria-Czech Republic) [60p14]; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF I370-B17],"We thank all members of the CryoCARB consortium that participated in field work in Cherskii in 2010 and their invaluable contributions to this manuscript by fruitful discussions.

Within a forest, disturbance events can greatly impact C cycling and subsequently influence the exchange of CO2 between forests and the atmosphere. This connection makes understanding the forest C cycle response to disturbance imperative for climate change research. The goal of this study was to examine the temporal response of soil respiration after differing levels of stand disturbance for 3 years at the Black Rock Forest (southeastern NY, USA; oaks comprise 67 % of the stand). Tree girdling was used to mimic pathogen attack and create the following treatments: control, girdling all non-oaks (NOG), girdling half of the oak trees (O50), and girdling all the oaks (OG). Soil respiratory rates on OG plots declined for 2 years following girdling before attaining a full rebound of belowground activity in the third year. Soil respiration on NOG and O50 were statistically similar to the control for the duration of the study although a trend for a stronger decline in respiration on O50 relative to NOG occurred in the first 2 years. Respiratory responses among the various treatments were not proportional to the degree of disturbance and varied over time. The short-lived respiratory response on O50 and OG suggests that belowground activity is resilient to disturbance; however, sources of the recovered respiratory flux on these plots are likely different than they were pre-treatment. The differential taxon response between oaks and non-oaks suggests that after a defoliation or girdling event, the temporal response of the soil respiratory flux may be related to the C allocation pattern of the affected plant group.","[Levy-Varon, Jennifer H.; Griffin, Kevin L.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Levy-Varon, Jennifer H.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Schuster, William S.

Reciprocal facilitation by associates, often involving multiple species, can be important for the maintenance of the host species. As with other multi-species interactions (e.g. multiple predator effects), non-additive relationships may be common among these associates, yet relatively few studies have examined potential interactions among multiple facilitator species. We combined field surveys and a mesocosm experiment to examine the independent and interactive effects of two co-occurring facilitator species, ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and fiddler crabs Uca pugilator, on their host salt marsh plant species, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. We also experimentally examined how these relationships varied across different host plant genotypes. Overall, facilitator effects increased with increasing facilitator density. There was a significant interaction between mussel and fiddler crab presence, indicating that the effects of each species on cordgrass were dependent on the presence of the other facilitator species. In addition, there were strong interactions among mussels, fiddler crabs, and plant genotype, with greater variation in the performance of individual genotypes when fiddler crabs were absent. Our work reinforces the importance of considering multiple responses when assessing the functional redundancy of co-occurring facilitators, as species are seldom completely redundant across the range of services they provide. It also highlights that the strength and direction of species interactions can vary due to genetic variation within the interacting species.","[Hughes, A.

Our aim was to identify the effect of belowground competition on the morphology and chemical properties of tree fine roots of different order and age. We grew saplings of a fast-growing (Populus trichocarpa) and a relatively slow-growing poplar species (P. tremula) in monoculture (intraspecific competition) and mixture (interspecific competition) in rhizoboxes, enabling the continuous monitoring of root growth, age determination of root segments, and a harvest-based analysis of root orders. Interspecific root competition was highly asymmetric in favor of P. trichocarpa. Species comparison in terms of root traits in four root order classes and eight age classes revealed thinner and longer 1st and 2nd order roots in fast-growing P. trichocarpa, whereas root N concentration was higher in P. tremula despite its much lower fine root productivity. The competition treatment had only a weak effect on fine root morphology. Comparison of the harvest and window observation data revealed considerable root polymorphism in both species (thicker young pioneer roots with low tissue density at the windows vs. thinner fibrous 1st-order roots without window contact in the soil) suggesting a marked alteration of fine root morphology by the presence of observation windows. Our results on the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition suggest that modification in fine root traits plays only a minor role in the plants' belowground competitive strategies. Root polymorphism has to be accounted for when interpreting root window and likely also rhizoscope data of future experiments.","[Hajek, Peter; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hajek, P (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",phajek@gwdg.de,,,Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; Niedersachsisches Vorab,"This study was conducted within the framework of the Cluster of excellence 'Functional Biodiversity Research' and has been funded by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony and the 'Niedersachsisches Vorab'.

Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and similar to 74-87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.","[Gu, Jiacun; Xu, Yang; Wang, Hongfeng; Wang, Zhengquan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jiacun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xueyun] Harbin Univ, Sch Sci, Harbin 150086, Peoples R China","Wang, ZQ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",wzqsilv@mail.nefu.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416906]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100470, 30130160]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitySichuan UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT1054]","This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2012CB416906), the Natural Science Foundation of China (31100470 and 30130160) and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT1054).",,64,37,44,3,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2014,34,4,,,,,415,425,,10.1093/treephys/tpu019,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,AH1PA,WOS:000335892100009,24695727,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Zhu, WZ; Wang, SG; Yu, DZ; Jiang, Y; Li, MH",,,,"Zhu, Wan-Ze; Wang, San-Gen; Yu, De-Zhen; Jiang, Yong; Li, Mai-He",,,Elevational patterns of endogenous hormones and their relation to resprouting ability of Quercus aquifolioides plants on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Alpine treeline; Coppice; Cytokinins (CTK); Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA); Nitrate; Resprouting ability,ABSCISIC-ACID; GROWTH-REGULATORS; APICAL DOMINANCE; POPULUS-TREMULA; TOBACCO PLANTS; CYTOKININS; ROOT; NITRATE; AUXIN; ARABIDOPSIS,"Above- and belowground tissues showed different trends in IAA, CTK and CTK/IAA ratios with elevations, and coppicing changed the levels of endogenous hormones that are related to resprouting ability. Little is known about how plant hormones and nitrate concentrations change in plants with increasing elevations, and whether the alpine treeline formation and the decreased resprouting ability of plants at high elevations are correlated with such changes. We studied tissue hormones and nitrate concentrations in Quercus aquifolioides plants before and after coppicing at 3,000, 3,500 m, and their uppermost distribution of 3,950 m a.s.l. in southwestern China. Concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) significantly increased, but concentrations of cytokinins (CTK) and CTK/IAA ratios decreased in aboveground tissues of intact plants with increasing elevations. The altitude had reverse effects on these parameters in belowground tissue. Coppicing changed the levels of IAA, CTK, and nitrate concentrations, as well as the CTK/IAA ratios, but not their elevational patterns in either stumps or roots. These results imply that the elevational patterns of plant hormones reflect mainly the effects of altitude associated with gradual changes in temperature and radiation condition on hormones along an elevational gradient. Both CTK concentrations and CTK/IAA ratios in stumps were significantly positively correlated with resprouting ability, but in fine roots they were negatively correlated. This indicates that CTK, which is synthesized in the root cap, needs to move from the roots into the stumps to initiate the growth of lateral buds. Our results suggest that for coppice regeneration management practices to be successful, the root system needs to be carefully protected from damage.","[Zhu, Wan-Ze] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Wang, San-Gen] Southwest Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Yu, De-Zhen] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yong; Li, Mai-He] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Li, Mai-He] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Zhu, WZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",wzzhu@imde.ac.cn,"Jiang, Yong/A-2263-2012; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Jiang, Yong/0000-0001-7518-5810; Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841","Knowledge Innovation Priority Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-EW-309]; 12th Five-year Plan of Science and Tech Program of China [2011BAC09B04-02-04]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30872017, 41371076]; State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology [LFSE2013-01]","This study was supported by the Knowledge Innovation Priority Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. KZCX2-EW-309), the 12th Five-year Plan of Science and Tech Program of China (Grant No. 2011BAC09B04-02-04), the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 30872017 and 41371076), and the State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology (Grant No. LFSE2013-01).

The research site, the Upper Sheep Creek catchment in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, is part of a study on the effects of prescribed fire and vegetation removal. Estimates of seasonal ET for the aspen using EC with the turbulent fluxes adjusted to force energy balance closure, a 180-cm TDR soil profile, two 225-cm neutron access tubes, and the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model agreed well with each other. If the two neutron probes were averaged, the RMSD of all approaches over the 6 yr was within 8% of the average. For the sagebrush-grassland, a 120-cm TDR profile underestimated seasonal ET for all years except the year immediately following the prescribed fire, when rooting depth likely had not recovered. A 195-cm neutron probe access tube located within 30 m of the stream underestimated ET for every year except when there was no streamflow, suggesting that lateral flow may have biased the results for this tube. A comparison of the other methods (EC flux adjusted to force energy balance closure, soil water loss measured from a 225-cm neutron access tube, and SHAW model simulation) agreed within 3% during the 6 yr with EC measurements at that site.","[Flerchinger, G.

The ""Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none"" hypothesis asserts that specialists persist because the fitness of a generalist utilizing a particular habitat is lower than that of a specialist adapted to that habitat. Yet, there are many reasons to expect that mutualists will generalize on partners. Plant-soil feedbacks help to structure plant and microbial communities, but how frequently are soil-based symbiotic mutualistic interactions sufficiently specialized to influence species distributions and community composition? To address this question, we quantified realized partner richness and phylogenetic breadth of four wild-grown native legumes (Lupinus bicolor, L. arboreus, Acmispon strigosus and A. heermannii) and performed inoculation trials to test the ability of two hosts (L. bicolor and A. strigosus) to nodulate (fundamental partner richness), benefit from (response specificity), and provide benefit to (effect specificity) 31 Bradyrhizobium genotypes. Results: In the wild, each Lupinus species hosted a broader genetic range of Bradyrhizobium than did either Acmispon species, suggesting that Acmispon species are more specialized. In the greenhouse, however, L. bicolor and A. strigosus did not differ in fundamental association specificity: all inoculated genotypes nodulated both hosts. Nevertheless, A. strigosus exhibited more specificity, i.e., greater variation in its response to, and effect on, Bradyrhizobium genotypes. Lupinus bicolor benefited from a broader range of genotypes but averaged less benefit from each. Both hosts obtained more fitness benefit from symbionts isolated from conspecific hosts; those symbionts in turn gained greater fitness benefit from hosts of the same species from which they were isolated. Conclusions: This study affirmed two important tenets of evolutionary theory. First, as predicted by the Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none hypothesis, specialist A. strigosus obtained greater benefit from its beneficial symbionts than did generalist L. bicolor. Second, as predicted by coevolutionary theory, each test species performed better with partner genotypes isolated from conspecifics. Finally, positive fitness feedback between the tested hosts and symbionts suggests that positive plant-soil feedback could contribute to their patchy distributions in this system.","[Ehinger, Martine; Mohr, Toni J.; Starcevich, Juliana B.; Porter, Stephanie S.; Simms, Ellen L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genom Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Simms, EL (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",esimms@berkeley.edu,"Sachs, Joel/AAB-9348-2019","Sachs, Joel/0000-0002-0221-9247",USA NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0645791]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Barbara Rotz and the Oxford Tract greenhouse staff for their valuable help; Michiel Vos for insights on genetic analysis; and the Bodega Marine Reserve of the U.

However, this phenomenon has received little attention within arid regions and is not well documented in southern Africa. Slow rates of post-disturbance recovery and projected increases in extreme weather events in arid areas mean that windthrow could be more common and have bigger impacts on these ecosystems in the future. This is of concern due to slow rates of post-disturbance recovery in arid systems and projected increases in extreme weather events in these areas. This study investigated the spatial pattern, magnitude and likely causes of windthrown mortality in relation to other forms of mortality in Aloe dichotoma, an iconic arid-adapted arborescent succulent and southern Africa climate change indicator species. Results: We found that windthrown mortality was greatest within the equatorward summer rainfall zone (SRZ) of its distribution (mean = 31%, n = 11), and was derived almost exclusively from the larger adult age class. A logistic modelling exercise indicated that windthrown mortality was strongly associated with greater amounts of warm season (summer) rainfall in the SRZ, higher wind speeds, and leptosols. A statistically significant interaction term between higher summer rainfall and wind speeds further increased the odds of being windthrown. While these results would benefit from improvements in the resolution of wind and substrate data, they do support the hypothesised mechanism for windthrow in A. dichotoma. This involves powerful storm gusts associated with either the current or subsequent rainfall event, heavy convective rainfall, and an associated increase in soil malleability. Shallow rooting depths in gravel-rich soils and an inflexible, top-heavy canopy structure make individuals especially prone to windthrown mortality during storms. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of this previously unrecognised form of mortality in A. dichotoma, especially since it seems to disproportionately affect reproductively mature adult individuals in an infrequently recruiting species. Smaller, more geographically isolated and adult dominated populations in the summer rainfall zone are likely to be more vulnerable to localised extinction due to windthrow events.","[Jack, Samuel Linton; Hoffman, Michael Timm] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Plant Conservat Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Rohde, Rick Frederick] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr African Studies, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Durbach, Ian] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Archibald, Margaret] Univ Cape Town, Dept Math & Appl Math, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa","Hoffman, MT (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Plant Conservat Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",timm.hoffman@uct.ac.za,"Hoffman, Timm/K-4937-2016","Hoffman, Timm/0000-0002-5843-2397; Archibald, Margaret/0000-0001-5635-6733; Durbach, Ian/0000-0003-0769-2153",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under promotion [01 LC 0024A]; Mazda Wildlife Fund; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/K005871/2],"The authors would like to thank Kate Watermeyer, Kathryn Gibbs, Peter Statham and James Puttick for assistance in the field, the Namibian Meteorological Office and South African Weather Service for climate data, and Roger Diamond for useful discussion regarding the geology and lithology of specific populations.

Such effects are critical for predicting long-term changes in plant distribution patterns in these ecosystems. We quantified richness and density of seedlings within 144 plots of 1m(2) located along a topographic gradient in long-unburned (fire protected since 1983) and recently burned (September 2005) savannas in Brazil. These savannas differ in tree density and canopy cover. Sites along the gradient, however, did not differ in species composition prior to the fire. In recently burned savannas we also evaluated the contribution of vegetative reproduction relative to sexual reproduction by quantifying richness and density of root suckers. Finally, we tested seed tolerance to pulses of high temperaturessimilar to those occurring during fires on the soil surface and belowof five dominant savanna tree species. Seedlings were more abundant and diverse in unburned than in burned savannas. Seedling species composition differed among unburned and burned savannas probably reflecting early differences in root: shoot biomass allocation patterns. In recently burned savannas, root suckers were more abundant and diverse than seedlings. Relatively long exposures (>10min) of temperatures of 90 degrees C reduced seed germination in all studied species suggesting a negative effect of fire on germination of seeds located at or aboveground level. Because vegetative reproduction contributes more than sexual reproduction in burned environments, frequent fires are likely to cause major shifts in species composition of Neotropical savanna plant communities, favoring clonally produced recruits along tree density/topographic gradients.","[Salazar, Ana; Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Lab Ecol Func, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Salazar, A (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, 1301 Mem Dr, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",asalparra@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation (U.S.A.)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0322051]; University of Miami (UM) Center for Latin American Studies; UM.

The use of sulphonates as a S source is limited to a functional bacterial guild. However, fungi may assist bacteria in sulphonate desulphurization. In this study, grassland turfs were watered periodically with a modified Hoagland's solution that was i) sulphur free, ii) contained low molecular weight sulphonate iii) or high molecular weight sulphonate. DNA fingerprint analyses of fungal and bacterial communities revealed significant differences between the rhizosphere soil and the bulk soil. Sulphonate treatments had only significant effects on the bacterial and desulphonating bacterial communities and no significant effects on the fungal communities. However, sequencing of the fungal ITS region identified the presence of potentially endophytic fungi in sulphonate amended turfs. Analysis of the sulphur species in soil suggested that the added toluenesulphonate-sulphur was transformed despite the fact that the number of the desulphonating bacteria remained unchanged indicating no sulphonate limitation. The results showcase a robust fungal community in grassland turfs where only the bacterial community with its desulphonating bacterial guild is predominantly responding to the sulphonate amendment.

This predation-based selection could have indirect effects on community biomass and tissue quality, especially given how untasty plants may have higher concentrations of recalcitrant carbon compounds including lignin. We tested small mammal effects on biomass and tissue quality of roots and shoots in a two-year-old 18 ha restored tallgrass prairie with established zones of high and low plant predation. We focused on the three dominant herbaceous functional groups of tallgrass prairie (perennial forbs, C-3 and C-4 grasses), and targeted the early stages of assembly given that plant predation by small animals can unfold quickly and is difficult to subsequently quantify. We predicted rodent predation to create communities with reduced biomass but an increased abundance of lignin-rich plants; we only observed the former. Rodents reduced aboveground biomass by 46% but preferentially targeted lignin-rich plants, with the latter result explained by the predominance of granivory over herbivory - there was no opportunity for selection based on tissue palatability. Based strictly on aboveground biomass, we estimated small mammals reduced standing stocks of recalcitrant carbon by 65 kg ha(-1), with reductions in belowground stocks almost certainly higher given that root:shoot ratios averaged 21:1. Given that the quantity and quality of plant production can affect ecosystem functions including decomposition and the regulation of soil carbon stocks, our work suggests that non-random plant predation may substantially affect rates of soil carbon accumulation in the early stages of grassland development.","[Drystek, Emily; MacDougall, AndrewS.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","MacDougall, A (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",asm@uoguelph.ca,"MacDougall, Andrew/F-2037-2011",,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CFICanada Foundation for Innovation,"Thanks to Rachel Germain, Laura Johnson, Stefan Schneider. and Peter Kelly for assistance with field work and with project logistics.

This study uses morphological characteristics to assess the quality of seedlings of three tree species (Persea americana, Cola acuminata and Dacryodes edulis) in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. The growth characteristics and quality indicators of seedlings produced in two nursery categories were compared-three nurseries collaborating with the tree domestication program implemented by the World Agroforestry Centre (Category 1) and three nurseries collaborating with government and non-governmental projects (Category 2). Seedlings produced in nurseries in the first nursery category were found to be uniform in terms of growth characteristics and quality indicators. In the second category, there were relatively higher seedling proportions having measured parameters out of threshold standards for root to shoot ratio and for sturdiness quotient. Significant differences between nursery categories (at alpha = 0.05) were detected in root collar diameter of C. acuminata and D. edulis and in shoot dry weight of D. edulis. These differences could be attributed to better nursery management as a results of training and technical backstopping received by nursery operators in Category 1. The level of experience of nursery operators in both categories was found to be insufficient and greater exposure to skills and knowledge could enhance the production of high quality seedlings.","[Takoutsing, Bertin; Tchoundjeu, Zacharie; Degrande, Ann; Asaah, Ebenezar; Nkeumoe, Frederick; Tsobeng, Alain] World Agroforestry Ctr, ICRAF West & Cent Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Gyau, Amos] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Nairobi, Kenya","Takoutsing, B (reprint author), World Agroforestry Ctr, ICRAF West & Cent Africa, POB 16317, Yaounde, Cameroon.",b.takoutsing@cgiar.org,"Takoutsing, Bertin/J-8683-2019; Degrande, Ann/V-4464-2019","Takoutsing, Bertin/0000-0002-2822-6453; Degrande, Ann/0000-0001-5376-0300; Numbisi, Frederick Nkeumoe/0000-0003-2603-5677",United State Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),The authors would like to thank the United State Department of Agriculture for funding this research work through the Agricultural and Tree Products Program in the Republic of Cameroon.

Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from root nodules and characterized by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, then submitted to phylogenetic analyses. A total of 67 isolates was obtained, representing the 3 different forest plots, all renodulating A. mearnsii in monoxenic conditions. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all isolates belong to different Bradyrhizobium lineages, according to each of the three locations with little intermixing between forest plots.

Microscopic observations studies revealed that the extraradical mycelium of the fungus showed formation of branched absorbing structures (BAS) in rhizosphere of olive tree. Root colonization with the AM fungi G. intraradices induced significant changes in the bacterial community structure of olive tree rhizosphere compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. The largest proportional increase was found for the fatty acid 10Me18:0, which indicated an increase in the number of actinomycetes in mycorrhizal rhizosphere soil, whereas the PLFAs i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, 16:1 omega 7 and cy17:0 which were used as indicators of bacteria decreased in mycorrhizal treatment compared to non-mycorrhizal control treatment.

This study aimed to investigate: (i) whether fine root biomass and production increased with successional stage and increasing tree species diversity; (ii) how forest type affected seasonal variation and regrowth of fine roots. Sequential coring and ingrowth core methods were used to measure fine root production in four Chinese subtropical forests differing in successional stages and species diversity. Fine root biomass increased from 262 g center dot m(-2) to 626 g center dot m(-2) with increasing successional stage and species diversity. A similar trend was also found for fine root production, which increased from 86 to 114 g center dot m(-2) yr (-1) for Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation to 211-240 g center dot m(-2) yr (-1) for Choerospondias axillaries forest when estimated with sequential coring data. Fine root production calculated using the ingrowth core data ranged from 186 g center dot m(-2) yr (-1) for C. lanceolata plantation to 513 g center dot m(-2) yr (-1) for Lithocarpus glaber - Cyclobalanopsis glauca forest.

There are four strategies that permit plants to become invasive without being limited by a lack of mutualists. One is to not be dependent on mutualists. The other three strategies are to form novel mutualisms, form associations with cosmopolitan species, or co-invade with mutualists from their native range. Historically there has been a bias to study mutualisms from a plant perspective, with little consideration of soil biota as invasive species in their own right. Here we address this by reviewing the literature on belowground invasive mutualists of woody plants. We focus on woody invaders as ecosystem-transforming plants that frequently have a high dependence on belowground mutualists. We found that co-invasions are common, with many ectomycorrhizal plant species and N-fixing species co-invading with their mutualists. Other groups, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, tend to associate with cosmopolitan fungal species or to form novel associations in their exotic range. Only limited evidence exists of direct negative effects of co-invading mutualists on native mutualist communities, and effects on native plants appear to be largely driven by altered environmental conditions rather than direct interactions. Mutualists that introduce novel ecosystem functions have effects greater than would be predicted based solely on their biomass. Focusing on the belowground aspects of plant invasions provides novel insights into the impacts, processes and management of invasions of both soil organisms and woody plant species.","[Nunez, Martin A.] CONICET Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotono, INIBIOMA, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Dickie, Ian A.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand","Nunez, MA (reprint author), CONICET Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotono, INIBIOMA, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",nunezm@gmail.com; ian.dickie@lincoln.ac.nz,"Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Nunez, Martin/0000-0003-0324-5479","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0948930]","We thank the attendees from the workshop on tree invasion (held in Isla Victoria in September 2012); Duane Peltzer, Jeremy Hayward and Romina Dimarco for helpful comments on early versions of the paper; Kabir Peay, Matt McGlone, Simon Fowler, and Jamie Wood for helpful input.

While roots are regarded as the main contributor to SOC formation, relatively little is known about how fine root dynamics respond to landscape-level changes in soil moisture, and thus the mechanisms promoting spatial heterogeneity of SOC remain uncertain. We evaluated SOC, fine root (<= 2 mm) biomass, production, decomposition, and vertical rooting distributions among landscape positions varying in soil moisture within 25+ year old restored tallgrass prairies in Wisconsin, USA. We hypothesized that SOC, root biomass, and root production would increase, while root decomposition would decline with increasing soil moisture. Additionally, we hypothesized that relative root biomass and production distributions would become shallower as soils became wetter. We found no relationship between soil moisture and root biomass, production, or their vertical distributions, but decomposition decreased and SOC increased as expected with increasing soil moisture. However, we also observed a strong relationship between soil moisture and species assemblages, suggesting that community composition changed in response to soil moisture. Our findings indicate that SOC was highest in seasonally wet, lowland landscape positions due to greatly reduced root decomposition, not due to changes in root production or relative distributions. We suggest that species turnover may have reduced the effect of soil moisture on root biomass and production, thereby maintaining similar root production under notably disparate soil moisture conditions. Considering continued interest in monoculture biofuel plantings and their potential to sequester C in roots and soils, additional research is necessary at the landscape scale to elucidate the importance of species spatial heterogeneity on grassland belowground C dynamics.

We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as biomarker to study soil microbial community structure and measured activities of five extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., -1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), chitin (i.e., -1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxidase) as indicators of soil microbial functioning in carbon transformation or turnover across varying biotic and abiotic conditions in a typical temperate forest ecosystem in central China. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the interrelationship between individual PFLAs and biotic and abiotic site factors as well as the linkage between soil microbial structure and function. Path analysis was further conducted to examine the controls of site factors on soil microbial community structure and the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial community structure and function. We found that soil microbial community structure is strongly influenced by water, temperature, SOC, fine root mass, clay content, and C/N ratio in soils and that the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and actinomycetes explained most of the variations in the specific activities of soil enzymes involved in SOC transformation or turnover. The abundance of soil bacterial communities is strongly linked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbon transformation, whereas the abundance of saprophytic fungi is associated with activities of extracellular enzymes driving carbon oxidation. Findings in this study demonstrate the complex interactions and linkage among plant traits, microenvironment, and soil physiochemical properties in affecting SOC via microbial regulations.","[You, Yeming; Wang, Juan; Tang, Zuoxin; Sun, Osbert J.] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [You, Yeming; Wang, Juan; Tang, Zuoxin; Sun, Osbert J.] Beijing Forestry Univ, Inst Forestry & Climate Change Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xueman; Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, China Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Sun, OJ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Inst Forestry & Climate Change Res, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",sunjianx@bjfu.edu.cn,,"Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2011CB403205],This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2011CB403205).,,89,48,56,3,189,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We surveyed AMF abundance and community composition in Centaurea stoebe and Potentilla recta invasions in the western USA to assess whether patterns were consistent with mycorrhizal-mediated invasions. We asked whether (1) AMF abundance and community composition differ between native and exotic forbs, (2) associations between native plants and AMF shift with invading exotic plants, and (3) AMF abundance and/or community composition differ in areas where exotic plants are highly invasive and in areas where they are not. We collected soil and roots from invaded and native forb communities along invasion gradients and in regions with different invasion densities. We used AMF root colonization as a measure of AMF abundance and characterized AMF communities in roots using 454-sequencing of the LSU-rDNA region. All plants were highly colonized (>60%), but exotic forbs tended to be more colonized than natives (P<0.001). We identified 30 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across sites, and community composition was best predicted by abiotic factors (soil texture, pH). Two OTUs in the genera Glomus and Rhizophagus dominated in most communities, and their dominance increased with invasion density (r=0.57, P=0.010), while overall OTU richness decreased with invasion density (r=-0.61, P=0.006). Samples along P.recta invasion gradients revealed small and reciprocal shifts in AMF communities with >45% fungal OTUs shared between neighboring native and P.recta plants. Overall, we observed significant, but modest, differences in AMF colonization and communities between co-occurring exotic and native forbs and among exotic forbs across regions that differ in invasion pressure. While experimental manipulations are required to assess functional consequences, the observed patterns are not consistent with those expected from strong mycorrhizal-mediated invasions.","[Bunn, Rebecca A.; Gallagher, Christopher] Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva; Ramsey, Philip W.] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59802 USA; [Rosendahl, Soren] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Bunn, RA (reprint author), Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll, Dept Environm Sci, ES Bldg 522,516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",rebecca.bunn@wwu.edu,"Rosendahl, Soren/F-4461-2014","Rosendahl, Soren/0000-0001-5202-6585",MPG Ranch; Western Washington University's Research,"MPG Ranch, Western Washington University's Research and Sponsored Programs",,69,15,15,0,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The fate of this C under elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change is still uncertain. A fundamental knowledge gap is the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and saprotrophic fungi contribute to C cycling in the systems by soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. In this study, we used a novel approach to generate and compare enzymatically active EMF hyphae-dominated and saprotrophic hyphae-enriched communities under field conditions. Fermentation-humus (FH)-filled mesh bags, surrounded by a sand barrier, effectively trapped EMF hyphae with a community structure comparable to that found in the surrounding FH layer, at both trophic and taxonomic levels. In contrast, over half the sequences from mesh bags with no sand barrier were identified as belonging to saprotrophic fungi. The EMF hyphae-dominated systems exhibited levels of hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities that were comparable to or higher than saprotroph-enriched systems. The enzymes assayed included those associated with both labile and recalcitrant SOM degradation. Our study shows that EMF hyphae are likely important contributors to current SOM turnover in sub-boreal systems. Our results also suggest that any increased EMF biomass that might result from higher below-ground C allocation by trees would not suppress C fluxes from sub-boreal soils.","[Phillips, Lori A.; Ward, Valerie; Jones, Melanie D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Phillips, Lori A.] Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Biosci Res Div, Bundoora, Vic, Australia","Phillips, LA (reprint author), AgriBioSci Ctr, Dept Environm & Primary Ind, Biosci Res Div, 5 Ring Rd, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",lori.phillips@dpi.vic.gov.au,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This study was funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic Grant.

We applied stable isotope probing of microbial PLFAs and repeated soil sampling in a grassland over a period of 1 year to assess the role of microbial communities in the cycling of rhizodeposit-C. Pulse-labeling with (CO2)-C-13 was performed in a grassland site near Gent (Belgium). Soil samples were taken 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, 9 months and 1 year following labeling and analyzed for C-13 in soil, roots and microbial PLFAs. C enrichment of PLFAs occurred rapidly (within 24 h) but temporally varied across microbial groups. PLFAs indicative for fungi and gram-negative bacteria showed a faster C-13 uptake compared to gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes. However, the relative C-13 concentrations of the latter communities increased after 1 week, while those of fungi decreased and those of gram-negative bacteria remained constant. PLFA C-13 mean residence times were much shorter for fungi compared to bacteria and actinomycetes. Our results indicate temporally varying rhizodeposit-C uptake by different microbial groups, and faster turnover rates of mycorrhizal versus saprotrophic fungi and fungi versus bacteria. Fungi appeared to play a major role in the initial processing and possible rapid channeling of rhizodeposit-C into the soil microbial community. Actinomycetes and gram-positive bacteria appeared to have a delayed utilization of rhizodeposit-C or to prefer other C sources upon rhizodeposition.","[Balasooriya, Wajira K.; Huygens, Dries; Boeckx, Pascal] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Denef, Karolien] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Huygens, Dries] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Inst Agr Engn & Soil Sci, Valdivia, Chile","Denef, K (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Karolien.Denef@Colostate.edu,"Huygens, Dries/A-8395-2008","Huygens, Dries/0000-0003-2423-6926",special research fund (BOF) of Ghent UniversityGhent University,"The authors wish to thank Dries Roobroeck, Davy Loete, Katja Van Nieuland and Jan Vermeulen for assistance with pulse-labeling, sample collection and laboratory analyses.

Climatic extremes are predicted to become more common with global climate change and, as such, may accelerate woody expansion and/or infilling rates. We quantified root biomass and distribution patterns of the invasive woody legume, honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and associated grasses following a long-term rainfall manipulation experiment in a mixed grass savanna in the southern Great Plains (United States). Root systems of mature trees were containerized with vertical barriers installed to a depth of 270 cm, and soil moisture was manipulated with irrigation (Irrigated) or rainout shelters (Rainout). Other treatments included containerized, precipitation-only (Control) and noncontainerized, precipitation-only (Natural) trees. After 4 yr of treatment, soil cores to 270 cm depth were obtained, and mesquite root length density (RLD) and root mass, and grass root mass were quantified. Mesquite in the Rainout treatment increased coarse-root (>2 mm diameter) RLD and root mass at soil depths between 90 cm and 270 cm. In contrast, mesquite in the Irrigated treatment increased fine-root (<2 mm diameter) RLD and root mass between 30 cm and 270 cm depths, but did not increase total root mass (fine+coarse) compared to the Control. Mesquite root-to-shoot mass ratio was 2.8 to 4.6 times greater in Rainout than the other treatments. Leaf water stress was greatest in the Rainout treatment in the first year, but not in subsequent years, possibly the result of increased root growth. Leaf water use efficiency was lowest in the Irrigated treatment. The increase in coarse root growth during extended drought substantially increased mesquite belowground biomass and suggests an important mechanism by which woody plant encroachment into grasslands may alter below ground carbon stocks under climate change scenarios predicted for this region.","[Ansley, R.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of near soil surface characteristics on soil detachment by overland flow in a 7-yr restored natural grassland. Four treatments were designed to characterize the effects of dead roots, live roots, biological soil crusts (BSCs), and plant litter-stems in succession. For comparison, an undisturbed bare Loess soil was used as a baseline. The testing area (1.0 m in length and 0.1 m in width) of each treatment was subjected to flow scouring under five different shear stresses ranging from 6 to 13 Pa. The results showed that near soil surface properties of plant litter-stem, BSCs, and plant roots enhanced the resistance of soil to water detachment significantly. With these factors subsequently superimposed, soil detachment capacity decreased progressively. Taken together, the 7-yr restored natural grassland would decrease soil detachment capacity by 98.9% compared with the bare Loess soil, in which plant litter-stem, BSCs, and total roots contributed to 30.3, 14.9, and 53.7%, respectively. Furthermore, for the total root effects, chemical bonding of root exudates accounted for 14.7% while physical binding of root systems accounted for 39.0%. Results also indicated that BSCs were unable to protect the soil from detachment when the shear stress was greater than 11 Pa, and tended to accelerate soil erosion. This paper developed an equation for adjusting WEPP's rill erodibility for use in natural succession grassland in the Loess Plateau of China, and the result seemed satisfactory with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficients ranging from 0.28 to 0.77. Further studies are needed to detect the dynamics of near soil surface characteristics with succession age of grassland in the Loess Plateau.","[Wang, Bing; Zhang, Guang-Hui; Li, Zhen-Wei] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bing; Zhang, Guang-Hui; Su, Zi-Long; Yi, Ting] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, X.

We grew plants in mesocosms subirrigated with water low in dissolved oxygen, mimicking natural systems, and set depth of ground water at 63 or 100 cm and soil temperature at cold (ambient) or warm (<= 2.7 degrees C above ambient). We hypothesized the moister (63 cm) and warmer soil would be most favorable and predicted faster growth of shoots and roots and greater nitrogen-fixation (thus, less uptake of mineral nitrogen) under those conditions. Growth in height was significantly faster in the moister treatment but was not affected by soil temperature. Final biomass of shoots and of roots, total biomass of plants, and root: shoot ratio indicated a significant effect only from depth of ground water. Final levels of soil mineral-nitrogen were as predicted, with level of nitrate in the moister treatment more than twice that in the drier treatment. No effect from soil temperature on level of soil-mineral nitrogen was detected. Our results suggest that establishment of G. lepidota requires strict conditions of soil moisture, which may explain the patchy distribution of the species along southwestern dryland rivers.","[Andersen, Douglas C.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Nelson, S.

Here, we identified the minimum temperatures for root growth in seven broad-leaved tree species, compared them with the species' natural elevational limits and identified morphological changes in roots produced near their physiological cold limit. Seedlings were exposed to a vertical soil-temperature gradient from 20 to 2 degrees C along the rooting zone for 18 weeks. In all species, the bulk of roots was produced at temperatures above 5 degrees C. However, the absolute minimum temperatures for root growth differed among species between 2.3 and 4.2 degrees C, with those species that reach their natural distribution limits at higher elevations also tending to have lower thermal limits for root tissue formation. In all investigated species, the roots produced at temperatures close to the thermal limit were pale, thick, unbranched and of reduced mechanical strength. Across species, the specific root length (m g(-1) root) was reduced by, on average, 60% at temperatures below 7 degrees C. A significant correlation of minimum temperatures for root growth with the natural high elevation limits of the investigated species indicates species-specific thermal requirements for basic physiological processes. Although these limits are not necessarily directly causative for the upper distribution limit of a species, they seem to belong to a syndrome of adaptive processes for life at low temperatures. The anatomical changes at the cold limit likely hint at the mechanisms impeding meristematic activity at low temperatures.","[Schenker, Gabriela; Lenz, Armando; Koerner, Christian; Hoch, Guenter] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Hoch, G (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",guenter.hoch@unibas.ch,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014; Hoch, Guenter/H-1505-2018","Hoch, Guenter/0000-0003-0985-9746; Lenz, Armando/0000-0001-5888-0846",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [233399],This study was part of the project TREELIM funded by the European Research Council (grant no. 233399 to C.K.).,,38,22,23,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2014,34,3,,,,,302,313,,10.1093/treephys/tpu003,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,AH1OQ,WOS:000335891000009,24584221,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Heinen, M",,,,"Heinen, Marius",,,Compensation in Root Water Uptake Models Combined with Three-Dimensional Root Length Density Distribution,VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HYDRAULIC ARCHITECTURE; INTEGRATED APPROACH; POROUS-MEDIA; ABSORPTION; CONDUCTIVITY; SYSTEMS; SOILS,"Because root water uptake is a considerable component in the soil water balance, a lot of attention has been paid to defining and applying root water uptake models.

Such a comparison is sometimes difficult because the level of information required by the models is different, for example, information on the root length density distribution. Here a three-dimensional root length density distribution function is introduced that makes it possible to compare two empirical uptake models with a more mechanistic uptake model.

Intragenomic variation of this multicopy gene can interfere with accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of biological entities. We investigated the amount and nature of this variation for the lichenized fungus Cora inversa in the Hygrophoraceae (Basidiomycota: Agaricales), analyzing base call and length variation in ITS1 454 pyrosequencing data of three samples of the target mycobiont, for a total of 16,665 reads obtained from three separate repeats of the same samples under different conditions. Using multiple fixed alignment methods (PaPaRa) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis (RAxML), we assessed phylogenetic relationships of the obtained reads, together with Sanger ITS sequences from the same samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all ITS1 reads belonged to a single species, C. inversa. Pyrosequencing data showed 266 insertion sites in addition to the 325 sites expected from Sanger sequences, for a total of 15,654 insertions (0.94 insertions per read). An additional 3,279 substitutions relative to the Sanger sequences were detected in the dataset, out of 5,461,125 bases to be called. Up to 99.3 % of the observed indels in the dataset could be interpreted as 454 pyrosequencing errors, approximately 65 % corresponding to incorrectly recovered homopolymer segments, and 35 % to carry-forward-incomplete-extension errors. Comparison of automated clustering and alignment-based phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that clustering of these reads produced a 35-fold overestimation of biological diversity in the dataset at the 95 % similarity threshold level, whereas phylogenetic analysis using a maximum likelihood approach accurately recovered a single biological entity. We conclude that variation detected in 454 pyrosequencing data must be interpreted with great care and that a combination of a sufficiently large number of reads per taxon, a set of Sanger references for the same taxon, and at least two runs under different emulsion PCR and sequencing conditions, are necessary to reliably separate biological variation from 454 sequencing errors. Our study shows that clustering methods are highly sensitive to artifactual sequence variation and inadequate to properly recover biological diversity in a dataset, if sequencing errors are substantial and not removed prior to clustering analysis.","[Luecking, Robert] Field Museum Nat Hist, Sci & Educ Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Lawrey, James D.; Gillevet, Patrick M.; Sikaroodi, Masoumeh; Dal-Forno, Manuela] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Berger, Simon A.] Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, Sci Comp Grp, Exelixis Lab, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany","Lucking, R (reprint author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Sci & Educ Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 South Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",rlucking@fieldmuseum.org,,"Dal Forno, Manuela/0000-0003-1838-1676",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0841405];  [DEB-0715660],"Financial support for this study was provided by grant DEB 0841405 from the National Science Foundation to George Mason University: ""Phylogenetic Diversity of Mycobionts and Photobionts in the Cyanolichen Genus Dictyonema, with Empasis on the Neotropics and the Galapagos Islands"" (PI J.

We carried out a field seedling transplant experiment to assess not only the direct effects of resources influencing recruitment of four tree species, but also their indirect and combined effects. Our analysis integrated first growing season demographic data together with estimates of mycorrhizal fungal colonization and resource availability (light, soil moisture, and soil nitrogen). Only by considering both the direct and indirect effects of resources we were able to account for most of the variability observed during seedling recruitment. Contrary to expectations, increasing light levels were not always beneficial for recruitment even in low light habitats, and soil moisture availability benefited seedling growth but not survival. In addition, mycorrhizal fungal colonization was not always favored by high light levels or by increasing soil moisture. Seedling survival for all species was lower in plots with higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the association with ectomycorrhizal fungi varied from beneficial to detrimental. When integrating the direct, indirect, and interactive effects of resource availability and mycorrhizal fungal colonization on tree recruitment dynamics we found that species responded in a nonlinear fashion to increasing resource levels, and we also identified thresholds, i.e., shifts in the direction of the response, along the resource gradient. Our integrated assessment considerably outperformed a null model where only direct effects of resources were accounted for. These results illustrate how the combination of direct, indirect, and combined effects of driving variables better represents the complexity of the processes determining tree species recruitment than simple resource availability mechanisms.","[Ibanez, Ines; McCarthy-Neumann, Sarah] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [McCarthy-Neumann, Sarah] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Ibanez, I (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",iibanez@umich.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-EAGER 0947783]; USDA McIntire-Stennis Program [USDA MICY000706],"We are grateful to the GCEL, PEDG, and Kobe lab groups at the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, and to B.

We used a plant-free mesocosm experimental system with two different mycorrhizal substrates containing either Glomus deserticola or Gigaspora gigantea and three Collembola species (Heteromurus nitidus, Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata) to test the hypothesis that Collembola grazing can interfere directly with AMF feeding on the mycorrhizal propagules and/or indirectly changing structure of associated microbial populations. The fatty acid (FA) composition of Collembola grazers and of their mycorrhizal food substrates was assessed. The feeding strategies of H. nitidus and P. fimata varied distinctly between mycorrhizal substrates, whereas the diet of E candida was invariant to the presence of mycorrhizal propagules. The FA marker for G. deserticola (16:1 omega 5) was not detected in Collembola lipids, indicating that this AMF was not consumed. In contrast, H. nitidus and P. fimata comprised the marker for feeding G. gigantea (20:1 omega 9). Both mycorrhizal substrates were no profitable diet for H. nitidus, resulting in a decline of individuals. Collembola grazed on the bacterial and fungal populations in the mycorrhizal substrate, predominantly H. nitidus that even decreased microbial biomass, resulting in significant changes in the composition of the microbial community. In sum, grazing by microarthropods can directly and indirectly modulate AMF performance as well as interactions with microorganisms, which in turn can impose on the soil infection potential from AMF propagules.

With this study we evaluated how differences in soil C availability affect the impact of simulated root exudate inputs on priming. We conducted a 60-day laboratory incubation with soils collected (60 cm depth) from under six switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) cultivars. Differences in specific root length (SRL) among cultivars were expected to result in small differences in soil C inputs and thereby create small differences in the availability of recent labile soil C; whereas soil depth was expected to create large overall differences in soil C availability. Soil cores from under each cultivar (roots removed) were divided into depth increments of 0-10, 20-30, and 40-60 cm and incubated with addition of either: (1) water or (2) C-13-labeled synthetic root exudates (0.7 mg C/g soil). We measured CO2 respiration throughout the experiment. The natural difference in C-13 signature between C-3 soils and C-4 plants was used to quantify cultivar-induced differences in soil C availability. Amendment with C-13-labeled synthetic root-exudate enabled evaluation of SOC priming. Our experiment produced three main results: (1) switchgrass cultivars differentially influenced soil C availability across the soil profile; (2) small differences in soil C availability derived from recent root C inputs did not affect the impact of exudate-C additions on priming; but (3) priming was greater in soils from shallow depths (relatively high total soil C and high ratio of labile-to-stable C) compared to soils from deep depths (relatively low total soil c and low ratio of labile-to-stable C). These findings suggest that the magnitude of the priming effect is affected, in part, by the ratio of root exudate C inputs to total soil C and that the impact of changes in exudate inputs on the priming of SOC is regulated differently in surface soil compared to subsoil.

These interactions contribute a largely to soil autotrophic respiration (R-A), influence soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H) and respond strongly to such climatic changes as temperature and precipitation. The aim of the present study was to explore how variation of temperature and precipitation influence R-A and R-H in global forest ecosystems that are classified by the mycorrhizal type of the dominant plants. The results show slight variation for R-A and significant change for R-H among different mycorrhizal strategy types. In forests with predominating arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) the R-A and R-H are trifling higher than in non-AM type forests. The responses of R-A and R-H to temperature and precipitation were highly variable among different mycorrhizal strategies. For example, the changes of R-A and R-H are more dependent on precipitation than temperature in AM-forest, and temperature accounted more for their variations in forests of the other three mycorrhizal types. As far as we know, this study was the first to evaluate the influence of different mycorrhizal strategies on forest R-A and R-H and their response to temperature and precipitation.","[Shi, Z.

Since aspen (Populus tremuloides) commonly regenerates from root suckers after disturbance; we can take advantage of its ability to sprout by applying salvaged surface soils containing aspen root fragments to reclaim heavily disturbed forest sites where soil surfaces have been displaced by resource extraction. In two studies we investigated the role of root size, root carbohydrate reserves, and the presence of fine roots on the ability of root fragments to initiate and grow suckers from different soil depths. Roots of different diameters were collected from natural aspen stands and buried at three different soil depths (5, 20 and 40 cm). Non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves were determined initially and after the experimental period at the end of August. The initiation of suckers was not affected by soil depth, root size, and the presence of fine roots. Suckers, however, did not emerge from the soil if root fragments were buried at a depth of 40 cm. The largest suckers were found on root fragments that were 2.1-3 cm in diameter. Sucker performance and root fragment survival increased with the initial NSC reserves stored in the root fragments. Insufficient initial NSC supply for suckering resulted in the death of root fragments indicating that there might be a lower threshold of NSC root reserves. The presence of fine roots appear to be a liability, as overall sucker numbers were three times higher in root fragments that had all their fine roots removed compared to root fragments with fine roots attached.

We studied growth, longevity and mortality of fine roots at different levels of frozen soil in winter followed by a delayed soil thawing in spring in a 47-year-old stand of Picea abies (L. Karst.) in the boreal zone. The treatments, repeated over two winters, were: (i) natural insulating snow accumulation and melting (CTRL), (ii) snow removed during winter (OPEN), and (iii) as OPEN in winter but soil thaw delayed by insulation at the top of the forest floor (FROST). Short and long roots were monitored at different depths by minirhizotron imaging at one-month intervals from May to October in the 2 years during and 2 years after the treatments, to assess standing length (SSL), production volume (SPV) and mortality. A survival function estimate was calculated according to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate for interval censored data, and the mean and median root longevities were calculated as with a Kaplan-Meier estimate. CTRL and OPEN did not differ for SSL and SPV but they differed in FROST where compensatory growth occurred in the follow-up seasons. The mean longevity ranged from 276 to 305 days for short roots and from 425 to 464 days for long roots, being higher in OPEN than CTRL and FROST, and higher in the deeper soil layers than near the soil surface. The mean and median longevities were largely the same for short roots but the means were 80-100 days higher for long roots. We conclude that the winters with deep soil freezing are not detrimental for fine roots of Norway spruce, insofar as soil thawing will not prolong the growing season. The longer lifetime in OPEN suggests declining carbon flux into the soil following winters with deeply frozen soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this work we characterized the structure and biological activity of NFs produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 138 under control, salt, and osmotic stress conditions. This strain is the most widely used in Argentine soybean culture; under control conditions, it produces a mixture of four types of NFs (V(C-16:0,MeFuc), V(C-18:1,MeFuc), IV(C-18:1), and V(C-18:1,Ac,MeFuc)).

All mixtures of NFs, extracted from control, salt, and osmotic stress conditions, showed biological activity in soybean plants, such as root hair deformation, and the radical application of purified NFs induced systemic differences in dry matter accumulation. The inoculation of soybean with genistein-induced bacteria cultured under both control and stress conditions had a positive effect on the number of nodules formed and in some cases on dry matter accumulation.

Soil temperature, moisture, fine root biomass, amounts of soil organic C and litterfall biomass were also measured. We found that immediately following thinning treatments, soil respiration increased by 8 %-21 % compared with the unthinned control plots during both growing seasons. Thinning significantly affected soil respiration and soil temperature with different thinning intensities, while there were no significant differences in soil moisture among the various treatments. During the growing seasons, the soil respiration rates were positively correlated with the soil moisture: the 19.4 %-54.0 % variation in soil respiration rates in the four thinning regimes are explained by the changes in soil moisture. Meanwhile, a positive correlation was found between soil temperature and soil respiration rates at all sites. The best fitting model with temperature and moisture explained 44.3 % of the variation in soil respiration in the high thinning treatment, 27.6 % in the light thinning treatment, 18.6 % in medium thinning and in the control sites during the measuring periods. Overall, soil respiration is better predicted by soil moisture, soil organic C, live fine root biomass and soil temperature when data are pooled for all thinning treatments over the two growing seasons. The best regression model explained 74.7 % of the total variation in soil respiration over the different thinning intensities for the two sampling periods.","[Cheng, Xiaoqin; Han, Hairong; Kang, Fengfeng; Liu, Ke; Song, Yali; Zhou, Bin; Li, Yong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Han, HR (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Shuangqing Rd 35,POB 372, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",forest_china@126.com,,,National Forestry Public Welfare Professional Scientific Research [201104008]; National Bureau of Forestry 948 project [2010-4-15]; CFERN GENE,"This project was supported by the National Forestry Public Welfare Professional Scientific Research project (no. 201104008), the National Bureau of Forestry 948 project (no. 2010-4-15) and CFERN & GENE Award Funds on Ecological Paper.

The historically and most commonly used method for measurement of EE-GRSP as total protein has been the Bradford assay. After some troubles/inconsistencies with this method, we carefully analyzed the Bradford assay, measuring a dilution series of the EE-GRSP fraction and analyzing the time stability of the product. In addition, we did similar analysis of another colorimetric method that quantifies total protein, the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Unexpectedly, we found that the EE-GRSP concentration values determined by Bradford assay were dependent and variable with the dilution level of the soil extract; moreover, the Bradford assay shows a great instability with the time when soil samples were analyzed but not when protein solution as bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as control. On the contrary, the BCA assay was independent of the dilution levels of the soil extract and showed stability in the time either for soil samples or BSA protein quantification. These results were consistent and independent on the different type of soils corresponding to different locations and with different textures.","[Reyna, Dalila L.; Wall, Luis G.] Univ Nacl Quilmes, Dept Ciencia & Tecnol, LBMIBS, Bernal, Argentina","Wall, LG (reprint author), Univ Nacl Quilmes, Dept Ciencia & Tecnol, LBMIBS, R Saenz Pena 352,B1876BXD, Bernal, Argentina.",dalila.reyna@gmail.com; lgwall@unq.edu.ar,,,"Argentine Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation [ANPCyT-PAE-36976 PID53]; ANPCyTANPCyT; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","The authors are members of the BIOSPAS consortium (http://www.biospas.org/en) whose work is supported in part by the Argentine Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Grant ANPCyT-PAE-36976 PID53).

Dynamic ecological responses complicate projecting how global change disturbances will influence ecosystem processes, such as carbon (C) storage. We developed an ecosystem-scale model (Stoichiometrically Coupled, Acclimating Microbe-Plant-Soil model, SCAMPS) that simulates the dynamic feedbacks between aboveground and belowground communities that affect their shared soil environment. The belowground component of the model includes three classes of soil organic matter (SOM), three microbially synthesized extracellular enzyme classes specific to these SOM pools, and a microbial biomass pool with a variable C-to-N ratio (C:N). The plant biomass, which contributes to the SOM pools, flexibly allocates growth toward wood, root, and leaf biomass, based on nitrogen (N) uptake and shoot-to-root ratio. Unlike traditional ecosystem models, the microbial community can acclimate to changing soil resources by shifting its C:N between a lower C:N, faster turnover (bacteria-like) community, and a higher C:N, slower turnover (fungal-like) community. This stoichiometric flexibility allows for the microbial C and N use efficiency to vary, feeding back into system decomposition and productivity dynamics. These feedbacks regulate changes in extracellular enzyme synthesis, soil pool turnover rates, plant growth, and ecosystem C storage. We used SCAMPS to test the interactive effects of winter, summer, and year-round soil warming, in combination with microbial acclimation ability, on decomposition dynamics and plant growth in a tundra system. Over 50-year simulations, both the seasonality of warming and the ability of the microbial community to acclimate had strong effects on ecosystem C dynamics. Across all scenarios, warming increased plant biomass (and therefore litter inputs to the SOM), while the ability of the microbial community to acclimate increased soil C loss. Winter warming drove the largest ecosystem C losses when the microbial community could acclimate, and the largest ecosystem C gains when it could not acclimate. Similar to empirical studies of tundra warming, modeled summer warming had relatively negligible effects on soil C loss, regardless of acclimation ability. In contrast, winter and year-round warming drove marked soil C loss when decomposers could acclimate, despite also increasing plant biomass. These results suggest that incorporating dynamically interacting microbial and plant communities into ecosystem models might increase the ability to link ongoing global change field observations with macro-scale projections of ecosystem biogeochemical cycling in systems under change.","[Sistla, Seeta A.; Schimel, Joshua P.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rastetter, Edward B.] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Sistla, SA (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",sistla@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,"Rastetter, Edward/0000-0002-8620-5431",DOE Global Change Education Program Graduate Fellowship; NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; UCSB EEMB Block Grant; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919049]; Arctic LTER Project [NSF-1026843],"We thank B.

However, how these two factors interactively affect plant invasions has rarely been tested. Here, we examined the response of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. to above- and below-ground enemies at varying plant densities in a greenhouse experiment in Wuhan, China. We found that both above- and below-ground enemies decreased the plant total and root mass at individual and population levels, but that of the two, below-ground enemies had a greater effect than above-ground enemies, and that the two guilds of enemies acted additively on the plant. However, their impacts decreased as the plant density increased, due to enhanced plant tolerance to both guilds of enemies. The increased plant tolerance may result from changes in plant resource allocation patterns, corresponding to a positive linear relationship between the ratio of fine root mass to total root mass and plant density. Given that forming dense monocultures in their new ranges is one of the most important characteristics of invasive plants, we propose that the high compensatory ability at dense monocultures may be an important mechanism underlying exotic species invasion.","[He, Minyan; Ding, Jianqing; Lu, Xinmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan Bot Inst, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Lu, XM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan Bot Inst, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lxm3412@gmail.com,"Ding, Jianqing/C-2751-2009",,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100302, 31370547]","The authors would like to thank Hui Wei, Xu Shao, Jingzhong Lu, Xuefang Yang, and Baoliang Tian for their field and laboratory assistance.

Water use is controlled by available energy (AE) and its partitioning between latent (E) and sensible (H) heat fluxes. We hypothesized that the partitioning of AE depends on soil depth, with greater depth leading to more E and less H. We compared energy fluxes of a deep soil savanna with -50% woody cover dominated by Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) and a shallow soil woodland dominated by live oak (Quercus virginiana) and juniper over a 5-year period, which included periods of unusually high rainfall and severe drought. Although AE was 7% higher in the woodland, E was about 2% higher at the savanna over the 5-year study. Site differences in evapotranspiration were maximal during dry periods between rainfall events, suggesting greater storage of water at the savanna site. During periods of high rainfall, the impact of water storage limitations was minimal, and site differences in evapotranspiration were controlled mainly by AE and its partitioning into H. Both sites were characterized by rapid reductions in E and reciprocal increases in H during drying cycles following rainfall, indicating that neither of these ecosystems had access to easily utilized sources of deep water.

We tested for an allelopathic effect of an introduced crucifer, Raphanus sativus, on a common neighboring legume, Lupinus nanus, on the legume's rhizobium affiliates, and on the broader soil community. In both field observations and a greenhouse experiment, we found that R. sativus decreased the density of nodules on L. nanus roots. However, in the greenhouse experiment, R. sativus soils only decreased the density of small, likely non-beneficial rhizobium nodules. In the same experiment, R. sativus soils decreased fungivorous nematode abundance, though there was no effect of R. sativus introduction on fungal density. In the greenhouse experiment, R. sativus soils had a net positive effect on L. nanus biomass. One explanation of this effect is that R. sativus introduction might alter the mutualistic/parasitic relationship between L. nanus and its rhizobial associates with a net benefit to L. nanus. Our results suggest that introduced brassicas can quickly alter belowground communities, but that the net effect of this on neighboring plants is not necessarily negative.","[Pearse, Ian S.; Tsang, Alia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pearse, Ian S.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Bastow, Justin L.] Eastern Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Cheney, WA 99004 USA","Pearse, IS (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ispearse@ucdavis.edu,,"Tsang, Alia/0000-0001-8654-2473",National Science Foundation-Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We would like to thank Jackie Sones and the Bodega Marine Reserve for help in the field as well as University of California, Davis greenhouse staff for greenhouse support.

Seedling inoculation would not be essential for reforestation practices. Polylepis forests are one of the most endangered high mountain ecosystems of South America and reforestation with native Polylepis species has been recommended. To determine whether native soil inoculation could help in reforestation success, a field trial was set up to evaluate the response of outplanted P. australis seedlings to the inoculation with soils from three vegetation types (a grassland, a mature forest and a degraded forest) and a sterile soil, used as control. We evaluated seedlings performance: growth and survival for 18 months, root/shoot ratio, phosphorous content and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization. To interpret performance patterns we evaluated the colonization potential of the three inoculum soils and the changes of the AMF community composition of the seedlings rhizosphere in relation to inoculation treatment and season. Our main results showed no significant differences in seedlings survival and growth between treatments. The colonization potential of grassland and degraded forest soils was similar to 25 times greater than mature forest soil and specific spore density of some morphospecies varied with season. However, AMF spore community of seedlings rhizosphere became homogenized after outplanting and was similar between treatments after 12 months. Therefore, we conclude that soil inoculation is not essential for outplanted P. australis survival and increase in height, and thus all the tested soils could be used as inocula, including grassland soils which in practice are the easiest to collect.","[Soteras, Florencia; Becerra, Alejandra G.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Lab Micol, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Renison, Daniel] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Ctr Ecol & Recursos Nat Renovables Dr Ricardo Lut, Inst Invest Biol & Tecnol, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Soteras, F (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Lab Micol, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",fsoteras@conicet.gov.ar,,"Soteras, Florencia/0000-0003-2189-8529; Becerra, Alejandra Gabriela/0000-0002-9055-5223",Agencia de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica-PICT [438-2008]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas-PIPConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [0269]; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (SECyT-UNC)Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT); CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This work was financially supported by Agencia de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica-PICT 438-2008, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas-PIP 0269 and Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica de la Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (SECyT-UNC).

Fine roots (diameter 0.5-2 mm) exhibited significantly higher lignin concentrations, but lower cellulose concentrations than medium or coarse roots (diameter > 5 mm). The cellulose and lignin concentrations of the roots as well as their lignin:cellulose ratios did not differ significantly among soil depths. In the Douglas fir, there was a tendency of decreasing N concentrations and increasing lignin:N ratios with increasing soil depth. This trend was absent or less pronounced in the beech. Beech roots displayed significantly higher cellulose and N concentrations and lower lignin:cellulose and lignin:N ratios than roots of the Douglas fir. Generally, the lignin concentrations of the roots did not differ between the tree species. Cellulose and lignin concentrations exhibited a significantly negative correlation. As several studies have demonstrated that plant litter decomposition is governed by the lignin:cellulose and lignin:N ratios more than by the lignin concentration of the detritus, the fraction of individual tree species in the stand composition might affect the decomposability of roots in beech-Douglas fir forests, and might also have an influence on soil carbon sequestration.","[Thomas, Frank M.; Molitor, Florian; Werner, Willy] Univ Trier, Fac Reg & Environm Sci, D-54296 Trier, Germany","Thomas, FM (reprint author), Univ Trier, Fac Reg & Environm Sci, Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",thomasf@uni-trier.de,"Thomas, Frank/H-8418-2019",,"European Union, INTERREG IVB North-West Europe [003A ForeStClim]","We thank FAWF (Research Institute for Forest Ecology and Forestry of Rhineland-Palatinate) for support in excavating the soil trenches.

They have simple morphologies and small genomes, occupy contrasting, well-identified ecological niches and tend to have short generation times, and many are amenable to experimental approaches. Fungi also display diverse lifestyles, from saprotrophs to pathogens or mutualists, and they play extremely important roles in both ecosystems and human activities, as wood decayers, mycorrhizal fungi, lichens, endophytes, plant and animal pathogens, and in fermentation or drug production. We review here recent insights into the patterns and mechanisms of adaptive divergence in fungi, including sources of divergence, genomic variation and, ultimately, speciation. We outline the various ecological sources of divergent selection and genomic changes, showing that gene loss and changes in gene expression and in genomic architecture are important adaptation processes, in addition to the more widely recognized processes of amino acid substitution and gene duplication. We also review recent findings regarding the interspecific acquisition of genomic variation and suggesting an important role for introgression, hybridization and horizontal gene transfers (HGTs). We show that transposable elements can mediate several of these genomic changes, thus constituting important factors for adaptation. Finally, we review the consequences of divergent selection in terms of speciation, arguing that genetic incompatibilities may not be as widespread as generally thought and that pleiotropy between adaptation and reproductive isolation is an important route of speciation in fungal pathogens.","[Gladieux, Pierre; Ropars, Jeanne; Badouin, Helene; Branca, Antoine; De La Vega, Ricardo C.

We investigated three root diameter classes for each stand, which consisted of fine (< 1 mm), medium (1-3 mm), and coarse (> 3 mm) roots. Our main findings were as follows. (1) All diameter classes of root intersects increased significantly with stand age (P < 0.01). However, the proportion of the three diameter classes in the total roots remained about the same, regardless of stand age. (2) Root intersects decreased significantly with soil depth (P < 0.001). (3) There were no significant differences in root intersects with distance from the trunk (P > 0.05) in this dense planting pattern. These root distribution patterns may enhance our understanding of the dense jujube plantation belowground root ecology and provide a basis for jujube plantation management practices in this semiarid hilly region.","[Ma, Li-hui; Wu, Pu-te] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ma, Li-hui; Wu, Pu-te] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ma, Li-hui; Wu, Pu-te] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xing] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wu, PT (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",malihui@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Wu, Pute/0000-0002-4682-6145",National Project of Science and Technology Supporting Program [2011BAD29B04]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200343],"We thank Mr. Sen Xiao, Mrs. Junhuang Lu, and Mrs. Xia Zhao for their help with sampling in the trench excavation.

They are thought to mostly grow vegetatively, a trait assumed to limit adaptability. However, AMF can also harbor genetically different nuclei (nucleotypes). It has been shown that one AMF can produce genotypically novel offspring with proportions of different nucleotypes. We hypothesized that (1) AMF respond rapidly to a change of environment (plant host) through changes in the frequency of nucleotypes; (2) genotypically novel offspring exhibit different genetic responses to environmental change than the parent; and (3) genotypically novel offspring exhibit a wide range of phenotypic plasticity to a change of environment. We subjected AMF parents and offspring to a host shift. We observed rapid and large genotypic changes in all AMF lines that were not random. Genotypic and phenotypic responses were different among offspring and their parents. Even though growing vegetatively, AMF offspring display a broad range of genotypic and phenotypic changes in response to host shift. We conclude that AMF have the ability to rapidly produce variable progeny, increasing their probability to produce offspring with different fitness than their parents and, consequently, their potential adaptability to new environmental conditions. Such genotypic and phenotypic flexibility could be a fast alternative to sexual reproduction and is likely to be a key to the ecological success of AMF.","[Angelard, Caroline; Masclaux, Frederic; Sanders, Ian R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Tanner, Colby J.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Fontanillas, Pierre] Broad Inst MIT & Harvard, Cambridge, MA USA; [Niculita-Hirzel, Helene] Univ Lausanne & Geneva, Inst Work & Hlth, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Masclaux, Frederic] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Vital IT Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Ian.Sanders@unil.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; Niculita-Hirzel, Helene/I-8741-2012","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Niculita-Hirzel, Helene/0000-0003-1467-8819",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [310030B_144079/1],"We thank M Bucher (University of Cologne) and G Becard (University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse) for supplying roots and Jeremy Bonvin for help with DNA extraction and molecular analyses.

Furthermore, shifting the composition of AMF communities has demonstrated consequences for the provision of symbiotic benefits to the host as well as for the qualities of ecosystem services. Therefore, here we addressed the nature and strength of interactions between three different AMF species in all possible two-species combinations on a gradient of inoculation densities. Fungal communities were established in pots with Medicago truncatula plants, and their composition was assessed with taxon-specific real-time PCR markers. Nature of interactions between the fungi was varying from competition to facilitation and was influenced by both the identity and relative abundance of the coinoculated fungi. Plants coinoculated with Claroideoglomus and Rhizophagus grew bigger and contained more phosphorus than with any of these two fungi separately, although these fungi obviously competed for root colonization. On the other hand, plants coinoculated with Gigaspora and Rhizophagus, which facilitated each other's root colonization, grew smaller than with any of these fungi separately. Our results point to as yet little understood complexity of interactions in plant-associated symbiotic fungal communities, which, depending on their composition, can induce significant changes in plant host growth and/or phosphorus acquisition in either direction.","[Thonar, Cecile; Frossard, Emmanuel; Jansa, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland; [Thonar, Cecile] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland; [Smilauer, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Jansa, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Microbiol, CR-14220 Prague, Czech Republic","Jansa, J (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Eschikon 33, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland.",jansa@biomed.cas.cz,"Smilauer, Petr/N-8313-2019; Jansa, Jan/H-3161-2014; Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016","Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Jansa, Jan/0000-0002-0331-1774; Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Thonar, Cecile/0000-0002-1806-688X","ETH ZurichETH Zurich [TH 14/05-3]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504121665]; Ministry of Education, Youth and SportsMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LK11224]; long-term development programme [RVO 61388971]; project GAJU [04-142/2010/P]","We thank Yoram Kapulnik and Bernhard Schmid for their advice on the experimental design and Irena Jansova, Thomas Flura, Ariane Keller, Jasmina Hugi and Mounir El M'hamdi for their invaluable technical support during the harvest and the plant and AMF analyses.

Here we present the delta N-15 of plant and soil in four remote typical tropical rainforests (one primary and three secondary) of southern China. We aimed to examine if (1) foliar delta N-15 in the study forests is negative, as observed in other tropical and subtropical sites in eastern Asia; (2) variation in delta N-15 among different species is smaller compared to that in many N-limited temperate and boreal ecosystems; and (3) the primary forest is more N rich than the younger secondary forests and therefore is more N-15 enriched. Our results show that foliar delta N-15 ranged from -5.1 to 1.3 aEuro degrees for 39 collected plant species with different growth strategies and mycorrhizal types, and that for 35 species it was negative. Soil NO3 (-) had low delta N-15 (-11.4 to -3.2 aEuro degrees) and plant NO3 (-) uptake could not explain the negative foliar delta N-15 values (NH4 (+) was dominant in the soil inorganic-N fraction). We suggest that negative values might be caused by isotope fractionation during soil NH4 (+) uptake and mycorrhizal N transfer, and by direct uptake of atmospheric NH3/NH4 (+). The variation in foliar delta N-15 among species (by about 6 aEuro degrees) was smaller than in many N-limited ecosystems, which is typically about or over 10 aEuro degrees. The primary forest had a larger N capital in plants than the secondary forests. Foliar delta N-15 and the enrichment factor (foliar delta N-15 minus soil delta N-15) were higher in the primary forest than in the secondary forests, albeit differences were small, while there was no consistent pattern in soil delta N-15 between primary and secondary forests.","[Wang, Ang; Chen, De-Xiang; Li, Yi-De; Luo, Tu-Shou] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yun-Ting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Koba, Keisuke; Makabe, Akiko; Yoh, Muneoki] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Chen, DX (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fangyt@iae.ac.cn; dexiangchen@126.com,"Yoh, Muneoki/C-2047-2013; Koba, Keisuke/A-3699-2012; Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012","Koba, Keisuke/0000-0003-1942-9811; Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X; WANG, ANG/0000-0002-9365-2926","Special Research Program for Public-Welfare Forestry [201104009-06]; Program to Create an Independent Research Environment for Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; NEXT Program from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [GS008]; State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology, Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS [Y1SRC111J6]; Special Research Program of the Research Institute for Tropical Forestry, CAF [RITFYWZX2011-02]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41171040]; CFERN; GENE;  [21310008]","This study was jointly supported by the Special Research Program for Public-Welfare Forestry (no. 201104009-06), Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (21310008), the Program to Create an Independent Research Environment for Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and the NEXT Program (GS008) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology, Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS (no.

In northwest China, soil water is usually a limiting factor for the development of forest plantations. This study aims to examine the effects of irrigation intensity on soil respiration from three poplar clone plantations in this arid area. The experiment included three poplar clones subjected to three irrigation intensities (without, low and high). Soil respiration was measured using a Li-6400-09 chamber during the growing season in 2007. Mean soil respiration rates were 2.92, 4.74 and 3.49 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for control, low and high irrigation treatments, respectively. Soil respiration decreased once soil water content was below a lower (14.8 %) or above an upper (26.2 %) threshold. When soil water content ranged from 14.8 % to 26.2 %, soil respiration increased and correlated with soil temperature. Fine root also played a role in the significant differences in soil CO2 efflux among the three treatments. Furthermore, the three poplar hybrid clones responded differently to irrigation regarding fine root production and soil CO2 efflux. Irrigation intensity had a strong impact on soil respiration of the three poplar clone plantations, which was mainly because fine root biomass and microbial activities were greatly influenced by soil water conditions. Our results suggest that irrigation management is a main factor controlling soil carbon dynamics in forest plantation in arid regions.","[Yan, Meifang] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Yan, Meifang; Zhou, Guangsheng; Zhang, Xinshi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Yan, MF (reprint author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 79 Yingzexi St, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China.",mfyan2010@aliyun.com,,,Scientific Research Foundation of Taiyuan University of Technology; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China,"This work was jointly supported by the Scientific Research Foundation of Taiyuan University of Technology, and the Natural Science Foundation of China.",,35,8,9,1,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2014,375,2-Jan,,,,,89,97,,10.1007/s11104-013-1944-1,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,AA6JL,WOS:000331204500007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhen, LN; Yang, GW; Yang, HJ; Chen, YL; Liu, N; Zhang, YJ",,,,"Zhen, Lina; Yang, Gaowen; Yang, Haijun; Chen, Yongliang; Liu, Nan; Zhang, Yingjun",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi affect seedling recruitment: a potential mechanism by which N deposition favors the dominance of grasses over forbs,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; N deposition; Non-N-2-fixing forb; Plant functional group; Revegetation,PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NITROGEN ENRICHMENT; INNER-MONGOLIA; DIVERSITY; GRASSLAND; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; NETWORKS; ALLOCATION; PRAIRIE,"Nitrogen (N) deposition usually alters plant community structure and reduces plant biodiversity in grasslands. Seedling recruitment is essential for maintaining species richness and determines plant community composition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread symbiotic fungi and could facilitate seedling establishment. Here we conducted an experiment to address whether the influence of AMF on seedling recruitment depends on N addition and plant species. Leymus chinensis were cultivated for 5 months in the microcosms that were inoculated with or without AMF at five N addition rates. Seeds of three main species (two C-3 grasses and one non-N-2-fixing forb) of the Eurasian steppe were sown to the 5-month-old microcosms. Seedling establishment was estimated by shoot biomass, N and P contents 7 weeks after seedling germination. AMF promoted seedlings recruitment of two C-3 grasses at addition rates above 0.5 g N m(-2). In contrast, seedling recruitment of the non-N-2-fixing forb was increased by AMF at addition rates below 0.5 g N m(-2) but was decreased above 2.5 g N m(-2). These results partly explain why N addition favored the dominance of grasses over forbs in perennial grassland communities. Our study indicates that AMF have the potential to influence plant community composition by mediating revegetation in the face of N deposition.","[Zhen, Lina; Yang, Gaowen; Liu, Nan; Zhang, Yingjun] China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Lina] Shanxi Datong Univ, Coll Life Sci, Datong 037009, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yongliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China","Zhang, YJ (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",zhangyj@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Gaowen/B-5073-2010; Zhang, Yingjun/A-2400-2015; Yang, Gaowen/P-7854-2019; Yang, Haijun/E-7186-2012","Yang, Gaowen/0000-0001-5154-011X; Yang, Haijun/0000-0002-9596-4907; Zhang, Yingjun/0000-0001-5776-4392",earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS-35]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270375],We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

In the present study, a field trial was established to examine the effects of 6 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization on the community structure of AMF both in soils and plant roots in a typical temperate steppe in Inner Mongolia, northern China. The AMF small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes were subjected to PCR, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. A total of 1554 sequenced SSU rRNA clones, including 919 clones from the soil and 635 clones from the roots, were analyzed. The 31 AMF sequence types belonging to Glomeromycota were identified: 17 to Glomus group A and 14 to Glomus group B. The experimental results indicated that N fertilization significantly altered the AMF communities in both soils and mixed roots but had no obvious influence on AMF abundance. However, P fertilization showed no significant influence on the AMF community structure, but induced a significant decrease in mycorrhizal colonization rate, arbuscule colonization and hyphal length density. Furthermore, N and P application showed significant interactions in affecting AMF species compositions in soils but not in roots. Generally the AMF diversity in the soil was higher than that in the roots. The study suggested that N fertilization predominantly altered AMF species composition, while P fertilization influenced AMF abundance in this steppe. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The four WLF treatments (designated as 0cm, 60cm, 60 +/- 30cm, and 60 +/- 60cm) were initiated with the minimum water levels (0, 60, 30, and 0cm, respectively) for a week and then switched to the maximal water levels (0, 60, 90, and 120cm, respectively) one week later. This cycle was repeated six times during 12 weeks. Relative growth rate (RGR), biomass allocation, shoot and below-ground morphology, chlorophyll content, and concentrations of proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), and soluble sugar (SS) of A. calamus were measured. After the 12 weeks' WLF treatment, growth rate differed among the treatments. RGR was negative in the 60cm treatment. A. calamus showed significant morphological adaptations to WLFs, including different patterns in length, blade length, width and numbers of shoots. The root:shoot ratio was significantly greater in the 0cm treatment with no significant differences among the other three WLF treatments. SS concentrations in the rhizome and root were higher in the 60 +/- 60cm treatment than in either the 60cm treatment or 60 +/- 30cm treatment. No clear relationship was found among the treatments for chlorophyll concentrations, proline, or MDA concentrations in the shoots but fluctuating water levels significantly stimulated proline and MDA accumulation. The differences in biomass and morphological variables among treatments suggested that WLF is an important regulator of the growth of A. calamus and that the species is better adapted to cyclic WLFs than to constant deep water.","[Wei, Hua; He, Feng; Liang, Wei; Wu, Zhenbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Wei, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Shuiping] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Yangtze River Water Environm, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Cheng, SP (reprint author), Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Yangtze River Water Environm, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",shpcheng@tongji.edu.cn,,,"Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2009ZX07106-003, 2011ZX07303-001]","This work was supported by Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [grant number 2009ZX07106-003], [grant number 2011ZX07303-001].",,45,6,7,0,48,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

A total of 19 experimental sites were established, 12 in balsam fir ecosystems and 7 in black spruce ecosystems. Diameter at breast height (dbh), height growth rate, and C contents in trees, understory species, downed logs, litter, and soil organic and mineral layers did not differ significantly between northern and southern experimental sites (P < 0.05). The only C pool that differed significantly among the regions was fine roots. Tree ring data collected on trees greater than 5 cm in dbh at all the sites were related to monthly climatic data between April and October, the active physiological season at the latitudes of the study. The relationships derived indicated that the differential effects of significant climatic variables along the climatic gradient were more important for black spruce than balsam fir. These results suggest that the changes in climatic conditions in the next 100 y may have a relatively small effect on the productivity and C allocation of both forest types when located within a range of climatic conditions similar to those of this study.","[Larocque, Guy R.; Pare, David] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn Ste Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Sarr, Lamine] ADL, Dakar Yoff, Senegal; [Ansseau, Colette] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada","Larocque, GR (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn Ste Foy, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",Guy.Larocque@NRCan.gc.ca,,"Pare, David/0000-0003-0177-6428",PERD program of the Office of Energy Research and Development of Natural Resources Canada (Enhancement of Greenhouse Gas Sinks)Natural Resources Canada [POL 6.2.1],"Sincere thanks are extended to L.

Touch is the signal most studied and the modifications of root structure used to either avoid or move across obstacles in the soil are described. Touch signals are sensed by the root cap and give rise to rapid changes in cytosolic calcium. Touch also modifies the columella cells reducing responses to gravity. The sensory system in the columella is reconstructed and represents a likely assessment of future potential signalling. Gradients of water are again sensed by the root cap, but a different transduction sequence is initiated to redirect growth. Again, the starch-containing columella cells acting as statoliths are degraded. Humidity gradients may use abscisic acid and not auxin to help manipulate growth. Roots are also sensitive to light and grow away from unilateral light. There are many other signals to which roots respond and most have never been investigated for their communication and growth-modifying character. Roots can respond in many different ways to signals and these are indicated. Darwin's 'root brain' is briefly described; he was fascinated by the way the tip responds to touch and gravity. Finally, the dispute concerning root regeneration between Darwin and Sachs was resolved by careful experiments removing defined portions of the root tip. Most surprisingly, three new root meristems can be regenerated if just the dividing cells in the meristem are removed. These experiments have consequences for supposed stem cells in the root meristems.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland","Trewavas, A (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"198 MADISON AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",,,978-0-19-178829-1; 978-0-19-953954-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,150,158,,,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539543.001.0001,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BC6HF,WOS:000353917800017,,,,,10/31/19S,"Biate, DL; Kumar, LV; Ramadoss, D; Kumari, A; Naik, S; Reddy, KK; Annapurna, K",,"Maheshwari, DK",,"Biate, David L.; Kumar, Lakkineni Vithal; Ramadoss, D.; Kumari, Annu; Naik, Satish; Reddy, Kiran K.; Annapurna, Kannepalli",,,Genetic Diversity of Soybean Root Nodulating Bacteria,BACTERIAL DIVERSITY IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE,Sustainable Development and Biodiversity,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,GLYCINE-MAX L.; MULTILOCUS SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; FAST-GROWING RHIZOBIA; SYMBIOTIC NODULE DEVELOPMENT; DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; SP-NOV.; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; RECEPTOR-KINASE; SINORHIZOBIUM-FREDII,"Soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), is a summer annual herb grown extensively in China, Argentina, Brazil and USA. It was thought to be very selective for its symbiotic partner. Earlier, only Bradyrhizobium japonicum was reported to nodulate soybean. It now is reported to be nodulated by a number of rhizobial genera and species; Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium. Sinorhizobial species (fredii) nodulating soybean shows broad host range, where as the slow growing Bradyrhizobium is more selective. Slow growing B. japonicum, B. elkanii, B. liaoningense and B. yuanmingense are more effective nodulaters of soybean. Fast growers Rhizobium tropici, Rhizobium sp., Rhizobium oryzae and Mesorhizobium tianshanense have also been reported to form nodules on soybean. A large genetic diversity exists within the slow growing Bradyrhizobium isolates nodulating soybean. Due to the ecological and economic importance, the Bradyrhizobia species and their diversity have been extensively investigated in the last few years. The diversity and the size of indigenous population in soil can vary with the presence of the host legume and the history of the land use pattern at the sampling site. This review focuses on the genetic diversity existing in the bacteria nodulating soybean with special reference to Indian work.","[Biate, David L.; Kumar, Lakkineni Vithal; Ramadoss, D.; Kumari, Annu; Naik, Satish; Reddy, Kiran K.; Annapurna, Kannepalli] Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, New Delhi 110012, India","Annapurna, K (reprint author), Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, New Delhi 110012, India.",annapurna93@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,100,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2352-474X,,978-3-319-05936-5; 978-3-319-05935-8,SUSTAIN DEV BIODIVER,,,2014,1,,,,,,131,145,,10.1007/978-3-319-05936-5_5,10.1007/978-3-319-05936-5,,15,Agronomy; Biodiversity Conservation; Microbiology,Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Microbiology,BC4FT,WOS:000352442800006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gakis, SF; Orfanoudakis, MZ; Papaioannou, AG; Mantzanas, KT; Papanastasis, VP; Alifragis, DA; Seilopoulos, DG; Kostakis, SN",,,,"Gakis, S.

The experiment was laid out in 1992 and included three understorey treatments (grass, legume and control - unsown), two tree species - sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and two tree spacings (2.5 x 2.5 m and 3.5 x 3.5 m). Tree height was taller in the control and in the dense stands while Scots pine had better growth but, higher mortality than sycamore in the both periods. In 2004, understorey vegetation was uniform under the three understorey treatments and a significant decrease in sward above ground biomass was recorded under the dense treatment, compared with the open stand. In the same year, organic C and N, Mg and K concentrations as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore numbers were found significantly higher under sycamore than Scots pine plots in the 0-20 cm soil depth. The results show that, although understorey vegetation became uniform over time, the initial plant composition of the understorey treatments continued to affect tree growth, indicating the importance of the understorey vegetation at the establishment stage of silvopastoral systems. However, as time passed initial tree spacing started to affect tree growth and tree species, particularly sycamore, to improve soil properties. These results indicate an evolution of the initial silvopastoral system to a forest.","[Gakis, S.

SEEDLINGS IN CROATIAN MEDITERRANENAN AREA,SUMARSKI LIST,,,Croatian,Article,,,,,,Mediterranean karst area; container type; morphological features of seedlings; soil preparation; afforestation success; height growth,SITE PREPARATION; NURSERY; GROWTH,"For successful afforestation in Mediterranean karst areas several important criteria must be fulfilled, especially adequate tree species selection, high-quality seedlings and proper soil preparation. Considering above metioned conditions, morphological features of one-year old stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) seedlings were analyzed. Seedlings were grown in different types of containers to establish the effect of container type on development (quality) of above- and belowground parts of the seedlings. Survival rates, growth and development of seedlings were measured and monitored in the period from 2003 to 2009, in forest culture on experimental plot in the vicinity of Sibenik (Mediterranean part of Croatia). Seedlings were planted both on ripped ground and in the pits with dimensions of 40 x 40 x 40 cm. Four types of containers were used: MP53/152, MP33/18, T-7/24 and T-8/24. Studied seedling variables (morphological features) include: seedling height, root collar diameter, biomass of the aboveground part of the seedlings and total seedling biomass. Two morphological indexes were calculated from measured variables: S/R ratio and DQI. Morphological dimensions of root systems (total root length, number of root tips, surface area and root volume) were scanned and measured with WinRhizo software. Seedlings were arranged over the area of the experimental plot according to the randomized block method. Seedlings were randomly assigned to 3 blocks (block area = 0.2 ha). Within each block two types of soil preparation prior to planting were performed: in pits with dimensions of 40 x 40 x 40 cm, and on the ripped ground. Each year during the experiment, after the growth cessation, seedlings were measured for height increment, and survival rates (e.g. mortality), with re- spect to container type and planting method. After six years plants were also measured for stem diameter at the height of 10 cm above ground level. Morphological features with regard to container type were evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple Turkey's post hoc test. Relationship between survival rates in 2009 and initial seedling height, container type, soil preparation method, as well as their interactions, for the period between 2003 and 2009, was evaluated with the repeated measures analysis of variance. ANOVA was also used to test for the influence of container type and soil preparation method on the diameters of seedlings six years after planting. Morphological features of seedlings derived from the samples of 20 seedlings per container type (Table 2), mostly showed significantly higher values in larger containers (T-7/24 and T-8/24) compared to smaller containers (MP53/12 and MP33/18). Root analyses also showed that roots of seedlings from smallest containers (MP53/12) were deformed to a high degree (Picture 2 and 3). In larger containers (MP33/18) root deformation was largely reduced. On the other hand, bind of roots into growing medium in seedlings grown in large containers was insufficient, although the roots were not deformed. Results indicate that the survival rates over six years in forest culture were influenced mainly by soil preparation (exp (beta) = 3,4591; p <0,0001), followed by container size in interaction with soil preparation method. Seedlings from larger containers (seedlings of higher quality) planted on ripped ground had several times lesser mortality compared to seedlings from smaller containers planted in pits excavated manually (exp (beta) = 3,0710; p = 0,0024). Container type and soil preparation also exhibited influence on height growth of stone pine (Pin us pinea L.). Seedlings of stone pine grown in larger containers show more intensive growth and development in forest culture during first six years (F = 101,488; p < 0,000001). Similarly, seedlings planted on ripped ground have better growth and development characteristics compared to seedlings planted in pits with dimensions of 40 x 40 x 40 cm (F = 83,750; p < 0,000001). Six years after the planting seedlings grown initially in larger containers (T-7/24 and T-8/24) had larger stein diameters (F = 32,663; p = 0,00001) compared to seedlings originated from smaller containers (MP53/12 and MP33/18). Plants that were growing on ripped ground have managed to acquire larger stem diameters compared to seedlings planted in pits (F = 44,187; p = 0,00001). Seedlings of stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) grown in container MP53/12 have developed highly deformed root systems because of inadequate dimensions of this container and its technological absoluteness. Therefore is recommended to gradually abandon the use of MP53/12 and MP33/18 containers from nursery production. Further research is needed to eventually define new, modern solutions adapted to production of high-quality seedlings for afforestation of Mediterranean karst area. Without proper soil preparation (ripping in this case) and adequate containers for production of high-quality seedlings it is impossible to successfully afforest Mediterranean karst area.","[Jelic, Goran; Topic, Vlado; Butorac, Lukrecija] Inst Jadranske Kulture & Melioraciju Krsa, Split 21000, Croatia; [Durdevic, Zoran] USP Split, Hrvatske Sume Doo Zagreb, Split, Croatia; [Jazbec, Anamarija; Orsanic, Milan] Sumarski Fak Sveucilista Zagrebu, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Jelic, G (reprint author), Inst Jadranske Kulture & Melioraciju Krsa, Put Duilova 11, Split 21000, Croatia.",goran.jelic@krs.hr,"Jazbec, Anamarija/U-9521-2017",,,,,26,1,2,1,14,CROATIAN FORESTRY SOC,ZAGREB,"TRG MAZURANICA 11, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",0373-1332,1846-9140,,SUMAR LIST,Sumar.

In the present study, we focused on Pinus tabuliformis, one of the most economically and ecologically important tree species in China. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed trees from high-elevation (HP) and low-elevation (LP) populations to low (80 % of field capacity, FC), mild (60 % FC), moderate (40 % FC) and severe (20 % FC) water stresses. Leaf gas exchange, biomass production and allocation, as well as water-use efficiency, were measured during the experiment. Increasing soil water stress clearly decreased the relative growth rate (RGR), total dry mass (TDM), light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(sat)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), total water use (TWU) and whole-plant water-use efficiency (WUEWP). In contrast, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) both increased significantly with increasing soil water stress for both populations. Only in the LP did the root/shoot ratio (R/S ratio) significantly increase when the water stress increased. A strong positive correlation between A(sat) and g(s) coupled with a reduced intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) probably suggested that stomatal limitations were the main cause of the decreased A(sat). However, all the measured variables from the HP were affected less by drought compared with those of the LP, and most aspects of the HP were canalized against drought stress, which was reflected by the relatively higher RGR, TDM and WUEWP. Overall, the results suggest that the two populations responded differentially to drought stress with the HP showing higher drought tolerance than the LP, which was reflected by its faster seedling growth rate and more efficient water use under drought conditions.","[Ma, Fei] Ningxia Univ, Ctr Res & Dev, Yinchuan 750021, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ting Ting] Ningxia Univ, Sch Life Sci, Yinchuan 750021, Peoples R China; [Ji, Ming Fei; Zhao, Chang Ming] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Zhao, CM (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",zhaochm@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31260166, 31170571, 31360185]","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 31260166, 31170571 and 31360185).",,51,7,7,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2014,6,,,,,,,,plu069,10.1093/aobpla/plu069,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CB2ED,WOS:000349438600008,25387750,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19S,"Wang, XX; Wu, L; Ping, Z; Li, C; Zhao, LB; An, W; Chen, Y",,"Hegde, G",,"Wang, Xinxin; Wu, Liang; Ping, Zhou; Li, Chen; Zhao, Libin; An, Wei; Chen, Yu",,,Effect of ZnO Nanoparticles on Medicago Sativa at the Germination Stage,"MATERIALS SCIENCE AND PROCESSING, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES",Applied Mechanics and Materials,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Conference on Application of Materials Science and Environmental Materials (AMSEM),"JUL 04-06, 2014","Yichang, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,Ecotoxicity; Root activity; Mitotic index; Principal component analysis,SOYBEAN GLYCINE-MAX; PLANTS; CEO2; SOIL,"Phytotoxicity of manufactured nanoparticles in plants has received increasing attention.

Therefore, root activity of Medicago sativa may serve as potential biomarker to indicate the pollution of ZnO nanoparticles.","[Wang, Xinxin; Chen, Yu] Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinxin; Wu, Liang; An, Wei; Chen, Yu] China Offshore Environm Serv Co Ltd, Tianjin 300452, Peoples R China; [Wu, Liang; Ping, Zhou] Ocean Univ China, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Liang; Ping, Zhou] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Li, Chen] Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Biotechnol, Tianjin 300457, Peoples R China","Wang, XX (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",wangxx200899@163.com,,,"China National Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC-KJ 125 ZDXM 00 000 00 NFCY 2011-04, CNOOC-KJ 125 ZDXM 25JAB NFCY 2013-01]; Tianjin Binhai New Area [2012-XJR23017]","This work was supported by the science and technology project from China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC-KJ 125 ZDXM 00 000 00 NFCY 2011-04, CNOOC-KJ 125 ZDXM 25JAB NFCY 2013-01), science and technology project of Tianjin Binhai New Area (2012-XJR23017) and postdoctoral innovation fund project of Tianjin.",,14,0,0,0,9,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,DURNTEN-ZURICH,"KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",1660-9336,,978-3-03835-270-9,APPL MECH MATER,,,2014,665,,,,,,583,586,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.665.583,,,4,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Materials Science,BB9BZ,WOS:000348127000127,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, ZH; Wang, H; Tang, ZH; Zu, YG; Liu, Y",,,,"Zhang, Zhong-Hua; Wang, Hua; Tang, Zhong-Hua; Zu, Yuan-Gang; Liu, Ying",,,High NaHCO3 stress causes direct injury to Nicotiana tabacum roots,JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,saline stress; alkaline stress; K+/Na+ ratio; ultrastructure; main site of toxicity,SALT STRESS; IONIC BALANCE; GROWTH; TOLERANCE; RESPONSES; SALINITY; EXPRESSION; SEEDLINGS; SODIUM,"In order to localize the main organic site of alkaline toxicity to plants, the injury of NaCl or NaHCO3 to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seedlings was compared.

The root/shoot ratio, transpiration rate, and Na+ accumulation in the leaves were lower than other. Further investigation of the root ultrastructure showed that the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane were not visible or absent, while more small vacuoles and mitochondria with dilated or absent cristae were observed under the 100 mM NaHCO3 stress.

This was achieved using aqueous extracts of different organs and root exudates of P. australis in laboratory and greenhouse experiments with Lactuca sativa as the model test plant. The observed reduced liquid imbibition and altered resource mobilization in seeds of L. sativa, in particular an insufficient carbohydrate supply, demonstrated that the onset of germination might be negatively affected by phytotoxicity. Dose-response studies pointed out that oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species production could potentially cause the observed germination and seedling growth reductions. The osmotic effects by mannitol solution on germination as well as growth and physiology at a level of -0.57 and -0.45 bar, respectively, demonstrated that the results from aqueous plant extracts were partially induced by the osmotic potential on and above those levels. Overall, the relative strength of inhibition on measured parameters was the highest in leaf extract, followed by rhizome, root, stem, and inflorescence. Root exudates of P. australis also had negative impacts by reducing germination and growth of plant.

The fungal isolates NICS01 and DFC01 significantly enhanced shoot length, root length, and fresh and dry seedling weight, due to the secretion of various concentrations of amino acids (Asp, Thr, Ser, Asn, Glu, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, Lys, His, Try, and Arg). Penicillium sp. NICS01 increased the amount of chlorophylls, proteins, amino acids, and lignans in the sesame plants more so than in controls. Sesame plant growth was stunted by high soil salinity, and application of the three fungal isolates increased plant survival. The RDA01 and NICS01 strains significantly increased shoot length and fresh and dry seedling weights under salt stress conditions. In addition, an in vitro study of the Penicillium spp. revealed their antagonistic activity toward the pathogenic fungi Fusarium spp. Fusarium spp. reduce shoot length; co-inoculation with the NICS01 or DFC01 isolates significantly increased shoot length in infected plants.

Belowground interactions between shrubs and native grasses are complicated and poorly understood in China's agroforestry practice, especially in the silvopasture systems of droughty northern China. The distribution of fine roots (<2 mm) in an alley sllvopasture system consisting of Caragana microphylla Lam. and local grasses was compared to those in a degraded pasture plot using soil cores. Fine root production was examined in these plots using ingrowth cores. We found that the introduction of C. microphylla did not change the vertical distribution pattern of fine roots of grassy plants but had a great impact on belowground production in the ecosystem. Grass fine roots decreased with depth in both the silvopasture system and the degraded pasture. Grass fine roots were mostly distributed in the top 40 cm of the soil, but they extended to deeper soil layers through root elongation. C. microphylla, in contrast, occupied the deeper soil layer, in which water was continuously available. We conclude that the belowground interactions between native grasses and C. microphylla in sandy soil can be explained by Walter's 2-layer hypothesis, which is used to explain the coexistence of trees and grasses. Our results draw attention to the interspecific configuration of the silvopasture system and belowground interactions of plants in semiarid and arid regions.","[Lai, Zongrui; Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin; Zha, Tianshan; Qin, Shugao; Jia, Xin; Liu, Rabin; Feng, Wei] Beijing Forestry Univ Beijing, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ Beijing, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangyqbjfu@gmail.com,,,National Key Technology Research and Development Program of China for the 12th Five-Year Plan [2012BAD16B02],"This research was supported by the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of China for the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012BAD16B02).

However, the effects of exclosures on grasslands are controversial and can depend on many factors, such as the grassland ecosystem types, evolutionary history and so on. In this study, we conduct field experiments to investigate the variations of the ecosystem function in response to livestock exclosure in a Kobresia humilis meadow with 6 years of grazing exclosure on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We focused on two ecosystem functions: plant community structure and ecosystem carbon cycling. The plant aboveground productivity, plant diversity and the composition of plant functional groups of the meadow were addressed as the indicators of the plant community structure. The C-13 isotope pulse labeling technique was applied to evaluate the alterations of ecosystem carbon cycling during a short term. The results showed that the plant community structure was changed after being fenced in for 6 years, with significantly decreased aboveground productivity, species loss and varied composition of the four plant functional groups (grasses, sedges, legumes and forbs). Using the pulse labeling technique, we found a lower cycling rate of C-13 in the plant-soil system of the fenced plots compared with the grazed sites during the first 24 h after labeling. A higher proportion of recovered C-13 in the plant-soil system migrated into the soil as root exudates immediately after labeling at both fenced and control grazed sites, with a significantly lower proportion in the fenced site, coinciding with the lower proportion of C-13 lost from soil respiration. Thirtytwo days after labeling, 37% of the recovered C-13 remained in the soil of the fenced plots, with significant differences compared to in the grazed plots (47 %). In addition, less C-13 (5 vs. 7 %) was lost by soil respiration in the fenced plots during the chase period of 32 days. Overall, our study suggests that livestock exclosures have negative effects on the plant community structure and partitioning patterns of the photoassimilated carbon in the Kobresia meadow, and the effects on photoassimilated carbon cycling are likely to result from the variations of community structures in the ecosystem.","[Zou, J.; Zhao, L.; Xu, S.; Chen, D.; Li, Q.; Zhao, N.; Luo, C.; Zhao, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Plateau Inst Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining 810001, Peoples R China; [Xu, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zou, J.] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhao, X (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Plateau Inst Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining 810001, Peoples R China.",xqzhao@nwipb.cas.cn,"Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015; Li, Qi/H-4374-2011","Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41030105]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05070000]; Key Project of Qinghai Province [2011-2-734],"We acknowledge the support of this study by the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41030105), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA05070000) and the Key Project of Qinghai Province (no. 2011-2-734).

Such damage on different tree species is being recorded throughout Europe periodically. In Croatian forestry an area size on which rodent damage occures in the years of their high abundance extends on 4500 hectars on average. The mere observing of the damage and of rodent presence is the most common method of evaluating rodent abundance while thorough analysis of the two is generally missing. The aim of this research was to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of rodent damage made to stem and root system of pedunculate oak saplings in accordance to rodent abundance, dynamics and population structure in young-growth pedunculate oak forest (Genisto elatae - Quercetum roboris Ht. 1938) situated within the region of Central Posavina (Lipovljani, Opeke). Quantitative analysis included monitoring of rodent abundance (linear transect method, three transects, 112 snap traps) and counting oak saplings on five experimental plots (5m x 5m) where saplings that had gnawing marks on their stem or roots were sampled and counted as damaged. Qualitative analysis included measuring dimension of gnawing marks (widh x hight) along with scaning, analysing and comparing damaged and undamaged root systems of sampled oak saplings. The latter was done using scaner Epson Expression 10000 XL while the WinRhizo software was used to determine root varables: lenght, volume and the number of root tips. Data classification of the root lenght and number of root tips was made in accordance to four categories depending on the diamentar of root sections: 0-1 mm, 1-2 mm, 2-5 mm, > 5 mm. Roots of 115 damaged and 33 undamaged oak saplings was sampled, scaned and sorted into three categories depending on a plant hight: <40 cm, 40-80 cm, >80 cm. Plant and rodent sampling were done in November 2011, April 2012 and in May 2013. Morphological determination of rodents was done according to Niethammer and Krapp. Georeferencing of trapped animals was made using the GPS (Garmin Oregon 450). Collected data was analysed using Garmin MapSource ver. 6.16.3., Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and STATISTICA 8. Differences between undamaged and damaged roots of the saplings were tested by Student t-test, or in case of inhomogeneous variences, by nonparametric Mann-Whintey U-test. In all the analyzes 5 % error was considered statistically significant. Monitoring of the rodent population showed that in period from November 2011 till May 2013 rodent abundance varied from 0 % to 16 % and that ratio of subfamilies Arvicolinae and Murinae changed seasonally (Graph 1). Analysis of the rodent spatial distribution showed that most of real mice were trapped on transect covered by dense vegetation, while voles were mostly trapped on other two transects with less vegetation coverage. Quantitative analysis showed that the ratio of damaged pedunculate oak saplings varied from 0,0 % to 42,05 % within individual experimental plots, while the highest overall recorded ratio was 22 %. Qualitative analysis showed that the extent of damage made by rodents increased with the age of oak saplings (1-5 years), both on the root system (Graphs 2-6) and on the stam. Feeding on the stems of the saplings resulted in gnawing marks that varied from 16,5 mm(2) to 766,5 mm2 in size and were 182,5 mm2 on average. Number of gnawing marks recorded on individual plant varied from one to five and was 1,6 on average. Rodent feeding on root system resulted in loss of 57-77 % of root volume, 71 %-97 % of root lenght and 65 %-96 % of root tips of pedunculate oak saplings depending on the hight of a plant. Statistically significant difference in volume, rooth lenght and number of root tips between damaged and undamaged oak saplings within almost all high and root categories was determened. This research confirmed that rodent abundance and population structure varies seasonally and is therefore important to be aware of it while it provides basic information for predicting the damage made by rodents on the pedunculate young-growth. It also showed that, in accordance to root volume, lenght and number of root tips of pedunculate oak saplings damaged by rodents - that were measured for the the first time within this research - the plant itself cannot recover from the loss.","[Vucelja, Marko; Margaletic, Josip] Sveuciliste Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Zavod Zastitu Suma & Lovno Gospodarenje, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bjedov, Linda; Sango, Mario] Sveuciliste Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Zavod Ekol & Uzgajanje Suma, Zagreb, Croatia; [Moro, Maja] Sveuciliste Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Zavod Proc Tehn, Zagreb, Croatia","Vucelja, M (reprint author), Sveuciliste Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Zavod Zastitu Suma & Lovno Gospodarenje, Svetosimunska 25, Zagreb, Croatia.",vucelja@sumfak.hr,,,,,,36,0,0,6,19,CROATIAN FORESTRY SOC,ZAGREB,"TRG MAZURANICA 11, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",0373-1332,,,SUMAR LIST,Sumar.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) act in plant succession by favoring the establishment of plant species typical of successional stages and by accelerating recovery leading to a climax stage. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the occurrence and diversity of AMF in successional stages of caatinga in the semi-arid region of Paraiba State. Experimental plots (30 x 60 m) were delimitated in 2007 in areas corresponding to different caatinga successional stages: early caatinga succession (natural revegetation during the previous 15 years); intermediate (natural revegetation for about 35 years); late (mature caatinga with more than 50 years without major disturbances;) and also in pasture areas fenced and protected to represent the initial phase of succession. Plots of all four stages were implemented with three replicates. Soil and root samples were collected in the experimental plots, from the 0-15 cm soil layer in the dry and in the rainy seasons. All areas presented low infectivity potential suggesting that the introduction of mycorrhizal seedlings may accelerate the process of revegetation of degraded soils in this region. Except for the areas of late stage, the glomalin reservoirs increased along with the advancement of the succession process. Areas in the late stage of succession presented greater richness of AMF species, indicating that the establishment of the vegetation also exerts a significant effect in the fungal community.

For example, timber containing reaction wood is more difficult to saw and takes a poorer surface. Compression wood also creates difficulties for papermaking because of its high lignin content although pulp is easier to produce from tension wood because of its lower lignin content. Part of the problems in performance of products incorporating reaction wood arises from the generally inferior mechanical properties of reaction wood compared to normal wood and part of the difficulty arises from the increased variability in wood properties introduced by the presence of reaction wood. Avoiding reaction wood formation in forest trees to reduce the problems in processing requires careful attention to site, species choice and management at all stages of the life of a tree. Although there can be sometimes conflicting evidence for the benefits or otherwise of a particular management option, in general any action that leads to unstable root systems, stem sweep or lean, unbalanced root to shoot biomass allocation, eccentric crowns or increased wind or snow loading will have a tendency to produce reaction wood. The key is for stand management to avoid, whenever possible, large scale changes that result in the requirement for major adaptation of the trees to new growing conditions.","[Gardiner, Barry; Flatman, Tom] Forest Res, No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gardiner, Barry] INRA, EPHYSE UR1263, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Flatman, Tom] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Thibaut, Bernard] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, LMGC, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France","Gardiner, B (reprint author), Forest Res, No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland.",barry.gardiner@bordeaux.inra.fr,,,,,,112,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1431-8563,,978-3-642-10814-3; 978-3-642-10813-6,SPRINGER SER WOOD,Springer Ser.

However, their effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions remain uncertain. We assessed the changes in stocks of SOC, light fraction of SOC (LF-SOC) and heavy fraction of SOC (HF-SOC) after planting Artemisia ordosica (AO, 17 years), Astragalus mongolicum (AM, 5 years) and Salix psammophila (SP, 16 years) in sand land and planting Caragana microphylla (CM, 24 years) on degraded pasture. Results show that: 1) after planting AO, AM and SP on sand land, SOC stocks increased by 162.5%, 45.2% and 70.8%, respectively, and LF-SOC accounted for a large proportion in the increased SOC. Dry weights of LF-SOC, rather than carbon concentrations, were higher in shrublands than that in sand land; 2) after planting CM on degraded pasture, SOC stock decreased by 9.3% and all the loss was HF-SOC in 60-100 cm soil layer where both herbaceous fine root biomass (HFRB) and soil water content (SWC) also decreased. The results indicate that planting shrubs can result in an increase of SOC in sand land, whereas that can lead to a decrease of SOC in degraded pasture. The increase of SOC in sand land mainly bases on the accumulation of dry weight of LF-SOC. The loss of SOC in degraded pasture is caused by the decrease of carbon concentrations of HF-SOC, which can be related to the reduction of HFRB and SWC in deep soil layer. Therefore, shrub-planting for desertification control not always improve the quantity and stability of SOC in northwest China.","[Liu, Jia-Bin; Zhang, Yu-Qing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shu-Gao; Lai, Zong-Rui] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu-Qing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shu-Gao] Yanchi Res Stn, Ningxia 751500, Peoples R China","Zhang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangyqbjfu@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31170666],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31170666).

All variables were measured in half-sibling families of P. pseudostrobus in a common garden test for 10 months-old seedlings in three competitive environments: (I) inter-family of low density (0.24 x 0.12 m), (II) inter-family of high density (0.12 x 0.06 m) and (III) intra-family with high density (0.12 x 0.06 m). The first three components (PC) explained 82.9% of the total variation. The growth was the major component (PC1), grouping families for competitive environments as PC2 with families grouped by survivability and physiological plasticity, and finally, architectural structural changes as PC3. The results showed a high level of phenotypic plasticity of P. pseudostrobus, and emphasize the importance of the selection of environments and genotypes consistent to enhance adaptation and productivity improvement programs.","[Hugo Cambron-Sandoval, Victor; Suzan-Azpiri, Humberto] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ciencias Nat, Queretaro, Mexico; [Saenz-Romero, Cuauhtemoc C.; Sanchez-Vargas, Naum M.] UMSNH, IIAF, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico","Cambron-Sandoval, VH (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ciencias Nat, Queretaro, Mexico.",hugo.cambron@gmail.com; hsuzan@uaq.mx; csaenzromero@gmail.com; nsanchezv@yahoo.com,,"Cambron Sandoval, Victor Hugo/0000-0002-3847-2885",,,,29,0,0,0,4,INST ECOLOGIA A C,XALAPA,"KM 2 5 CARR ANT A COATEPEC NO 351, CONGREGACION EL HAYA, XALAPA, VER 00000, MEXICO",1405-0471,,,MADERA BOSQUES,Madera Bosques,,2014,20,1,,,,,47,57,,10.21829/myb.2014.201175,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,AH8SG,WOS:000336407900005,,Other Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Chomicki, G; Bidel, LPR; Jay-Allemand, C",,,,"Chomicki, Guillaume; Bidel, Luc P.

However, it is believed that a proportion of carbon is obtained by endomycorrhizal associations. In this study, we show that Dendrophylax lindenii possesses a dimorphic exodermis with smaller, thin-walled passage cells that are depleted in flavonoids. No hyphae succeeded in penetrating into the cortex from a non-passage cell, but 20% of the hyphae in contact with a passage cell managed to penetrate into the cortex. The passage cells represent 40% of the amount of cells in the centre of the side that touches the substrate, but no passage cells are observed in the upper side of the root. This distribution and density of exodermal passage cells define a strategy for controlling the extent and location of fungal invasion in the orchid root. This strategy provides a mechanism for restricting fungal growth to the lower cortex and thus maximising carbon gain from photosynthesis while enabling further trophic exchanges from mycorrhizal associations.

The strains were characterized using a polyphasie approach, including nodulation pattern, phenotypic characterization, 16S rDNA sequencing, nifH and nodA symbiotic genes sequencing, and rep-PCR fingerprinting. Symbiotic properties assay revealed that all local rhizobial strains showed a wide spectrum of prolific nodulation and a marked increase in plant growth parameters compared to the un-inoculated control. Complete sequencing of 16S rRNA demonstrated that, native soybean nodulating rhizobia are phylogenetically related to Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer and Rhizobium (syn. Agrobacterium) genera. Study of tolerance ability to environmental stresses revealed that local strains survived in a wide pH ranges (pH 5-11) and a few of them tolerated high acidic conditions (pH 4). Agrobacterium strains were identified as the highest salt-tolerant and were survived under 6% NaCl, however Ensifer strains were the uppermost heat-tolerant and can grow at 42 degrees C. Agrobacterium strains have been shown to harbor nifH and nodA genes similar to those in other fast growing soybean symbionts and were largely distinct from symbiotic genes of slow growing bradyrhizobia.

The current study was conducted to better understand the infection of in vitro cultures of Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings by three trophically diverse fungal species, Fusarium oxysporum E. F. Sm. & Swingle, Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and Hebeloma crustuliniforme (Bull.) Quel. Biochemical methods and microscopy were utilized to determine (i) which factors (apoplastic and cellular pH, reactive oxygen species, glutathione and cell death) play a role in the establishment of pathogenic, saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, and (ii) whether cell death is a common response of conifer seedling tissues when they are exposed to trophically diverse fungi. Establishment of the pathogen, F. oxysporum, was observed more frequently in the meristematic region of root tips than in the elongation zone, which was in contrast to T. harzianum and H. crustuliniforme. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) hyphae, however, were occasionally observed in the studied root zone and caused small changes in the studied factors. Colonization of the meristematic zone occurred due to host cell death. Independently of the zone, changes in cellular pH resulting in an acidic cytoplasm conditioned the establishment of F. oxysporum. Additionally, cell death was negatively correlated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in roots challenged by a pathogenic fungus. Cell death was the only factor uniquely associated with the colonization of host roots by a saprotrophic fungus. The mechanism may differ, however, between the zones since apoplastic pH was negatively correlated with cell death in the elongation zone, whereas in the meristematic zone, none of the studied factors explained cell death. Colonization by the ECM fungus, H. crustuliniforme, was associated with a decreasing number of cells with acidic apoplast and by production of H2O2 in the elongation zone resulting in cell death. Saprotrophic and ECM fungi had a greater effect on cell acidification in the meristematic zone than the pathogenic fungus.","[Mucha, Joanna; Guzicka, Marzenna; Ratajczak, Ewelina; Zadworny, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland","Mucha, J (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Pk 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",mucha_joanna@wp.pl,,"Mucha, Joanna/0000-0002-1290-9639; Ratajczak, Ewelina/0000-0003-2710-4638; Zadworny, Marcin/0000-0002-7352-5786","Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [IP2010 027470]",The research has been financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (project no.

TOF-SIMS mapping also shows that Al has a tendency to be localized around vessels in the inner rings.","[Saito, Kaori; Matsushita, Yasuyuki; Imai, Takanori; Fukushima, Kazuhiko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Watanabe, Yoko] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Hokkaido Univ Forests, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan; [Koike, Takayoshi; Sano, Yuzou; Fukazawa, Kazumi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Funada, Ryo] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Fukushima, K (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",kazu@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Matsushita, Yasuyuki/I-6924-2014; Funada, Ryo/C-2020-2013","Matsushita, Yasuyuki/0000-0003-1357-3927; ",,,,37,6,6,1,52,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0018-3830,1437-434X,,HOLZFORSCHUNG,Holzforschung,JAN,2014,68,1,,,,,85,92,,10.1515/hf-2012-0215,,,8,"Forestry; Materials Science, Paper & Wood",Forestry; Materials Science,AA2AP,WOS:000330897800012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, M; Drozdowski, S; Brzeziecki, B; Rutkowska, P; Jablonska, B",,,,"Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, Marta; Drozdowski, Stanislaw; Brzeziecki, Bogdan; Rutkowska, Paulina; Jablonska, Barbara",,,Effects of different methods of site preparation on natural regeneration of Pinus sylvestris in Eastern Poland,DENDROBIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Scots pine; seedling density; seedling growth; seedling quality; soil scarification,SCOTS PINE; SOUTHERN SWEDEN; PICEA-ABIES; MOISTURE CONDITIONS; SOIL SCARIFICATION; CLEAR-CUT; SEEDLING EMERGENCE; SEEDBED SUBSTRATE; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; GROWTH-RESPONSE,"Mechanical site preparation (MSP) is commonly used to enable forest regeneration of clear-cuts. Less intense methods may be more suitable from an environmental point of view, but such a method can result in the lack of natural regeneration. We compare the influence of three MSP methods on natural regeneration of Scots pine. The methods differ in their degree of soil disturbance. The effects of MSP by forest plough (FP), active plough (AP), and forest cutter (FC) on density, quality, and biometric parameters of one-year old seedlings were determined. The highest density of seedlings was obtained in the FP treatment (188,000 seedlings ha(-1)). The seedling density was significantly lower in the AP method (121,000 seedlings ha(-1)), and in the FC variant (36,000 seedlings ha(-1)). The best quality seedlings were found in the FC variant, and the worst - in the FP treatment. Most biometric parameters of seedlings did not differ by MSP method, except for the root length and root: shoot ratio. By the end of growing season, in the FP treatment, 1-year old seedlings formed a top bud more than twice as often as the seedlings from the AP and FC treatments. The FP method led to the best Scots pine natural regeneration. The results obtained in the FC variant were not as good as in the FP method, though they were still acceptable from the silvicultural point of view. The FC method was the least intensive method of site preparation, yet it is considered the most appropriate from the environmental (soil protection) point of view.","[Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, Marta] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Protect & Ecol, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Drozdowski, Stanislaw; Brzeziecki, Bogdan; Rutkowska, Paulina; Jablonska, Barbara] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Silviculture, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland","Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, M (reprint author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Protect & Ecol, 159 Nowoursynowska St, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",marta_aleksandrowicz_trzcinska@sggw.pl,,"Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, Marta/0000-0002-1397-4475; Brzeziecki, Bogdan/0000-0001-5786-3075; Drozdowski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-1253-7281",Warsaw University of Life Sciences [504-10-03040016],"We are grateful to Mr. Piotr Uscian-Szacilowski, District Forest Manager of the Ostrow Mazowiecka Forest District for his invaluable support and help during the field part of the study.

Based on forest soil survey data, we present a multivariate approach to identify the main parameters of FRD patterns of Central European forests, compare them with the FRD model according to Gale and Grigal (1987), and aim to detect the decisive site and soil properties. Two main parameters for the description of FRDs were found: one describes ""shallowness"" and the other additionally characterizes ""divergence"" from an evenly decreasing FRD with depth. With these two parameters, distinct FRD patterns could be described better than with absolute values of depth-dependent fine-root densities or with the compared FRD model. Comparing all sites, no significant differences occurred regarding stand types for most of the analysed fine-root parameters. Specific site and soil properties were seemingly more responsible for the expression of FRD. Results of multivariate analyses suggest that the shape of FRDs is mainly a reflection of the trees' strategy to optimally adapt to the local soil physical and hydrological conditions. Soil chemical properties were of increased relevance when sites with either spruce or beech were analysed and for the prediction of uneven FRDs. The applied soil survey design enabled us to identify parameters, which can describe FRD patterns and how they are influenced by several soil and site properties in general. These multivariate relationships should be considered and discussed in the context of ecological forest models in further research.","[Hartmann, Peter; von Wilpert, Klaus] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Soils & Environm, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Hartmann, P (reprint author), Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Soils & Environm, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",peter.hartmann@forst.bwl.de,,,,,,25,5,6,0,51,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

In addition, a new primer combination v) covering the ITS2 region (ITS2) was included in the comparison. The ""Kruger"" primers tended to yield the highest AMF diversity and showed a significantly higher Shannon diversity index than the SSU primers. We found a strong bias towards the Glomeraceae in the LSU and SSU primer systems and differences in the composition of AMF communities based on the ""Redecker"" primer system. Our results confirm the crucial role of the choice of target rRNA marker region for analysing AMF communities. We also provide evidence that nested-PCR based data can be interpreted semi-quantitatively and that the extent of observed AMF community overdominance largely depends on the choice of primer.

The specific roles of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) in the rooting medium on the in vitro root morphological processes were explored using a good-rooting clone. In vitro rooting percentage was significantly reduced when either of the auxin inhibitors 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and rho-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) or the auxin antagonist kinetin was supplied at rooting, with or without exogenous auxin. For all treatments, at the time of root induction, shoots did not possess a vascular cambium, only procambial tissue, from where adventitious roots formed. However, when the inhibitors or the antagonist were supplied to the roots 3 days after root induction, they affected root growth and graviperception. Kinetin and PCIB significantly reduced the mean root diameter from 552.8 mu m (control) to 129.2 mu m and 278.6 mu m, respectively, over 3 weeks. While the PCIB treatment resulted in a significant increase in Delta root length over this period, the TIBA treatment significantly decreased Delta root length and increased mean root diameter to 833.4 mu m. Restricting IAA transport with TIBA further altered root vascular patterning and, as with PCIB, resulted in the collapse of the columella region. Nevertheless, only a disruption in IAA transport and subsequent auxin distribution by TIBA treatment resulted in altered root graviperception. The results suggest the necessary inclusion of IAA in eucalypt micropropagation protocols to ensure good quality roots.","[Nakhooda, Muhammad; Watt, Maria Paula] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Durban, South Africa; [Mycock, David] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa","Watt, MP (reprint author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Durban, South Africa.",wattm@ukzn.ac.za,,,National Research Fund of South Africa [UID85573]; Universities of KwaZulu-Natal and Witwatersrand; Mondi Business,"The authors thank the National Research Fund of South Africa (grant UID85573), the Universities of KwaZulu-Natal and Witwatersrand, and Mondi Business for funding this research.",,61,3,3,0,20,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

Both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) as well as other root endophytic fungi co-occur in plant roots, and therefore have the potential to influence relative abundances of plant species in local assemblages. However, no study has experimentally examined how these key root endosymbiont groups might interact and affect plant community composition. Here, using an assemblage of five plant species in mesocosms in a fully factorial experiment, we added an assemblage of AM fungi and/or a mixture of root endophytic fungal isolates, all obtained from the same grassland field site. The results demonstrate that the AM fungi and root endophytes interact to affect plant community composition by changing relative species abundance, and consequently aboveground productivity.

Canada yew foliage contains high concentrations of paclitaxel and other taxanes, which have proven effective in treating many forms of cancer. A major challenge to the sustainable management of wild Canada yew harvest is the lack of a spatial inventory of the resource. The objective of this study was to develop a spatial model to predict the distribution and abundance of Canada yew populations in a forest landscape representative of the boreal forest region of Ontario, Canada. The study was conducted in the Romeo Mallete Forest (RMF) located on the southern edge of the boreal forest west of Timmins, Ontario. Abundance of Canada yew populations was assessed in 140 circular sample plots (5541 m(2)), established at locations throughout the RMF. Canada yew abundance in each sample plot was estimated as the mean percent cover of three randomly located 100 m(2) subplots. Predictor variables were extracted from the Forest Resources Inventory (FRI) of the RMF, and from layers derived from remote sensing data covering the study area. A combination of classification and regression trees with Random Forests analysis was used to develop a classification model for FRI polygons based on patterns of Canada yew abundance, and assess the performance of the model. The classification error rate on the presence/absence model was approximately 21%, and the root mean squared error on the best continuous cover model was 9.1%. In all analyses, the most important classification node was based on percent basal area of the shade-tolerant late successional species Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill), which suggests that patterns of Canada yew abundance are driven largely by time since disturbance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the lack of standardized method to measure this trait makes comparisons tricky. This study aims to compare three methods commonly used for determining fine RTD and to test whether root dry matter content (RDMC, the ratio between root dry mass and root fresh mass) could be used as a surrogate of fine root tissue density. RTD of 163 fine root samples was determined using (i) Archimedes' method, (ii) image analysis (WinRHIZO software), and (iii) using the root dry matter content as a proxy. Root samples belonged to different herbaceous species grown in different conditions. RTD measured with Archimedes' method was positively correlated with RTD estimated with image analysis and with RDMC. However we demonstrated that RTD measured with Archimedes' method was better predicted by RDMC (R-2 = 0.90) than by RTD measured with image analysis (R-2 = 0.56). The performance and limitations of each method were discussed. RDMC is a quick, cheap and relatively easy measurable root attribute; we thus recommended its measurement as a proxy of fine root tissue density.","[Birouste, Marine; Zamora-Ledezma, Ezequiel; Bossard, Carine; Roumet, Catherine] Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Zamora-Ledezma, Ezequiel] PDVSA Intevep, Urbanizac Santa Rosa, Sect El Tambor, Caracas 1070A, Venezuela; [Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M.] CSIC, IRNAS, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Birouste, M (reprint author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",marine.birouste@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M/H-6048-2015; caputo, carlo/N-3747-2014","Perez-Ramos, Ignacio M/0000-0003-2332-7818; ","Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); Centre International d'etudes superieures en sciences agronomiques (Montpellier SupAgro)""; Fondation de la Recherche sur la Biodiversite;  [CT 054045]","We acknowledge the << Plateforme des Terrains d'Experiences du LabEx CeMEB >> and the << Plate-forme d'Analyses en Ecologie de la SFR Montpellier Environnement Biodiversite >> for their assistance.

Recent advances in molecular methods based on fungal-specific PCR amplification have dramatically enhanced the identification of their host mycorrhizal fungi. However, studies investigating the fungal hosts of arbuscular mycorrhizae-forming mycoheterotrophs are still limited in Asia, which is known as one of the diversity hot spots of mycoheterotrophs that parasitize arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM). Therefore, we aimed to reveal the mycorrhizal associations of two Asian, fully mycoheterotrophic Burmannia species by molecular identification. Sequences of the small subunit ribosomal DNA showed that both Burmannia species are associated with several distinct lineages of Glomus group Ab. Because Glomus group Ab fungi have been confirmed as fungal hosts of various mycoheterotrophic plants in Africa and South America, we suggest they are widely exploited by AM-forming mycoheterotrophs globally.","[Suetsugu, Kenji; Kato, Makoto] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Kawakita, Atsushi] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Suetsugu, K (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Nihonmatsu Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",kenji.suetsugu@gmail.com,"Suetsugu, Kenji/S-8762-2018","Suetsugu, Kenji/0000-0002-7943-4164",,,,47,7,8,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0913-557X,1442-1984,,PLANT SPEC BIOL,Plant Spec.

They also enhance invasions of many alien species. Invasions disrupt native mutualisms, often leading to population declines, reduced biodiversity, and altered ecosystem functioning. Focusing on three main types of mutualisms (pollination, seed dispersal, and plant-microbial symbioses) and drawing on examples from different ecosystems and from species-and community-level studies, we review the key mechanisms whereby such positive interactions mediate invasions and are in turn influenced by invasions. High interaction generalization is ""the norm"" in most systems, allowing alien species to infiltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that influence invasiveness (e.g., selfing capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions. Mutualistic disruptions due to invasions are pervasive, and subsequent cascading effects are also widespread. Ecological networks provide a useful framework for predicting tipping points for community collapse in response to invasions and other synergistic drivers of global change.","[Traveset, Anna] Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, E-07190 Mallorca, Balearic Island, Spain; [Richardson, David M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Traveset, A (reprint author), Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, E-07190 Mallorca, Balearic Island, Spain.",atraveset@uib.es; rich@sun.ac.za,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011; Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297",,,,141,128,132,15,267,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1543-592X,,978-0-8243-1445-3,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

This model accepts input from a first-principles light-use efficiency model (the ""P"" model). The P model provides values for gross primary production (GPP) per unit of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Absorbed PAR is estimated from the current leaf area. GPP is allocated to foliage, transport tissue, and fine-root production and respiration in such a way as to satisfy well-understood dimensional and functional relationships. Our approach thereby integrates two modelling approaches separately developed in the global carbon-cycle and forest-science literature. The T model can represent both ontogenetic effects (the impact of ageing) and the effects of environmental variations and trends (climate and CO2) on growth. Driven by local climate records, the model was applied to simulate ring widths during the period 1958-2006 for multiple trees of Pinus koraiensis from the Changbai Mountains in northeastern China. Each tree was initialised at its actual diameter at the time when local climate records started. The model produces realistic simulations of the interannual variability in ring width for different age cohorts (young, mature, and old). Both the simulations and observations show a significant positive response of tree-ring width to growing-season total photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(0)) and the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration (alpha), and a significant negative response to mean annual temperature (MAT). The slopes of the simulated and observed relationships with PAR(0) and alpha are similar; the negative response to MAT is underestimated by the model. Comparison of simulations with fixed and changing atmospheric CO2 concentration shows that CO2 fertilisation over the past 50 years is too small to be distinguished in the ring-width data, given ontogenetic trends and interannual variability in climate.","[Li, G.; Harrison, S.

Engaging in specialized ecological interactions may constrain a species' distribution and abundance through limiting the availability of suitable habitat or reducing fecundity. In a generic-wide study of Drakaea (Orchidaceae), containing three common and six rare species, we tested if mycorrhizal specificity and pollinator availability is associated with intrinsic rarity across multiple spatial scales and if the ecology of common and rare species consistently differs. All Drakaea formed a mycorrhizal association with the same widely distributed species of Tulasnella, demonstrating that rarity does not arise from the mycorrhizal interaction. Drakaea are pollinated by sexual deception of thynnine wasps. Experiments at >300 sites across the geographic range of the genus revealed extreme pollinator specialization, with each species primarily pollinated by a single orchid-specific wasp species. In only two of the six rare species was the pollinator detected beyond the range of the orchid, At the scale of habitat patches, the pollinator of rare orchids occurred in fewer patches of otherwise suitable orchid habitat. Pollination rate was not significantly different between common and rare species. However, pollination rate was highest in small populations suggesting that pollinator-mediated rarity is likely to arise through patchy distribution of pollinators rather than infrequent pollen transfer in small populations. In five of the six rare species there was evidence that a specialized pollination system is contributing to rarity, demonstrating that conservation programs must prioritize the ecological requirements of pollinators.

Although organic carbon contents are commonly very low, loess and organic matter (LOM) thereof is regarded as important terrestrial archive for vegetation and climate during deposition. However, the LOM signal is prone to contamination by OM of other age and origin than the synsedimentary vegetation, e.g. by postsedimentary deep-rooting plants. We hypothesized that the influence of rhizosphere effects related to deep-rooting plants varies with depth in quality, quantity and distance to the former root. The 13 m thick late Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence at Nussloch (SW Germany) contains rhizoliths (calcified roots) of Holocene age. With the carbonatic encrustation leading to preservation of former root deposits, rhizoliths allow for assessment of rhizosphere processes that occurred during the root's lifetime. Several horizontal transects comprising rhizoliths, surrounding loess (rhizoloess) up to a distance of 11 cm from rhizoliths, and root-free reference loess from different depth intervals, were analyzed for their carbon (C), alkane and fatty acid (FA) composition. Alkane proxies like carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), as well as n-C-27/n-C-31 and n-C-29/n-C-31 ratios indicated grass vegetation as origin of LOM, while rhizoliths derived from woody vegetation. Several lipid molecular proxies, e.g. short chain/long chain alkanes, long chain alkane composition and long chain/very long chain FA, indicated the incorporation of considerable amounts of root and rhizomicrobial OM. The rhizosphere effect, i.e. postsedimentary overprint of initial LOM in the vicinity of roots, was not restricted to few mm around the former root, but notable to distances of at least 5 cm and possibly more. This was confirmed by X-ray tomography analyses enabling identification of small calcified root remains and non-calcified root channels in the former rhizosphere, which could not be identified under field conditions. In depth intervals with high rhizolith frequency, this entailed lateral overprint of large parts of loess, which in depths of 1.95 and 3.2 m below present surface can cover the whole loess due to extension of the former rhizosphere of >5 cm. Regarding the high rhizolith frequency (maximizing at 200 m(-2) at similar to 2.6 m depth) at Nussloch, these findings raise the importance of deep-rooting plants as potential source for significant postsedimentary overprint of loess-paleosol sequences.

There is recent concern that these communities may be lost as animals enter captive breeding programmes, due to changes in diet and/or exposure to environmental sources. However, empirical evidence documenting the effects of captivity and captive birth on gut communities is lacking. We conducted three studies to advance our knowledge in this area. First, we compared changes in microbial diversity of the gut communities of two species of woodrats (Neotoma albigula, a dietary generalist, and Neotoma stephensi, which specializes on juniper) before and after 6-9 months in captivity. Second, we investigated whether reintroduction of the natural diet of N. stephensi could restore microbial diversity. Third, we compared the microbial communities between offspring born in captivity and their mothers. We found that the dietary specialist, N. stephensi, lost a greater proportion of its native gut microbiota and overall diversity in response to captivity compared with N. albigula. Addition of the natural diet increased the proportion of the original microbiota but did not restore overall diversity in N. stephensi. Offspring of N. albigula more closely resembled their mothers compared with offspring-mother pairs of N. stephensi. This research suggests that the microbiota of dietary specialists may be more susceptible to captivity. Furthermore, this work highlights the need for further studies investigating the mechanisms underlying how loss of microbial diversity may vary between hosts and what an acceptable level of diversity loss may be to a host. This knowledge will aid conservation biologists in designing captive breeding programmes effective at maintaining microbial diversity.

Equations often have been developed using differing methods and applied only to certain species or isolated areas. We previously had compiled and combined (in meta-analysis) available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component dry-weight biomass for US trees. This had resulted in a set of 10 consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for US species, as well as equations for predicting biomass of tree components as proportions of total aboveground biomass. In this update of our published equation database and refinement of our model, we developed equations based on allometric scaling theory, using taxonomic groupings and wood specific gravity as surrogates for scaling parameters that we could not estimate. The new approach resulted in 35 theoretically based generalized equations (13 conifer, 18 hardwood, 4 woodland), compared with the previous empirically grouped 10. For trees from USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) plots, with forest types grouped into conifers and hardwoods, previous and updated equations produced nearly identical estimates that predicted 20 per cent higher biomass than FIA estimates. Differences were observed between previous and updated equation estimates when comparisons were made using individual FIA forest types.","[Chojnacky, David C.] Virginia Tech, Adjunct Fac, Forest Biometr Forest Resources & Environm Conser, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA; [Heath, Linda S.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Jenkins, Jennifer C.] US EPA, Off Air & Radiat, Climate Change Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA","Chojnacky, DC (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Adjunct Fac, Forest Biometr Forest Resources & Environm Conser, 144 Rees Pl, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA.",dchojnac@vt.edu,,,"US Joint Fire Science Program [07-3-1-05]; USDA Forest Service, Northern Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [07-3-1-05, 09-JV-1142305-128]","This work was supported by the US Joint Fire Science Program (project no. 07-3-1-05); and the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station (Joint Venture #09-JV-1142305-128, project no. 07-3-1-05).",,198,99,100,3,106,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,JAN,2014,87,1,,,SI,,129,151,,10.1093/forestry/cpt053,,,23,Forestry,Forestry,300CR,WOS:000330442500011,,Bronze,Y,N,10/31/19J,"Ding, X; Zhang, S; Wang, R; Liao, X; Li, S",,,,"Ding, X.; Zhang, S.; Wang, R.; Liao, X.; Li, S.",,,Exogenous labile C application enhances Fe-P utilization for mycorrhizal plants through iron-reducing bacteria in subtropical soil,JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mycorrhizal plants; Iron-reducing bacteria (IRB); Labile C input forms; Fe-P; Microbial biomass C/P (MBC/P),EXTRACTION METHOD; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; REDUCTION; GROWTH; FUNGI; CARBON; INOCULATION; FUMIGATION; SEDIMENTS; DYNAMICS,"In a greenhouse experiment, Medicago sativa was grown in iron-rich soil inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Funelliformis mosseae, FM) and/or iron (Fe) -reducing bacteria (IRB, Klebsiella pneumoniae strain L17) with three exogenous labile C input forms (no C source, as a single dose, and as a pulse) at rates of P0 and P5 (0 and 5 mg P2O5 kg(-1), KH2PO4), which is to understand the role of IRB in enhancing the Fe-P utilization with exogenous labile C in subtropical soil. The results showed when inoculated with IRB, labile C as a pulsed input significantly improved the mycorrhiza colonization and hyphal length density, and increased the shoot P content, microbial biomass C and glomalin content at P5 rate; meanwhile, the labile C input also promoted the Fe(II) production, when inoculated with IRB, labile C as a pulsed input increased the C/A extractable Fe(II), oxalate-extractable P and microbial biomass P content.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a key role in soil aggregate formation and stabilization. Here we quantitatively analyzed the importance of experimental settings as well as biotic and abiotic factors for the effectiveness of AMF to stabilize soil macroaggregates. We gathered 35 studies on AMF and soil aggregation and tested 13 predictor variables for their relevance with a boosted regression tree analysis and performed a meta-analysis, fitting individual random effects models for each variable. The overall mean effect of inoculation with AMF on soil aggregation was positive and predictor variable means were all in the range of beneficial effects. Pot studies and studies with sterilized sandy soil, near neutral soil pH, a pot size smaller than 2.5 kg and a duration between 2.2 and 5 months were more likely to result in stronger effects of AMF on soil aggregation than experiments in the field, with non-sterilized or fine textured soil or an acidic pH. This is the first study to quantitatively show that the effect of AMF inoculation on soil aggregation is positive and context dependent. Our findings can help to improve the use of this important ecosystem process, e.g. for inoculum application in restoration sites.","[Leifheit, Eva F.; Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Lehmann, Anika; Morris, E.

Allelopathic potential of litter, root exudates, and soils in successive rotations of Chinese fir plantations were detected. An allelochemical cyclic dipeptide (6-hydroxy-1,3-dimethyl-8-nonadecyl-[1,4]-diazocane-2,5-dione) from litter, root exudates, and soils in successive rotations was quantified. Extracts of leaf litter, fine root, and root exudates significantly inhibited the growth of Chinese fir germinants, and inhibition increased with successive rotations. Similar results were observed in the rhizosphere soil, basal soil, and bulk soil. The largest observed inhibition occurred in the rhizosphere soil. Furthermore, cyclic dipeptide was found in litter, root exudates, and soils, and the concentrations increased with successive rotations. The rhizosphere soil had the highest cyclic dipeptide level, followed by basal soil, while bulk soil contained the lowest concentration. There was a significant positive relationship between the inhibition of radicle growth of Chinese fir germinants and the concentration of cyclic dipeptide. Annual release of cyclic dipeptide through root exudation was 2.08-9.78 mol ha(-1) annum, but the annual release of cyclic dipeptide through leaf litter decomposition was lowered to 0.32-1.41 mol ha(-1) annum. Cyclic dipeptide which caused autoinhibition of Chinese fir may be released into the soil through litter decomposition and root exudation. Root exudates provided more contributions to soil cyclic dipeptide levels than litter in Chinese fir plantations.","[Chen, Long-Chi; Wang, Si-Long; Wang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Chen, Long-Chi; Wang, Si-Long] Chinese Acad Sci, Huitong Expt Stn Forest Ecol, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China; [Kong, Chui-Hua] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Kong, CH (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",kongch@cau.edu.cn,"Chen, Long-Chi/D-9983-2017; Wang, Peng/C-4029-2008; Kong, Chui-Hua/G-6002-2011","Chen, Long-Chi/0000-0003-1608-1987; Wang, Peng/0000-0002-0629-8835; Kong, Chui-Hua/0000-0002-8405-3083","National Basic Research Program of China (973 program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416905]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41030533, 30671663]","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973 program no. 2012CB416905) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 41030533 and 30671663).

The aims of this study were to reveal the effects of temperature on the nodulation dominancy of B. japonicum and B. elkanii and to clarify the relationship between the effects of temperature and the climate-dependent distribution of Bradyrhizobium species. A laboratory competition experiment was conducted between B. japonicum and B. elkanii strains isolated from the same temperate location in Nepal. A mixture of each strain was inoculated into sterilized vermiculite with or without soybean seeds, and inoculated samples were incubated at 33/27 (day/night) and 23/17 A degrees C. Relative populations in the non-rhizosphere, rhizosphere, and nodules were determined by competitive PCR using specific primers for each strain at 0, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after inoculation. Both separately inoculated B. japonicum and B. elkanii strains formed nodules at both temperatures. Under competitive conditions, B. japonicum strains dominated at low temperature; however, at high temperature, both strains achieved co-nodulation in 1 week, with B. elkanii dominating after 2 weeks. The relative populations of both strains were similar in the non-rhizosphere and rhizosphere at low temperature, but B. elkanii strains dominated in these regions at high temperature. The domination of B. japonicum strains in nodules at the low temperature appeared to be due to preferential infection, while the domination of B. elkanii strains at high temperature appeared to be due to the higher population of B. elkanii in the non-rhizosphere and rhizosphere, in addition to its domination in nodules after co-nodulation. The effects of temperature on the competition between B. japonicum and B. elkanii strains were remarkable and corresponded with the distribution of bradyrhizobial species in Nepal.","[Suzuki, Yuta; Adhikari, Dinesh; Itoh, Kazuhito; Suyama, Kousuke] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Adhikari, Dinesh] Nepal Agr Res Council, Kathmandu, Nepal","Itoh, K (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",itohkz@life.shimane-u.ac.jp,"Spaink, Herman P./S-3586-2017","Spaink, Herman P./0000-0003-4128-9501",,,,27,11,12,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2014,374,2-Jan,,,,,915,924,,10.1007/s11104-013-1924-5,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,277WE,WOS:000328849200068,,,,,10/31/19B,"Jaloviar, P; Kucbel, S; Saniga, M; Vencurik, J",,"Stefancik, I",,"Jaloviar, Peter; Kucbel, Stanislav; Saniga, Milan; Vencurik, Jaroslav",,,The fine root vertical distribution of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in natural forest stand,"SILVICULTURE IN CENTRAL EUROPE, 2014",,,Slovak,Proceedings Paper,"Conference on Silviculture in Central Europe, 2014",2014,"Zvolen, SLOVAKIA","Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res, Inst Zvolen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Prod",,old-growth forest; fine roots; root distribution; root competition,NORWAY SPRUCE; SCOTS PINE; COMPETITION; PLANT,"The study evaluates the quantity and distribution of European beech and silver fir fine roots (roots with the diameter under 2 mm) in old-growth fir-beech forest.

One method of estimating glomalin in soils is as glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP). In this study the role of GRSP in sequestering Pb and Cd was investigated in an in situ field experiment. The effect of metal sequestration on the subsequent decomposition of GRSP was also investigated. GRSP was determined using the Bradford method as total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP) and as easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP). After 140 days, GRSP bound Pb accounted for 0.21-1.78% of the total Pb, and GRSP bound Cd accounted for 038-0.98% of the total Cd content in the soil. However when compared on a soil organic matter (SOM) basis, only 4% of the Pb or Cd was bound to the GRSP fraction of the SOM compared with 40-54% of the Pb or Cd bound to the humin and fulvic acids in the SOM fraction. In soils contaminated with the highest levels of Pb and Cd, the T-GRSP (EE-GRSP) decomposition after 140 days was reduced by 8.0 (6.6)% and 7.0 (7.5)%, respectively, when compared with the controls. In the high Pb or Cd treatment groups we found that the fraction of metal bound to GRSP increased even though the total GRSP content declined over time. The mass ratio between Pb and GRSP-carbon changed from 2.3 to 271.4 mg (100 g)(-1) in all Pb levels soil, while with the high-Cd treatment group the mass ratio between Cd and GRSP-carbon (0.36 mg (100 g)(-1)) was higher than the mass ratio seen with Cd-bound humic acid fractions. Our in situ field study shows that while GRSP does bind Pb and Cd, in the soils we investigated, the levels are insignificant compared to soil organic matter such as humic and fulvic acids.

Quantification of the amount of carbon stored in forests presently is an important component in the implementation of the emerging carbon credit market mechanisms. This calls for appropriate allometric models predicting biomass which currently are scarce. The aim of this study was to develop above- and belowground allometric general and site-specific models for trees in miombo woodland. The data were collected from four sites in Tanzania and covers a wide range of conditions and tree sizes (diameters at breast height from 1.1 to 110 cm). Above- and belowground biomass models were developed from 167 and 80 sample trees, respectively. The model fitting showed that large parts of the variation (up to 97%) in biomass were explained by diameter at breast height and tree height. Since including tree height only marginally increased the explanation of the biomass variation (from 95% to 96-97% for aboveground biomass), the general recommendation is to apply the models with diameter at breast height only as an independent variable. The results also showed that the general models can be applied over a wide range of conditions in Tanzania. The comparison with previously developed models revealed that these models can probably also be applied for miombo woodland elsewhere in southeastern Africa if not used beyond the tree size range of the model data.

In a field experiment, we investigated the response of young beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) to extreme and repeated summer drought and the modulation of drought response patterns along the natural gradient of light availability at the study site. In autumn 2008, two-year-old, nursery derived beech - as used for forest conversion practices - was planted under a Norway spruce stand primarily opened through winter storm. Precipitation was manipulated in the growing seasons of 2009 through 2011, inducing a pronounced gradient of water availability. Individual drought-stress doses (DSD) and light doses (LD) were calculated for each beech sapling during the three growing seasons. Plant growth, CO2-assimilation rate and stomatal conductance were reduced with increasing drought stress, but facilitated by increasing light availability. Progressive acclimation to water and light limitation during the three years of the experiment led to a decreased drought and shade sensitivity of diameter growth. Water-use efficiency, root/shoot ratio and rooting depth, were increased with decreasing water availability. Mean fine root diameter and specific fine root length correlated positively with both DSD and LD. Proceeding low-light acclimation was indicated by progressively increasing specific leaf area and reduced leaf dark-respiration. Present results suggest that nursery-induced high-light acclimation of the beech saplings, exacerbated light limitation upon transplant and hence productivity decline under co-occurring water limitation.

We measured the root length density (RLD) and the rate of root production and mortality over 3 yr using minirhizotrons, and compared these rates with temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and plant area indices (PAI). We also measured the FRB and the necromass of fine roots four times per year for 2 yr using soil cores and calculated dry weight-based FRP and FRM. FRB in the uppermost 15 cm of the surface-soil layer accounted for 41-61% of the biomass up to 60 cm soil depth, and decreased with increasing soil depth. The biomass of fine roots with root diameters <0.5 mm was almost equivalent to that of roots measuring 0.5-2 mm in diameter. Sasa roots accounted for 59-88% of the total FRB. FRB did not fluctuate seasonally, whereas RLD did. The FRP rate was high in mid- to late summer and correlated significantly with air and soil temperatures, indicating that temperature affects FRP. However, the relationship between FRP and soil moisture was weak. FRP was significantly correlated with the PAI of oak trees and the increment in the PAI of Sasa, suggesting that endogenous factors also affect FRP. Depending on the method used to calculate turnover, mean FRP for the 3-year study period was 589 or 726 g m(2) yr(-1), accounting for 36% or 41% of forest net primary production, respectively. The results of this study illustrate the substantial seasonal and interannual fluctuations in FRP, and indicate that a significant proportion of assimilated carbon was allocated to below-ground root systems in an oak-Sasa stand.

Total biomass carbon (sum of all the pools) was significantly lower 1 year post-treatment than pre-treatment and returned to 97% of pre-treatment levels by 8 year post-treatment primarily from increases in the tree carbon pool. Prescribed fire reduced predicted wildfire emissions by 45% the first year after treatment and remained reduced through 8 year post-treatment (34%). Net carbon (total biomass minus simulated wildfire emissions) resulted in a source (10.4-15.4 Mg ha(-1)) when field-derived values were compared to simulated controls for all post-treatment time periods. However, the incidence of potential crown fire in the untreated simulations was at least double for the 2 year and 8 year post-treatment time periods than in the treated plots. We also compared field-derived estimates to simulated values using the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS). In our validation of FFE-FVS to predict carbon stocks, the model performed well for the total biomass carbon (4% difference); however, there was great variability within the individual carbon pools. Live tree carbon had the highest correlation between field-derived and simulated values, and dead tree carbon the lowest correlation and highest percent differences followed by herb and shrub carbon. The lack of trends and variability between the field-derived and simulated carbon pools other than total biomass indicate caution should be used when reporting carbon in the individual pools.

This paper investigates the effect of increased air humidity and understory composition on short root morphology and on the relative abundance of colonizing ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal associates in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) stands. Short root morphological traits of silver birch were analyzed at increased humidity and ambient conditions for two different understories (early-successional grasses and diverse ""forest"" understory) in three consecutive years (2009-2011). The fungal community was determined in 2010 (after three seasons of misting) using molecular methods. The study was conducted on the Free Air Humidity Manipulation (FAHM) experimental facility established in Estonia. Silver birches responded to the rise in air humidity by forming longer and thinner short roots, which can be interpreted as a morphological adaptation leading to an increase in the absorptive area. The response was stronger when humidification concurred with the species-poor understory of pioneer grasses. The inter- and intra-treatment variation in short root morphological parameters decreased by the third year. Using molecular methods, overall 64 EcM taxonomic units were distinguished. Hydrophilic fungal morphotypes dominated significantly in humidified plots, hydrophobic morphotypes in control plots. Our results suggest that rising air humidity causes a morphological stress response in EcM short roots. Young trees show the ability to adapt to climate change with great plasticity by modifying short root length, diameter and specific root length (SRL). Humidification leads to a shift in the fungal colonizers towards the dominance of hydrophilic taxa, which may alter ecosystem functioning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Relative to overstory vegetation, understory vegetation is overlooked in forest ecosystems; and the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil microbial communities are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to improve our knowledge of how understory removal and/or fertilization influence soil microbial communities. We conducted an experiment in which understory was removed or retained in plots with or without nitrogen fertilization in eucalyptus plantations; and we measured their effects on soil temperature, soil water content, and soil microbial communities (as indicated by phospholipid fatty acids). Understory removal increased soil temperature, decreased soil water content, decreased fungal biomass and decreased fungal to bacterial biomass (F:B) values. Additionally, fungal biomass correlated negatively with soil temperature. Nitrogen fertilization did not significantly affect soil temperature, soil water content, or soil microbial community. These findings suggest that the presence of understory is favorable for sustaining soil microclimates and acts as an important driver of soil microbial communities in eucalyptus plantations. Moreover, understory vegetations are important components and should not be removed from eucalyptus plantations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we use in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) coupled with a fluid reaction cell to image dissolution on the (010) face of brushite, CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O, in citrate-bearing solutions over a broad concentration range. We directly measure the dependence of molecular step retreat rate on citrate concentration at various pH values and ionic strengths, relevant to soil solution conditions. We find that low concentrations of citrate (10-100 mu M) induced a reduction in step retreat rates along both the [(1) over bar 00]Cc and [10 ($) over bar1]Cc directions. However, at higher concentrations (exceeding 0.1 mM), this inhibitory effect was reversed with step retreat speeds increasing rapidly. These results demonstrate that the concentration-dependent modulation of nanoscale Ca-P phase dissolution by citrate may be applied to analyze the controversial role of organic acids in enhancing Ca-P mineral dissolution in a more complex rhizosphere environment. These in situ observations may contribute to resolving the previously unrecognized interactions of root exudates (low molecular weight organic acids) and sparingly soluble Ca-P minerals.","[Qin, Lihong; Zhang, Wenjun; Lu, Jianwei; Wang, Lijun] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Stack, Andrew G.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Chem Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Wang, LJ (reprint author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",ljwang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Stack, Andrew/D-2580-2013","Stack, Andrew/0000-0003-4355-3679","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41071208]; Huazhong Agricultural University [2010BQ063, 2012MBDX014, 2011JQ008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2011PY150]; Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41071208) and a startup grant (2010BQ063) and two Independent Innovation Foundation (2012MBDX014, 2011JQ008) from the Huazhong Agricultural University to Lijun Wang.

The highly melanized and common ectomycorrhizal fungus, Cenococcum geophilum, is drought tolerant and abundant in water-stressed habitats, yet the responsible functional traits have not been identified. The production of melanin, a class of complex dark polymers found in fungal cell walls, may be a key functional trait to water stress tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we devised a series of experiments determining the effect of the melanin biosynthesis inhibitor, tricyclazole, on response to osmotic and desiccation stresses. Melanin inhibition only had negative effects on growth when C. geophilum isolates were subjected to osmotic and desiccation stress (-1.7 MPa and desiccated) but not under control conditions (-0.01 MPa and non-desiccated).

However, the effects of elevated CO2 and N deposition on soil respiration are not fully understood especially in subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China where ambient N deposition is high. In this study, we investigated the seasonal responses of soil respiration to elevated CO2 and N addition in young subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China using open-top chambers. Two CO2 treatment levels (i.e., ambient CO2 and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) and two N levels (i.e., ambient and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were considered. Forty-eight 1-2 years old seedlings (eight seedlings per each of 6 species) were planted in each chamber. In the wet season, soil respiration significantly enhanced under elevated CO2 and N addition with no interactive effect. There was not significant relationship between treatment-enhanced soil respiration and soil moisture in the wet season, suggesting that increases in soil respiration resulted in large part from treatment-induced increases in tree growth and C inputs. In the dry season, soil respiration significantly enhanced under elevated CO2, but did not significantly change under N addition. The N-induced change in soil respiration negatively corrected with soil moisture in the dry season, indicating that decrease in soil moisture under N addition, together with increase in tree growth interactively resulted in negligible net change in soil respiration. Our results highlighted the seasonal importance of environmental controls under elevated CO2 and N deposition in the assessment of soil C sequestration potential in subtropical forest ecosystems in southern China.

We added CaCl2 to isolate the effect of Ca deposition by Sahara dust to tropical montane forest from the simultaneously occurring pH effect. We examined components of the Ca cycle at four control plots and four plots with added Ca (2 x 5kg ha(-1) Ca annually as CaCl2) in a random arrangement. Between August 2007 and December 2009 (four applications of Ca), we determined Ca concentrations and fluxes in litter leachate, mineral soil solution (0.15 and 0.30 m depths), throughfall, and fine litterfall and Al concentrations and speciation in soil solutions. After 1 y of Ca addition, we assessed fine-root biomass, leaf area, and tree growth. Only < 3% of the applied Ca leached below the acid organic layer (pH 3.5-4.8). The added CaCl2 did not change electrical conductivity in the root zone after 2 y. In the second year of fertilization, Ca retention in the canopy of the Ca treatment tended to decrease relative to the control. After 2 y, 21% of the applied Ca was recycled to soil with throughfall and litterfall. One year after the first Ca addition, fine-root biomass had decreased significantly. Decreasing fine-root biomass might be attributed to a direct or an indirect beneficial effect of Ca on the soil decomposer community. Because of almost complete association of Al with dissolved organic matter and high free Ca2+ : Al3+ activity ratios in solution of all plots, Al toxicity was unlikely. We conclude that the added Ca was retained in the system and had beneficial effects on some plants.","[Wullaert, Hans] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geog, Earth Syst Sci Res Ctr, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Bigalke, Moritz; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Cumbicus, Nixon] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Inst Ecol, Loja, Ecuador; [Valarezo, Carlos] Univ Nacl Loja, Direcc Gen Invest Ciudadela Univ Guillermo Falcon, Sect La Argelia, Loja, Ecuador","Wilcke, W (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",wolfgang.wilcke@giub.unibe.ch,"Bigalke, Moritz/M-6089-2013; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Homeier, Jurgen/G-1662-2011","Bigalke, Moritz/0000-0002-6793-6159; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Homeier, Jurgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Cumbicus, Nixon/0000-0002-4880-6607","DAAD-RISE program; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 816, Wi 1601/8-1, Le 762/10-1]","Hans Wullaert thanks the DAAD-RISE program which supported his work with the internship of Katelyn Reczek.

However there is still very little known about the role of soil microbial communities in their invasion success in novel ranges. We examined the role of the soil microbial community in the invasion success of four Acacia species (A. cyclops, A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon and A. saligna) and a close relative Paraserianthes lophantha, introduced into novel regions within Australia using a ""black-box"" approach. Seed and soil material were collected from multiple populations within each species' native and introduced range within Australia and used in a plant-soil feedback experiment to assess the effect of the soil microbial community on plant growth and nodulation. We found no effect, either positive or negative, of soil origin on species' performance, however there was a significant interaction between species and seed origin. Seed origin had a significant effect on the biomass of two species, A. cyclops and A. saligna. A. cyclops plants from the native range performed better across all soils than plants from the introduced range. The opposite trend was observed for A. saligna, with plants from the introduced range performing better overall than plants from the native range. Seed or soil origin did not have a significant effect on the presence and number of nodules suggesting that rhizobia do not constrain the invasion success of these legumes. Our results suggest that plant-soil feedbacks are unlikely to have played a significant role in the invasion success of these five species introduced into novel regions within Australia. This may be due to the widespread occurrence of acacias and their associated soil microbial communities throughout the Australian continent.","[Birnbaum, C.; Leishman, M.

In this study, we investigated differences in biomass accumulation and allometric relationships between tree diameter and biomass of above and belowground components in two populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (progeny of clonal seed orchards) differing in stem growth. At a common tree diameter, populations differed in accumulated belowground biomass, but not in total tree or aboveground components' biomass. Populations also differed in the root:shoot ratio and proportional allocation of biomass into stems. However, proportional allocation to stem mass decreased from smaller to larger trees, contrary to branch and foliage, which likely reflected a response to competition in the stand. The allometric equations predicted well the total tree, aboveground, and stem biomass independently of population, but separate equations were required for estimation of belowground biomass for the two populations. These results suggest that total stand and aboveground biomass in young Scots pine stands could be estimated without accounting for genetic component. Comparison of literature data with estimates obtained using our allometric equations indicate that equations were site-specific and should not be generalized to other sites, unless for rough approximation of aboveground biomass. More research is required for a more reliable assessment of genetic effect on allometric relationships for belowground biomass.","[Chmura, Daniel J.; Guzicka, Marzenna; Rozkowski, Roman; Chalupka, Wladyslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland","Chmura, DJ (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Ul Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",djchmura@man.poznan.pl,"Chmura, Daniel J/H-6245-2011","Chmura, Daniel J/0000-0002-8776-1472; Rozkowski, Roman/0000-0002-6555-4835","General Directorate of State Forests in Warsaw, Poland [OR/2717/3/11]; Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences","This study was partially funded by the General Directorate of State Forests in Warsaw, Poland [grant no.

The mosaic genomes that encode these capacities are accountable for the abilities of environmental microbes to survive and thrive in highly complex systems such as soil and the rhizosphere. Whereas credits are to be given to traditional microbiology studies, e.g. with rhizobia and their interaction with the plant, an explosive enhancement of our understanding of the plant-microorganism interactive system has been recently achieved by the broad application of the molecular toolbox, in particular high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. The latter have allowed to access thousands to millions of microbial phylotypes and functions at relatively low cost and effort. While such techniques have improved the accessibility of the taxonomic and functional diversity of rhizosphere and soil microbial communities, detailed insights into organismal ecology and physiology (reflecting the behaviour of populations of cells) within the community in the natural environment are still required. In this review, we first examine the current 'state-of-the-art' of rhizosphere ecology studies and what HTS strategies have added to our understanding of the system. We posit that our capacity to develop and test refined ecological hypotheses is hindered if we solely depend on deep-sequencing methods. Plant-soil-microorganism systems represent one of the most intriguing 'playgrounds' for assessments of ecological theories, since they offer a myriad of ways to investigate ecological interactions (i.e. intra- and inter-specifically), physiological and behavioural traits. In addition, the evolutionary processes that lead to innovation in the microbiota are likely prominent in the rhizosphere. Thus, there is a perceived need to shift our attention from the HTS studies, that extensively map the local microbiota in an overall fashion, to studies focusing on as-yet-unaddressed fundamental questions about the plant-soil microbiota system. Such a paradigm shift will certainly assist us in the unravelling of the building blocks of rhizosphere (and soil) microbial communities, as well as form a basis for targeted manipulation of these in their natural settings.","[Dini-Andreote, Francisco; van Elsas, Jan Dirk] Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Dept Microbial Ecol, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","Dini-Andreote, F (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Dept Microbial Ecol, Nijenborgh 7, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",f.dini.andreote@rug.nl,"Dini-Andreote, Francisco/M-6176-2017","Dini-Andreote, Francisco/0000-0002-6654-0769",,,,122,14,16,2,172,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2013,373,2-Jan,,,,,1,15,,10.1007/s11104-013-1687-z,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,257QK,WOS:000327400400001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chen, CC; Beauregard, F; Cote, B; Belanger, N; Courchesne, F; Hendershot, WH",,,,"Chen, Ching-Chih; Beauregard, Frieda; Cote, Benoit; Belanger, Nicolas; Courchesne, Francois; Hendershot, William H.",,,Partitioning of the source of leaf calcium of American beech and sugar maple using leaf Ca/Sr ratios: a predominantly surficial but variable depth of Ca uptake,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aluminum; Beech; Calcium uptake; Mass balance; Strontium; Sugar maple,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; SR-87/SR-86 RATIOS; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; HARDWOOD FORESTS; SOUTHERN QUEBEC; ACID DEPOSITION; EDAPHIC FACTORS; EASTERN CANADA; SOIL CHEMISTRY; SR ISOTOPES,"Reduced availability of calcium (Ca) has been linked to maple forest decline. We therefore aimed at assessing the contribution of the different soil horizons to leaf Ca of competing beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) to better understand the dynamics of Ca uptake. Leaf Ca was partitioned using the Ca/Sr ratio approach in two mature forests of southern Quebec. A mass balance was also used at one site to validate the results obtained with the Ca/Sr approach. The L and F horizons contributed most of the leaf Ca of beech and maple with likely small contributions from the upper B and/or H/Ahe horizons. Leaf Ca/Sr ratios of beech were however more variable than those of maple. Using a mass balance, the organic horizons and upper mineral soil horizons were found to provide ca. 80 and 20 % of tree Ca uptake, respectively. Beech and maple Ca uptake depth apportionment is on average similar but beech is likely more plastic in sourcing soil Ca. The low contribution of the mineral soil to leaf Ca at our sites can be linked to less favorable conditions for Ca uptake likely associated with low Ca/Al ratios.","[Chen, Ching-Chih; Cote, Benoit; Hendershot, William H.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Beauregard, Frieda] McGill Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Belanger, Nicolas] Univ Quebec, Teluq, UER Sci & Technol, Montreal, PQ H2X 3P2, Canada; [Courchesne, Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B8, Canada; [Cote, Benoit; Belanger, Nicolas] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Cote, B (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Macdonald Campus,21,111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",benoit.cote@mcgill.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les TechnologiesFQRNT,"We would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies for funding, and Helene Lalande, Marie-Claude Turmel, Alain Brousseau, Erin Gertzen, Anne Murphy, Pierre-Olivier Quesnel, and Susan Beauregard for help in the field and in the laboratory.",,52,1,1,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2013,373,2-Jan,,,,,229,242,,10.1007/s11104-013-1787-9,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,257QK,WOS:000327400400016,,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Tanikawa, T; Hirano, Y; Dannoura, M; Yamase, K; Aono, K; Ishii, M; Igarashi, T; Ikeno, H; Kanazawa, Y",,,,"Tanikawa, Toko; Hirano, Yasuhiro; Dannoura, Masako; Yamase, Keitarou; Aono, Kenji; Ishii, Masahiro; Igarashi, Tetsurou; Ikeno, Hidetoshi; Kanazawa, Yoichi",,,Root orientation can affect detection accuracy of ground-penetrating radar,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon storage; Coarse root; Grid transect; Nondestructive root method; Root angle; Root diameter,TREE ROOTS; BIOMASS; GROWTH; CARBON,"Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied to detect coarse tree roots. The horizontal angle of a root crossing a scanning line is a factor that affects both root detection and waveform parameter values. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the influence of root orientation (x, degree) on two major waveform parameters, amplitude area (A, dB x ns) and time interval between zero crossings (T, ns). We scanned four diameter classes of dowels in a sandy bed as simulated roots using a 900 MHz antenna from multiple angles to clarify the relationships between the parameters and x. Angle x strongly affected reflection images and A values. The variation in A(x) fitted a sinusoidal waveform, whereas T was independent of x. The value of A scanning at 90A degrees was estimated by A values of arbitrary x in two orthogonal transects. The sum of T in all reflected waveforms showed a significant linear correlation with dowel diameter. We clarified that root orientation dramatically affected root detection and A values. The sum of T of all reflected waveforms was a suitable parameter for estimating root diameter. Applying grid transects can overcome the effects of root orientation.","[Tanikawa, Toko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yamase, Keitarou] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, Shiso 6712515, Japan; [Aono, Kenji; Ishii, Masahiro; Igarashi, Tetsurou] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd KANSO TECHNOS, Osaka 5410052, Japan; [Ikeno, Hidetoshi] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Kanazawa, Yoichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Tanikawa, T (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6120855, Japan.",tanikawa@affrc.go.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014","Tanikawa, Toko/0000-0002-6042-8071; Yamase, Keitaro/0000-0002-2689-0633","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [22380090, 25252027]; Program for Supporting Activities for Female Researchers; MEXT's Special Coordination Fund for Promoting Science and Technology","We thank D.

Lotus japonicus (L.) was grown in a low-P soil with (a) no additional P, (b) homogeneous P (28 mg pot(-1)), (c) low heterogeneous P (9.3 mg pot(-1)), and (d) high heterogeneous P (28 mg pot(-1)). Each P treatment was combined with one of three mycorrhiza treatments: no mycorrhizae, Glomus intraradices, indigenous AMF. Real-time PCR was used to assess the abundance of G. intraradices and the indigeneous AMF G. mosseae and G. claroideum. Mycorrhization and P fertilization strongly increased plant growth. Homogeneous P supply enhanced growth in both mycorrhizal treatments, while heterogeneous P fertilization increased biomass production only in treatments with indigenous AMF inoculation. Preferential root allocation into P-enriched soil was significant only in absence of AMF. The abundance of AMF species was similar in P-enriched and unfertilized soil patches. Mycorrhization may completely override preferential root growth responses of plants to P- patchiness in soil. The advantage of this effect for the plants is to give roots more freedom to forage for other resources in demand for growth and to adapt to variable soil conditions.","[Felderer, Bernd; Schulin, Rainer] ETH, Soil Protect Grp, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Jansa, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, CR-14220 Prague, Czech Republic","Felderer, B (reprint author), ETH, Soil Protect Grp, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",bernd.felderer@env.ethz.ch,"Jansa, Jan/H-3161-2014","Jansa, Jan/0000-0002-0331-1774","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Ministry of Science, Research and Culture of Brandenburg (MWFK, Potsdam)","The study was part of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 38 (Gerwin et al. 2009).

However, endophytic bacteria (other than rhizobia) colonizing root nodules in legumes have been rarely analyzed. The present study aimed to examine the colonization and spread of gfp-tagged Paenibacillus polymyxa in soybean plants under gnobiotic conditions. Inoculation with gfp-tagged Paenibacillus. polymyxa HKA -15 alone and in combination with Bradyrhizobium japonicum were done on soybean seedlings. In situ localization was detected through confocal microscopy and PCR. Inoculation with P. polymyxa-gfp strain alone and in combination with B. japonicum DS-1 had a stimulatory effect on the plant growth. There was an increase in shoot (7.2 %) and root dry weights (14.5 %) when the two strains were co - inoculated over that of B. japonicum inoculation alone. In vivo simultaneous visualization using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) showed the localization of the gfp-tagged P. polymyxa cells in the root nodules and its spread in the root tissue, both tap as well as lateral roots. Systemic spread into aerial tissue did not occur as indicated by the absence of bacteria. CLSM observations of the presence of gfp-tagged P. polymyxa in the nodule and roots tissues was corroborated with PCR amplification of the gfp-gene from these tissues. CLSM and PCR methods confirmed that P. polymyxa invades roots and root nodules of soybean, but the spread is restricted to root tissue only. The strain improves plant growth when inoculated singly or in combination with B. japonicum.","[Annapurna, Kannepalli; Ramadoss, Dhanushkodi; Bose, Pranita; VithalKumar, Lakkineni] Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, New Delhi 110012, India","Annapurna, K (reprint author), Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Microbiol, New Delhi 110012, India.",annapurna93@yahoo.co.in,,,"Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaGovernment of India [BT/PR11468/AGR/21/274/2008]","The authors thank Dr. S.

Since most traits used relate to aboveground plant organs we aim to explore the indicative value of root traits. We examined the response of root traits (specific root length [SRL], specific root surface area [SRA], root diameter [RD], root tissue mass density [TMD], root N concentration) in six grassland species (3 grasses, 3 herbs) to four management regimes (low vs. high mowing frequency; no fertilization vs. high NPK fertilization). The replicated experiment in temperate grassland with long continuity simulated the increase in grassland management intensity in the past 50 years in Central Europe. Increasing mowing frequency (one vs. three cuts per year) led to no significant root trait changes. NPK fertilization resulted in considerable trait shifts with all species responding in the same direction (higher SRL, SRA and N concentration, lower TMD) but at different magnitude. Fertilization-driven increases in SRA were mainly caused by lowered tissue density while root diameter reduction was the main driver of SRL increases. We conclude that root morphological traits may be used as valuable indicators of environmental change and increasing fertilization in grasslands.","[Leuschner, Christoph; Gebel, Stefanie] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Rose, Laura] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Rose, L (reprint author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",l.rose@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Rose, Laura/0000-0003-4523-4145",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; Niedersachsisches Vorab,"This study is part of the Cluster of Excellence 'Functional Biodiversity Research', funded by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony and the ""Niedersachsisches Vorab"".

This study examined the potential relationship between foliar delta N-15 and depth of plant N acquisition (surface organic vs. mineral soil) and nitrification as conifer stands develop following stand-replacing wildfire. We measured foliar delta N-15 along an 18-site chronosequence of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands, 1 to 72 years in age post-wildfire. Foliar delta N-15 was compared to total delta N-15 of the organic (Oe + Oa) and mineral (0-15 cm) soil horizons, and organic horizon N mineralization and nitrification as functions of total mineralization. Foliar delta N-15 declined with stand age, yet wildfire effects were heterogeneous. Jack pine seedlings on burned, mineral soil patches in the youngest stand were significantly more enriched than those on unburned, organic patches (P = 0.007). High foliar values in the youngest stands relative to mineral-horizon delta N-15 indicate that nitrification also likely contributed to seedling enrichment. Our results suggest jack pine seedlings on burned patches obtain N from the mineral soil with potentially high nitrification rates, whereas seedlings on unburned patches and increasingly N-limited, mature jack pine acquire relatively more N from organic horizons.","[LeDuc, Stephen D.; Rothstein, David E.; Yermakov, Zhanna; Spaulding, Susan E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry & Ecol, Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","LeDuc, SD (reprint author), US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, 1200 Penn Ave NW,ORD NCEA 8623-P, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",leduc.stephen@epa.gov,,"Rothstein, David E/0000-0002-8426-9933","Michigan Botanical Society, Michigan State University's Biogeochemistry Environmental Research Initiative; Sustainable Michigan Endowed Project; Land Policy Institute at Michigan State University","Personnel of the USDA-Forest Service and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources provided access to field sites and logistical help.

This study was performed to determine the relationship between C and N metabolism in cowpea nodules inoculated with only Bradyrhizobium sp. or with double and triple combinations of Bradyrhizobium sp., and two PGPB, Paenibacillus graminis and Paenibacillus durus during two critical phases of nodule development (flowering and beginning of senescence). The triple inoculation (Bradyrhizobium sp and two PGPB) induced higher N content in nodules, total-N accumulation per plant and shoot dry weight compared with other combinations at the beginning of senescence. This increased N performance was positively correlated with the nodule sucrose content but not with the content of total soluble carbohydrates, reduced sugars and starch. The higher BNF under triple inoculation conditions was not significantly associated with sucrose synthase activity but was slightly associated with soluble acid invertase activity in nodules at the beginning of senescence. These enzymes exhibited opposite responses between flowering and the beginning of senescence in all treatments. Glutamate synthase, glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase were stimulated by double (Bradyrhizobium sp. + P. durus) and triple inoculation compared with other treatments. Our data revealed that inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. and PGPB is favorable for BNF activity in cowpeas.

We provide a case study of the U.S. Southwest to investigate the interactions among forest restoration treatments that alter stand density, tree growth and drought resistance in trees of different size classes. Using cores taken from five positions in large trees (coarse roots, breast height, base of live crown, midcrown branch and treetop) and breast height in small trees, we investigated how radial growth response to thinning and precipitation availability varied in 72 ponderosa pines Pinus ponderosa Dougl. in northern Arizona. Ten years after thinning, growth of small trees did not respond significantly to thinning, whereas growth of large trees increased following moderate and heaving thinning, and this response was similar across within-tree core sample positions. The intensity of thinning treatment did not significantly affect dry-year growth in small trees. In large trees, dry-year growth after thinning was maintained at pre-thinning levels in moderate and heavy thinning treatments but decreased in the light thinning and control treatments. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that more aggressive thinning treatments used for forest restoration stimulate growth throughout large residual trees from coarse roots to branches and also improve drought resistance, providing a greater resilience to future climate-related stress. These responses to treatment are more pronounced in large trees than small trees. Forest thinning is therefore recommended in systems that are likely to experience increased temperature and decreased precipitation as a result of climate change.","[Kerhoulas, Lucy P.; Koch, George W.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Kolb, Thomas E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hurteau, Matthew D.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Kerhoulas, LP (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Dept Biol Sci, POB 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",lucykerhoulas@yahoo.com,"Hurteau, Matthew D/D-2301-2009","Hurteau, Matthew D/0000-0001-8457-8974",United States Department of Energy Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists; Science Foundation Arizona [CAA 0237-08],"A Graduate Fellowship from The United States Department of Energy Office of Science funded the majority of this research.

In the present study, the effects of management practices on root (0.5 a parts per thousand currency sign o < 20 mm) spatial distribution were examined in a 40-year-old coppice stand (CpS 1968) and other two stands converted from coppice to thinned high forest in 1994 (CvS 1994) and 2004 (CvS 2004), respectively. The use of a semi-automatic digitising device approach was compared with a conventional root mapping method in order to estimate the time per person required from fieldwork to the final digital map. In July 2009, six trench walls per stand were established according to tree density, i.e. as equidistant as possible from all surrounding trees. Findings highlighted differences between the stands with CvS 1994 showing a lower number of small roots (2 a parts per thousand currency sign o < 5 mm), a higher mean cross-sectional area (CSA) of coarse roots (5 a parts per thousand currency sign o < 20 mm) and different root depth distribution as compared to CpS 1968 and CvS 2004 whose values were close to each other. The three diameter classes selected in this study showed significant relationships in terms of number of roots, scaling down from coarse- to small- and fine-roots. Forest management practices significantly affected only the number of small roots. The number of fine roots (0.5 a parts per thousand currency sign o < 2 mm) was isometrically related to their root length density (RLD, cm cm(-3)). No relationship occurred with RLD of very fine roots (o < 0.5 mm). In conclusion, forest management practices in terms of conversion thinnings significantly affected belowground biomass distribution of beech forest in space and time. In particular, frequency of coarse roots was related to the stand tree density, frequency of small roots was related to the cutting age. Size of coarse roots was related to tree density but only several years after felling. The allometric relationship occurring between fine- and small-roots highlighted how fine root number and RLD were only indirectly affected by forest management practices. These findings suggest that future investigations on the effect of forest thinning practices on fine-root traits like number, length and biomass several years after felling cannot ignore those on small roots.","[Di Iorio, Antonino; Montagnoli, Antonio; Terzaghi, Mattia; Chiatante, Donato] Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci DBSV, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Scippa, Gabriella Stefania] Univ Molise, Dept Sci & Technol Environm & Terr DISTAT, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy","Di Iorio, A (reprint author), Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci DBSV, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",antonino.diiorio@uninsubria.it,"Montagnoli, Antonio/V-1724-2019; Di Iorio, Antonino/A-8699-2013; CHIATANTE, DONATO/B-8783-2015; SCIPPA, GABRIELLA/F-6007-2012","CHIATANTE, DONATO/0000-0003-4854-5408; SCIPPA, GABRIELLA/0000-0003-0573-1235; Terzaghi, Mattia/0000-0002-8803-7726","Italian Ministry of Environment; Ministry of Education, Universities and ResearchMinistero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR); Italian Botanic Society Onlus","We thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive and insightful comments on the first version of this manuscript.

After 4 years, seedlings were harvested and measured for height, stem diameter, leaf area, structural biomass, carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll and carbohydrate levels of needles, branches, stem and roots. At low density, warming increased height, stem diameter, total leaf area biomass production and carbohydrate concentration per seedling, while it decreased C/N ratio for all plant parts, but did not affect chlorophyll content. By contrast, at high density, although warming increased biomass and total leaf area, it did not affect plant height and stem diameter. At the same time, it had different effects on chlorophyll content, C/N ratio and carbohydrate levels among plant parts. On the other hand, high density limited plant growth and altered resource allocation pattern. Our study demonstrates that planting densities decreased the temperature-induced growth enhancement of P. purpurea seedlings and the effects of warming on resource allocation not only showed density-dependence, but also vary with tissue age classes and root diameter; the responses of plants to elevated temperature, acquired from plants growing as individuals, may not be applicable to plants grown under intraspecific competition as typically found in the field.","[Wang, Jinchuang] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinchuang; Bughio, Mansoor Ahmed; Jia, Wei] China Agr Univ, MOE Lab Plant Soil Interact, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinchuang; Bughio, Mansoor Ahmed; Jia, Wei] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Duan, Baoli; Zhang, Yuanbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Zhang, YB (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",zhangyb@imde.ac.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270649, 31270650]; Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [SDSQB-2012-01]","The financial support was provided by the Natural Science Foundation of China(31270649,31270650) and the Youth Talent Team Program of Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SDSQB-2012-01).",,38,3,3,0,50,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Ecosystem engineers and other functional biodiversity in soils can be influenced directly by such change and this in turn can affect key soil functions. Here, we employ meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of changes in land use and land management across a range of successional/extensification transitions (conventional arable -> no or reduced tillage -> grassland -> wooded land) on community metrics for two functionally important soil taxa, earthworms and fungi. An analysis of the relationships between community change and soil structural properties was also included. Results: Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased earthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity and later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such as introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all changes, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether woodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on woodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during conversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil structure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group composition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on tillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were positively associated with soil microaggregate stability. Conclusions: These findings raise the potential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation to regulation of soil structure and water flow.","[Spurgeon, David J.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Keith, Aidan M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England; [Schmidt, Olaf] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Lammertsma, Dennis R.; Faber, Jack H.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Spurgeon, DJ (reprint author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg,Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",dasp@ceh.ac.uk,"Schmidt, Olaf/P-1438-2019; Spurgeon, David J/E-9466-2010; Schmidt, Olaf/A-9670-2008","Schmidt, Olaf/0000-0003-0098-7960; Schmidt, Olaf/0000-0003-0098-7960","European Commission within the EcoFINDERS project [FP7-264465]; strategic research program KBIV ""Sustainable spatial development of ecosystems, landscapes, seas and regions""; Dutch Ministry of Economic AffairsMinistry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [CEH010021, ceh020009]","This work was supported by the European Commission within the EcoFINDERS project (FP7-264465) and partly by the strategic research program KBIV ""Sustainable spatial development of ecosystems, landscapes, seas and regions"" which is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and carried out by Wageningen University and Research Centre.

We found morphologically similar few AMF spores from rhizosphere of P. euphratica under drought stress. The average AMF spore densities were 53/50 and 32/50g in air dried soil from rhizosphere of mature and seedling of P. euphratica, respectively. The AMF spores were simple and Glomus mosseae in nature, identified by traditional morphological methods and molecular techniques. The G. mosseae fungal spores formed mainly in three different types: alone in the soil, inside of the roots or sporangium. The hypha was single and funnel-shaped at the site of attachment. By optical microscopic observation, the vesicular structures demonstrated a formation by AMF inside the roots of P. euphratica tree. The molecular analysis data showed that a mycorrhizal symbiont was established by G. mosseae associated with P. euphratica root. Moreover, the AMF colonization rate and the infection intensity were not significant high. Specifically, the average colonization frequency (F%) and mycorrhizal infection intensity (M%) were 8.45%, 2.9% for the mature, and 8.62%, 0.3% for the young seedlings of P. euphratica, respectively.

The restoration of degraded drylands is commonly initiated by restoring the vegetation using plantations of tree/shrub seedlings. We conducted a meta-analysis of published field experiments in drylands to analyze and compare the effects of different ecotechnological techniques (nursery mycorrhization, treeshelters, organic amendments, hydrogels and the combined use of mycorrhization and organic amendments) on the survival and growth of seedlings of woody species used during restoration activities. We also evaluated how these effects were influenced by the planting method used, and by the duration of the experiments. We gathered results from 1207 case studies from 88 studies conducted in 14 countries. Our analyses indicate that the inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi (mycorrhization) in the nursery (alone, or in combination with organic amendments) and the use of treeshelters were the most effective treatments for enhancing both the survival and growth of the planted seedlings. The use of organic amendments by themselves did not increase seedling survival. The combined use of mycorrhization and organic amendments in the field improved the results when compared to the use of organic amendments alone. The analysis of hydrophilic gels and organic amendments revealed evidence of publication bias, so more studies are needed before any generalization on their effects on seedling establishment can be made. The planting method influenced the effects of some of the treatments evaluated, though this response varied depending on the seedling performance variable considered. The length of the study was negatively related to growth variables in treatments including organic amendments. Our results provide general trends and guidelines for researchers and practitioners involved in dryland restoration, which can be used to maximize the benefits provided by the ecotechnological techniques evaluated.

We reviewed and synthesized current knowledge of tree species effects on SOC stocks in temperate and boreal forests based on common garden, retrospective paired stand and retrospective single-tree studies. There was evidence of consistent tree species effects on SOC stocks. Effects were clearest for forest floor C stocks (23 of 24 studies) with consistent differences for tree genera common to European and North American temperate and boreal forests. Support for generalization of tree species effects on mineral soil C stocks was more limited, but significant effects were found in 13 of 22 studies that measured mineral soil C. Proportional differences in forest floor and mineral soil C stocks among tree species suggested that C stocks can be increased by 200-500% in forest floors and by 40-50% in top mineral soil by tree species change. However, these proportional differences within forest floors and mineral soils are not always additive: the C distribution between forest floor and mineral soil rather than total C stock tends to differ among tree species within temperate forests. This suggests that some species may be better engineers for sequestration of C in stable form in the mineral soil, but it is unclear whether the key mechanism is root litter input or macrofauna activity. Tree species effects on SOC in targeted experiments were most consistent with results from large-scale inventories for forest floor C stocks whereas mineral soil C stocks appeared to be stronger influenced by soil type or climate than by tree species at regional or national scales. Although little studied, there are indications that higher tree species diversity could lead to higher SOC stocks but the role of tree species diversity per se vs. species identity effects needs to be disentangled in rigorous experimental designs. For targeted use of tree species to sequester soil C we must identify the processes related to C input and output, particularly belowground, that control SOC stock differences. We should also study forms and stability of C along with bulk C stocks to assess whether certain broadleaves store C in more stable form. Joint cooperation is needed to support syntheses and process-oriented work on tree species and SOC, e.g. through an international network of common garden experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Minirhizotron tubes were installed in 2006 and root images were taken in 2007-2010. Soil cores were used to estimate fine root biomass. Soil samples were taken from the humus layer and from 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm and 20 to 30 cm depth in the mineral soil. Only images from the humus layer and the upper 10 cm of mineral soil were included in root analysis. Spruce has a higher aboveground production than pine and birch in southern Sweden and this was reflected in larger fine root biomass as well as higher fine root biomass production. The annual tree fine root biomass production (humus and 0-30 cm in mineral soil) was 73, 78 and 284 g m(-2) in pine, birch and spruce stands, respectively. Thicker fine roots tended to live longer. The majority of the fine roots were thinner than 0.5 mm in diameter, with a turnover rate (KM) of 0.4 year(-1).

This assessment was carried out across soil depths and subsystems in a forest ecosystem. Major differences in the contribution of microbial processes (CMP%) were found between soil layers and subsystems, corresponding with differences in soil organic matter and Al and Fe oxide contents. CMP% significantly decreased with increasing soil depth (from 87-100% in the forest floor to 2-16% in the 90-120 cm mineral soil layer). Tree fine roots were mostly concentrated in the top soil layers where microbial processes dominated. Consequently, estimates of CMP% in the entire soil profile were also affected by the vertical distribution of tree fine roots. We assumed that including fine root densities leads to a more correct estimation of the role of microbial processes (CMP% = 31-52% in the entire soil profile, up to 75% in one particular site). To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the relative contributions of the different processes involved in replenishing the soil solution with phosphate ions based on soil properties and fine root distribution.

In the Arctic, a region containing globally important stores of soil carbon, and where the most rapid climate change is expected over the coming century, plant communities have on average sixfold more biomass below ground than above ground, but knowledge of the root carbon pool sizes and turnover rates is limited. Here, we show that across eight plant communities, there is a significant positive relationship between leaf and fine root turnover rates (r(2)=0.68, P<0.05), and that the turnover rates of both leaf (r(2)=0.63, P<0.05) and fine root (r(2)=0.55, P<0.05) pools are strongly correlated with leaf area index (LAI, leaf area per unit ground area). This coupling of root and leaf dynamics supports the theory of a whole-plant economics spectrum. We also show that the size of the fine root carbon pool initially increases linearly with increasing LAI, and then levels off at LAI=1m(2)m(-2), suggesting a functional balance between investment in leaves and fine roots at the whole community scale. These ecological relationships not only demonstrate close links between above and below-ground plant carbon dynamics but also allow plant carbon pool sizes and their turnover rates to be predicted from the single readily quantifiable (and remotely sensed) parameter of LAI, including the possibility of estimating root data from satellites.","[Sloan, Victoria L.; Fletcher, Benjamin J.; Phoenix, Gareth K.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Press, Malcolm C.] Coll Life & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland","Sloan, VL (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, 1 Bethel Valley Rd,Bldg 2040,MS 6301, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",sloanvl@ornl.gov,"Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107","NERC as part of the ABACUS-IPY consortiumNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D005884/1]; NERC Blue Skies studentship [NER/S/A/2006/14202]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D005795/1, NE/D005884/1]","Funding was provided by NERC Grant NE/D005884/1 as part of the ABACUS-IPY consortium and NERC Blue Skies studentship NER/S/A/2006/14202.

Global N enrichment has greatly changed soil C:N ratios, but how altered resource stoichiometry influences the complexity of direct and indirect interactions among plants, soils, and microbial communities has rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the responses of the plant-soil-microbe system to multi-level N additions and the role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic N stoichiometry in regulating microbial biomass in semiarid grassland in northern China. We documented a significant positive correlation between DOC and inorganic N across the N addition gradient, which contradicts the negative nonlinear correlation between nitrate accrual and DOC availability commonly observed in natural ecosystems. Using hierarchical structural equation modeling, we found that soil acidification resulting from N addition, rather than changes in the plant community, was most closely related to shifts in soil microbial community composition and decline of microbial respiration. These findings indicate a down-regulating effect of high N availability on plant-microbe interactions. That is, with the limiting factor for microbial biomass shifting from resource stoichiometry to soil acidity, N enrichment weakens the bottom-up control of soil microorganisms by plant-derived C sources. These results highlight the importance of integratively studying the plant-soil-microbe system in improving our understanding of ecosystem functioning under conditions of global N enrichment.","[Wei, Cunzheng; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wei, Cunzheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang; Bai, Edith; Lu, Xiaotao; Li, Qi; Liang, Wenju; Wang, Zhengwen; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Xia, Jianyang; Kardol, Paul] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Xia, Jianyang; Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Han, XG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",xghan@ibcas.ac.cn,"Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011; Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011; Xia, Jianyang/A-7886-2008; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016; Xia, Jianyang/S-9499-2019","Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30830026, 31270476]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-T06, KZCX2-YWBR-20]","We are grateful to the Inner Mongolia Grassland Ecosystem Research Station (IMGERS) for providing the experimental sites and elemental analyses.

Semithin sections were stained with metachromatic toluidine blue O (TBO) and fluoresced with acriflavine-HCl. The total P content was analyzed during the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) development stages and spherical electron-dense opaque granules were analyzed using TEM-EDS. The spherical polyphosphates (phytate) were precipitated and stained with TBO as dark variable sized granules in the vacuoles of the mantle hyphae, Hartig net and the epidermal and apical meristem cells of the ECM root. Higher levels of P and cations K, Mg, Ca, Na which indicated polyphosphate (phytate), were detected in the spherical electron-dense opaque granules in the mantle hyphae vacuoles, Hartig net and epidermal cells. The increase in phytate granules was correlated with the ECM development stages in the ECM root tip tissue. The total P content of the root tips also increased during each developmental stage, because of ECM development. The polysaccharide granules fluoresced in the apical meristem cells during the mature mantle stage. Wall ingrowth was observed in epidermal cells adjacent to Hartig net hyphae. Thus, the P acquired from the external Pi supply by the mantle hyphae was converted to polyphosphates, which were transferred initially to the epidermal cells in the host root tips that interfaced with mantle hyphae during the early mantle stage before Hartig net formation.","[Jung, Nam Chul; Tamai, Yutaka] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Lab Forest Resource Biol, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Jung, NC (reprint author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Environmentally Friendly Agr Res Inst, Coll Agr & Life Sci, 300 YongBong Dong, Gwangju Metrocity 500757, South Korea.",ancyjung@gmail.com,,,"National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20255002]","This work was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (#20255002).

In dynamic or degraded environments, the ability to associate with multiple partners (i.e. broad specificity) may enable species to persist through fluctuations in the availability of any particular partner. Understanding how species interactions vary across landscapes is necessary to anticipate direct and indirect consequences of environmental degradation on species conservation. We asked whether mycorrhizal symbiosis by populations of a rare epiphytic orchid (Epidendrum firmum) is related to geographic or environmental heterogeneity. The latter would suggest that interactions are governed by environmental conditions rather than historic isolation of populations and/or mycorrhizal fungi. We used DNA-based methods to identify mycorrhizal fungi from eleven E.firmum populations in Costa Rica. We used molecular and phylogenetic analyses to compare associations. Epidendrum firmum exhibited broad specificity, associating with diverse mycorrhizal fungi, including six Tulasnellaceae molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), five Sebacinales MOTUs and others. Notably, diverse mycorrhizal symbioses formed in disturbed pasture and roadside habitats. Mycorrhizal fungi exhibited significant similarity within populations (spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation) and significant differences among populations (phylogenetic community dissimilarity). However, mycorrhizal symbioses were not significantly associated with biogeographic or environmental features. Such unexpected heterogeneity among populations may result from complex combinations of fine-scale environmental factors and macro-evolutionary patterns of change in mycorrhizal specificity. Thus, E.firmum exhibits broad specificity and the potential for opportunistic associations with diverse fungi. We suggest that these characteristics could confer symbiotic assurance when mycorrhizal fungi are stochastically available, which may be crucial in dynamic or disturbed habitats such as tropical forest canopies.","[Kartzinel, Tyler R.; Shefferson, Richard P.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Trapnell, Dorset W.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Kartzinel, TR (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 East Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",tylerk@princeton.edu,"Shefferson, Richard/M-7115-2015","Shefferson, Richard/0000-0002-5234-3131; Trapnell, Dorset/0000-0001-7184-4700",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB: 1110307]; UGA Graduate School; Sigma Xi; Tinker Foundation; Explorer's Club; Lewis and Clark Fund; Idea Wild; Odum School of Ecology; UGA Office of the Vice President for Research,"We thank K.

Addressing literature reports on competition-induced changes in tree fine root morphology, we conducted a growth experiment with tree saplings to investigate competition effects on important root morphological and functional traits in a root order-focused analysis. European beech and European ash saplings were grown for 34 months in containers under greenhouse conditions in monoculture (2 conspecific plants), in mixture (1 beech and 1 ash) or as single plants. The root system was fractionated according to root orders and eight morphological and functional properties were determined. Root order was the most influential factor affecting the fine root traits (except for root diameter and delta C-13); a significant species identity effect was found for root diameter, tissue density, N concentration and delta C-13. Ash fine roots were thicker, but had lower tissue densities, contained more N and had systematically higher delta C-13 values than beech roots. The competition treatments had no significant effect on morphological root traits but altered delta C-13 in the 2nd root order. Neither intra- nor interspecific root competition affected fine root morphology significantly suggesting that competition-induced root modification may not be a universal phenomenon in temperate trees.","[Beyer, Friderike] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Beyer, F (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, POB 7043, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",friderike.beyer@slu.se,"Beyer, Friderike/M-1108-2013","Beyer, Friderike/0000-0002-3597-5022","Ministry of Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony, Germany; ""Niedersachsisches Vorab"" in the framework of the Cluster of Excellence ""Functional Biodiversity Research""","The authors would like to thank the Centre for Stable Isotope Research and Analysis (KOSI) of the University of Gottingen for isotope analyses and Ann-Catrin Fender for soil chemical analysis.

Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO (TM) is discussed. We compared IJ_Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO (TM) using two sets of images, one comprising test-line images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ_Rhizo and WinRHIZO (TM) estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis. IJ_Rhizo ""Kimura"" and WinRHIZO (TM) ""Tennant"" were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise.

Since polyphenols seriously confound quantification of extracted protein, minimising this interference is important to ensure measurements are representative. Although the Bradford colorimetric assay is used routinely in soil science for rapid quantification protein in soil-extracts, it has several limitations. We therefore investigated an alternative calorimetric technique based on the Lowry assay (frequently used to measure protein and humic substances as distinct pools in microbial biofilms). The accuracies of both the Bradford assay and a modified Lowry microplate method were compared in factorial combination. Protein was quantified in soil-extracts (extracted with citrate), including standard additions of model protein (BSA) and polyphenol (Sigma H1675-2). Using the Lowry microplate assay described, no interfering effects of citrate were detected even with concentrations up to 5 times greater than are typically used to extract soil protein. Moreover, the Bradford assay was found to be highly susceptible to two simultaneous and confounding artefacts: 1) the colour development due to added protein was greatly inhibited by polyphenol concentration, and 2) substantial colour development was caused directly by the polyphenol addition. In contrast, the Lowry method enabled distinction between colour development from protein and non-protein origin, providing a more accurate quantitative analysis. These results suggest that the modified-Lowry method is a more suitable measure of extract protein (defined by standard equivalents) because it is less confounded by the high polyphenolic content which is so typical of soil extracts.

We compared the soil microbial community (SMC) composition (measured as PLFAs) and enzyme activity between paired earthworm-invaded and earthworm-free plots in northern hardwood forests of New York, USA. We hypothesized that differences in SMCs and enzyme activity between plots would correspond with differences in soil C content and C:N ratios. Relative abundance of several bacterial (mostly gram-positive) PLFAs was higher and that of two fungal PLFAs was lower in earthworm compared to reference plots, largely because of earthworm incorporation of the organic horizon into mineral soil. In surface mineral soil earthworms increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and decreased fungal (mostly saprotrophic) and several bacterial (gram-negative and non-specific) PLFAs. Earthworms also increased the activities of cellulolytic relative to lignolytic enzymes in surface mineral soil, and the relationships between enzyme activities and components of the SMC suggest a substrate-mediated effect on the SMC and its metabolism of C. A highly significant relationship between components of the SMC and soil C:N also suggests that earthworms reduce soil C:N through functional and compositional shifts in the SMC. Finally, changes in AMF abundances were linked to phosphatase activity, suggesting that earthworms do not necessarily inhibit P-acquisition by AMF-associated plants in our study system. We conclude that the combined influence of earthworm-related changes in physical structure, accessibility and chemistry of organic matter, and relative abundance of certain groups of fungi and bacteria promote C metabolism, in particular by increasing the activities of cellulolytic vs. lignolytic enzymes.

Two micro-propagated clones were tested: AL1, in vitro and C1 (acclimatized plants) in nursery and later in a field trial. In vitro, rooted shoots were transferred to test tubes containing the substrate previously inoculated with mycelium cultured on agar. In the nursery, two inoculation treatments were tested (vegetative inocula or dry sporocarps) and compared to control plants. In the field trial, plants from nursery inoculation treatments were compared and an additional control treatment using seedlings was implemented. Plant height was evaluated 4 months later in the nursery and 20 months later in the field trial. Roots were examined by morphological and histological studies: a) in vitro plantlets one month after inoculation and nine months after acclimatization; and b) 20 months after the field trial was established. Arbutoid mycorrhizae were observed in vitro one month after inoculation, indicating compatibility between A. unedo and P. arhizus. These,showed the presence of a mantle, Hartig net, and intracellular hyphal complexes confined to the epidermal root cells. Arbutoid mycorrhizae were also observed nine months after acclimatization in inoculated and control plants. In order to confirm the identity of mycorrhizae, molecular techniques were used, in previously inoculated in vitro plants, 12 months after acclimatization. Thelephora and Hebeloma mycorrhizae, two types of highly competitive and widespread mycorrhizae on nurseries were identified. In the nursery, dry sporocarp treatment improved plant height after four months. In a field trial (20 months later), plants growth did not show significant differences. By this time, mycorrhized roots with Cenococcum geophilum and other types were identified. These results and their implications on A. unedo breeding program are discussed.","[Gomes, Filomena; San Martin, Esteban] Escola Super Agr Coimbra, Dep Recursos Florestais, CERNAS, P-3040316 Coimbra, Portugal; [Machado, Helena] Inst Nacl Invest Agr & Vet IP, INIAV, P-2780159 Oeiras, Portugal; [Portugal, A.; Canhoto, Jorge M.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal","Gomes, F (reprint author), Escola Super Agr Coimbra, Dep Recursos Florestais, CERNAS, P-3040316 Coimbra, Portugal.",fgomes@esac.pt,,"Machado, Helena/0000-0002-1775-0962; Canhoto, Jorge/0000-0003-2299-298X; Gomes, Filomena/0000-0001-9561-3907",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [SFRH/BD/37170/2007],"We thank Vera Santos, Iker Sorzabalbere, Mafalda Simoes and Jose Maia, who helped us in the laboratory, in the nursery and field work.

We carried anatomical and ultrastructural studies to examine this symbiotic association and the characteristics of shoots and roots of Leucaena leucocephala in As-amended soils (35 and 75 mg As dm(-3)). The experiment used 3 AMF isolates from uncontaminated soils: Acaulospora morrowiae, Glomus clarum, and Gigaspora albida; a mixed inoculum derived from combining these 3 isolates (named Mix AMF); and, 3 AMF isolates from As-contaminated areas: A. morrowiae, G.

Inoculation with G. clarum and the mixture of species (A. morrowiae, G. albida, and G. clarum) resulted in better growth of L. leucocephala in soils with high As concentrations, as well as significant As removal from the soil, showing a potential for using AMF in phytoextraction. Light microscopy (LS), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopies (SEM) studies showed the colonization of the AMF in plant tissues and damage in all treatments, with ultrastructural changes being observed in leaves and roots of L. leucocephala, especially with the addition of 75 mg dm(-3) of As.

However, a direct evaluation of microorganisms and their processes in undisturbed soil allows a better understanding of the real effect of different managements. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes induced by different types of land use (pasture, eucalyptus forest, araucaria forest, conventional tillage with carrot, and conventional tillage with pumpkin) on soil chemical properties (pH, Ca, Mg, Al, P, K, S, and organic matter), physical properties (mean geometric diameter, mean weight diameter, bulk density, and particle density), and on the microbial quality (microbial activity and carbon, total extraradical mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and metabolic quotient - qCO(2)) of the aggregate size classes (I- 4.00 to 2.36 mm, II - 2.36 to 1.18 mm, III - 1.18 to 0.60 mm; IV - 0.60 to 0.30 mm, V - 0.30-0.15 mm) of a Red-Yellow Latosol in the South of Minas Gerais. The results showed that the land use affected the formation, size and microbial quality of aggregates. In the smaller aggregates (classes IV and V) extraradical mycelium of fungi and microbial biomass were reduced, and metabolic activity and quotient increased, regardless of the land use. The microbiological quality of larger aggregates (between 0.60 to 4.00 mm or I, II and III), in soil under araucaria forest was similar to all size classes of soil aggregates under eucalyptus forest, while the quality of smaller aggregates (<0.60 mm or IV and V) was similar to all aggregate size classes under pasture. Under conventional cultivation, conversely to the other types of land use, the aggregates had a low microbial quality and relationship with soil fertility.","[Melloni, Rogerio] Univ Fed Itajuba IRN UNIFEI, Inst Recursos Nat, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [Pereira Melloni, Eliane Guimaraes; Vieira, Lucas Lopes] IRN UNIFEI, Itabira, Brazil","Melloni, R (reprint author), Univ Fed Itajuba IRN UNIFEI, Inst Recursos Nat, Av BPS 1303, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil.",rogerio.melloni@gmail.com; eliane.melloni@gmail.com; vieiraeam@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,41,3,4,2,29,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

The effects of climate change, including increasing drought in already arid lands, pose an additional layer of uncertainty in the fate of rare species. In the case of plants, reintroduction is becoming an important active management practice in species conservation. We hypothesized that even under extreme drought inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi would increase growth rates of an endangered plant in experimental reintroduction. We selected a plant species, Abronia macrocarpa, and conducted the experiment in Texas while the area was experiencing mild and extreme drought intensities. Treatment plots were planted with seed inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and control plots were planted with seed coated with autoclaved inoculant. We analyzed measurements of growth and development of germinated plants. Mean number of leaves was greater in treatment plants (P = 0.005) and mean aerial diameter was larger in treatment plants (P = 0.02) than in control plants. Significantly improved growth suggests that inoculation is a viable technique to increase reintroduction success in plant species especially during periods of drought. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They play an important role in soil food webs via regulating the decomposition of organic matter and propagating microorganisms within the soil. To our knowledge, the influence of different plant functional groups on oribatid mites has not been studied in abandoned farmland with undisturbed succession before. The density and assemblage structure of oribatid mites in nine grassy arable fallows relative to three habitat age classes (2-3, 6-8, 12-15 years) and three selected plant species (legume: Medicago sativa, forb: Taraxacum officinale, grass: Bromus sterilis) were investigated in soil associated with single plants. Mite density declined marginally not significant with habitat age because of high abundances of the ubiquitous species Tectocepheus velatus sarekensis and Punctoribates punctum in young and mid-aged fallows and their subsequent decline in old fallows. Oribatid mite density and species assemblage were not affected by plant species. Only P. punctum had significantly higher densities in B. sterilis samples than in T. officinale samples due to a higher amount of fine roots. Distance-based linear models revealed that 65% of the variation in mite assemblage was explained by soil properties, soil type, exposition and geographic position, while habitat age was of minor importance. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the mite assemblage was best explained by soil organic and microbial carbon, water content and pH. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In the current study, the impacts of calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al) additions on mature sugar maple physiology were evaluated at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (Thornton, NH, USA) to assess remediation (Ca addition) or exacerbation (Al addition) of current acidified conditions. Fine root cation concentrations and membrane integrity, carbon (C) allocation, foliar cation concentrations and antioxidant activity, foliar response to a spring freezing event and reproductive ability (flowering, seed quantity, filled seed and seed germination) were evaluated for dominant sugar maple trees in a replicated plot study. Root damage and foliar antioxidant activity were highest in Al-treated trees, while growth-associated C, foliar re-flush following a spring frost and reproductive ability were highest in Ca-treated trees. In general, we found that trees on Ca-treated plots preferentially used C resources for growth and reproductive processes, whereas Al-treated trees devoted C to defense-based processes. Similarities between Al-treated and control trees were observed for foliar cation concentrations, C partitioning and seed production, suggesting that sugar maples growing in native forests may be more stressed than previously perceived. Our experiment suggests that disruption of the balance of Ca and Al in sugar maples by acid deposition continues to be an important driver of tree health.","[Halman, Joshua M.; Hawley, Gary J.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Schaberg, Paul G.; Pardo, Linda H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Fahey, Timothy J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Halman, JM (reprint author), Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Joshua.Halman@uvm.edu,,,Forest Service Northern Research Station; USDA CSREES McIntire-Stennis Forest Research ProgramUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Northeastern States Research Cooperative,"This research was supported by funds provided by the Forest Service Northern Research Station, USDA CSREES McIntire-Stennis Forest Research Program, and the Northeastern States Research Cooperative.",,68,19,23,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2013,33,11,,,,,1242,1251,,10.1093/treephys/tpt099,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,271EP,WOS:000328374500010,24300338,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Veselkin, DV; Morozova, LM",,,,"Veselkin, D.

Due to changes in climate and emergence of carbon (C) market, plantations are also being credited for total biomass productivity and C sequestration. Does growth selection adversely affect total above- and belowground biomass and C sequestration? We investigated this by comparing two fast-growing provenances (LS and CH) to a slow-growing provenance (KT) from a 31-year-old Picea koraiensis experiment. Results showed that (1) the fast-growing provenances could enhance both above- and belowground biomass productivity and carbon sequestration. On average, trees of LS and CH provenances produced 16.1% and 31.8% more biomass and had 17.2% and 31.8% more C stock, respectively, than KT provenance, although these differences were statistically non-significant (P < 0.10). The fast-growing provenances displayed a comparable to or even slightly higher C concentration than KT provenance; (2) growth selection influenced biomass and C partitioning. Compared to KT, the CH and LS allocated relatively more to stem wood but less to the needles and branches aboveground and partitioned more to the stump and coarse roots but less to the fine and medium size roots belowground. The fast-growing provenances had a very similar or lower above- to belowground biomass partitioning slope. Thus, the superiority of the aboveground growth of LS and CH was not achieved at the expense of belowground compartments; and (3) the best function to predict biomass and C content was 'a((DBHH)-H-2)(b)'. Fitting provenance-specific relationship parameter (a orb) improved prediction precision. This was particularly true for b and for the biomass of branches, aboveground and whole tree.

We examined alpha- and beta-proteobacteria whose genomes were sequenced using large-scale phylogenetic profiling and revealed the evolutionary origin of two nodulation genes. These genes, nodI and nodJ (nodIJ), play key roles in the secretion of Nod factors, which are recognized by legumes during nodulation. We found that only the nodulating beta-proteobacteria, including the novel strains isolated in this study, possess both nodIJ and their paralogous genes (DRA-ATPase/permease genes). Contrary to the widely accepted scenario of the alpha-proteobacterial origin of rhizobia, our exhaustive phylogenetic analysis showed that the entire nodIJ clade is included in the clade of Burkholderiaceae DRA-ATPase/permease genes, that is, the nodIJ genes originated from gene duplication in a lineage of the beta-proteobacterial family. After duplication, the evolutionary rates of nodIJ were significantly accelerated relative to those of homologous genes, which is consistent with their novel function in nodulation. The likelihood analyses suggest that this accelerated evolution is not associated with changes in either nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates or transition/transversion rates, but rather, in the GC content. Although the low GC content of the nodulation genes has been assumed to reflect past horizontal transfer events from donor rhizobial genomes with low GC content, no rhizobial genome with such low GC content has yet been found. Our results encourage a reconsideration of the origin of nodulation and suggest new perspectives on the role of the GC content of bacterial genes in functional adaptation.","[Aoki, Seishiro; Ito, Motomi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Iwasaki, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Ctr Earth Surface Syst Dynam, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan","Aoki, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",saoki@bio.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"IWASAKI, Wataru/O-4917-2014","IWASAKI, Wataru/0000-0002-9169-9245","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20570220]; Scientific Research on Priority Areas ""Comparative Genomics""Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18017009, 20017011]","The authors are grateful to Dr Hirohisa Kishino and Dr Julien Dutheil for their help.

The aim of this study was to assess differences in the amount and diversity of phenolic compounds in leaves among coexisting shrub species differing in rooting depth and leaf turnover. We hypothesized that the diversity and amount of phenolic compounds in leaves of desert shrubs are related to access to soil water through rooting depth, and to leaf turnover. The study was carried out in the Patagonian Monte of Argentina. We collected green leaves of six species representing the dominant shrub morphotypes (tall evergreen, tall deciduous, and medium evergreen shrubs) and assessed lignin concentration and groups of soluble phenols obtained by sequential extraction with ethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and amyl alcohol. We also assessed nitrogen concentration in leaves and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) as traits related to leaf lifespan. The diversity of phenolic compounds was higher in green leaves of tall shrubs with deep rooting depth than in those of medium evergreen shrubs with shallow rooting depth. Diversity of phenolic compounds in green leaves was negatively related to lignin concentration. Evergreen shrubs had higher amount of phenolic compounds in green leaves than deciduous ones and the total amount of phenolic compounds in green leaves was positively related to LMA. We concluded that access to soil water sources and leaf turnover were related to the amount and diversity of phenolic compounds in green leaves of desert shrub species and these results are consistent with those predicted by the resource availability theory for plants from resource-rich and resource-poor habitats.","[Saravi Cisneros, Hebe; Bertiller, Monica B.; Carrera, Analia L.; Larreguy, Cecilia] Ctr Nacl Patagon CENPAT CONICET, Chubut, Argentina; [Saravi Cisneros, Hebe; Bertiller, Monica B.; Carrera, Analia L.] Univ Nacl Patagonia UNPSJB, Chubut, Argentina","Bertiller, MB (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CENPAT CONICET, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACF Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",bertil@cenpat.edu.ar,,,ANPCyT-FONCYTANPCyTFONCyT [PICT 08-1349]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP-112-200801-01664]; CONICET (National Research Council of Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This research was funded by ANPCyT-FONCYT (PICT 08-1349), and CONICET (PIP-112-200801-01664).

Soil nitrogen (N) often limits growth and occurs in differentially available chemical forms. In a Bornean forest where tree species composition changes dramatically along a soil gradient varying in supplies of different N-forms, we investigated whether tree species' N-uptake and soil specialization strategies covaried. We analyzed foliar N-15 natural abundance for a total of 216 tree species on clay or sandy loam (the soils at the gradient's extremes) and conducted a N-15-tracer experiment with nine specialist and generalist species to test whether species displayed flexible or differential uptake of ammonium and nitrate. Despite variation in ammonium and nitrate supplies and nearly 4 aEuro degrees difference in foliar delta N-15 between most soil specialists and populations of generalists on these soils, our N-15 tracer experiment showed little support for the hypothesis that soil specialists vary in N-form use or the ratios in which they use these forms. Instead, our results indicate that these species possess flexible capacities to take up different inorganic N forms. Variation between soil specialists in uptake of different N forms is thus unlikely to cause the soil associations of tree species and high beta diversity characteristic of this Bornean rain forest. Flexible uptake strategies would facilitate N-acquisition when supply rates of N-forms exhibit spatiotemporal variation and suggest that these species may be functionally redundant in their responses to N gradients and influences on ecosystem N-cycles.","[Russo, Sabrina E.; Kochsiek, Amy; Olney, Jocelyn; Thompson, Lauren] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Russo, Sabrina E.; Tan, Sylvester] Harvard Univ, Arnold Arboretum Asia Program, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Miller, Amy E.] Natl Pk Serv, Southwest Alaska Network, Anchorage, AK 99501 USA","Russo, SE (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Manter Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",srusso2@unl.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919136]; Center for Tropical Forest ScienceSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Nebraska-Lincoln Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences Program; Center for Tropical Forest Science, Forest Department of Sarawak, Malaysia; Harvard University, USA (NSF) [DEB-9107247, DEB-9629601]; Osaka City University, Japan [06041094, 08NP0901, 09NP0901]; NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates supplementary award","The authors thank the Sarawak Forest Department, National Parks, and Forest Research Corporation for their kind permission to conduct research in Lambir Hills National Park.

It can be expected that higher N fertilization and higher below-ground biomass production can remediate soil physically degraded by wheel compaction. The main objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between tractor traffic and N fertilization of a clover/grass mixture during the period from 2010 to 2012. The experiment was established in a split-plot design with fertilization as a main plot and tractor passes as a subplot. The N fertilizer treatments used were: untreated control (N0), 80 kg N ha(-1) (N80) and 160 kg N ha(-1) (N160). Four compaction treatments were applied using the following numbers of tractor passes: untreated control (P0), two passes (P2), four passes (P4) and six passes (P6). Root samples were collected in the autumn of 2010, 2011 and 2012 and their morphometric parameters were calculated after measurement of the root length, using image analysis: root length density (RLD), mean root diameter (MRD), specific root length (SRL) and root dry matter (RDM). Heavy tractor traffic significantly affected the physical parameters of the soil. The highest value of bulk density was recorded in the 10-20 cm soil layer with the P6 treatment (1.582 g cm(-3)), being approximately 10% higher compared with the P0 treatment at the same depth. The tractor wheeling increased penetration resistance in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The maximum value of penetration resistance (2.98 MPa) was recorded for the P6 treatment, in the 5-10 cm soil layer. The differences between root parameters caused by fertilization and compaction treatments were observed only in the 5-15 cm soil layer. The roots in the upper, 0-5 cm, soil layer were not affected by soil compaction or nitrogen fertilization. The tractor passes reduced biomass and length of the roots. In the 5-10 cm soil layer the highest value of the RDM was noticed with the P0 treatment (0.00241 g cm(-3)), whilst it decreased to 0.00144 g cm(-3) for the P6 treatment. In the 10-15 cm the maximum value for the RDM was also recorded in the P0 whereas the minimum was in the P4. The higher N rates play unfavourable role in root development what reflected in their morphometric parameters. The use of nitrogen reduced the RDM. The main difference was noticed between the N160 treatment (0.00230 g cm(-3)) and two others: namely, N0 and N80, totalling 0.00298 and 0.000287 g cm(-3) respectively. Similar reductions were also observed for the RLD. The results in root morphology did not indicate significant interaction between tractor passes and the N fertilization level. According to the regression model, the optimum condition for root growth could be meet when nitrogen fertilization is at the level of approximately 50 kg N ha(-1). At this N rate red clover/grass mixture produces the highest below ground biomass what can play favourable role in remediation of compacted soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to search for evidence that the roots of two desert riparian phreatophytes, Populus euphratica Oliv. and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., carry out HR and to investigate the pattern of this phenomenon in the broader scheme of plant water uptake by roots. To demonstrate HR, we present data on patterns of sap flow in the stems or branches and lateral roots of those two phreatophyte species and soil volumetric moisture content where these species grow. During the dry season, we observed reverse or acropetal flow in the lateral roots of P. euphratica, a pattern consistent with hydraulic lift. With the onset of heavy rains, this pattern reversed, indicating water movement from moist topsoil to dry subsoil, i.e. hydraulic descent. After lateral irrigation by creek, water moved downward to dry subsoil and outward to opposite sides, suggesting lateral hydraulic redistribution via roots at night and during the day, which may be mediated by stem tissues and, by inference, the radial sectoring in the xylem. Although no direct evidence indicated reverse sap flow of lateral roots and associated HR in T. ramosissima, several factors indicate that HR is occurring: (1) diel fluctuations of volumetric moisture content in the upper soil layer and (2) the identification of primary water sources as groundwater and vadose zone water through stable isotope studies. As a result, we inferred that HR occurs in T. ramosissima via adventitious roots with diameters of 2-5 mm and length of 60-100 cm in the upper soil layer, rather than via lateral roots; further investigation is needed to substantiate this. We confirm and extend previous knowledge on HR patterns of P. euphratica and add a new species, T. ramosissima, to the wide list of existing species involved in HR. However, these two desert riparian phreatophytes exhibit remarkable differences in their patterns and pathways of HR that are possibly associated with root architecture.","[Yu, Tengfei] Lanzhou Univ, Res Sch Arid Environm & Climate Change, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tengfei; Feng, Qi; Si, Jianhua; Xi, Haiyang; Li, Zongxing; Chen, Aifang] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Feng, Qi; Si, Jianhua; Xi, Haiyang; Li, Zongxing] Gansu Hydrol & Water Resources Engn Res Ctr, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Feng, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",qifeng@ns.lzb.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-04-05]; General Program of National Natural Science Fund of China [91025024, 91025002]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences","Financial support is gratefully acknowledged to Key Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KZZD-EW-04-05), General Program of National Natural Science Fund of China (No. 91025024; 91025002) and Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists.

Modified earth impedance method was developed recently and here it was tested, by comparing the results with those obtained by combination of several classical methods. We used direct (soil cores, scanning and microscopy) and indirect (sap flow patterns and modified earth impedance) methods in an attempt to estimate the absorptive root area indexes (RAI) at two sites of about 25 and 40-years-old Norway spruce. We considered the geometric surfaces of all scanned fine roots to be equal to the fine root absorptive area (RAI (scan) ). To estimate the potentially physically permeable area of fine roots, we microscopically evaluated the point of secondary xylem appearance and calculated the geometric area of root portions with primary structure (RAI (micro) ). We termed the area of electrically conductive root surface as the active (ion) absorptive area (RAI (mei) ) and measured its extent by the modified earth impedance (MEI) method. The highest values for absorptive root areas at the two experimental sites we obtained with the scanning method (RAI (scan) was considered to be 100%), followed by the RAI (micro) (51%) and RAI (mei) (32%). RAImei reached about 2/3 of RAImicro. The surface area of the ectomycorrhizal hyphae was an order of magnitude larger than that of all fine roots, but the MEI did not measure such increase. We showed that the absorptive root area, indirectly estimated by the MEI, provides consistent results that approach the values obtained for fine roots with a primary structure estimated by traditional direct methods. The similar range of the values for the absorptive root surface area obtained by microscopy and by the MEI method indicates that this method is feasible and that it could be used to determine the extent of active absorptive root surface areas in forests.","[Cermak, Jan; Gebauer, Roman; Martinkova, Milena; Koller, Jan; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocenol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Cudlin, Pavel] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Syst Biol & Ecol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Borja, Isabella] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, NO-1431 As, Norway; [Stanek, Zdenek; Koller, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Dept Phys, Prague 16627, Czech Republic","Cermak, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocenol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",cermak@mendelu.cz,"Nadezhdina, Nadezhda/E-6075-2014; Gebauer, R/C-4906-2014; Borja, Isabella/A-8496-2010; Cudlin, Pavel/G-3607-2014; Neruda, Jindrich/B-9172-2014","Borja, Isabella/0000-0002-3740-9948; Gebauer, Roman/0000-0001-5661-7585","Research Intention of Czech [MSMT 6215648902]; Research Centre Czech Globe [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0073]; COST projects [1P05OC077, OC10023]; EEA Norwegian Financial Mechanism [A/CZ0046/2/0009]","We are grateful to Eva Chmelkova for the excellent technical assistance in in handling the roots and to Valeriy Nadyezhdin for his expert use of the sap flow instrumentation.

They are ecologically important determinants of plant growth and diversity. Considerable genetic variation occurs in AMF populations. Thus, plants are exposed to AMF of varying relatedness to each other. Very little is known about either the effects of coexisting AMF on plant growth or which factors influence intraspecific AMF coexistence within roots. No studies have addressed whether the genetics of coexisting AMF, and more specifically their relatedness, influences plant growth and AMF coexistence. Relatedness is expected to influence coexistence between individuals, and it has been suggested that decreasing ability of symbionts to coexist can have negative effects on the growth of the host. We tested the effect of a gradient of AMF genetic relatedness on the growth of two plant species. Increasing relatedness between AMFs lead to markedly greater plant growth (27% biomass increase with closely related compared to distantly related AMF). In one plant species, closely related AMF coexisted in fairly equal proportions but decreasing relatedness lead to a very strong disequilibrium between AMF in roots, indicating much stronger competition. Given the strength of the effects with such a shallow relatedness gradient and the fact that in the field plants are exposed to a steeper gradient, we consider that AMF relatedness can have a strong role in plant growth and the ability of AMF to coexist. We conclude that AMF relatedness is a driver of plant growth and that relatedness is also a strong driver of intraspecific coexistence of these ecologically important symbionts.","[Roger, Aurelien; Colard, Alexandre; Angelard, Caroline; Sanders, Ian R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Ian.Sanders@unil.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [310030B_144079/1],"We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation with a grant to IRS (310030B_144079/1).

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and conservation.Robinia pseudoacacia, false acacia or black locust, is a deciduous, broad-leaved tree native to North America. The medium-sized, fast-growing tree is armed with spines, and extensively suckering. It has become naturalized in grassland, semi-natural woodlands and urban habitats. The tree is common in the south of the British Isles and in many other regions of Europe.Robinia pseudoacacia is a light-demanding pioneer species, which occurs primarily in disturbed sites on fertile to poor soils. The tree does not tolerate wet or compacted soils. In contrast to its native range, where it rapidly colonizes forest gaps and is replaced after 15-30years by more competitive tree species, populations in the secondary range can persist for a longer time, probably due to release from natural enemies.Robinia pseudoacacia reproduces sexually, and asexually by underground runners. Disturbance favours clonal growth and leads to an increase in the number of ramets. Mechanical stem damage and fires also lead to increased clonal recruitment. The tree benefits from di-nitrogen fixation associated with symbiotic rhizobia in root nodules. Estimated symbiotic nitrogen fixation rates range widely from 23 to 300kgha(-1)year(-1). The nitrogen becomes available to other plants mainly by the rapid decay of nitrogen-rich leaves.Robinia pseudoacacia is host to a wide range of fungi both in the native and introduced ranges. Megaherbivores are of minor significance in Europe but browsing by ungulates occurs in the native range. Among insects, the North American black locust gall midge (Obolodiplosis robiniae) is specific to Robinia and is spreading rapidly throughout Europe. In parts of Europe, Robinia pseudoacacia is considered an invasive non-indigenous plant and the tree is controlled. Negative impacts include shading and changes of soil conditions as a result of nitrogen fixation.","[Cierjacks, Arne; Kowarik, Ingo; von der Lippe, Moritz] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo; Joshi, Jasmin; Hempel, Stefan; von der Lippe, Moritz] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Joshi, Jasmin; Ristow, Michael; Weber, Ewald] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Hempel, Stefan] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Weber, E (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",ewweber@uni-potsdam.de,"Cierjacks, Arne/C-8629-2011","Cierjacks, Arne/0000-0002-1536-8153; Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465; von der Lippe, Moritz/0000-0003-4760-1420",,,,227,93,101,9,177,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, relatively little is known about the evolution of these symbiotic plant-fungal interactions in natural communities. In this study, we investigated the symbiotic AMF communities of populations of the native plant species Pilea pumila (Urticaceae) with varying histories of coexistence with a nonmycorrhizal invasive species, Alliaria petiolata (Brassicaceae), known to affect mycorrhizal communities. We found that native populations of P. pumila with a long history of coexistence with the invasive species developed more diverse symbiotic AMF communities. This effect was strongest when A.petiolata plants were actively growing with the natives, and in soils with the longest history of A.petiolata growth. These results suggest that despite the ancient and widespread nature of the plant-AMF symbiosis, the plant traits responsible for symbiotic preferences can, nevertheless, evolve rapidly in response to environmental changes.","[Lankau, Richard A.; Nodurft, Rachel N.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ralankau@uga.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",NSF DEB grant [0918450],"We thank Charlene Chalmers for assistance with field and greenhouse experiments.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated xylem vulnerability to cavitation for nine principal tree species of miombo woodlands, which differ in habitat preference and leaf phenology. We measured cavitation vulnerability (I-50), stem-area specific hydraulic conductivity (K (S)), leaf specific conductivity (K (L)), seasonal variation in predawn water potential (I-PD) and xylem anatomical properties [mean vessel diameter, mean hydraulic diameter, mean hydraulic diameter accounting for 95 % flow, and maximum vessel length (V (L))]. Results show that tree species with a narrow habitat range (mesic specialists) were more vulnerable to cavitation than species with a wide habitat range (generalists). I-50 for mesic specialists ranged between -1.5 and -2.2 MPa and that for generalists between -2.5 and -3.6 MPa. While mesic specialists exhibited the lowest seasonal variation in I-PD, generalists displayed significant seasonal variations in I-PD suggesting that the two miombo habitat groups differ in their rooting depth. We observed a strong trade-off between K (S) and I-50 suggesting that tree hydraulic architecture is one of the decisive factors setting ecological boundaries for principal miombo species. While vessel diameters correlated weakly (P > 0.05) with I-50, V (L) was positively and significantly correlated with I-50. I-PD was significantly correlated with I-50 further reinforcing the conclusion that tree hydraulic architecture plays a significant role in species' habitat preference in miombo woodlands.","[Vinya, Royd; Malhi, Yadvinder; Fisher, Joshua B.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Ctr Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Vinya, Royd] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Kitwe, Zambia; [Brown, Nick] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Brodribb, Timothy J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Aragao, Luiz E.] Univ Exeter, Sch Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England","Vinya, R (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Ctr Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",royd.vinya@cbu.ac.zm,"Brodribb, Timothy John/C-6797-2013; Vinya, Royd/G-5413-2011","Brodribb, Timothy John/0000-0002-4964-6107; Vinya, Royd/0000-0003-0478-2612; Fisher, Joshua/0000-0003-4734-9085",Association of Commonwealth Universities; Copperbelt University,"The lead author was funded by a scholarship from the Association of Commonwealth Universities; Copperbelt University provided financial support during field work.

We investigated the effects of the invasive plant, Brassica nigra on the multi-trophic arthropod community residing on the native California annual Deinandra fasciculata. In a common garden experiment, we planted D. fasciculata without B. nigra or with one of 45 B. nigra half-sib genetic families. We in turn crossed this B. nigra treatment with the suppression of soil fungi to both test for effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on arthropods, and elucidate the mechanisms of B. nigra's below ground effects. B. nigra had no effect on D. fasciculata traits (biomass, inflorescence number, root colonization by AMF), arthropod community composition or predator density, but increased herbivore density. While B. nigra families varied 18-fold in size, there was no genetic variation for effects on D. fasciculata or its arthropods. Soil fungi suppression had no effect on D. fasciculata traits, herbivore density or herbivore community composition, but increased predator density and altered predator community composition. While the exact mechanisms of B. nigra effects are unclear, they do not appear to have been mediated by altered plant performance or reductions in root colonization by AMF. Our experiment shows that invasive plants such as B. nigra may affect higher trophic levels even when they do not measurably affect native plant performance.","[Schreck, Tadj K.; David, Scott J.; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Mooney, KA (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@uci.edu,,,"Newkirk Center for Science and Society Graduate Fellowship; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine; NSF Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) fellowship; UC Irvine School of Biological Sciences; UC Irvine Academic Senate Council on Research, Computing and Libraries; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120794]","This research was supported by the Newkirk Center for Science and Society Graduate Fellowship.

In this paper we tested whether bag size and presence of soil fauna in bags influence the production, isotopic composition, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content of the EMM. Cylindrical in-growth mesh bags (2- or 5-cm-diameter; with or without openings - (1 or 2 mm), allowing faunal colonization or not) were harvested 37, 48, 81 and 283 days after installation in July and the EMM biomass was determined from elemental analyses of the extractable amount of mycelia. The occurrence of openings allowed animals to invade the bags but this did not affect the amount of EMM. We suggest further studies in this matter since the number of animals was low and variable. In the first harvest, mycelial biomass C was three times greater in 2-cm than in 5-cm-bags. After 81 days, mycelial biomass C was 54% greater in the 2-cm (54 kg ha(-1)) than in the 5-cm bags (35 kg ha(-1)). While total mycelial C did not change over winter, N content increased suggesting a role for the EMM in the storage of N from autumn to spring. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 of the EMM changed between the first three harvests. We hypothesize these changes to be mainly driven by changes in plant C and N sinks. The relation between the isotopic composition of sporocarp exploration type, plant roots and EMM is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explores linkages between substrate stoichiometry and warming-induced patterns of microbial carbon (C) mineralization in boreal forest soils via replacements of native litterfall with Oi material possessing distinct delta C-13 and C:N. Following 120 day incubations of soils from sites similar except for mean annual temperature, we examined exo-enzyme activities, microbial biomass, and delta C-13 of respired CO2 and individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) to identify microbial community and decay responses to these experimental manipulations. In accordance with stoichiometric theory, we hypothesized that warming-induced increases in microbial use of naturally low C:N Oea materials and fungal incorporation of Oea would be enhanced when available Oi material exhibited relatively high C:N. These hypotheses were only partially supported. At the warmer site, higher C:N Oi was linked to an enhanced, warming-induced decline in Oi-derived CO2, lower C:N Oi prompted an increase in the warming-induced increase in phenol oxidase activities, and the interaction between temperature and Oi C:N had no influence on the relative abundances or activities of distinct microbial groups. In contrast, responses to Oi C:N and temperature at the cooler site were evident only via changes in the structure and substrate preference of the active microbial community; we observed a similar to 25% increase in the incorporation of low C:N Oi into fungi relative to bacteria in these soils when they were incubated at a relatively high temperature. The data emphasize the importance of native climate imposing a legacy effect on how these microbial communities respond to temperature and substrate stoichiometry, by governing those communities' adaptive characteristics and the climate-related composition of the SUM on which they depend. That legacy effect is reflected in patterns of decay and in the relative abundances of microbial groups that both decay and generate SOM.

A hybrid model combining SIA and SRA to form a new approach called, 'risk and social impact assessment' (RSIA) is introduced.

However, the interpretation of its results is complicated by differences in data analysis approaches that make inter-study comparisons difficult. The pyrosequencing studies published so far have also used variable molecular targets in fungal rDNA. Although the ITS region and, in particular, ITS1 appear to be the most frequent sequencing targets, the use of various primers with different coverages of fungal groups remains a serious problem. Sequence length limits also vary widely across studies, and in many studies, length differences may negatively affect sequence similarity clustering or identification. Unfortunately, many studies neglect the need to correct for method-dependent errors, such as pyrosequencing noise or chimeric sequences. Even when performed, error rates in sequences may be high, and consensus sequences created by sequence clustering therefore better represent operational taxonomic units. We recommend a data analysis workflow that includes sequence denoising, chimera removal, sequence trimming before clustering and random resampling before calculating diversity parameters. The newly developed free pipeline (SEED) introduced here can be used to perform all the required analytical steps. The improvement and unification of data analysis procedures should make future studies both more reliable and comparable and allow meta-studies to be performed to provide more general views on fungal diversity, biogeography or ecology.","[Vetrovsky, Tomas; Baldrian, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, Lab Environm Microbiol, Vvi, CR-14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic","Baldrian, P (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, Lab Environm Microbiol, Vvi, Videnska 1083, CR-14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic.",baldrian@biomed.cas.cz,"Baldrian, Petr/A-9170-2009; Vetrovsky, Tomas/R-5817-2017","Baldrian, Petr/0000-0002-8983-2721; ","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LD12048, LD12050]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504/12/0709]; Research concept of the Institute of Microbiology ASCR [RVO61388971]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (LD12048, LD12050), by the Czech Science Foundation (P504/12/0709) and by the Research concept of the Institute of Microbiology ASCR (RVO61388971).",,63,107,107,4,155,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

It has been revealed recently that the autoregulation of various legumes controls both nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization. We investigated the involvement of autoregulation in the interaction between rhizobial nodulation and AM fungal colonization. We used a wild-type soybean cv. Enrei and its hypernodulating mutant Kanto100, defective in the autoregulation. We included four different treatments: an uninoculated control, inoculation with rhizobium Bradyrhizobium japonicum alone, inoculation with AM fungus Gigaspora rosea alone, and dual inoculation with rhizobium and AM fungus. In both Enrei and Kanto100, AM fungal colonization enhanced the weight and N-2 fixation of nodules, suggesting that autoregulation of host plant is not involved in the stimulatory effect of AM fungal colonization on rhizobial nodulation. In plants with the AM fungus alone, the AM fungal colonization of Enrei was comparable to that of Kanto100. In plants with dual inoculation, however, this was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in Kanto100. To confirm the control of AM fungal colonization by the autoregulation of host plant, a reciprocal grafting experiment was performed between Enrei and Kanto100. In plants with the AM fungus alone, AM fungal colonization was comparable among Enrei (shoot)/Enrei (root), Enrei/Kanto100, Kanto100/Enrei, and Kanto100/Kanto100 grafts. In plants with dual inoculation, however, AM fungal colonization of Enrei/Enrei and Enrei/Kanto100 grafts was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of Kanto100/Enrei and Kanto100/Kanto100. These results indicate that rhizobial nodulation suppresses AM fungal colonization, and the autoregulation of host plant, initiated by nodulation, is involved in this phenomenon.","[Sakamoto, Kazunori; Ogiwara, Natsuko; Kaji, Tomomitsu] Chiba Univ, Dept Hort, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan","Sakamoto, K (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Dept Hort, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",ksakamoto@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"SAKAMOTO, Kazunori/R-8750-2019; Sakamoto, Kazunori/R-8728-2019","Sakamoto, Kazunori/0000-0002-8817-814X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18380047, 23380042]","We are grateful to Dr. Ryo Yamamoto, NARO Institute of Crop Science, Tsukuba, Japan, for providing soybean seeds.

The natural environment of Wollemia nobilis, shady conditions and shallow, acidic soils with high organic matter, led to the hypothesis that organic N might be a potential N source, although this species is living in a subtropical area. A pot experiment was carried out to investigate whether W. nobilis seedlings have the capability to take up intact organic N and whether the uptake of organic N contributes significantly to N acquisition for W. nobilis. Three N-15-labeled N forms, ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), or glycine, were injected into soils separately, and the tissues of plants were then harvested 6 and 48 h after injection. Our results demonstrated that W. nobilis, a subtropical species, has the capability to take up intact glycine as indicated by the enrichment of C-13 and N-15 in fine roots at a nearly 1:1 ratio. The uptake rate of glycine-N was faster than that of inorganic N, but which was only restricted in the short term (6 h). The absorbed glycine-N reduced quickly (in 48 h), indicating that organic N uptake did not contribute greatly to N acquisition for W. nobilis.","[Wei, Lili; Chen, Chengrong] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Chen, Chengrong; Xu, Zhihong] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Xu, Zhihong] Griffith Univ, Sch Biomol & Phys Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Naesholm, Torgny] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Wei, LL (reprint author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",l.l.wei@hotmail.com,"Xu, Zhihong/B-3223-2009; chen, chengrong/K-8188-2019; Chen, Chengrong/B-3814-2009","Xu, Zhihong/0000-0002-6768-0720; chen, chengrong/0000-0001-6377-4001; Chen, Chengrong/0000-0001-6377-4001; Nasholm, Torgny/0000-0002-2275-2030","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT0990547, DP0667184]","This research was supported by the Australian Research Council (FT0990547; DP0667184).

To optimally achieve this, green roof plants need to use water when available, but reduce transpiration when limited to ensure survival. Succulent species commonly planted on green roofs do not achieve this. Water availability on green roofs is analogous to natural shallow-soil habitats including rock outcrops. We aimed to determine whether granite outcrop species could improve green roof performance by evaluating water use strategies under contrasting water availability. Physiological and morphological responses of 12 granite outcrop species with different life-forms (monocots, herbs and shrubs) and a common green roof succulent were compared in well watered (WW) and water deficit (WD) treatments. Granite outcrop species showed a variety of water-use strategies. Unlike the green roof succulent all of the granite outcrop species showed plasticity in water use. Monocot and herb species showed high water use under WW but also high water status under WD. This was achieved by large reductions in transpiration under WD. Maintenance of water status was also related to high root mass fraction. By developing a conceptual model using physiological traits we were able to select species suitable for green roofs. The ideal species for green roofs were high water users which were also drought tolerant.","[Farrell, Claire; Szota, Christopher; Williams, Nicholas S.

We studied 19 spruce stands to examine relationships between microbial community composition, stem growth, soil-, and lysimeter-collected soil solution characteristics, and N leaching. We used nitrate concentration in the soil solution below the rooting zone as an N leaching index and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis for characterisation of microbial communities. Microbial community composition in the organic horizon and soil solution chemistry below the rooting zone was highly correlated. Stands with low concentrations of nitrate (NO3 (-)) and aluminium (Al) had higher fungi: bacteria ratio compared with stands with higher concentrations of NO3 (-) and Al. Stem growth and fungi: bacteria ratio explained 70 % of the variation in N and Al leaching. We identified three microbial predictors of variation in soil solution chemistry, of which the fungi: bacteria was the strongest. The other two were putative indicators of microbial C limitation, a condition known to stimulate N mineralisation and nitrification.","[Hogberg, Mona N.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Hogbom, Lars] Forestry Res Inst Sweden, SE-75183 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kleja, Dan B.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Hogberg, MN (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",mona.n.hogberg@slu.se,"Hogberg, Mona N/L-9635-2014","Hogberg, Mona N/0000-0003-1258-7630","Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural SciencesSwedish Research Council Formas; Spatial Planning","We thank visiting Prof. Sari Palmroth (Duke University) and Prof. Vaughan Hurry (Umea University) for internal review of the manuscript, and Anders Jonshagen and Leo Kleja for help with soil sampling.

We investigated whether root exudates could enhance desorption of residual pollutants, thus improving bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation potential. Root exudates were harvested from three species of hydroponically grown plants, and artificial root exudates (AREs) were created using a literature recipe. Aliquots of the exudates were metabolized by soil bacteria to investigate whether biotransformed exudates exhibited different chemical characteristics or had different effects on contaminant bioavailability than 'raw exudates.' Slurries of naphthalene-aged soil containing raw exudates had a significantly lower soil-water distribution coefficient (K-d) than slurries with metabolized exudates or no-exudate controls, exhibiting median reductions of 50% and 55%, respectively. Raw exudates had a significantly lower surface tension while not increasing overall solubility, indicating the presence of surface-active compounds below the critical micelle concentration; this is a newly observed mechanism of the rhizosphere effect. Exudate samples were characterized by specific UV absorbance, spectral slope, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission matrices. Substantial changes in organic carbon character pre- and postmetabolism, and between harvested exudates and AREs, suggest that AREs are not chemically representative of plant root exudates. Overall, we present evidence that enhanced contaminant desorption in the presence of exudates provides an abiotic contribution to the rhizosphere effect.","[LeFevre, Gregory H.; Hozalski, Raymond M.; Novak, Paige J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Novak, PJ (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, 500 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",novak010@umn.edu,,"Hozalski, Raymond/0000-0002-7541-0165","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0504195]; University of Minnesota Water Resources Center, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; University of Minnesota Graduate School FellowshipUniversity of Minnesota System","We would like to thank Patrick McNamara (Marquette University) for his careful reading of this manuscript and members of the James Cotner lab (University of Minnesota), especially Meghan Jacobson, for providing use of their fluorometer and operating instructions.

We investigated the spatial variability of soil respiration in a mixed Mediterranean forest located on rugged terrain, where Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is affected by drought-induced dieback and appears to have been replaced by Holm oak (Quercus ilex) as the dominant tree species. Soil respiration was measured in spring 2010 on two plots (16.2 x 16.2 m) using a static closed chamber method (soda lime technique) and a systematic sampling (1.8-m grid) including 100 points per plot. Biotic and abiotic variables, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, soil organic matter content, stoniness, pH, fine root C:N ratio and biomass, tree basal area and tree species and health condition of nearest neighbouring tree were also recorded. Our results showed that the spatial variability of soil respiration under optimal environmental conditions (spring) was high and showed no spatial autocorrelation on the scale studied (1-18 m). A mixed-effects model applied to explain the spatial variability of soil respiration indicated that only the variables related to forest structure (i.e., health condition and basal area) explained any of the observed variability of soil respiration (R-2 = 0.45). Our model revealed that soil respiration was highest in soils close to dead pines and under Holm oak trees, suggesting that tree mortality and species replacement of pine trees by Holm oak may lead to higher soil respiration fluxes. The direct effect of tree mortality on soil respiration may be a transitory response caused by fine root mortality. Furthermore, the fact that tree species replacement as a result of drought-induced die-off is accompanied by concomitant changes in soil respiration has important implications for soil and ecosystem carbon balance.

To explore this issue, we adopt a community approach to examine the role of plant-microbial and insect-microbial symbioses in modulating a plant-herbivore interaction. Potato plants were grown under glass in controlled conditions and subjected to feeding from the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. By comparing plant growth in sterile, uncultivated and cultivated soils and the performance of M. euphorbiae clones with and without the facultative endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa, we provide evidence for complex indirect interactions between insect- and plant-microbial systems. Plant biomass responded positively to the live soil treatments, on average increasing by 15% relative to sterile soil, while aphid feeding produced shifts (increases in stem biomass and reductions in stolon biomass) in plant resource allocation irrespective of soil treatment. Aphid fecundity also responded to soil treatment with aphids on sterile soil exhibiting higher fecundities than those in the uncultivated treatment. The relative allocation of biomass to roots was reduced in the presence of aphids harbouring H. defensa compared with plants inoculated with H. defensa-free aphids and aphid-free control plants. This study provides evidence for the potential of plant and insect symbionts to shift the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions.","[Hackett, Sean C.; Karley, Alison J.; Bennett, Alison E.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Hackett, Sean C.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland","Bennett, AE (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",alibenne@bio.indiana.edu,,"Hackett, Sean/0000-0003-1048-8583",British Mycological Society; University of Dundee; Scottish Government,S.C.H. was funded by the British Mycological Society and The University of Dundee.

D. C., subject to flooding conditions in the nursery. The experiment was conducted at Forest Nursery, Department of Forest Sciences, Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), the municipality of Sao Cristovao, (11 degrees 01 'S latitude and 37 degrees 12' longitude W, altitude 20 m), state of Sergipe, Brazil, from October 2006 to January 2007 under ambient conditions. We used a completely randomized design (CRD), factorial (2x7), two treatments (control - T0, plants at field capacity and flooded - T1) and days after flooding (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days). To simulate the condition of flooding, the plants were placed in plastic pots of black color with a volume of 5 L and more substrate. Following these pots were attached to pots with a volume of 10 L, which was added water until it reaches a water depth of 5 cm above the top of the plants. The control plants kept in pots with a volume of 5 L substrate maintained at field capacity. In non-destructive variables were used four replicates per treatment evaluated every fifteen days, where each replicate consists of six plants, totaling 24. Destructive variables used were 4 replicates per treatment, determined biweekly from 15 days after flooding, where each replicate consists of a plant totaling 24 plants. Therefore, 48 plants were used per treatment. The non-destructive variables were height, diameter and number of leaves. While the destructive variables analyzed were dry weight of roots, dry weight of shoots and dry weight of root / shoot ratio. In addition, we carried out analysis of gas exchange on a monthly basis and evaluated twelve plants per treatment, with two sampling leaves, fully expanded, per plant. The biometric variables were subjected to analysis of variance and subsequently the average test (Tukey p < 0.05), while the values of gas exchange were taken from the standard deviations of the mean. Thus, we observe that the flooding caused a reduction in height and dry mass of root / shoot ratio, from 30 days after treatment application. In addition, flooded plants showed morphological changes such as hypertrophy of adventitious roots and lenticels, characteristics of species tolerant to flooding. The net photosynthetic rate has been reduced by 48.20% compared to control after 60 days. However, despite reductions in growth variables and gas exchange species Lonchocarpus sericeus showed promise in the recovery of riparian vegetation, due to its morphological characteristics of species tolerant to flooding.","[Sousa Lira, Jean Marcel] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Programa Fisiol Vegetal, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Ferreira, Roberio Anastacio; Santana, Wislane da Silva] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Ciencias Florestais, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [da Silva Junior, Carlos Dias] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [dos Santos Neto, Elisio Marinho] Secretaria Estado Meio Ambiente & Recursos Hidr, BR-49010410 Aracaju, SE, Brazil","Lira, JMS (reprint author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Programa Fisiol Vegetal, Campus Univ,Caixa Postal 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",lirajms@posgrad.ufla.br; raf@ufs.br; cdias@ufs.br; gararufloresta@yahoo.com.br; wislane_santana@hotmail.com,,,,,,48,3,3,0,9,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the effects of one-season tillage event in two field trials on the stocks of microbial biomass, fungal biomass, microbial residues, soil organic C (SOC) and total N in comparison with permanent grassland; (2) to determine the effects of repeated manure application to restore negative tillage effects on soil microbial biomass and residues. One trial was started 2 years before sampling and the other 5 years before sampling. Mouldboard ploughing decreased the stocks of SOC, total N, microbial biomass C, and microbial residues (muramic acid and glucosamine), but increased those of the fungal biomarker ergosterol in both trials. Slurry application increased stocks of SOC and total N only in the short-term, whereas the stocks of microbial biomass C, ergosterol and microbial residues were generally increased in both trials, especially in combination with tillage. The ergosterol to microbial biomass C ratio was increased by tillage, and decreased by slurry application in both trials. The fungal C to bacterial C ratio was generally decreased by these two treatments. The metabolic quotient qCO(2) showed a significant negative linear relationship with the microbial biomass C to SOC ratio and a significant positive relationship with the soil C/N ratio. The ergosterol to microbial biomass C ratio revealed a significant positive linear relationship with the fungal C to bacterial C ratio, but a negative one with the SOC content. Our results suggest that slurry application in grassland soil may promote SOC storage without increasing the role of saprotrophic fungi in soil organic matter dynamics relative to that of bacteria.

An effort was made to explore the role of Trichoderma harzianum T-E5 in reducing the incidence of Fusarium wilt. Three treatments (Control, T1, and T2) were established in the greenhouse experiment. The effects of T-E5 on the composition of root exudates and fungal community in the cucumber rhizosphere were measured. Compared with the control, the application of a bio-organic fertilizer (BIO) enriched with T-E5 was found to decrease the incidence of Fusarium wilt notably and promote the growth of cucumber plants. Based on real-time PCR, the population of F. oxysporum in the control without T-E5 increased from 103 to 104 ITS copies g(-1) soil, whereas the population decreased from 103 to 102 ITS copies g(-1) soil in the T1 and T2 treatment groups when T-E5 was included. Significant difference in fungal community was also found among the treatment groups. HPLC analysis showed that the detected levels of phenolic compounds in control were significantly higher than the levels in the samples subjected to T1 and T2 treatments. The root exudates from the control group significantly increased the numbers of germinating spores of the pathogen compared with those from the samples treated with T1 and T2. In conclusion, the modification of root exudates and the fungal community by the application of BIO might account for the effective suppression of Fusarium wilt disease in cucumbers.

A maximum population density of 19.3 x 10(3) CFU/g was recorded in monsoon and minimum of 3 x 10(3) CFU/g in premonsoon season. Two-way analysis of variance suggests that the fungal community varied significantly between the seasons (F = 9.543, P < 0.001) and at various depths sampled (F = 4.655, P < 0.05). In total, 54 fungal species belonging to 13 different families were documented and all species were sequenced for internal transcribed spacer genes. Each species was represented by at least two specimens constituting a total of 171 specimens for DNA barcoding. Twelve species of a marine fungi were sequenced for the first time. Branching patterns of phylogenetic tree strongly supported the sequence variations within and between all species barcoded. Based on the pairwise distance model we suggest barcode gaps of 15%, 21%, 30%, 35% and 51% for genera, family, order, class and phyla respectively.

However, few studies have simultaneously examined the responses of both the above- and belowground communities to N deposition. Here, we investigated the effects of 8years of simulated N deposition on soil microbial communities and plant diversity in a subtropical forest. The quantities of experimental N added (g of N m(-2)year(-1)) and treatment codes were 0 (N0, control), 6 (N1), 12 (N2), and 24 (N3). Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis was used to characterize the soil microbial community while plant diversity and coverage were determined in the permanent field plots. Microbial abundance was reduced by the N3 treatment, and plant species richness and coverage were reduced by both N2 and N3 treatments. Declines in plant species richness were associated with decreased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, increased bacterial stress index, and reduced soil pH. The plasticity of soil microbial community would be more related to the different responses among treatments when compared with plant community. These results indicate that long-term N deposition has greater effects on the understory plant community than on the soil microbial community and different conservation strategies should be considered.","[Wu, Jianping; Liu, Wenfei; Fan, Houbao; Yuan, Yinghong] Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guomin] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia; [Wan, Songze] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ji, Chunfeng] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Dept Hort & Art, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China","Fan, HB (reprint author), Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, 289 Tianxiang Rd, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China.",hbfan@nit.edu.cn,"Wu, Jianping/H-9150-2012; Huang, Guomin/J-2105-2014","Wu, Jianping/0000-0002-5784-834X; Huang, Guomin/0000-0002-7597-9386","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200406, 31060109, 30771714]; Jiangxi Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20122BAB204021]; Nanchang Institute of Technology [2012KJ001]; Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education [KJLD12097]","This work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 31200406; 31060109; 30771714), the Jiangxi Natural Science Foundation (20122BAB204021) and Young Scientific Funding from Nanchang Institute of Technology (2012KJ001) and Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education (KJLD12097).",,67,14,23,3,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here we studied simultaneously the newly grown biomass of ECM and fine roots in a young Norway spruce stand. Ingrowth mesh bags of 16 cm diameter and 12 cm height were placed in the upper soil and left for 12 to 16 months. The 2 mm mesh size allowed the ingrowth of fungal hyphae and roots whereas a 45 mu m mesh size allowed only the ingrowth of hyphae. The mesh bags were filled with either EA horizon soil, pure quartz sand or crushed granite. Controls without any ingrowth were established for each substrate by solid tubes (2010) and by 1 mu m mesh bags (2011). The fungal biomass in the substrates was estimated by the PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9 and ECM biomass was calculated as difference between fungal biomass in mesh bags and controls. The maximum ECM biomass was 438 kg ha(-1) in October 2010 in 2 mm mesh bags with EA substrate, and the minimum was close to zero in 2011 in 45 mu m mesh bags with quartz sand. The high P content of the crushed granite did not influence the ECM biomass. Fine root biomass reached a maximum of 2,343 kg ha(-1) in October 2010 in mesh bags with quartz sand after 16 months exposure. In quartz sand and crushed granite, ECM biomass correlated positively with fine root biomass and the number of root tips, and negatively with specific root length. The ratio of ECM biomass/fine root biomass in October ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 in quartz sand and crushed granite, but from 0.7 to 1.8 in the EA substrate. The results for the EA substrate suggest a large C flux to ECM under field conditions.","[Neumann, Jonny; Matzner, Egbert] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Matzner, E (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",egbert.matzner@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,56,4,6,0,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2013,371,2-Jan,,,,,435,446,,10.1007/s11104-013-1701-5,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,224JZ,WOS:000324882500033,,,,,10/31/19J,"De Roissart, A; de la Pena, E; Van Oyen, L; Van Leeuwen, T; Ballhorn, DJ; Bonte, D",,,,"De Roissart, Annelies; de la Pena, Eduardo; Van Oyen, Lien; Van Leeuwen, Thomas; Ballhorn, Daniel J.; Bonte, Dries",,,The presence of root-feeding nematodes - Not AMF - Affects an herbivore dispersal strategy,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dispersal; Plant-herbivore interaction; Soil biota; Tetranychus urticae,ARBUSCULAR-MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DENSITY-DEPENDENT DISPERSAL; BELOW-GROUND INTERACTIONS; 2-SPOTTED SPIDER-MITE; TETRANYCHUS-URTICAE; AERIAL DISPERSAL; INSECT HERBIVORES; MULTITROPHIC INTERACTIONS; PLANT DEFENSES; EVOLUTION,"Plant quality and aboveground herbivore performance are influenced either directly or indirectly by the soil community. As herbivore dispersal is a conditional strategy relative to plant quality, we examined whether belowground biotic interactions (the presence of root-feeding nematodes or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) affect aerial dispersal of a phytophagous mite (Tetranychus urticae) through changes in performance of their host plant (Phaseolus vulgaris). Aerial dispersal strategies of mites were analyzed in wind-tunnel experiments, in which a unique mite pre-dispersal behavior (rearing) was assessed in relation to the presence of belowground biota on the host plant on which mites developed. Spider mite pre-dispersal behavior significantly increased with the experienced mite density on the host during development. Additionally, plants infected with root-feeding nematodes induced an increase of spider mite aerial dispersal behavior. The results highlight that belowground herbivores can affect population dynamics of aboveground herbivores by altering dispersal strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Results suggest that roots can use biopores as preferred pathways for growth through rather compact soil layers, whereas they can possibly leave the biopore and re-enter the bulk soil in deeper, less compact layers.","[Kautz, Timo; Perkons, Ute; Athmann, Miriam; Koepke, Ulrich] Inst Organ Agr, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Pude, Ralf] Univ Bonn, D-53359 Rheinbach, Germany","Kautz, T (reprint author), Inst Organ Agr, Katzenburgweg 3, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",tkautz@uni-bonn.de,"Kautz, Timo/N-7660-2013; Athmann, Miriam/A-9177-2014","Kautz, Timo/0000-0002-7906-8512; ",German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG) [1320],"This study was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, research unit 1320).",,18,23,23,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are thought to have a key role in decomposing and mobilizing nitrogen from such complexes. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing these processes, how they are regulated by the carbon in the host plant and the availability of more easily available forms of nitrogen sources. Here we used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine how the presence or absence of glucose and/or ammonium regulates decomposition of litter material and nitrogen mobilization by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus. We found that the assimilation of nitrogen and the decomposition of the litter material are triggered by the addition of glucose. Glucose addition also resulted in upregulation of the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative degradation of polysaccharides and polyphenols, peptidases, nitrogen transporters and enzymes in pathways of the nitrogen and carbon metabolism. In contrast, the addition of ammonium to organic matter had relatively minor effects on the expression of transcripts and the decomposition of litter material, occurring only when glucose was present. On the basis of spectroscopic analyses, three major types of chemical modifications of the litter material were observed, each correlated with the expression of specific sets of genes encoding extracellular enzymes. Our data suggest that the expression of the decomposition and nitrogen assimilation processes of EMF can be tightly regulated by the host carbon supply and that the availability of inorganic nitrogen as such has limited effects on saprotrophic activities.","[Rineau, F.; Smits, M.

Four simulated rainfall regimes were applied: 600 mm year(-1) (severe water deficit), 800 mm year(-1) (mild water deficit), 1,000 mm year(-1) (mild wet), and 1,200 mm year(-1) (well-watered) used as control. Provenances were compared in terms of water relations (midday leaf water potential, I (md) and relative water content, RWC), growth (root, shoot and leaf length, neck diameter), growth rate (shoot- and neck growth rate, SGR and NGR), biomass production (root, shoot and leaf dry weight), and biomass allocation (root:shoot ratio, RSR). Multivariate analyses revealed that water relations differed significantly under all simulated rainfall treatments by means of several variables throughout time. Effects of species x treatment, and provenance nested within species x treatment interactions significantly were important. SGR and RSR also were important to explain differences in I (md) and RWC between treatments and provenances. Broadly C. balansae and C. saltensis provenances seem to display a better performance than C. fissilis provenances under severe water deficit only. However, despite differences between provenances, it was not possible to clearly separate them according to their origin, based on water relations and growth performance. Even though the results of this study performed on pot-grown seedlings are based on relatively few observations and require additional confirmation, they allow an opportunity for speculation on the factors that are related to intraspecific variations that are likely to occur during the growth of seedlings from different geographical sites in field condition.","[Ruiz, Veronica E.; Hilal, Mirna; Prado, Fernando E.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Catedra Fisiol Vegetal, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Ruiz, Veronica E.; Hilal, Mirna; Prado, Fernando E.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Inst Miguel Lillo, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Meloni, Diego A.] Univ Nacl Santiago del Estero, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Catedra Fisiol Vegetal, RA-4200 Santiago Del Estero, Argentina; [Fornes, Luis F.] EEA Famailla, Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, RA-4132 Famailla, Tucuman, Argentina; [Ordano, Mariano] Fdn Miguel Lillo, Inst Ecol, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina","Prado, FE (reprint author), Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat, Catedra Fisiol Vegetal, Miguel Lillo 205, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.",prad@arnet.com.ar,"Ordano, Mariano/H-8437-2019","Ordano, Mariano/0000-0003-0962-973X",National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) [PNFOR4233],This research was supported by the grant PNFOR4233 from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA).

These suspensions were subjected to UV irradiation in the absence of an added sacrificial reducing agent (SRA) for oxygen purged, air equilibrated and nitrogen purged solutions. A commercial Degussa P25 titanium dioxide powder (DP25) was taken as standard photocatalyst and compared to three other commercial titanium dioxide powders, namely Tioxide A-HR (AHR), Sigma-Aldrich Anatase (SAA) and Sigma-Aldrich Rutile (SAR). The highest rate of photocatalytic reduction was observed for the lower chlorinated Pd(II) complexes in nitrogen, i.e. oxygen depleted solutions, at constant temperature, photocatalyst load, pH and ionic strength on all four photocatalysts. Sigma-Aldrich Rutile (SAR) was the only photocatalyst capable of reducing the highly chloride coordinated [PdCl4)(2-) complex, in the absence of an added organic SRA, in air equilibrated and nitrogen purged solutions. The presence of dissolved oxygen was found to be detrimental to the photocatalytic reduction of highly chloride coordinated chloro-aqua palladium(II) complexes. The effect of the structure of the complex as well as the photocatalyst surface area, crystal phase composition, aggregate particle size and band gap energy was explored in an effort to elucidate the observed differences in behaviour of the photocatalysts.

We hypothesized that Piscidia piscipula is able to extend leaf senescence until later in the dry season due to deeper and more reliable water sources than Gymnopodium floribundum, which loses leaves earlier in the dry season. Physiological performance was assessed as timing of leaf production and loss, growth, leaf water potential, depth of water uptake determined by stable isotopes, and leaf stable isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18). P. piscipula took water primarily from shallow sources, whereas G. floribundum took water from shallow and deep sources. The greatest variation in water sources occurred during the onset of the dry season, when G. floribundum was shedding old leaves and growing new leaves, but P. piscipula maintained its leaves from the previous wet season. P. piscipula showed greater relative growth rate, greater leaf expansion rates, and more negative predawn and midday water potentials than G. floribundum. P. piscipula also exhibited greater leaf organic delta C-13 and lower delta O-18 values, indicating that the decrease in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination was associated with greater stomatal conductance and greater photosynthesis. Our results indicate that the contrasting early and late dry season leaf loss phenology of these two species is not simply determined by rooting depth, but rather a more complicated suite of characteristics based on opportunistic use of dynamic water sources, maximizing carbon gain, and maintenance of water potential during the dry season.","[Estrada-Medina, Hector; Jose Jimenez-Osornio, Juan] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Manejo & Conservac Recursos Nat Trop PROTROP, Merida 97315, Yucatan, Mexico; [Estrada-Medina, Hector; Graham, Robert C.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Soil & Water Sci Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Santiago, Louis S.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Santiago, Louis S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Allen, Michael F.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Estrada-Medina, H (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Manejo & Conservac Recursos Nat Trop PROTROP, Campus Ciencias Biol & Agr,Km 15-5 Carretera Meri, Merida 97315, Yucatan, Mexico.",hector.estrada@uady.mx,"Estrada Medina, Hector/A-7665-2014; Santiago, Louis/E-3185-2016","Santiago, Louis/0000-0001-5994-6122","CONACyT-UCMEXUSConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); UCMEXUS; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0615427, DEB 0770 6813, EF 0410408, CRR 0120778]; UCR Center for Conservation Biology","We thank to CONACyT-UCMEXUS for the scholarship granted to the first author for doctoral studies at the University of California Riverside.

We studied the community of AMF actively transcribing ribosomal genes in the forest floor of northern hardwood forests dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) that have been exposed to experimental N deposition since 1994 (30 kg NO3--N ha(-1) year(-1)). Our objective was to evaluate whether previously observed declines in AM root infection and mycelial production resulted in a compositional shift in the AM fungi actively providing resources to plant symbionts under chronic N deposition. To accomplish this task, we cloned and sequenced the LSU of reverse-transcribed AM fungal rRNA extracted from the forest floor under ambient and experimental N deposition treatments. We found that experimental N deposition did not alter the active community of AMF or AMF diversity, but we did observe a significant decrease in rare taxa under chronic N deposition. Our results indicate that chronic N deposition, at levels expected by the end of this century, can exert a moderate influence on the composition and abundance of AMF associated with plant roots in a wide-spread forest ecosystem in the northeastern North America.

Their extravagance and ubiquity can be puzzling because the common underlying genome of males and females is expected to impede rather than foster phenotypic divergence. Widespread dimorphism, despite a shared genome, may be more readily explained by considering the multivariate, rather than univariate, framework governing the evolution of sexual dimorphism. In the univariate formulation, differences in genetic variances and a low intersexual genetic correlation (rMF) can facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. However, studies that have analysed sex-specific differences in heritabilities or genetic variances do not always find significant differences. Furthermore, many of the reported estimates of rMF are very high and positive. When monomorphic heritabilities and a high rMF are present together, the evolution of sexual dimorphism on a trait-by-trait basis is severely constrained. By contrast, the multivariate formulation has greater generality and more flexibility. Although the number of multivariate sexual dimorphism studies is low, almost all support sex-specific differences in the G (variance-covariance) matrix; G matrices can differ with respect to size and/or orientation, affecting the response to selection differently between the sexes. Second, whereas positive values of the univariate quantity rMF only hinder positive changes in sexual dimorphism, positive covariances in the intersexual covariance B matrix can either help or hinder. Similarly, the handful of studies reporting B matrices indicate that it is often asymmetric, so that B can affect the evolution of single traits differently between the sexes. Multivariate approaches typically demonstrate that genetic covariances among traits can strongly constrain trait evolution when compared with univariate approaches. By contrast, in the evolution of sexual dimorphism, a multivariate view potentially reveals more opportunities for sexual dimorphism to evolve by considering the effect sex-specific selection has on sex-specific G matrices and an asymmetric B matrix.","[Wyman, M.

Interactions less negative (Enemy Release Hypothesis) or more positive (Enhanced Mutualist Hypothesis) compared to native plants may enhance invasive success and change exotic plant traits. We investigated plant soil interactions of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) from China (native range) and US (invasive range) populations along with US and China species within four co-occurring genera (Liquidambar, Litmus, Celtis, and Platanus) grown in both ranges. Treatments included sterilized, home, away, active mix, and fungicide treated soils. The net effect of soil biota on Triadica performance was generally negative or had no effect in its native range but was always positive in its invasive range. In China, Triadica had higher survival and biomass in ""away"" (heterospecific) soils than in ""home"" (conspecific) soil, but in the US, only biomass was higher. The pattern of performance in home and away soils suggests a stronger negative effect of specific pathogens for Triadica in China (Enemy Release Hypothesis). No other species had a significant feedback in either range. Triadica mycorrhizal colonization was higher in the US than in China supporting the Enhanced Mutualist Hypothesis. On average, Triadica performance was similar for native and invasive populations. However, invasive populations had greater biomass in active mix than in sterilized or fungicide-treated soil and native populations had higher mycorrhizal colonization in home than in away soils or active mix. These population origin results suggest genetic differences in strength or specificity of mycorrhizal interactions. Overall, our results support both ecological and evolutionary variation in interactions with the soil community that may influence the invasion success of exotic plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we tested Illumina metabarcoding, a method that generates shorter reads but achieves deeper sequencing than 454 metabarcoding approaches. We found that paired-end Illumina MiSeq data cover the full ITS1 in many fungal lineages and are suitable for environmental fungal community assessment. There was substantial read loss during data cleanup (78.6%), which, however, did not impede the analyses, because of the large number of initial sequences (over 4Mio). We observed a high stochasticity in individual PCR reactions. Comparing three repeated sets of PCRs products showed that 58.5% of the total fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found were not recovered by any single set of PCR reactions. Similarly, comparing three annealing temperatures showed that 63.6% of all fungal OTUs were not recovered using any single annealing temperature. These findings suggest that sampling of soil fungal communities is more exhaustive, if we combine repeated PCR products, and PCR products generated at various annealing temperatures. To analyze the above issues we sampled 16 soil cores along a 270 cm transect in a meadow. In total we recovered 3320 fungal OTUs (based on a 95% similarity threshold). Distance decay analysis indicated that community similarity decreased slightly with geographical distance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We used stable isotope signals from precipitation, soil water, and xylem water of Mongolian pine trees, which were planted in early 1980s on sand dunes in the east-southern margin of Horqin Sandy Land, to identify water uptake sources of this tree. (1) Stable O-18 isotope composition of the xylem water exhibited little seasonality, suggesting that the trees use a relatively stable water source; (2) the water source of the pine trees primarily came from a soil depth of 20-60 cm (sampling depth up to 60 cm in this study) and the trees might use groundwater when soil moisture became extremely low; and (3) there was not much difference in water sources used by the pine trees grown at the top of the fixed dune and in the inter dune lowland, although these two sites had 3-8 m elevation difference. This study suggests that it is critical for Mongolian pine trees to access relatively reliable and stable water sources to grow in sandy land habitats, and timely recharging of rainwater to the trees' rooting depth is requisite for avoiding and/or reducing their degradation caused by water shortage.","[Wei, Y.

Four temperate grassland sites of low to medium fertility located on a common soil were sampled in winter and summer at two different depths (0-40 cm, 40-80 cm) using a spatially intensive experimental sampling design. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition was determined via the amplification of AMF rRNA gene fragments present in fine roots combined with terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and sequencing analyses. For one out of three endonucleases applied, a site x depth interaction on T-RF richness (S) and Shannon's diversity index (H') was observed, indicating differences between sites in the upper soil layer and depth effects on S and H' for the extensively managed, low fertility site. The S and H' of the AMF taxa present in fine plant roots were marginally lower in winter than in summer (-14% and -16% for S and H', respectively). Evenness E did not vary as a function of site, season or depth. The AMF community profiles, as determined by nonmetric multidimensional scaling, differed between sites and seasons, but not among soil depths. The intersite AMF community variations were attributed to niche differentiation based on soil phosphorus availability and pH. Seasonal shifts could not be related to variations in root densities or physicochemical soil properties measured in this study, suggesting climate and plant regulation as major processes responsible for the variations between winter and summer AMF communities. It is concluded that diverse winter AMF communities are present in temperate grassland soils, and that plant roots colonizing subsoils harbour similar and equally diverse AMF assemblages than those present in topsoil layers.

There are many factors involved in its development. In this work, we have studied a large number of chemical and biological factors under the influence of different plant species (Pinus halepensis, Quercus rotundifolia, Cistus albidus and Rosmarinus officinalis) to learn which has the greatest responsibility for its presence and persistence in the top-soil layer. We observed strong and significant correlations between ergosterol, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP), extractable lipids, soil organic matter (SUM) content and water repellency (WR). Our results suggested lipid fraction as the principal factor. Moreover, apart from Pinus, fungal biomass seems to be also related to the SUM content. Soil WR found under Pinus appears to be the most influenced by fungi. Quality of SUM, to be precise, lipid fraction could be responsible for WR and its relationship with fungal activity.

Three areas within Eucalyptus obliqua forest that had not been burnt for more than 20 years were sampled and, based on the calculated mass of components prior to and immediately following burning, the redistribution of carbon within the forest and carbon emission from the forest to the atmosphere were estimated. Of the 165 Mg C ha(-1) in aboveground components, about 7.8 Mg C ha(-1) was redistributed through accession of tree components to the forest floor and deposition of incompletely combusted plant structures and litter on the soil surface. A further 6.7 Mg C ha(-1) was emitted to the atmosphere, mostly from the on-ground and near surface components of litter, coarse woody debris and understorey. Overall, these E. obliqua forests sequester around 244 Mg C ha(-1) to 30 cm soil depth (excluding woody roots) and planned burning transferred about 3% of this C to the atmosphere and a further 3% was transformed to charred and fragmented organic matter and deposited on the soil surface. Estimating long term C balance of burnt forests will require a much better understanding of the decay characteristics of these charred organic materials and good measures of post-fire aboveground carbon accumulation. The more intense a fire becomes the greater will be C emission from coarse woody debris and understorey, indicating the importance of quantifying these components in emission estimates for more intense planned burns and for wildfires.

This study sought to determine whether fine-root (< 1 mm) respiration in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)-dominated northern hardwood forest would adjust to experimentally warmed soil, reducing C return to the atmosphere at the ecosystem scale to levels lower than that would be expected using an exponential temperature response function. Infrared heating lamps were used to warm the soil (+4 to +5 degrees C) in a mature sugar maple forest in a fully factorial design, including water additions used to offset the effects of warming-induced dry soil. Fine-root-specific respiration rates, root biomass, root nitrogen (N) concentration, soil temperature and soil moisture were measured from 2009 to 2011, with experimental treatments conducted from late 2010 to 2011. Partial acclimation of fine-root respiration to soil warming occurred, with soil moisture deficit further constraining specific respiration rates in heated plots. Fine-root biomass and N concentration remained unchanged. Over the 2011 growing season, ecosystem root respiration was not significantly greater in warmed soil. This result would not be predicted by models that allow respiration to increase exponentially with temperature and do not directly reduce root respiration in drier soil.","[Jarvi, Mickey P.; Burton, Andrew J.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Burton, Andrew J.] Michigan Technol Univ, Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Jarvi, MP (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",mpjarvi@mtu.edu,,"Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997",U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FC02-06ER64158],The research was funded by U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) through the Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research (DE-FC02-06ER64158).,,36,23,26,1,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,2013,33,9,,,,,949,959,,10.1093/treephys/tpt068,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,241UW,WOS:000326194800007,24052568,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Lorenzo, P; Rodriguez-Echeverria, S; Freitas, H",,,,"Lorenzo, Paula; Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana; Freitas, Helena",,,No allelopathic effect of the invader Acacia dealbata on the potential infectivity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from native soils,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Allelochemical compounds; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); Natural leachates; Plant invasion; Plantago lanceolata,INVASIVE PLANT SUPPRESSES; COMMUNITIES; MICROBES; ENHANCE; WEAPONS; GROWTH; IMPACT,"The invasion success of the leguminous tree Acacia dealbata Link has been related to the release of novel chemical compounds that affect both native plant performance and native soil bacterial communities.

We used natural leachates from invasive A. dealbata and native soils to assess the bioactivity of these chemicals on AMF colonization of Plantago lanceolata in native soils. The highly mycorrhizal P. lanceolata was used as a model-test species to estimate the infectivity of AM fungi. Acacia leachates did not affect mycorrhizal colonization in any of the native soils studied. Either the leachates released by A. dealbata do not have an antifungal effect or the analyzed soils contained AMF species resistant to those allelochemicals.

This study investigated the phytoavailability and rhizospheric gradient distribution of bound residues of phenanthrene and pyrene as representative PAHs in soils. Although the available fractions of phenanthrene and pyrene in soils were removed, the clear uptake, accumulation, and translocation of phenanthrene and pyrene by ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) indicated a significant phytoavailability of bound-PAH residues in soils. Rhizosphere soil from the root surface (0-9 mm) was divided into three fractions: the rhizoplane, and strongly and loosely adhering soil. The concentrations of bound-PAH residues increased, and the rhizosphere effect (R) in the soil weakened with distance away from the root surface after plants were cultivated for 30 to 75 d. In general, the concentrations of bound-PAH residues decreased over time in all three components of rhizosphere soils; 24 to 40% and 0 to 36% of the bound residues of phenanthrene and pyrene were dissipated in the three rhizosphere soil fractions within 30 to 75 d, respectively. Dissipation ratios decreased in rhizosphere soils with distance from the root surface. The phytoavailability and reduced concentrations of the bound-PAH residues in the rhizosphere were indicative of their significant release and subsequent uptake by plants and/or degradation in the rhizosphere, which may be related to the reduced soil organic matter and enhanced microbial activity from the input of root exudates in the rhizosphere zone. The results of this work provide useful information on the fate and risk of PAHs in the soil environment.","[Gao, Yanzheng; Wang, Yize; Zeng, Yuechun; Zhu, Xuezhu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Enviornm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Gao, YZ (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Enviornm Sci, Weigang Rd 1, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gaoyanzheng@njau.edu.cn,"Gao, Yanzheng/G-6391-2010","Gao, Yanzheng/0000-0002-3814-3555","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41171193, 21077056, 41071212, 41171380]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYZ201109]; Key Technology R&D Program of Jiangsu Province [BE2011780]; Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, China [PCRRF11034]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41171193, 21077056, 41071212, 41171380), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (KYZ201109), the Key Technology R&D Program of Jiangsu Province (BE2011780), and the Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, China (PCRRF11034).",,77,10,11,1,72,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,1435-0661,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

However, the current understanding on controls of foliar delta N-15 is based principally on studies from America, Europe, Australia and Africa. Here we compiled data from 65 forests at 33 sites across East Asia to explore regional patterns and what controls foliar delta N-15 by linking it to climate, species composition, soil depth, slope position, N deposition, and soil N availability. In East Asia, foliar delta N-15 ranged from -7.1 to +2.7aEuro degrees. Mean foliar delta N-15 values for tropical, subtropical and temperate forests were all -3.1aEuro degrees, which was unexpected. The patterns of foliar delta N-15 with precipitation, temperature and altitude were not clear. The variation in foliar delta N-15 among species and between different slope positions appeared to be small within a given forest. The delta N-15 for both bulk soil N and extractable inorganic N generally increased with soil depth as expected, strengthening the idea that deep-rooted trees may have access to N-15-enriched N. Different from the positive correlations reported across America and Europe, in East Asia we found that foliar delta N-15 decreased with increasing N deposition and did not relate to soil N availability. These discrepancies deserve more research to elucidate the mechanisms by which foliar delta N-15 is affected by ecosystem N availability at a regional scale.","[Fang, Yunting; Koba, Keisuke; Yoh, Muneoki; Makabe, Akiko; Liu, Xueyan] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Yoh, M (reprint author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.",yoh@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012; Koba, Keisuke/A-3699-2012; Yoh, Muneoki/C-2047-2013","Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X; Koba, Keisuke/0000-0003-1942-9811; ","Sumitomo Foundation; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [GS008]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40903012, 40721002]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [09F09316];  [187801172];  [19310019];  [20780113];  [21310008]","This work was supported by a Grant for Projects for the Protection, Preservation & Restoration of Cultural Properties in Japan by the Sumitomo Foundation, Grants-in-Aid for Creative Scientific Research (Nos. 187801172, 19310019, 20780113 and 21310008), the Program to Create an Independent Research Environment for Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and NEXT Program (GS008) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The preference or specificity for partners in these symbiotic relationships is a key to understanding how the community structures of root-associated fungi and their host plants influence each other. In an oak-dominated forest in Japan, we investigated the root-associated fungal community based on a pyrosequencing analysis of the roots of 33 plant species. Of the 387 fungal taxa observed, 153 (39.5%) were identified on at least two plant species. Although many mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi are shared between the plant species, the five most common plant species in the community had specificity in their association with fungal taxa. Likewise, fungi displayed remarkable variation in their association specificity for plants even within the same phylogenetic or ecological groups. For example, some fungi in the ectomycorrhizal family Russulaceae were detected almost exclusively on specific oak (Quercus) species, whereas other Russulaceae fungi were found even on ""non-ectomycorrhizal"" plants (e.g., Lyonia and Ilex). Putatively endophytic ascomycetes in the orders Helotiales and Chaetothyriales also displayed variation in their association specificity and many of them were shared among plant species as major symbionts. These results suggest that the entire structure of belowground plant-fungal associations is described neither by the random sharing of hosts/symbionts nor by complete compartmentalization by mycorrhizal type. Rather, the colonization of multiple types of mycorrhizal fungi on the same plant species and the prevalence of diverse root-endophytic fungi may be important features of belowground linkage between plant and fungal communities.","[Toju, Hirokazu; Sato, Hirotoshi; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Kadowaki, Kohmei; Tanabe, Akifumi S.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Toju, Hirokazu; Sato, Hirotoshi; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Kadowaki, Kohmei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Yazawa, Shigenobu; Nishimura, Osamu; Agata, Kiyokazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Toju, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",toju.hirokazu.4c@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yazawa, Shigenobu/E-6395-2014; Toju, Hirokazu/S-7307-2017; Sato, Hirotoshi/A-2429-2015; Kadowaki, Kohmei/K-8117-2019; Tanabe, Akifumi/P-9381-2015","Yazawa, Shigenobu/0000-0003-4539-3875; Toju, Hirokazu/0000-0002-3362-3285; Kadowaki, Kohmei/0000-0003-0512-1621; Agata, Kiyokazu/0000-0002-5195-2576; Nishimura, Osamu/0000-0003-1969-2580; Tanabe, Akifumi/0000-0003-1017-6504","Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, the Japanese Government [GS014]; Global GCOE Program of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [A06]","This work was supported by the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, the Japanese Government (to H.

Although many species may be suitable, black willow (Salix nigra) is the species of choice in streambank stabilization projects in the southeastern United States. Studies were conducted on four species native to the southeastern United States that have potential for success as live stakes. Black willow, silky willow (Salix sericea), silky dogwood (Cornus amomum), and Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica) were evaluated for biomass differences among species, effect of soaking stakes in tap water for 48 hours prior to installation, and differences in survival attributed to season of harvest.The,experiment was conducted at the Paterson Horticulture Greenhouse Complex, Auburn University, Alabama. Each species was established from live stakes and had 100% survival when harvested during the dormant season. Total biomass of soaked and nonsoaked live stakes of silky dogwood was greater than soaked and nonsoaked black willow live stakes at nine months. This was driven by belowground biomass. At nine months, silky dogwood belowground biomass for nonsoaked stakes was greater than belowground biomass for black willow, silky willow, and Virginia sweetspire. Belowground biomass of soaked silky dogwood stakes was similar to belowground biomass of silky willow and greater than belowground biomass of black willow. Soaking live stakes, collected in the dormant season for 48 hours resulted in only one significant total biomass difference between soaked and nonsoaked in the species silky dogwood at six months. After nine months of growth, there were no differences between soaked and nonsoaked live stake biomass. Virginia sweetspire, a shrub, consistently had less biomass, diameter, and height than the other species. However, the nine month root:shoot ratio of Virginia sweetspire was greater than both willow species and similar to silky dogwood. There was 0% survival of black willow, silky willow, and silky dogwood after six months when live stakes were harvested during the growing season irrespective of soaking treatment. Live stakes ofVirginia sweetspire harvested in the growing season had a survival rate of 80% for soaked stakes and 67% for nonsoaked stakes.The four native species evaluated in this study became established and survived as live stakes. These species are candidates for use in riparian enhancement and restoration projects, which will assist with increasing riparian plant diversity.","[Hunolt, A.

Increasing evidence suggests AMF diversity is at least partially controlled by the identities of plants in the host plant neighborhood. However, much of this evidence comes from greenhouse studies or work in invaded systems dominated by single plant species, and has not been tested in species-rich grasslands. We worked in 67 grasslands spread across the three German Biodiversity Exploratories that are managed primarily as pastures and meadows, and collected data on AMF colonization, AMF richness, AMF community composition, plant diversity, and land use around focal Plantago lanceolata plants. We analyzed the data collected within each Exploratory (ALB Schwabische Alb, HAI Hainich-Dun, SCH Schorfheide-Chorin) separately, and used variance partitioning to quantify the contribution of land use, host plant neighborhood, and spatial arrangement to the effect on AMF community composition. We performed canonical correspondence analysis to quantify the effect of each factor independently by removing the variation explained by the other factors. AMF colonization declined with increasing land use intensity (LUI) along with concurrent increases in non-AMF, suggesting that the ability of AMF to provide protection from pathogens declined under high LUI. In ALB and HAI mowing frequency and percent cover of additional P. lanceolata in the host plant neighborhood were important for AMF community composition. The similar proportional contribution of land use and host neighborhood to AMF community composition in a focal plant rhizosphere suggests that the diversity of this important group of soil microbes is similarly sensitive to changes at large and small scales.","[Morris, E.

Due to global warming and other changes in the environment, many native and exotic plant species show range expansion from lower to higher latitudes. In the new range, the (in)ability of range-expanding plants to establish associations with local soil microbes can have important consequences for plant abundance; however, very little information exists on rhizosphere communities of range-expanding plant species. Here, we examine the rhizosphere microbial community composition of range-expanding plant species in comparison with phylogenetically related species that are native in the invaded range. 2. We tested the hypothesis that range-expanding plants species would promote fewer shifts in rhizosphere communities than congeneric natives would. In order to test this, soil was collected from the invaded habitat and six range-expanding and nine congeneric natives were planted individually in pots to condition soil microbial communities. 3. After harvesting, individuals of the same species were planted in conditioned own and control soils to test the legacy effects of soil conditioning on biomass production. The control soils were mixtures of soils conditioned by all other plant species, except congenerics. After 10weeks of plant growth, we determined the rhizosphere community composition of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Fusarium spp. 4. All groups of microbes were analysed qualitatively using denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Ergosterol was determined as a quantitative measure of nonarbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass, and real-time PCR was applied to detect amounts of Fusarium spp. 5. Range-expanding plants had less fungal hyphal biomass and lower amounts of Fusarium spp. in the rhizosphere than congenerics. Bacterial community composition was influenced by a combination of soil conditioning and plant origin, whereas fungal communities, AMF and Fusarium spp. were less pronounced in their responses to the experimental treatments. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that the lack of legacy effects in range-expanding plant species compared with natives may be due to differences in bacterial rhizosphere community composition, or to different quantities of potential pathogenic fungi. If the range-expanding plant species were benefiting more from AMF, effects will not have been due to differences in community composition, but we cannot exclude other options, such as different effectiveness of AMF or other soil biota in the rhizosphere of range-expanding vs. native plant species. The greater accumulation of bacterial and fungal pathogens in the rhizosphere of natives in relation to range expanders might explain the successful establishment of range-expanding plants.","[Morrien, Elly; van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Morrien, E (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, POB 50, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.",e.morrien@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Morrien, Elly/H-3527-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Morrien, Elly/0000-0002-6490-2260; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",ALW-VICI [865.05.002],"We thank Tim Engelkes for the invaluable help in the set-up and development of the experiment; Staatsbosbeheer Regio Oost for allowing permission to collect soil and seeds in the Millingerwaard; Baudewijn Ode, Wil Tamis, Kees Groen, Arjen Biere, Martijn Bezemer, Jeffrey Harvey and the late Ruud van der Meijden for discussions; Wiecher Smant, Miranda Vlag, Lonneke Hensen and Freddy ten Hooven for chemical and molecular analyses; Agata Pijl, Tanja Bakx-Schotman, George Kowalchuk, Etienne Yergeau, Petr Smilauer, Jan Leps and Cajo ter Braak for advices during molecular data interpretation; and George Kowalchuk, Emilia Hannula and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions on a previous version of the manuscript.

The ability to form effective mutualisms with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is implicated in the success of introduced leguminous plant species, such as Acacia. While Acacia appear to associate with rhizobia where introduced, there is evidence that the extent of this may limit success during early stages of colonization. 2. We examine three Australian Acacia species that have been introduced to New Zealand and ask whether variation in their ability to form rhizobial associations can explain differences in the degree to which they have established and spread since introduction. 3. In both Australia and New Zealand, we used glasshouse experiments to measure growth and nodulation of Acacia seedlings grown under two soil treatments: soils taken from underneath conspecifics (Host+ soils) and soils taken from the same sites but away from Acacia trees (Host-). We predicted that suitable rhizobia would be widespread in Australia leading to similar growth and nodulation in Host+ and Host- soils. However, we predicted lower growth and nodulation in New Zealand Host- soils, relative to New Zealand Host+ soils, due to limited availability of suitable rhizobia away from established conspecifics. We also predicted that differences between Host+ and Host- soils would be less marked in Acacia that were more widespread in New Zealand. Finally, we examined whether the establishment of one Acacia species might facilitate the establishment of other species by planting seedlings into soils associated with each of the two congeners. 4. As predicted, seedling growth and nodulation were lower in Host- than Host+ soils in New Zealand but there was no significant difference in Australia. In both countries, the difference between Host+ and Host- soils was similar for all three species and in conspecific and congeneric soils. 5. Synthesis. In New Zealand, Acacia seedlings that colonize sites away from established conspecifics or congeners are likely to suffer reduced growth and nodulation, which may limit their ability to establish and spread away from introduction sites. However, this limitation was the same for all three species, implying that interactions with soil biota cannot explain differences in the degree to which these Acacia have spread in New Zealand.","[Wandrag, Elizabeth M.; Duncan, Richard P.; Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Sheppard, Andy] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Duncan, Richard P.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Wandrag, EM (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 84, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",elizabethwandrag@gmail.com,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011; Sheppard, Andy W/C-1045-2009; Duncan, Richard P/E-7899-2013","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; Sheppard, Andy W/0000-0002-6188-7122; Duncan, Richard P/0000-0003-2295-449X; Wandrag, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8140-539X",New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission; Bio-Protection Research Centre; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"This research was funded by a New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission PhD scholarship, the Bio-Protection Research Centre and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

However, vegetation and soil delta N-15 patterns along climatic and edaphic gradients have not yet been fully understood, particularly for high-altitude ecosystems. Here we determined vegetation and soil delta N-15 in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau by conducting four consecutive regional surveys during 2001-2004, and then examined their relationships with both climatic and edaphic variables. Our results showed that both vegetation and soil N in Tibetan alpine grasslands were more N-15-enriched than global averages. Vegetation delta N-15 did not exhibit any significant trend along the temperature gradient, but decreased significantly with an increase in precipitation amount. In contrast, soil delta N-15 did not vary with either mean annual temperature or precipitation. Our results also indicated that soil delta N-15 exhibited a slight increase with clay content, but decreased with soil carbon:nitrogen ratio. A general linear model analysis revealed that variations in vegetation delta N-15 were dominantly determined by climatic variables, whereas soil delta N-15 was related to edaphic variables. These results provide clues for potential climatic and edaphic regulations on ecosystem N cycle in these high-altitude regions.","[Yang, Yuanhe; Shen, Haihua; Fang, Jingyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanhe; Ji, Chengjun; Fang, Jingyun] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanhe; Ji, Chengjun; Fang, Jingyun] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Robinson, David] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Zhu, Biao] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fang, Huajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Yang, YH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yhyang@ibcas.ac.cn,"Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011; Zhu, Biao/F-8712-2010; Robinson, David/C-2112-2009","Zhu, Biao/0000-0001-9858-7943; Robinson, David/0000-0003-3504-5981","Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [1102000129]; National Basic Research Program of China on Global ChangeNational Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950600]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31021001, 41071166]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050503]","We thank members of the Peking University Sampling Campaign Teams for their assistance in field investigation.

Here, we used a powerful sample size and a strong quantitative genetic approach to analyse the sources of variation of early seedling performance and to identify seed mass (SM)-dependent and -independent maternal environmental effects in Maritime pine. We measured SM of 8924 individual seeds collected from 10 genotypes clonally replicated in two environments of contrasting quality (favourable and stressful), and we measured seedling growth rate and biomass allocation to roots and shoots. SM was extremely variable (up to 14-fold) and strongly determined by the maternal environment and the genotype of the mother tree. The favourable maternal environment led to larger cones, larger seeds and reduced SM variability. The maternal environment also determined the offspring phenotype, with seedlings coming from the favourable environment being 35% larger and with greater root/shoot ratio. Transgenerational plasticity appears, thus, to be a relevant source of phenotypic variation in the early performance of this pine species. Seed provisioning explained most of the effect of the maternal environment on seedling total biomass. Environmental maternal effects on seedling biomass allocation were, however, determined through SM-independent mechanisms, suggesting that other epigenetic regulation channels may be involved.","[Zas, R.; Cendan, C.; Sampedro, L.] Mision Biol Galicia MBG CSIC, E-36080 Galicia, Spain","Zas, R (reprint author), MBG CSIC, Apdo 28, E-36080 Galicia, Spain.",rzas@mbg.csic.es,"SAMPEDRO, LUIS/Y-4894-2019; SAMPEDRO, LUIS/B-7187-2011; Zas, Rafael/I-5729-2014","SAMPEDRO, LUIS/0000-0002-3921-2575; SAMPEDRO, LUIS/0000-0002-3921-2575; Zas, Rafael/0000-0001-6563-2461","Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I [INIA-RTA2007-100, PSE310000, AGL2010-187241]; EU-FEDEREuropean Union (EU); DOC-INIA grant at the Centro de Investigacion Forestal de Lourizan","This work was supported by the Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I (INIA-RTA2007-100, PSE310000 and AGL2010-18724) and co-financed by EU-FEDER.

In addition to soil organism biomass, shrinkage analysis and soil aggregate stability analysis were used to characterize the soil physical properties. The soil aggregate stability, specific volume and structural pores volumes were increased with plant roots compared to control. The drilling effect of roots could not explain the pore volume increase, which was several orders of magnitude larger than the volume of the roots. Leek had larger impact on volumes while petunia mostly increased soil aggregate stability. Mycorrhizae increased the soil stability and the soil volume. Earthworms alone decreased the pore volumes at any pore size, and plant roots mitigated this.

C stocks were modeled, performing boosted regression trees (BRT). Overall CFR was 2.8 t ha(-1), with significantly higher C stocks in diked (DRF) compared to flooded riparian forests (FRF). In contrast to CFR, mean CAB was 123 t ha(-1) and lower in DRF compared to FRF. However, dike construction was consistently ruled out as a predictor variable in BRT. CFR was influenced by the distance to the Danube River and the dominant tree species. CAB was mainly influenced by the magnitude of fluctuations in the groundwater table and the distances to the river and the low groundwater table.

The present study was performed to obtain insights into the physiology and potential role(s) of DSE fungi for Salix caprea growing in metal-enriched sites. Fungal isolates from S. caprea roots were identified using molecular methods, and tested for their tolerance and metal accumulation in axenic cultures. In addition, an inoculation experiment was performed to monitor the effects of the fungi on the metal uptake by the plant host. Fitness of S. caprea cuttings was assessed by photosynthetic pigment quantification and measurements of transpiration. Fungal isolates were identified as members of the Phialophora/Cadophora complex. They showed different levels of metal tolerance and maintained growth on metal-enriched media. In comparison to non-inoculated cuttings, the DSE-inoculated cuttings had lower leaf Cd content, and for isolates DB146 and DB148, also lower Zn concentrations. All DSE isolates increased the chlorophyll levels of the cuttings, with isolate DB146 also positively affecting the transpiration rate of S. caprea. Our findings suggest that DSE reduced the metal uptake by the S. caprea cuttings, thus suggesting a beneficial role for S. caprea in metal-enriched soils.","[Likar, M.; Regvar, M.] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Likar, M (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Venca Pot 111, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matevz.likar@bf.uni-lj.si,"Likar, Matevz/T-4538-2017; Regvar, Marjana/B-8867-2018","Likar, Matevz/0000-0002-3086-6433; Regvar, Marjana/0000-0002-2623-1099",,,,66,37,40,2,91,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2013,370,2-Jan,,,,,593,604,,10.1007/s11104-013-1656-6,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,202XG,WOS:000323253500044,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kristin, A; Miranda, H",,,,"Kristin, Aleklett; Miranda, Hart",,,The root microbiota-a fingerprint in the soil?,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Review,,,,,,Root microbiota; Plant life stages; Community assembly; Historical contingency,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; GUT MICROBIOTA; RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOME; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; STRESS TOLERANCE; DISPERSAL AGENTS; SPORE DISPERSAL; PH GRADIENT,"The root system of a plant is known to host a wide diversity of microbes that can be essential or detrimental to the plant. Microbial ecologists have long struggled to understand what factors structure the composition of these communities. An overlooked part of the microbial community succession in root systems has been the potential for individual variation among plants shaped by early colonisation events such as microbial exposure of the seed inside the parent plant and during dispersal. In this review we outline life events of the plant that can affect the composition of its root microbiota and relate ecological theory of community assembly to the formation of the root microbiota. All plants are exposed to environmental conditions and events throughout their lifetime that shape their phenotype. The microbial community associated with the plant is ultimately an extension of this phenotype. Therefore, only by following a plant from its origin inside the flower to senescence, can we fully understand how the associated microbial community was assembled and what determined its composition.","[Kristin, Aleklett; Miranda, Hart] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Miranda, H (reprint author), Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",miranda.hart@ubc.ca,,,,,,128,36,36,2,175,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2013,370,2-Jan,,,,,671,686,,10.1007/s11104-013-1647-7,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,202XG,WOS:000323253500050,,,,,10/31/19J,"Leal, PL; Siqueira, JO; Sturmer, SL",,,,"Leal, Patricia Lopes; Siqueira, Jose Oswaldo; Stuermer, Sidney Luiz",,,Switch of tropical Amazon forest to pasture affects taxonomic composition but not species abundance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Land use; Species richness; Glomeromycota; Spore abundance; Community structure; Mycorrhiza,LAND-USE; RAIN-FOREST; AGROECOSYSTEMS; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; VERACRUZ; GLOMALIN; SPORES; SOILS,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community composition and species richness are affected by several factors including soil attributes and plant host. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that conversion of tropical Amazon forest to pasture changes taxonomic composition of AMF community but not community species abundance and richness. Soil samples were obtained in 300 m x 300 m plots from forest (n = 11) and pasture (n = 13) and fungal spores extracted, counted and identified. A total of 36 species were recovered from both systems, with 83% of them pertaining to Acaulosporaceie and Glomeraceae. Only 12 species were shared between systems and spore abundance of the majority of fungal species did not differ between pasture and forest. Spore abundance was significantly higher in pasture compared to forest but both systems did not differ on mean species richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou equitability. Species abundance distribution depicted by species rank log abundance plots was not statistically different between both systems. We concluded that conversion of pristine tropical forest to pasture influences the taxonomic composition of AMF communities while not affecting species richness and abundance distribution.

It has been suggested that the diversity and radiation of the Aizoaceae are coincident with low but predictable rainfall and lack of competition between species. In this study we examine the relationship between water source and the efficiency of PSII photochemistry for representative Aizoaceae and non-Aizoaceae. We do this to determine the extent to which the different genera are adapted to the frequent, low volume, precipitation characteristic of the region and to ascertain the extent to which there is competition for water. Our water isotope results show that the Aizoaceae use shallow surface water while the non-Aizoaceae use a deeper water source. We are however not able to show the extent to which the Aizoaceae utilize fog or dew. Our chlorophyll fluorescence results show that there are no differences in efficiency of PSII photochemistry between the species in the wet season. The decline from wet to dry season for the Aizoaceae is, however, more dramatic than that of the non-Aizoaceae reflecting the differences in rooting depth between the different families. These results suggest that, during the dry season, there is no competition for resources between families but there is competition between species. We conclude that the adaptation to using shallow water, coupled with susceptibility to drought of adult short lived Aizoaceae may be a, mechanism for the diversification of this family.","[February, Edmund C.; Matimati, Ignatious; Hedderson, Terry A.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Matimati, Ignatious; Musil, Charles F.] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Climate Change Bioadaptat Div, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa","February, EC (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",edmund.february@uct.ac.za,,"Matimati, Ignatious/0000-0002-3081-9506",German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC0624A2],"Mr. S.

The objective of this study was to examine how the time of environmental recuperation is affecting the occurrence and diversity of AMF species in riparian areas belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study involved a native forest area (NT) and a gradient of environmental restoration: five (R05), ten (R10), and twenty (R20) years after reforestation. Soil samples were collected in the rainy (January) and dry season (June). Chemical, physical and microbiological analyses were performed including the amount of glomalin and quantification of AMF spores. The frequency of occurrence of genera and ecological indices, as richness (R), Shannon's diversity (H) and Simpson's dominance index (Is) were calculated. The largest spore number was found in R05 and the highest richness and diversity indices of AMF species in NT. Considering the two sampling periods and the four areas studied, we found 22 AMF species, and the genera Glomus and Acaulospora were the most frequent. A Canonical Discriminant Analysis showed that Glomus viscosum, Acaulospora scrobiculata, Acaulospora mellea and Scutellospora heterogama were the species that contributed the most to distinguishing the areas. Moisture, density and glomalin were positively correlated with the number of spores, however, soil nitrate showed a negative correlation. This work gives a better understanding of the interactions between AMF and forest soils and allows to know the distribution of AMF species according to environmental recovery time.

However, response to climate may be affected by inter-species interactions and local constraints, which beg the question of the effect of mixture on tree growth response under various ecological conditions. To assess these effects, climate-tree growth relationships of pure Abies alba stands were compared to those of three different mixtures: A. alba with Fagus sylvatica, with Picea abies and with both species. 151 stands (456 A. alba trees) were sampled in the Vosges mountains in north-eastern France under three contrasted climates, from low altitude and dry conditions (mean precipitation in July <85 mm and altitude <600 m) to high altitude and humid conditions (P July >115 mm and alt. >900 m). We sampled adult trees and homogeneous stand conditions to clearly assess differences in sensitivity to climate. Climate-tree growth relationships were evaluated from 12 A. alba chronologies (four mixtures x three climatic conditions) through pointer years and response function analyses. Late previous summer conditions and current summer soil water deficit and temperature played a major role on A. alba growth. Results showed greater sensitivity to temperature at high elevation, and to summer drought at low altitude and under dry conditions. Mixture allowed maintaining a higher level of A. alba growth during extreme climatic events and reduced A. alba response to summer drought especially under the driest contexts. Different facilitation processes may explain mixture effects such as changes in rooting depth, water input by stemflow and rainfall interception. This differentiated functioning of mixed forests highlights their importance for adapting forest management to climate change. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Optimal resource partitioning theory predicts that plants should increase the ratio between water absorbing and transpiring surfaces under short water supply. An increase in fine root mass and surface area relative to leaf area has frequently been found in herbaceous plants, but supporting evidence from mature trees is scarce and several results are contradictory. 2. In 12 mature Fagus sylvatica forests across a precipitation gradient (820-540mmyr(-1)), we tested several predictions of the theory by analysing the dependence of standing fine root biomass, fine root production and fine root morphology on mean annual precipitation (MAP), the precipitation of the study year, and stand structural and edaphic variables. The water storage capacity of the soil (WSC) was included as a covariable by comparing pairs of stands on sandy (lower WSC) and loam-richer soils (higher WSC). 3. Fine root biomass, total fine root surface area, fine root production and the fine root:leaf biomass production ratio markedly increased with reduced MAP and precipitation in the study year, while WSC was only a secondary factor and stand structure had no effect. 4. The precipitation effect on fine root biomass and production was more pronounced in stands on sandy soil with lower WSC, which had, at equal precipitation, a higher fine root biomass and productivity than stands on loam-richer soil. 5. The high degree of allocational plasticity in mature F. sylvatica trees contrasts with a low morphological plasticity of the fine roots. On the more extreme sandy soils, a significant decrease in mean fine root diameter and increase in specific root area with decreasing precipitation were found; a similar effect was absent on the loam-richer soils. 6. Synthesis. In support of optimal partitioning theory, mature Fagus sylvatica trees showed a remarkable allocational plasticity as a long-term response to significant precipitation reduction with a large increase in the size and productivity of the fine root system, while only minor adaptive modifications occurred in root morphology. More severe summer droughts in a future warmer climate may substantially alter the above-/below-ground C partitioning of this tree species with major implications for the forest C cycle.","[Hertel, Dietrich; Strecker, Tanja; Mueller-Haubold, Hilmar; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Strecker, Tanja] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hertel, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",dhertel@gwdg.de,,,Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony (Germany),We like to thank Irmgard Gerstmann and Mechthild Stange for their skilful support with the fine root analysis.

An interesting plant to be used in restoration of saline environments, Asteriscus maritimus, is highly mycotrophic. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of native and allochthonous AMF to enhance the establishment and growth of the halophyte A. maritimus under saline conditions. We studied the symbiotic effectiveness of four AMF strains (three native fungal isolates from a saline soil and one allochthonous, from collection) in A. maritimus subjected to increasing salinity stress. We measured plant physiological parameters by which AMF may ameliorate the detrimental effects of salinity stress. A. maritimus plants showed a high mycorrhizal dependency, even in absence of salt stress. Plants inoculated with native AMF had higher shoot dry weight, efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and accumulation of glutathione than those inoculated with the collection AMF at the highest level of salinity. Moreover, at this salt level, only 30 % of A. maritimus plants inoculated with the collection AMF survived, while with the three native AMF, the rate of survival was 100 %. Results points out the importance of native AMF inoculation in the establishment, survival and growth of A. maritimus plants. Inoculation with these native AMF enhanced A. maritimus salt tolerance by increasing efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and glutathione content and by reducing oxidative damage. Thus, the use of adequate native AMF inocula could be a critical issue for success in recovering saline degraded areas.","[Estrada, Beatriz; Aroca, Ricardo; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion; Miguel Barea, Jose; Manuel Ruiz-Lozano, Juan] Estn Expt Zaidin CSIC, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, Granada 18008, Spain","Ruiz-Lozano, JM (reprint author), Estn Expt Zaidin CSIC, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, Prof Albareda 1, Granada 18008, Spain.",juanmanuel.ruiz@eez.csic.es,"Aroca, Ricardo/K-5268-2014; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015; Azcon, Concepcion/H-5873-2015","Aroca, Ricardo/0000-0003-2402-2063; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718; Azcon, Concepcion/0000-0003-3041-8566; Ruiz Lozano, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-4473-5434","Junta de Andalucia (Spain)Junta de Andalucia [P06-CVI-01876, P11-CVI-7107]","This work was financed by two research projects supported by Junta de Andalucia (Spain).

Reports state that increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 will stimulate photosynthesis and productivity in most ecosystems. However, the duration and magnitude of this stimulation, particularly in the tropics, remains a question. To investigate the effects of CO2 fertilization on plant growth, seedlings of three common plantation species, Casuarina equisetifolia, Ailanthus excelsa and Tectona grandis were grown in closed chambers enriched with CO2. After 180 days of treatment, morphological traits of seedling height, biomass of root and shoot and root-shoot allometric co-efficient were measured. The activity of carbonic anhydrase and contents of chlorophylls, total carbohydrates and soluble proteins were determined. In Tectona grandis, significant effects of CO2 supply were found on chlorophylls, root-shoot allometric ratio and seedling quality index. Ailanthus excelsa showed significant effect on only the shoot characteristics on exposure to elevated CO2 but the root characteristics and concentrations of chlorophylls were not significantly different. Casuarina equisetifolia also showed significant effects on exposure to elevated CO2 in terms of shoot characteristics and concentrations of chlorophylls. Total sugars, the major photosynthates, did not show any significant variation to elevated CO2 in any of the three species. Carbonic anhydrase, the key enzyme responsible for transfer of CO2 into the tissues significantly increased in all three species. Overall, all the variables responded to elevated CO2, reflecting the positive effects of one parameter of climate change conditions on seedling quality. A positive response of these three plantation species to elevated CO2 content is a good indication for their future existence in potentially changed climatic conditions.","[Warrier, Rekha R.; Buvaneswaran, C.; Priyadharshini, P.; Jayaraj, R.

We investigated the impact of inter- and intraspecific competition between European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) on fine root survivorship, root system size and plant productivity in a competition experiment with direct fine root growth observation. Ash and beech saplings were grown either in mixture, monoculture or in isolation (single plant) in rhizoboxes with a transparent observation window that allowed quantifying root growth as well as root longevity dependent on neighbour presence. Root survival was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier estimations. Standing root biomass and root productivity were quantified at a final harvest, allowing the calculation of competition indices and biomass partitioning in the plant. With competition indices indicating asymmetric competition in favour of ash, our experiment supports earlier findings on the competitive superiority of juvenile ash over beech plants. Mean root lifespan differed significantly among species (higher longevity of ash fine roots) and also in dependence of the competition treatment. The risk of fine root mortality increased when beech roots grew in mixture with ash or in beech monoculture as compared to beech plants growing in isolation. In contrast, ash fine roots had a lower mortality in mixture with beech than when grown in isolation. Our data indicate that ash fine roots apparently profit from the presence of beech roots while beech root growth and survival are negatively affected, indicating size-asymmetric belowground competition. Competition may represent an important force influencing the fine root lifespan of these tree species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Present forest tree species ranges will be altered by changing environmental conditions. By a combination of continuous and destructive sampling, we compared biomass stocks and annual NPP in naturally regenerated stands of Norway spruce and European beech. We purposely selected a site where future environmental conditions are predicted to favour beech over presently dominant spruce. We found no difference in overall productivity, but biomass allocation differed significantly between the two species. Beech allocated more assimilates to stem and roots than spruce. There was no significant difference between the species in NPP of the fast turnover biomass pool comprising foliage and fine roots. Maximum height growth occurred about a month earlier than in spruce, potentially changing the timing of carbon (C) flow into the soil pools. We show that the replacement of spruce by beech will result in changes in forest biomass allocation and in alterations of belowground C cycle. Such changes will affect forest ecosystem function by modifying the magnitude and timing of certain C fluxes, but also by potentially changing the species composition of forest biota dependent on them.

Ammonium nitrate had been applied annually for 42 years at average rates of 34 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to the N1 plots, and for two decades at 73 and 108 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N to N2 and N3 plots, respectively. Treatments N2 and N3 were terminated 19 and 17 years before the study, which enabled us to study the recovery from the previous high N load. Stem growth responded strongly to N additions and correlated to gross N mineralization and microbial community composition. Total stem volume measured in 2010 was 299, 483, 470, and 376 m(3) ha(-1), in NO (control), N1, N2, and N3 plots, respectively. In N-limited control plots with high soil C/N ratio and low soil and needle N concentrations, we observed lower gross N mineralization rate and lower recovery of non-immobilized tracer in the soil ammonium pool, which indicates a high microbial N immobilization capacity. Commonly, microbial biomarkers decline after N addition, which was also found here, whereas total abundance was highest in high N plots with thick mor-layer. Contrary to our expectation the fungi/bacteria ratio was not lower, because fungi and bacteria declined concurrently and to the same extent. As we expected, soils in N amended plots had higher relative amounts of gram-positive bacteria than in control plots. Termination of N additions caused a reduction in gross N mineralization and needle N. Lower N-15 abundance in needles compared with the mor-layer indicated a recovery of the function of ectomy-corrhizal symbiosis. We propose that the higher gross N mineralization rate in N-loaded forest is not caused by greater decomposition of organic matter, but a higher internal turnover of microbial N.

We conducted a snow removal experiment and took year-round continuous automated measurements of R-S, soil temperature (T-5) and soil volumetric water content at the 5 cm depth (W-5) with a half-hour interval in a Chinese temperate forest in 2010-2011. Our objectives were to: (1) develop statistical models to describe the seasonality of R-S in this forest; (2) quantify the contribution of seasonal R-S to the annual budget; (3) examine biophysical effects of snowpack on R-S; and (4) test the hypothesis that an FTC-induced enhancement of R-S is jointly driven by biological and physical processes. Empirical R-S-T-5-W-5 models explained 65.3-94.1% of the variability in the R-S data, but the number of the regression terms and their coefficients varied with season. This indicates that the model should be fitted to the seasonal data sets separately to explicitly describe the seasonality of R-S. The R-S during the winter, spring FTC period, and growing season contributed 5.7%, 3.5%, and 91.1%, respectively, to the total annual R-S. The relative enhancement of R-S due to snowpack and FTCs averaged 3.4 and 2.5, respectively. The snowpack-induced enhancement of R-S exponentially increased with T-5 (R-2 = 0.83) and snow depth (R-2 = 0.16), while the FTC-induced enhancement of R-S exponentially decreased with T-5 (R-2 = 0.45) and W-5 (R-2 = 0.67). These results suggest that the snowpack-induced enhancement mainly results from the snow-depth-dependent insulation of soil from low air temperatures, while the FTC-induced enhancement is dominantly driven by biological processes. Accumulatively, the snowpack and spring FTCs made a minor net contribution (2.3% and 1.2%, respectively) to the annual R-S budget. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Decision rules (DR) (e.g. functional balances and source-sink relationships) are widely used to model C allocation in forests. However, standard DR allocation schemes lack a strong environmental sensitivity and their ability to simulate the year-to-year variability and the impact of extreme events is questioned. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of a standard DR allocation scheme to the performance of an improved DR allocation scheme taking into account drought-induced changes in allocation dynamics and acclimation of respiration. Model validation was performed against extensive datasets of C fluxes and C pools for a 9 years period (2000-2008) for the site of parameterisation (the beech forest of Hesse, France) and for two contrasting sites not used for parameterisation (the beech forest of Soro, Denmark, for 1999-2006, and Collelongo, Italy, for 2005-2006). At Hesse, 2003 was characterised by a severe and extreme drought and heat wave. The standard DR allocation scheme captured the average annual dynamics of C allocation and wood growth at beech stands with contrasting climate and standing stock. However, the allocation model required high quality GPP input and errors (even modest) in GPP resulted in large errors in the growth of the tree organs lowest in the modelled sink hierarchy (woody organs). The ability of the standard DR allocation model to simulate year-to-year variability was limited. The amended DR allocation scheme improved the annual simulations and allowed capturing the stand growth dynamics at Hesse during the extreme 2003 summer and its important lag effect on next year's wood production. Modelling of drought-induced changes in fine root dynamics and of short-term thermal acclimation of maintenance respiration should not be overlooked when simulating the C cycle of forests, particularly for sites likely to experience extreme drought and heat waves. The most relevant model bias was the inaccurate estimation of leaf biomass production (up to 15%) and a poor description of its interannual variability. Future studies should focus primarily on this limitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The responses to drought in long-lived trees differ depending on the time scale considered, and short-term responses are currently better understood than longer term acclimation. We assessed the temporal changes in trees facing a chronic reduction in water availability by comparing leaf-scale physiological traits, branch-scale hydraulic traits, and stand-scale biomass partitioning in the evergreen Quercus ilex across a regional precipitation gradient (long-term changes) and in a partial throughfall exclusion experiment (TEE, medium term changes). At the leaf scale, gas exchange, mass per unit area and nitrogen concentration showed homeostatic responses to drought as they did not change among the sites of the precipitation gradient or in the experimental treatments of the TEE. A similar homeostatic response was observed for the xylem vulnerability to cavitation at the branch scale. In contrast, the ratio of leaf area over sapwood area (LA/SA) in young branches exhibited a transient response to drought because it decreased in response to the TEE the first 4years of treatment, but did not change among the sites of the gradient. At the stand scale, leaf area index (LAI) decreased, and the ratios of stem SA to LAI and of fine root area to LAI both increased in trees subjected to throughfall exclusion and from the wettest to the driest site of the gradient. Taken together, these results suggest that acclimation to chronic drought in long-lived Q. ilex is mediated by changes in hydraulic allometry that shift progressively from low (branch) to high (stand) organizational levels, and act to maintain the leaf water potential within the range of xylem hydraulic function and leaf photosynthetic assimilation.","[Martin-StPaul, Nicolas K.; Limousin, Jean-Marc; Vogt-Schilb, Helene; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Rambal, Serge; Longepierre, Damien; Misson, Laurent] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Martin-StPaul, NK (reprint author), CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France.",nico09.martin@gmail.com,"Rambal, Serge/H-5705-2019; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus/P-6716-2014","Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus/0000-0001-7408-7653; rambal, serge/0000-0001-5869-8382","Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME); French Research Agency (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-06-VULN-003-01]; 'Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion' of SpainMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN); European project CARBOEXTREME [EP7-ENV-2008-1, 226701]","This work is a tribute to Laurent Misson, who initiated this research in 2007.

The lack of lateral transfer of nitrogen-fixation genes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes has been partially attributed to the physiological requirements necessary for the function of the nitrogenase complex. However, symbiotic bacterial nitrogenase activity is protected by the nodule, a plant structure whose organogenesis can be trigged in the absence of bacteria. To explore the intrinsic potentiality of this plant organ, we generated rhizobium-independent nodules in alfalfa by overexpressing the MsDMI3 kinase lacking the autoinhibitory domain. These transgenic nodules showed similar levels of leghemoglobin, free oxygen, ATP, and NADPH to those of efficient Sinorhizobium meliloti B399-infected nodules, suggesting that the rhizobium-independent nodules can provide an optimal microenvironment for nitrogenase activity.

Soils collected from an old C. atlantica forest and pre-cultivated with each of the target plant species (L. dentata and T. satureoides). After 5 months of cultivation, they were uprooted and the treated substrate was amended or not with Khouribga Rock Phosphate (KRP). Then pots were filled with the soil mixtures and planted with one pre-germinated seed of C. atlantica. The results show that pre-cultivation step with native mycotrophic plant species improves the mycorrhizal soil infectivity, modifies soil microbial functionalities and increases the impact of rock phosphate amendment on the C. atlantica growth. This low cost cultivation practice by improving forest plant development and cultural soil quality constitutes a promising ecological engineering tool to improve the performances of ecosystem restoration.

Samp. by the black truffle fungus T. melanosporum Vittad. by quantitative and molecular analyses. Area of study: seedlings inoculated by different Spanish suppliers. Material and methods: The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of mycorrhizae from different plants were amplified by nested PCR involving fluorescently-labelled primers, and the amplicons either directly sized by ARISA or analysed by TRFLP following their digestion with restriction endonucleases. TRFLP analysis distinguished between mycorrhizae of T melanosporum, T. indicum Cooke & Massee and T. borchii Vittad., as suggested possible by virtual (in silico) TRFLP analysis and real TRFLP analysis of the ascomata of these species. Main results: Significant differences between suppliers were detected in terms of the mean number of mycorrhizae established per plant and percentage mycorrhization. These results allowed the following quality standards for 2 year-old plants to be proposed: a) good quality: >3,000 mycorrhizae/plant, >40% mycorrhization, b) medium (acceptable): >3,000 mycorrhizae/plant, >30% mycorrhization, c) low quality: <3,000 mycorrhizae/plant or <30% mycorrhization, always supposing the mycorrhizae counted represent the species of interest as confirmed by the presence of its DNA and the absence of DNA belonging to contaminating species. Finally, a new microsatellite allelic map obtained from the analysis of several T melanosporum populations across Spain was used to provide a tool capable of determining the geographic origin of the fungi used to inoculate plants. Research highlights: The proposed quality standards can be useful for the evaluation and certification of commercialized Q. ilex plants mycorrhized with T. melanosporum.","[Alvarado, P.; Manjon, J.

Here, we aimed to compare the respiration rates of roots subjected to different treatments (i.e., washing with water vs. brushing without water, and excising vs. not excising) for 17-month-old seedlings of Cryptomeria japonica. Immediately after sampling an entire root system, the root respiration rate was measured on a mass basis using a closed static chamber system equipped with an infrared gas analyzer. We found that the respiration rates for roots that were excised 10-20 times were significantly higher than those for roots that were not excised. There was no significant difference in the root respiration rates between washing and brushing treatments. Our results indicate that large numbers of excisions (> 10 times) could lead to bias in the measured changes in specific root respiration rates, and imply that differences between washing and brushing treatments do not affect the specific root respiration rate. We conclude that potential variation in recorded root respiration rates could be minimized by standardizing the root preparation technique, which should involve rapidly removing all loose soil and limiting the extent of root excision.","[Makita, Naoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Environm Sci & Technol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yaku, Ryoko; Ohashi, Mizue; Fukuda, Keisuke; Ikeno, Hidetoshi] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Makita, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Environm Sci & Technol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",macky@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014",, [DC1 22-2100],"The authors thank Mr. Toshifumi Kimura and members of the laboratory at University of Hyogo, who provided useful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

Nevertheless, species and provenances may differ in their ecological requirements. We hypothesised that (i) provenances from xeric sites are better adapted to drought than those from more humid sites, (ii) oaks direct root growth towards resource-rich layers, and (iii) air-warming promotes root growth. To test different provenances of Quercus robur, Q. petraea and Q. pubescens, we conducted a model ecosystem experiment with young trees, grown on acidic and calcareous soil, subjected to drought, air warming, the combination of warming and drought, and a control. The results were only in partial agreement with the first hypothesis. As expected the provenances originating from drier sites produced more biomass than those from more humid sites under drought conditions. Surprisingly, however, they reacted more sensitive to water limiting conditions, as they produced also substantially more biomass under well-watered conditions. The drought treatment reduced root mass substantially in the upper soil. In agreement with the second hypothesis this led to a shift in the centre of root mass to lower depth, where water was still more available than closer to the soil surface. In contrast to the third hypothesis, the air-warming treatment, which was very mild however compared to climate change scenarios, had no significant effects on root growth. Given that the provenances from drier sites showed more biomass loss at water limiting conditions than provenances from more humid sites, it remains questionable whether provenances from drier sites are better suited for a future climate.","[Kuster, Thomas M.; Arend, Matthias; Guenthardt-Goerg, Madeleine S.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Kuster, Thomas M.; Schulin, Rainer] ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst ITES, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kuster, TM (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",thomaskuster@gmx.ch,"Arend, Matthias/L-7795-2013; Gunthardt-Goerg, Madeleine/L-6461-2013",,Velux foundation [489],For funding we are gratefully indebted to the Velux foundation (project number: 489).,,42,26,30,2,114,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2013,369,2-Jan,,,,,61,71,,10.1007/s11104-012-1541-8,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,181BE,WOS:000321642200006,,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Yang, HS; Yu, ZX; Zhang, Q; Tang, JJ; Chen, X",,,,"Yang, Haishui; Yu, Zhenxing; Zhang, Qian; Tang, Jianjun; Chen, Xin",,,Plant neighbor effects mediated by rhizosphere factors along a simulated aridity gradient,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Plant-plant interaction; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Medicago sativa L. water availability; Belowground interaction,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; ROOT COMPETITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; FACILITATION; WATER; DIVERSITY; DETERMINES; GRASSLAND,"We investigated how rhizosphere factors (total rhizosphere, roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae [AMF], and soil solution) and water availability affect interactions between neighboring Medicago sativa plants. A three-compartment mesocosm was used to test the effects of rhizosphere factors on plant-plant interactions. A relative interaction index (RII) was calculated to indicate whether effects of neighbor plant on target plant were positive or negative (facilitative or competitive). Isotope tracers were used to test whether AMF hyphae mediated competition for nitrogen (N) between target and neighbor plants. The effects of rhizosphere factors on the interactions between neighboring M. sativa plants depended on water availability. The effects of total rhizosphere shifted RII from negative to positive as water availability increased. Interaction with the roots and rhizosphere soil solution of neighbor plants shifted RII from negative to positive as water availability increased but the opposite was true for AMF hyphae. AMF hyphae helped neighbor plants compete for N-15 when water was available but not when water was limiting. The effect of total rhizosphere on plant-plant interaction of M. sativa shifted from competitive to facilitative as water availability increased.

In addition, increased temperatures and summer drought lead to increased risk of forest fires as a result of climate change. This may have important consequences for C dynamics and balance in these ecosystems. Soil respiration was measured over 2 successive years in Holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota; Qi); Pyrenean Oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd; Qp); and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.; Ps) forest stands located in the area surrounding Madrid (Spain), to assess the long term effects of wildfires on C efflux from the soil, soil properties, and the role of soil temperature and soil moisture in the variation of soil respiration. Soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, fine root mass, microbial biomass, biological and chemical soil parameters were compared between non burned (NB) and burned sites (B). The annual C losses through soil respiration from NB sites in Qi, Qp and Ps were 790, 1010, 1380 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the B sites emitting 43 %, 22 % and 11 % less in Qi, Qp and Ps respectively. Soil microclimate changed with higher soil temperature and lower soil moisture in B sites after fire. Exchangeable cations and the pH also decreased. The total SOC stocks were not significantly altered, but 6-8 years after wildfires, there was still measurably lower fine root and microbial biomass, while SOC quality changed, indicated by lower the C/N ratio and the labile carbon and a relative increase in refractory SOC forms, which resulted in lower Q(10) values. We found long term effects of wildfires on the physical, chemical and biological soil characteristics, which in turn affected soil respiration. The response of soil respiration to temperature was controlled by moisture and changed with ecosystem type, season, and between B and NB sites. Lower post-burn Q(10) integrated the loss of roots and microbial biomass, change in SOC quality and a decrease in soil moisture.","[Uribe, C.; Inclan, R.; Fernandez, A.

Roots modify the pH of their surrounding soil causing the soil pH to vary as a function of distance from root surface, location along root axes, and root maturity. Non-invasive imaging techniques provide the possibility to capture pH patterns around the roots as they develop. We developed a novel fluorescence imaging set up and applied to the root system of two lupin (Lupinus albus L., Lupinus angustifolius L.) and one soft-rush (Juncus effusus L.) species. We grew plants in glass containers filled with soil and equipped with fluorescence sensor foils on the container side walls. We gained highly-resolved data on the spatial distribution of H+ around the roots by taking time-lapse images of the samples over the course of several days. We showed how the soil pH in the vicinity of roots developed over time to different values from that of the original bulk soil. The soil pH in the immediate vicinity of the root surface varied greatly along the root length, with the most acidic point being at 0.56-3.36 mm behind the root tip. Indications were also found for temporal soil pH changes due to root maturity. In conclusion, this study shows that this novel optical fluorescence imaging set up is a powerful tool for studying pH developments around roots in situ.","[Rudolph, Nicole; Voss, Sebastian; Oswald, Sascha E.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Moradi, Ahmad B.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Nagl, Stefan] Univ Leipzig, Inst Analyt Chem, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Rudolph, N (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",nrudolph@uni-potsdam.de,"Nagl, Stefan/I-3362-2012; Oswald, Sascha E/C-1441-2008; Moradi, Ahmad/B-8910-2009","Nagl, Stefan/0000-0001-5512-1174; Oswald, Sascha E/0000-0003-1667-0060; ","German DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1315, OS 351/1-2]","We acknowledge funding from the German DFG priority program 1315 ""Biogeochemical interfaces in soil"", under contract OS 351/1-2.

Enzymatic activities of ectomycorrhizal root tips are therefore result of the contribution from different partners of the symbiotic organ. However, the functional potential of the fungus-associated bacterial communities remains unknown. In this study, a collection of 80 bacterial strains randomly selected and isolated from a soil-ectomycorrhiza continuum (oak-Scleroderma citrinum ectomycorrhizas, the ectomycorrhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil) were characterized. All the bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequences as members of the genera Burkholderia, Collimonas, Dyella, Mesorhizobium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium and Sphingomonas. The bacterial strains were then assayed for beta-xylosidase, beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-hexosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, cellobiohydrolase, phosphomonoesterase, leucine-aminopeptidase and laccase activities, chitin solubilization and auxin production. Using these bioassays, we demonstrated significant differences in the functional distribution of the bacterial communities living in the different compartments of the soil-ectomycorrhiza continuum. The surrounding bulk soil was significantly enriched in bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing cellobiose and N-acetylglucosamine. In contrast, the ectomycorrhizosphere appeared significantly enriched in bacterial isolates capable of hydrolysing glucopyranoside and chitin. Notably, chitinase and laccase activities were found only in bacterial isolates belonging to the Collimonas and Pseudomonas genera. Overall, the results suggest that the ectomycorrhizal fungi favour specific bacterial communities with contrasting functional characteristics from the surrounding soil.","[Uroz, S.; Courty, P.

Replicated plots received organic fertilizer (OF), chemical fertilizer (CF), and no fertilizer (NF), and microbial communities were analyzed in the early season, mid-season and harvesting stages. The electrical conductivity of the CF soil at mid-season was significantly higher than that of the OF and NF soils (P <0.05), whereas the NO3-N content at the harvesting stage was significantly lower in the CF soil than in the OF soil (P <0.05). The average microbial biomasses in the OF soils during the Chinese cabbage growing period were approximately 1.03 similar to 1.27 times higher for fungi, Gramnegative bacteria, total bacteria, total FAMEs, Gram-positive bacteria, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Organic fertilizer had a significantly lower ratio of cy19:0 to 18:16)7c then CF (P <0.001), which indicates that a decrease in microbial stress was caused by organic matter soil inputs and the lack of chemical amendments. Communities of fungi in OF soils were significantly larger than those in CF soils (P <0.001) indicating fungi are potentially responsible for the microbial community differentiation between the OF and CF treatments in an upland field. However, the average microbial communities in the OF soils were approximately 0.86 times lower for actinomycetes and 0.95 times lower for AMF. In communities of total bacteria (P <0.001), Gram-negative (P <0.001) and Gram-positive bacteria (P <0.01), the interaction between the growth stage and the fertilizer showed significant differentiation.

Engineering structures are commonly well defined, immediately usable and operative, and their stability effects quantifiable. Differently, the use of plants requires more restrictive boundary conditions and the protection potential is rarely easily calculable and is developing as a function of growth time. Soil aggregation processes play a crucial role in re-establishing soil structure and function and, conclusively, for successful and sustainable re-colonisation. Mycorrhizal fungi are key-players that foster the development of a protective vegetation cover. They accelerate and increase plant growth and, additionally, contribute to soil aggregate stability which, on its part, was recently proposed as an appropriate indicator with regard to the quantification of biological effects on soil and slope stability. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the host's root system as well as on soil aggregate stability. Furthermore, the biological contribution to soil aggregate stability was compared to mechanical stabilisation effects due to soil compaction. The site-specific plant-fungus symbiosis Alnus incana and Melanogaster variegatus s.l. of a recently stabilised steep catchment on moraine was used for laboratory experiments. Aggregate stability tests were performed with samples of differently treated moraine, including soil at low (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) and high (similar to 19.0 kN m(-3)) dry unit weight, soil planted with A. incana (White Alder) as well as the combination of planting with alder and inoculating with the mycorrhizal fungus M. variegatus s.l. After a 20 week growth period in a greenhouse, a total of 100 samples was tested and evaluated. Positive correlations were found between the soil aggregate stability and the three variables dry unit weight, root length per soil volume, and degree of mycorrhization. Based on robust statistics it turned out that over all samples dry unit weight and degree of mycorrhization were strongest correlated with soil aggregate stability. Simple linear regression models revealed a significant positive effect of root length per soil volume on soil aggregate stability. Compared to the non-inoculated control plants, mycorrhized White Alder produced significantly more roots and, consequently, higher soil aggregate stability. Furthermore, the combined biological effect of plant roots and mycorrhizal mycelia on aggregate stability in soil with low density (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) was comparable to the compaction effect of the pure soil from 15.5 to similar to 19.0 kN m(-3). Literature data on the effect of vegetation on the angle of internal friction Phi' of the same moraine showed similar correlations, i.e. that Phi'of low density soil material (similar to 15.5 kN m(-3)) increased by the same amount whether by planting with White Alder or by compaction to similar to 19.0 kN m(-3). Based on this coincidence and from a soil mechanical perspective, soil aggregate stability is suitable to estimate the joint effect of plants and mycorrhizal fungi with respect to their contribution to soil and slope stability in the near-surface layer.

We examined the influence of common boreal tree species (trembling aspen, black spruce, and jack pine), either in pure stands or in conifer-broadleaf mixtures, on the amount, distribution, and quality of SOC in two regions of the Canadian boreal biome. Long-term laboratory incubations were used to assess SOC quality by quantifying proportions of fast carbon (C) (that is, proportion of total C released during the first 100 days of incubation) and active C (that is, modeled proportion of total C that can be potentially released). Total amounts of SOC did not differ between stand types, but the effects of stand type on SOC stocks and quality differed with soil depth. Among stand types, aspen stands had the greatest relative proportion of total SOC in deeper mineral layers and the lowest amount of active C in the organic layer. For these reasons, the SOC stock that developed under aspen was more stable than in the other stand types. Although black spruce stands allowed a greater accumulation of SOC in surface layers, these stocks, however, might become more vulnerable to extra losses if environmental conditions are to become more favorable to decomposition in the future. Our work highlights that boreal forest composition influences the stability of SOC stocks and how climate change could alter this large C pool.","[Laganiere, Jerome; Pare, David] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Laganiere, Jerome; Bergeron, Yves; Cavard, Xavier] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Laganiere, Jerome; Bergeron, Yves; Cavard, Xavier] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, NSERC UQAT UQAM Ind Chair Sustainable Forest Mana, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 4E5, Canada; [Chen, Han Y.

Soil and fine roots were collected from the rhizosphere of severely declining or recently dead specimens of 13 woody species at 11 dieback sites and two dieback spots and from healthy specimens of five woody species at four dieback-free sites in native forests, woodlands and heathlands of the south-west of Western Australia (WA). Phytophthora cinnamomi was recovered from 80.4, 78.1 and 100% of tested soil, fine root and soil-debris slurry samples at the 11 dieback sites, in some cases even after 18-month storage under air-dry conditions, but not from the small dieback spots and the healthy sites. Direct isolations from soil-debris slurry showed that P.cinnamomi colonies exclusively originated from fine roots and root fragments not from free propagules in the soil. Microscopic investigation of P.cinnamomi-infected fine and small woody roots and root fragments demonstrated in 68.8, 81.3 and 93.8% of samples from nine woody species the presence of thick-walled oospores, stromata-like hyphal aggregations and intracellular hyphae encased by lignitubers, respectively, while thin-walled putative chlamydospores were found in only 21.2% of samples from five woody species. These findings were confirmed by microscopic examination of fine roots from artificially inoculated young trees of 10 woody species. It is suggested that (i) the main function of chlamydospores is the survival in moderately dry conditions between consecutive rain events and (ii) selfed oospores, hyphal aggregations, and encased hyphae and vesicles in infected root tissue of both host and non-host species are the major long-term survival propagules of P.cinnamomi during the extremely dry summer conditions in WA.","[Jung, T.; Hardy, G.

In this study, we investigated the impacts of different RECs including organic acids, amino acids, and fructose on the availability of pyrene as a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in soils. Citric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, serine, alanine, and fructose were used in the experiments as representative RECs. Pyrene-spiked soils (TypicPaleudalfs) with present RECs were incubated for 30 days, and the available fraction of pyrene was determined using n-butanol extraction procedure. The amount of n-butanol-extractable pyrene in soil increased with the addition of tested RECs and increased when REC concentrations are enhanced within the range of 0-21 g kg(-1). The extractability of pyrene in soil with REC treatments and the enhancement ratio (r, %) of the extractable pyrene in soil by the addition of RECs after a 30-day incubation decreased in the following order: organic acids (oxalic acid a parts per thousand yen citric acid > malic acid) > amino acid (alanine > serine) > fructose. This decrease was observed irrespective of soil sterilization, although the concentrations of extractable pyrene were lower in non-sterilized soils compared to sterilized soils. The concentrations of metal cations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in solution increased when organic acids were added. The tested RECs at concentrations of 0-21 g kg(-1) clearly enhanced the availability of pyrene in soils, and larger amounts of RECs resulted in higher pyrene availabilities in the tested soils. Microbial biodegradation diminished the amount of available pyrene irrespective of the presence of RECs. The mechanism of REC-influenced availability of pyrene in soil may be related to the metal dissolution and release of DOM from soil solids. The results of this study will be useful in assessing PAH-related risks to human health and the environment and will be instructive in food safety and remediation strategies at contaminated sites.","[Sun, Bingqing; Ling, Wanting; Wang, Yize] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resource & Environm Sci, Inst Organ Contaminant Control & Soil Remediat, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Ling, WT (reprint author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resource & Environm Sci, Inst Organ Contaminant Control & Soil Remediat, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lingwanting@njau.edu.cn,,"LING, Wanting/0000-0002-2376-7760","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [21077056, 51278252, 41171380, 41171193]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYZ201109]; Key Technology R&D Program of Jiangsu Province [BE2011780]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21077056, 51278252, 41171380, and 41171193), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (KYZ201109), and the Key Technology R&D Program of Jiangsu Province (BE2011780).",,50,21,22,2,92,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

It has been suggested that both above- and below-ground competition and their interplay vary along gradients, but few studies have investigated this idea, and in most cases, the role of facilitation has not been considered, despite its importance in high stress environments. Here we used two-layer zone-of-influence' models to simulate the effects of facilitation, size-asymmetry of competition, abiotic stress, resource availability and the balance of root-shoot growth on shoot and root interactions and their interplay along an environmental gradient. In the absence of facilitation, shoot and total competition became weaker, while root competition and the interplay between shoot and root competition were unchanged under increasing stress when root competition was completely symmetric. In contrast, shoot, root, total interactions and the interplay between shoot and root interactions were all negative, and they increased with increasing stress when root competition was size-symmetric. When facilitation was included in the models, net effects of shoot, root, total interactions and the interplay of root-shoot interactions were very different from those without facilitation, and many were positive under highly stressful conditions. The type of stress (non-resource or resource) did not significantly influence the simulation results. Our study provides an alternative interpretation of the interplay between above- and below-ground plant-plant interactions across an environmental gradient.","[Zhang, Wei-Ping; Pan, Sha; Wang, Gen-Xuan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, CN-310058 Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, CN-100083 Beijing, Peoples R China; [Damgaard, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Morris, E.

We investigated B. tuberum STM678(T)'s ability to induce Fix(+) nodules on a small-seeded, easy-to-propagate legume (Macroptilium atropurpureum). Previous studies demonstrated that B. tuberum elicited either Fix(-) or Fix(+) nodules on siratro, but the reasons for this difference were unexplored. Experiments to promote effective siratro nodule formation under different environmental conditions were performed. B. tuberum STM678(T)'s ability to withstand high temperatures and desiccation was checked as well as its potential for promoting plant growth via mechanisms in addition to nitrogen fixation, e.g., phosphate solubilization and siderophore production. Potential genes for these activities were found in the sequenced genomes. Higher temperatures and reduced watering resulted in reliable, effective nodulation on siratro. Burkholderia spp. solubilize phosphate and produce siderophores. Genes encoding proteins potentially involved in these growth-promoting activities were detected and are described. Siratro is an excellent model plant for B. tuberum STM678(T). We identified genes that might be involved in the ability of diazotrophic Burkholderia species to survive harsh conditions, solubilize phosphate, and produce siderophores.","[Angus, Annette A.; Shehayeb, Maya; Hessabi, Reza; Fujishige, Nancy A.; Kano, Stephanie; Song, Nannie; Yang, Paul; Hirsch, Ann M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Mol Cell & Dev Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lee, Andrew] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hirsch, Ann M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Mol Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lum, Michelle R.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA; [Yerrapragada, Shailaja] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Estrada de los Santos, Paulina] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [de Faria, Sergio M.] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Dakora, Felix D.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Chem, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Weinstock, George] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hirsch, Ann M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Hirsch, AM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ahirsch@ucla.edu,"de Faria, Sergio Miana/C-1405-2013; Hirsch, Ann M/D-3562-2009; Estrada de los Santos, Paulina/S-1238-2018; Weinstock, George/C-6314-2013","Estrada de los Santos, Paulina/0000-0003-2407-0284; Dakora, Felix/0000-0002-9070-6896; Weinstock, George/0000-0002-2997-4592",National Science Foundation (USA)National Science Foundation (NSF) [IOB-0537497]; Shanbrom Family Foundation; University of California Office of The PresidentUniversity of California System,"This research was supported in part by a grant (IOB-0537497) from the National Science Foundation (USA) to GW and AMH and a Shanbrom Family Foundation grant to AMH.

Arid and semi-arid ecosystems experience extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions, both of which favor growth and survival of some fungi, but the extent of fungal nitrification and denitrification in these soils has not been explored. We investigated the role of fungi in nitrate (NO(3) over bar) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production in soils from regions across the southwestern US. Soils were collected from urban and Sonoran Desert sites within the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona, and from grasslands in Arizona and New Mexico. Rates of potential nitrification were measured in soils subjected to biocide treatments (fungal and bacterial inhibitors) and acetylene, an inhibitor of autotrophic ammonia oxidation. Nitrous oxide production was measured from soils incubated at two moisture levels in the presence of the biocide treatments. Rates of potential nitrification decreased significantly in all soils with additions of acetylene, indicating that autotrophic microorganisms may dominate ammonia oxidation and NOT production rather than heterotrophs (e.g., fungi). Similarly, fungi played a minor role in N2O production in urban turfgrass soils that were highly managed with irrigation and fertilizers. In contrast, fungi were major sources of N2O production in desert and semi-arid grassland soils across a range of soil water content. We conclude that fungi are likely responsible for denitrification in aridland soils, and that land-use changes associated with urbanization alter the biotic pathways responsible for N cycling.

Leaves, twigs, trunk and roots were sampled, and total non-structural nitrogen compounds (TNNC) and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) were quantified. TNC concentrations decreased more than 50 % between February and May, especially in the above-ground parts. During the same period, TNNC concentrations drastically decreased especially in twigs (more than 55 % below the winter baseline). This indicates high sink strength of new organs at bud break. TNC concentrations increased in summer in all tree compartments highlighting the TNC storage. TNNC deposition for storage constitution began in autumn during leaf senescence. The first organs acting as a N store were coarse roots followed by twigs; whereas all oak tree compartments were potential C store organs except phloem tissue. Arginine and asparagine were the two prevailing amino acids involved in both storage and transport. Besides identifying the compounds involved in the storage and transportation of N, our results highlight that oak seasonal cycles of C and N are not in phase: after intensive use of C and N stores in spring, the replenishment of N stores lags behind that of C stores.","[Bazot, S.; Barthes, L.; Fresneau, C.] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Equipe Ecophysiol Vegetale,UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Blanot, D.] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Inst Biochim & Biophys Mole & Cellulaire, Equipe Enveloppes Bacteriennes & Antibiot,UMR 861, F-91405 Orsay, France","Bazot, S (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Equipe Ecophysiol Vegetale,UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France.",stephane.bazot@u-psud.fr,,,"CNRS through the EC2CO project ""Linking models and data to evaluate nitrogen feedbacks on potential future carbon sequestration at local, regional and global scales""","Financial support was provided by CNRS through the EC2CO project ""Linking models and data to evaluate nitrogen feedbacks on potential future carbon sequestration at local, regional and global scales"".

In order to investigate to what degree living trees influence the abundance and activity of mycorrhizal fungi, saprotrophic fungi, and bacteria we used a geostatistical approach to examine natural abundance stable-isotope-ratios of soil microbial PLFAs, respired CO2, and different soil organic C pools in a 100 point grid extending from an area of retention trees into a clear-cut area. Labile C from trees was the major source of C for the fungal communities and influenced the composition of the microbial community and soil respiration rates up to ten meters into the clear-cut. When the input of labile plant C decreased, it appeared that microorganisms became increasingly dependent on recycled C released during microbial turnover, resulting in a decrease in soil respiration. Our findings demonstrate that plants not only influence the structure and function of soil microbial communities but also act as important regulators of belowground C flux, soil C sequestration and, ultimately, soil C stocks.

In a mature deciduous forest dominated by beech we identified clusters of one, two and three tree species of beech, ash and lime allowing to investigate the role of tree species diversity and identity on the density and community structure of oribatid mites. To relate oribatid mite community structure to environmental factors we measured leaf litter input, fine root biomass, mass of organic layers, topsoil pH and C and N content. We expected oribatid mite density to increase with increasing tree diversity, but we expected the effects of tree species identity to override effects of tree diversity. Further, we hypothesized the density of oribatid mites to be reduced by the presence of beech but increased by the presence of lime and ash. As expected tree diversity little affected oribatid mite communities, whereas tree species identity strongly altered density and community structure of oribatid mites. However, in contrast to our expectations the density of oribatid mites was highest in presence of beech indicating that many oribatid mite species benefit from the presence of recalcitrant litter forming thick organic layers. Especially Oppioidea benefited from the presence of beech presumably due to an increased availability of food resources such as fungi and nematodes. Lower density of oribatid mites in monospecific clusters of lime and ash suggests that oribatid mites did not benefit from high quality litter of these species. Notably, large and strongly sclerotized oribatid mite species, such as Steganacarus magnus and Chamobates voigtsi, benefited from the presence of ash and lime. Presumably, these large species better resist harsh microclimatic conditions in shallow organic layers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three plantations of monoculture and mixed Pinus massoniana and Castanopsis hystrix were selected to examine soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and temporal and spatial patterns of the main greenhouse gases fluxes for understanding the effects of mixed forests on soil carbon and nitrogen (N) cycling processes. We found that SOC stock in 0-20 cm layer in the mixed plantation was 14.3% higher than that in the P. massoniana, and 8.1% higher than that in the C. hystrix plantations. Differences in SOC stock among the plantations were attributed to soil N stock and leaf litterfall input. Soil CO2 and N2O fluxes in the mixed plantation displayed the seasonal trends, while soil CH4 flux did not show the seasonal trend. The seasonal variations in soil CO2 and N2O emissions were positively related to soil temperature and moisture. Mean soil CO2 and N2O emissions (53.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and 5.21 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), respectively) were significantly higher in the mixed plantation than in the P. massoniana plantation, while they were lower than in the C. hystrix plantation. Mean soil CH4 uptake (38.4 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) was significantly higher in the mixed plantation than in the C. hystrix plantation, while it is similar to that in the P. massoniana plantation. Variations in soil CO2 flux among the plantations were influenced by fine root biomass, leaf litterfall mass, soil N stock and soil C:N ratio. Differences in soil N2O flux among the plantations could be attributed to the differences in soil N stock, soil NO3--N content and soil C:N ratio. Soil respiration rate and soil NO3--N content could account for variations in soil CH4 flux among the plantations. This study confirms that the mixed plantation has a higher SOC stock than the monoculture plantations, and there is an increase in amount of GHG absorbed by the soil of mixed plantations compared to C. hystrix plantations. Therefore, a mixture of C. hystrix versus P. massoniana, could be a better silvicultural approach for SOC sequestration than monoculture C. hystrix plantation for substituting P. massoniana plantations in subtropical China.

C dynamics during litter decomposition provide an insight into C flow in soils. To quantitatively assess how decomposition processes vary with litter types, the solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning (CPMAS-NMR) technique was applied to analyze the organic C dynamics of conifer (Pinus massoniana) and broadleaf (Castanopsis hystrix, Michelia macclurei and Mytilaria laosensis) leaf litter and fine roots which had degraded during one year litterbag experiment in four subtropical plantations of China. The results were used to estimate decomposition rates of different C types and compositional changes of leaf litter and fine roots during decomposition. The mass loss rates of different C fractions during decomposition varied significantly between litter types. Site environment and initial litter quality played more critical roles in regulating decomposition of fine roots than of leaf litter. The significant changes in the proportion of C forms and degree of humification occurred during leaf litter decomposition, but not during fine roots decomposition. The proportions of alkyl C and carbonyl C and alkyl/O-alkyl C ratio varied with leaf litter types, with an increase for the proportion of alkyl C and alkyl/O-alkyl C ratio in broadleaf leaf litters and an enhanced trend for the proportion of carbonyl C for P. massoniana. The results suggest that the patterns and main controlling factors of litter C compositional change during decomposition differed between above- and belowground, and the dynamics of leaf litter C fractions during decomposition differed between conifer and broadleaf species. The findings of litter C compositional decomposition of the main tree species in this study could contribute to the accurate estimation of soil C sequestration in subtropical plantation ecosystems.

We investigated changes of C stocks in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantations converted from a natural broadleaved forest, based on a typical chronosequence in mountainland of subtropical China, which includes six first-generation Chinese fir stands at different development stages: 2- (recently regenerated), 7- (sapling), 16- (middle-aged), 21- (pre-mature), 40- (mature), and 88-year-old (over-mature), with a natural evergreen broadleaved forest (NF) as a comparison. The tree biomass C pool increased linearly from 2 to 40 years old, with no further significant increase from 40 to 88 years old. Compared with that in the NF forest, the mineral soil organic C (SOC) pool in Chinese fir plantation was decreased by 38.9% to a minimum at 16 years old. The soils reaccumulated C only between 16 and 21 years old, and then became neutral to C till to the over-mature stage, attaining an equilibrium SOC pool 30% lower than the pre-harvest level. The contribution of subsoil (below 20 cm depth) to total profile SOC loss ranged from 53.2% in the recently regenerated stand to 81.1% in the 16-year-old stand, emphasizing the importance of subsoil for the SOC balance. Both litterfall and fine-root biomass of Chinese fir trees exhibited a decreasing trend during late stand development, while the stand fine-root biomass remained relatively constant due to an increased contribution from understory vegetations. The stagnancy in stand fine-root biomass during late stand development might prevent the accruement of total profile SOC. However, the reduction of tree roots and the increase of understory roots did change the vertical distribution of soil C at the over-mature stage: the surface 0-20 cm soils accumulated C while the 20-40 cm soils lose C. It is concluded that over-mature tree plantations had a limited role in continuously sequestering C as old-growth unmanaged forests did, and that the SOC pools of tree plantations can be hardly recovered to those of natural forests due to a large initial loss and a low late gain in SOC following tree plantation establishment.

All species were mycotrophic in both periods with a high percentage of colonization rates, between 66 and 100% in rainy period and between 84 and 100% in dry period. Vesicles, arbuscules, spores, hyphal and arbuscular coils of arbuscular mycorrhizae were observed. Paris -type and Arum -type morphologies (both) were observed indistinctly in all the species, and Intermediate type was observed only in Aster grisebachii and Erigeron bellidiastroides, which could be a hint that these species are colonized by more than one fungal species, and therefore enhancing the relevance of fungal identity as a considerable character in the morphology association. Also, septate hyphae and microsclerotium of dark septate endophytes were identifyed inside the roots of all the species.","[Milagros Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Raquel; Herrera, Pedro; Furrazola, Eduardo] Inst Ecol & Sistemat, Havana 11900, Cuba","Rodriguez-Rodriguez, RM (reprint author), Inst Ecol & Sistemat, Carretera Varona Km 3 1-2, Havana 11900, Cuba.",ode@ecologia.cu,,,net AMFOODS,"The authors thank Lazaro Hernandez (conservation's worker) of RFM San Ubaldo-Sabanalamar.

Also evaluated the relationship between the spatial distribution of spore densities and biovolume of AMF and soil properties. Spatial dependence of spore densities and biovolume of AMF were exhibited further by kriged maps. The results showed spore density and biovolume indicated strong spatial autocorrelation and a patchy distribution within both sites. However, the patch size of genera and biovolume of AMF differed between the two communities. The correlation between distribution of spore and biovolume of AMF and distribution of soil parameters was expressed by Spearman rank-correlations coefficients. These results suggest that spore or biovolume distribution of AMF was affected significantly by some soil properties.","[Shi, Z. Y.; Liu, D. H.; Wang, F.

We tested the flooding and drought tolerance of two plant species with different occurrences along a soil water gradient by assessing seed germination, seedling survival, seedling growth, and root characteristics. In the high Sino-Himalayas, Rheum alexandrae typically occurs in wetlands, R. nobile in scree or open slope with well-drained soils. Seeds and seedlings of the two species were subjected to different soil water conditions in controlled greenhouse experiments. Seed germination in both species was inhibited by high soil water content; however, seeds of R. alexandrae were more tolerant to flooding, especially to submergence. Seedling survival, biomass accumulation, root diameter, and root porosity of R. alexandrae increased significantly with increased soil water content, but submergence was lethal for seedlings. Seedling survival, biomass accumulation, and root length of R. nobile increased significantly in response to reduced soil water content. These results indicate that in the two species, seed germination and seedling establishment in response to different soil water condition are habitat-specific. Because both species are susceptible to moderate changes in soil water condition, their species-specific requirements with respect to this factor should be a consideration when planning their conservation.","[Song, Bo; Zhang, Zhi-Qiang; Yang, Yang; Sun, Hang] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Biodivers & Biogeog, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Song, Bo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Stoecklin, Juerg] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Gao, Yong-Qian] Yunnan Forestry Technol Coll, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhi-Ming] Yunnan Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Kunming 650092, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Sun, H (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Biodivers & Biogeog, Kunming Inst Bot, 132 Lanhei Rd, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",hsun@mail.kib.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB03030112]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40930209, 31061160184, 31100179, 31200184]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of ScienceChinese Academy of Sciences [2011312D11022]; Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2011FB102]; Western Light Talent Culture Project","We are grateful to Prof. Xiang-Yang Hu and Yun-Gang Guo for providing the experimental facilities.

Soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass, and microbial community composition were measured in 2006 and 2008. A larger ratio of fungi/bacteria was observed in the upper slope than in the lower slope. Interannual climate fluctuation could have modified the effects of topography on microbial biomass and composition. Burning effects on microbial biomass and composition also depended on year, which could be attributed to low fire severity resulting from decreasing fuel load over time or microbial resilience. Nitrogen addition exerted a much stronger influence on microbial biomass in 2008 compared with 2006 and reshaped microbial communities through decreasing the relative proportion of fungal groups [arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nonmycorrhizal fungi] in 2008.

However, there is evidence that the associations are highly specific. Hence, we aimed to determine the specificity of plant-microbe relationships amongst co-occurring grass species in a temperate grassland. Methods and results We examined the broad microbial groups of bacteria and fungi as well as a specific fungal group, the arbuscular mycorrhizal community amongst two dominant C-3 and C-4 species and one subdominant C-3 species using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. We found that the two dominant species were more similar to each other in their bacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal community composition than either was to the sub-dominant species, but not in their fungal community composition. We also found no clear evidence that those differences were directly linked to soil chemical properties. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that co-occurring grass species have a distinct soil microbial community and T-RFLP analysis is able to detect plant species effect on the microbial community composition on an extremely local scale, providing an insight into the differences in the response of bacterial, fungal and arbuscular mycorrhizal communities to different, but similar and co-occurring, plant species.","[Osanai, Yui; Hovenden, Mark J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Bougoure, Damian S.; Hayden, Helen L.] Victorian AgriBiosci Ctr, Dept Primary Ind, Biosci Res Div, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia","Osanai, Y (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Locked Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",yosanai@utas.edu.au,"Hovenden, Mark/A-1323-2008","Hovenden, Mark/0000-0001-7208-9700; Hayden, Helen L./0000-0002-5443-538X; Osanai, Yui/0000-0001-6390-5382",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,Dr Mandeep Kaur provided useful feedback on a draft of this manuscript.

Therefore, they are expected to play an important role in reducing soil erosion by wind. However, direct evidence for this is lacking, because it is hardly possible to separate the mycorrhizal effect from all other factors that influence wind erosion in natural environments. Here, we present laboratory wind tunnel experiments, which indicate that mycorrhizal fungi have the potential to substantially increase the protective effect of newly seeded plants against wind erosion. For root balls of two plant species (Lolium perenne and Anthyllis vulneraria ssp. alpestris), we found that the wind-induced soil loss decreased significantly with increasing percentage of root colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi. The mean soil loss of non-mycorrhizal control samples was more than twice as high as the one of mycorrhizal samples for A.vulneraria, whereas no significant difference was observed for L.perenne. These results are all the more remarkable because there was no mycorrhiza-induced plant growth enhancement. On the contrary, mycorrhizal plants had significantly smaller root systems than non-mycorrhizal plants in both species. Above-ground biomass was significantly smaller in mycorrhizal plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants for L.perenne but only slightly smaller for A.vulneraria. This study demonstrates that mycorrhizal fungi are able to help newly seeded plants to decrease the wind erodibility of soil, even in cases when they do not increase plant growth.

Location The native range of A. pycnantha in Australia and invasive ranges in South Africa and Western Australia. Methods Bacteria were isolated from root nodules collected from 18 populations of A. pycnantha. Repetitive element polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) fingerprinting was used to assess overall bacterial diversity and clustering. Molecular phylogenies for a subset of isolates representing major REP-PCR clades were reconstructed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS), 16S rRNA, and the symbiotic nodA genes. Results Twelve clusters were identified from the REP-PCR analysis; 11 included isolates from both the native range in Australia and invasive range in South Africa, while one cluster comprised only Australian isolates. Six rhizobial species were found in association with A. pycnantha: Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium gallicum, R. lusitanum, R. miluonense, R. multihospitium and R. tropici. We also identified three plant-growth promoting bacteria isolated from root nodules of A. pycnantha: Burkholderia caledonica, B. graminis and B. phytofirmans. Phylogenetic analysis of the IGS gene retrieved clades containing symbionts from both Australia and South Africa while others comprised only South African taxa, suggesting the introduction of bacterial lineages from Australia to South Africa. Our phylogeographic analysis of the nodA gene confirmed that A. pycnantha was co-introduced with its symbionts to South Africa. Main conclusions Acacia pycnantha is a promiscuous legume, associated with at least six different rhizobial symbionts, and forms associations with plant-growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria from the genus Burkholderia. In the invasive range of A. pycnantha in South Africa, nodules contained some symbionts of South African origin while other symbionts appear to have been co-introduced from Australia. Acacia pycnantha is associated with a wider suite of symbionts in its invasive than native range.","[Ndlovu, Joice; Richardson, David M.; Wilson, John R.

We examined the effects of soil fungi, disturbance and propagule pressure on seed germination, seedling recruitment and adult plant establishment of the invasive Centaurea stoebe in its native European and non-native North American ranges. Centaurea stoebe can establish virtual monocultures in parts of its non-native range, but occurs at far lower abundances where it is native. We conducted parallel experiments at four European and four Montana (USA) grassland sites with all factorial combinations of +/- suppression of soil fungi, +/- disturbance and low versus high knapweed propagule pressure [100 or 300 knapweed seeds per 0.3mx0.3m plot (1000 or 3000per m2)]. We also measured germination in buried bags containing locally collected knapweed seeds that were either treated or not with fungicide. Disturbance and propagule pressure increased knapweed recruitment and establishment, but did so similarly in both ranges. Treating plots with fungicides had no effect on recruitment or establishment in either range. However, we found: (i) greater seedling recruitment and plant establishment in undisturbed plots in Montana compared to undisturbed plots in Europe and (ii) substantially greater germination of seeds in bags buried in Montana compared to Europe. Also, across all treatments, total plant establishment was greater in Montana than in Europe. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of simultaneously examining processes that could influence invasion in both ranges. They indicate that under background' undisturbed conditions, knapweed recruits and establishes at greater abundance in Montana than in Europe. However, our results do not support the importance of soil fungi or local disturbances as mechanisms for knapweed's differential success in North America versus Europe.","[Maron, John L.; Waller, Lauren P.; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hahn, Min A.; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz] Univ Fribourg, Unit Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Diaconu, Alecu] NIRDSB, Ecol & Biol Control Dept, Branch Inst Biol Res, Iasi 700305, Romania; [Pal, Robert W.] Univ Pecs, Fac Sci, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Maron, JL (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,"DIACONU, Alecu/A-9299-2011; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz/H-5277-2011",,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0614406]; International Programs at The University of Montana; Swiss National Science Foundation (through the National Centre of Competence in Research 'Plant Survival'); Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_125314/1]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [300639],"We thank Yvette Ortega for insightful comments on the manuscript.

Carbon (C) was applied as (CO2)-C-13 to plants and nitrogen (N) was added as (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 to the soil. We hypothesized that C will be transferred from plants to the rhizosphere, subsequently in beech to ectomycorrhiza (EM), in ash to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and finally to soil animals. We expected the C signal to be more effectively transferred to soil animals in EM as compared to AM systems since EM forms more extensive extramatrical mycelia as compared to AM. For N-15 we hypothesized that it will be taken up by both saprotrophic microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi and then channeled to-soil animals. After five month, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of soil animals, EM and fine roots of beech and ash were measured. Litter and soil were hardly enriched in N-15 whereas fine roots of beech and ash were highly enriched suggesting that nitrogen in (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 was predominantly taken up by plants and mycorrhizal fungi but little by saprotrophic microorganisms. Roots of beech and ash were highly enriched in C-13 with maximum values in EM proving that C-13 was translocated into roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Soil animals were a priori assigned to primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and predators. Generally, signatures of soil animals did not significantly vary between beech and ash and therefore were pooled. Primary decomposers had low delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures similar to litter and soil confirming that rhizosphere C and microbial N are of limited importance for primary decomposer taxa. delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of secondary decomposers were higher than those of primary decomposers and spanned a large gradient indicating that certain secondary decomposers rely on root derived C and microbial N, however, none of the secondary decomposers had signatures pointing to exclusive feeding on EM. Unexpectedly, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures were highest in predators suggesting that they heavily preyed on secondary decomposer species such as the litter dwelling Collembola species Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and species not captured by the heat extraction procedure used for capturing prey taxa, presumably predominantly root associated nematodes. Overall, the results highlight that in particular higher trophic levels rely on carbon originating from other resources than litter with these resources channeled to dominant predators via litter dwelling Collembola species.

Inoculation increased shoot length, shoot dry weight and plant total nitrogen by 82.3, 196 and 452%, respectively, over negative control (without inoculation and N fertilization). The tested isolates were found to be very effective (20.9%) and effective (77.4%), with only one ineffective isolate. Indigenous rhizobia in the investigated soils ranged from 30 to 5.8x10(3) cell g(-1) dry soil. A pot experiment with selected rhizobia and nitrogen fertilizer on Chefedonsa and Debrezeit soils did not show any significant difference in shoot dry weight at p<0.05.

We analyzed soil and foliar N-15 along a secondary forest chronosequence in Northeast China in mid-growing seasons 2008 and 2009, to address two questions: how does foliar N-15 vary with stand age; and are the variations driven by compositional differences in species among stands, or by consistent changes in N-15 with plant growth forms, and within species. The results showed that community-level foliar N-15 depleted as stand age increased, and these responses were remarkably consistent within three contrasting plant growth forms (herbs, shrubs, and trees), and within individual species. In spite of the three plant growth forms sharing similar responses to the stand age, tree species showed smaller variations in foliar N-15 along stand ages than herbs and shrubs. Soil N-15 also significantly depleted with increasing stand age, which may drive the variations of foliar N-15. In addition, mycorrhizal fungi discrimination against N-15 may also partly affect the patterns of foliar N-15 along stand ages. The results clearly indicate that differences in foliar N-15 among different stand ages are dominantly driven by the N-15 variations at the species levels, which reflects the variations of soil N-15 and mycorrhizal association intensity and association type, not by compositional difference in species among stands.","[Li, Mingcai; Zhu, Jiaojun; Zhang, Min; Song, Lining] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Qingyuan Expt Stn Forest Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Zhu, JJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",jiaojunzhu@iae.ac.cn,,"ZHU, Jiaojun/0000-0002-2512-7900","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30830085, 40901283]","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30830085, 40901283).

Climate change may alter forest recovery dynamics or even prevent recovery, triggering feedbacks to the climate system, altering regional biodiversity, and affecting the ecosystem services provided by forests. Multiple lines of evidence - including global-scale patterns in forest recovery dynamics; forest responses to experimental manipulation of CO2, temperature, and precipitation; forest responses to the climate change that has already occurred; ecological theory; and ecosystem and earth system models - all indicate that the dynamics of forest recovery are sensitive to climate. However, synthetic understanding of how atmospheric CO2 and climate shape trajectories of forest recovery is lacking. Here, we review these separate lines of evidence, which together demonstrate that the dynamics of forest recovery are being impacted by increasing atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. Rates of forest recovery generally increase with CO2, temperature, and water availability. Drought reduces growth and live biomass in forests of all ages, having a particularly strong effect on seedling recruitment and survival. Responses of individual trees and whole-forest ecosystems to CO2 and climate manipulations often vary by age, implying that forests of different ages will respond differently to climate change. Furthermore, species within a community typically exhibit differential responses to CO2 and climate, and altered community dynamics can have important consequences for ecosystem function. Age- and species-dependent responses provide a mechanism by which climate change may push some forests past critical thresholds such that they fail to recover to their previous state following disturbance. Altered dynamics of forest recovery will result in positive and negative feedbacks to climate change. Future research on this topic and corresponding improvements to earth system models will be a key to understanding the future of forests and their feedbacks to the climate system.","[Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J.] Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Smithsonian Inst Global Earth Observ, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Panama City, Panama; [Miller, Adam D.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Mohan, Jacqueline E.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hudiburg, Tara W.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Energy Biosci Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hudiburg, Tara W.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Duval, Benjamin D.] USDA ARS, US Dairy Forage Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Anderson-Teixeira, KJ (reprint author), Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Natl Zool Pk,1500 Remount Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA.",TeixeiraK@si.edu,,"Hudiburg, Tara/0000-0003-4422-1510",DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0008085],"Thanks to Jonathan Thompson and Sean McMahon for helpful discussion and to three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

We show that invasions by knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula, hereafter spurge)-but not cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)-support a higher abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than multi-species native plant communities. The higher AMF richness associated with knapweed and spurge is unlikely due to a co-invasion by AMF, because a separate sampling showed that individual native forbs hosted a similar AMF abundance and richness as exotic forbs. Native grasses associated with fewer AMF taxa, which could explain the reduced AMF richness in native, grass-dominated communities. The three invasive plant species harbored distinct AMF communities, and analyses of co-occurring native and invasive plants indicate that differences were partly driven by the invasive plants and were not the result of pre-invasion conditions. Our results suggest that invasions by mycotrophic plants that replace poorer hosts can increase AMF abundance and richness. The high AMF richness in monodominant plant invasions also indicates that the proposed positive relationship between above and belowground diversity is not always strong. Finally, the disparate responses among exotic plants and consistent results between grasses and forbs suggest that AMF respond more to plant functional group than plant provenance.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Gibbons, Sean M.; Ramsey, Philip W.] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rosendahl, Soren] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark","Lekberg, Y (reprint author), MPG Ranch, 1001 S Higgins Ave, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.",ylekberg@mpgranch.com,"Rosendahl, Soren/F-4461-2014","Rosendahl, Soren/0000-0001-5202-6585; Gibbons, Sean/0000-0002-8724-7916",MPG Operations,"We thank land managers and ranchers for providing sample sites, Lauren Stoffel and Alexii Cornell for help during sampling, PCR and plant identification and Jill Castoe, Scott Hunicke-Smith, Weizhong Li and Sitao Wu for guidance with 454-sequencing and associated analyses.

However, it is not clear whether this variation represents adaptation of species to specific soil properties, alternative resource acquisition strategies among co-occurring species, or canalized traits without a strong impact on the success of individuals in different environments. Here, our goal was to test these alternative hypotheses and quantify how community-aggregated and intraspecific root trait variations are explained by biotic versus abiotic mechanisms in a temperate deciduous forest. We conducted our study in an Acer-Fagus-dominated forest in north-east Ohio, USA. Using molecular barcoding techniques, we identified 738 root systems belonging to 14 tree species. We measured seven functional root traits related to root architecture and morphology at the species and community-aggregated levels. Although we found significant relationships between soil resource gradients and root trait distributions, intrinsic differences between coexisting species were more important than soil factors in explaining the distribution of root traits in the community. Additionally, root trait variation at the species level was also influenced by the presence of other species within cores. Community-aggregated variation was more influenced by the combination of species present than soil properties in each sample, suggesting that biotic interactions play an important role in controlling community root trait distribution. Synthesis. We propose that root trait differentiation between coexisting species is the result of inherent differences between species and plasticity-mediated responses to neighbours. Hence, the large variation in root traits reported in temperate forest seems to reflect alternative evolutionary pathways that allow individuals to exploit distinct niches in relatively close proximity.","[Valverde-Barrantes, Oscar J.; Feinstein, Larry M.; Kershner, Mark W.; Blackwood, Christopher B.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Smemo, Kurt A.] Holden Arboretum, Kirtland, OH 44094 USA","Valverde-Barrantes, OJ (reprint author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",ovalverd@kent.edu,"Blackwood, Christopher/B-3839-2010","Blackwood, Christopher/0000-0001-5764-6978",Kent State University,"We thank Hafiz Maherali for his comments on this manuscript.

Partner abundance may determine the relative costs and benefits associated with the interaction. Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can strongly influence plant phenotype and community interactions, the effects of AMF abundance on plant resistance traits and multitrophic interactions are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that increasing AMF abundance in soil will increase mycorrhizal colonization and affect plant biomass, foliar phosphorus concentration, the expression of plant resistance and herbivore performance. We inoculated Asclepias syriaca seedlings with Glomus etunicatum, Scutellospora fulgida and a mix of the two species in 11 AMF abundance treatments. We quantified plant phosphorus (P), growth and resistance phenotype and the performance of a specialist herbivore, Danaus plexippus on plants associated with varying amounts of fungi. Increasing abundance of S.fulgida or G.etunicatum in soil increased the proportion of plant root colonized by AMF, but root colonization by a mix of the fungi was not related to inoculum density. The abundance of S.fulgida, but not G.etunicatum, increased per cent foliar P and trichome density, but decreased latex exudation. Abundance of all AMF treatments tended to decrease specific leaf mass (SLM), and the two single-species treatments unimodally affected the expression of total foliar cardenolides. Increasing abundance of the mix of AMF species also increased above-ground biomass, foliar P and trichome density, but had little effect on other traits. The presence of AMF, species identity and the AMF abundance all explained significant variation in the expression of plant traits, although their relative contribution varied depending on the trait examined. Mycorrhizal abundance strongly increased caterpillar growth rate, which was associated with a decline in SLM. Synthesis. Variation in mycorrhizal abundance can profoundly influence the expression of plant resistance and subsequent herbivore performance. AMF abundance may be a key, but overlooked factor in determining the outcome of mycorrhizal mutualisms.","[Vannette, Rachel L.; Hunter, Mark D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vannette, Rachel L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Vannette, RL (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 830 N Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",raleva@stanford.edu,,"Hunter, Mark/0000-0003-3761-8237; Vannette, Rachel/0000-0002-0447-3468",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0814340]; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF),"The authors would like to thank the Matthaei Botanical Gardens for greenhouse space and help with plant care, Mike Grant for analysing phosphorus samples and Hannah DeRose-Wilson and Susan Kabat for help setting up and harvesting the experiment.

The distributions of very fine roots (diameter < 1 mm) and fine roots (diameter < 3 mm) were studied in a randomized block design close to the harvest age of fast-growing plantations. A replacement series was set up in Brazil with mono-specific Eucalyptus grandis (100E) and Acacia mangium (100A) stands and a mixture with the same stocking density and 50 % of each species (50A:50E). The total fine root (FR) biomass down to a depth of 2 m was about 27 % higher in 50A:50E than in 100A and 100E. Fine root over-yielding in 50A:50E resulted from a 72 % rise in E. grandis fine root biomass per tree relative to 100E, whereas A. mangium FR biomass per tree was 17 % lower than in 100A. Mixing A. mangium with E. grandis trees led to a drop in A. mangium FR biomass in the upper 50 cm of soil relative to 100A, partially balanced by a rise in deep soil layers. Our results highlight similarities in the effects of directional resources on leaf and FR distributions in the mixture, with A. mangium leaves below the E. grandis canopy and a low density of A. mangium fine roots in the resource-rich soil layers relative to monospecific stands. The vertical segregation of resource-absorbing organs did not lead to niche complementarity expected to increase the total biomass production.","[Laclau, Jean-Paul; Nouvellon, Yann; Jourdan, Christophe; le Maire, Guerric; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre] CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Estadual Sao Paulo, UNESP, Dept Recursos Nat, BR-18610307 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Nouvellon, Yann] Univ Sao Paulo, IAG, Dept Ciencias Atmosfer, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Reine, Caroline] Univ Lorraine, INRA, Lab Sols & Environm, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Dept Ciencias Florestais, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Krushe, Alex Vladimir] Univ Sao Paulo, CENA, BR-13416000 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","Laclau, JP (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",laclau@cirad.fr,"Bouillet, Jean-Pierre/E-6929-2014; Goncalves, Jose Leonardo Moraes/G-4979-2013; Laclau, Jean-Paul/O-2189-2019; JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019; le Maire, Guerric/P-6378-2014; Nouvellon, Yann/C-9295-2016","Goncalves, Jose Leonardo Moraes/0000-0003-1068-5448; Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; Nouvellon, Yann/0000-0003-1920-3847; le Maire, Guerric/0000-0002-5227-958X",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Intensfix)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2010-STRA-004]; FAPESP Thematic Project [2010/16623-9]; CIRAD (ATP Neucapalm); USP-COFECUB project [22193PA]; European Integrated Project Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) [n515960],"Our thanks to Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Intens&fix, ANR-2010-STRA-004), FAPESP Thematic Project (2010/16623-9), CIRAD (ATP Neucapalm), the USP-COFECUB project (No. 22193PA), and the European Integrated Project Ultra Low CO<INF>2</INF> Steelmaking (ULCOS-Contract n515960) for their financial support.

This research determines whether significant variation in rooting characteristics of potato exists, which characters correlate with final yield and whether a simple screen for rooting traits could be developed. Methods Twenty-eight genotypes of Solanum tuberosum groups Tuberosum and Phureja were grown in the field; eight replicate blocks to final harvest, while entire root systems were excavated from four blocks. Root classes were categorised and measured. The same measurements were made on these genotypes in the glasshouse, 2 weeks post emergence. Results In the field, total root length varied from 40 m to 112 m per plant. Final yield was correlated negatively with basal root specific root length and weakly but positively with total root weight. Solanum tuberosum group Phureja genotypes had more numerous roots and proportionally more basal than stolon roots compared with Solanum tuberosum, group Tuberosum genotypes. There were significant correlations between glasshouse and field measurements. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that variability in rooting traits amongst commercially available potato genotypes exists and a robust glasshouse screen has been developed. By measuring potato roots as described in this study, it is now possible to assess rooting traits of large populations of potato genotypes.","[Wishart, Jane] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9TS, Fife, Scotland; [George, Timothy S.; Brown, Lawrie K.; Ramsay, Gavin; Bradshaw, John E.; White, Philip J.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Gregory, Peter J.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Ctr Food Secur, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","George, TS (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",Tim.George@hutton.ac.uk,"White, Philip John/C-5860-2008","White, Philip John/0000-0003-0827-288X; Gregory, Peter/0000-0002-4118-4833",Scottish Government,"We thank all who helped in the field with digging up the potato root systems including Catherine Rose, Jackie Thompson, Lionel Dupuy, Gladys Wright, Ankush Prashar and Gaynor Mackenzie.

Consequently, an understanding of the factors determining the fate of DU in soil is necessary. An understudied factor is the interaction of root exudates with DU. This study describes the use of 'Single-Cell-Sampling-and-Analysis' (SiCSA) for the first time in soil and investigates the effects of root exudates on DU dissolution. Methods Soil solutions from soil and plant-soil microcosms containing DU fragments were sampled and analysed using SiCSA and capillary electrophoresis/ICP-MS for organic acids and uranium. Results Nanolitre volumes of soil solution were sampled and analysed. Soils with DU fragments but no citrate addition showed low uranium concentrations in contrast to those with added citrate. Lupin root exudation gave concentrations up to 8 mM citrate and 4.4 mM malate in soil solution which solubilised DU fragments yielding transient solution concentrations of up to 30 mM. Conclusions Root exudates solubilise DU giving high localised soil solution concentrations. This should be considered when assessing the environmental risk of DU munitions. The SiCSA method was used successfully in soil for the first time and enables investigations with high spatial and temporal resolution in the rhizosphere.","[Tandy, Susan; Grail, Barry M.; Tomos, A.

We quantified seasonal C-assimilation and allocation by plants, and assessed how well this corresponds with intraradical arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) storage and structural lipids (16: 1 omega 5 NLFA and PLFA, respectively), as well as microscopic assessments of AMF root colonization. Methods Coastal Hypochoeris radicata plants were labeled with (CO2)-C-13 in February, July and October, and C-13-allocation to fine roots and NLFA 16: 1 omega 5, as well as overall lipid contents and AM colonization were quantified. Results C-allocation to fine roots and AMF storage lipids differed seasonally and mirrored plant C-assimilation, whereas AMF structural lipids and AM colonization showed no seasonal variation, and root colonization exceeded 80 % throughout the year. Molecular analyzes of the large subunit rDNA gene indicated no seasonal AMF community shifts. Conclusions Plants allocated C to AMF even at temperatures close to freezing, and fungal structures persisted in roots during times of low C-allocation. The lack of seasonal differences in PLFA and AM colonization indicates that NLFA analyses should be used to estimate fungal C-status. The implication of our findings for AM function is discussed.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Rosendahl, Soren; Michelsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Olsson, Pal Axel] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Lekberg, Y (reprint author), Univ Montana, MPG Ranch, 1001 S Higgins Ave,Suite A3, Missoula, MT 59802 USA.",ylekberg@mpgranch.com; soerenr@bio.ku.dk; andersm@bio.ku.dk; pal_axel.olsson@biol.lu.se,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Rosendahl, Soren/F-4461-2014","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Rosendahl, Soren/0000-0001-5202-6585",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council,"This study was made possible by a Marie Curie grant awarded to YL, and funding from the Swedish Research Council to PAO.

The underlying mechanisms are, however, only little understood, likely due to the focus on the aboveground system and neglecting species-specific traits. We used different clusters of tree species composition to investigate how tree species diversity and tree species identity affect belowground nematode communities. Since soil nematodes comprise different trophic groups and are strongly linked to the microbial community, results can provide insight on how soil food webs are structured. In addition, data on leaf litter and fine root biomass were included to account for different effects of aboveground and belowground resources. Clusters of three trees of one, two and three species were identified within a temperate deciduous forest. Target tree species were European beech (Fagus sylvatica), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lime (Tilia cordata, T. platyphyllos) differing in physiology, leaf litter quality and type of mycorrhiza. Tree species identity strongly affected nematode trophic structure, whereas tree Species diversity had no impact. Ash beneficially affected bacterial-feeding nematodes, whereas fungal feeders were suppressed, likely caused by ash litter increasing soil pH. Fostering of the bacterial food chain by ash additionally could be related to rhizodeposition gaining importance after disappearance of high quality ash litter in spring, highlighting seasonal shifts in root and leaf litter-derived resources. The negative effect of ash on fungal-feeding nematodes is suggested to be due to the lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi as ash roots only form arbuscular mycorrhiza. In contrast, beech benefited fungal feeders and detrimentally affected bacterial feeders due to more acidic soil conditions that increase the competitive strength of fungi. Lime tended to negatively impact total nematode density but positively influenced plant-feeding nematodes. Generally, beech and ash strongly but opposingly influenced the trophic structure of nematode communities suggesting that changes in tree species identity result in major shifts in the channeling of energy through decomposer food webs. The results indicate that the structure of soil food webs varies markedly with tree species and point to the importance of basal resources, i.e., leaf litter and rhizodeposits. This suggests bottom-up forces mediated by individual tree species to control major decomposition pathways rather than tree diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using values from literature and excavations, this study examined rooting patterns for 125 riparian species of southwestern USA and asked if maximum root depth varies with 1) moisture affinity, 2) growth habit, 3) flowering season, and 4) exotic vs. native status. Root depth varied with all factors analyzed. Hydroriparian species had shallower roots than mesoriparian and xeroriparian species. Annuals had shallower roots than perennials, and shrubs had deeper roots than trees. Hydroriparian perennials and cool-season annuals had the shallowest roots; xeroriparian shrubs had the deepest. Plants varied widely in root depth as well as in root length (near surface laterals) and root:shoot ratios. This wide range is typical of ecosystems that have many water sources, with each rooting pattern being adaptive in a different hydrogeomorphic setting. Exotic species showed trait divergence as evidenced by greater rooting depths. There were many data gaps, with several species having no rooting data. There is a need for site-based studies of rooting patterns in dryland riparian zones to more accurately document hydrogeomorphic niches and predict changes in plant distributions.

We tested if 1) invasive species are colonised by AMF to a lower degree than resident native species, and 2) AMF colonisation of native plants is lower in a community inhabited by an invasive species than in an uninvaded resident community. The two tests were run in semiarid temperate grasslands on grass (Poaceae) species, and the frequency and intensity of mycorrhizal colonisation, and the proportion of arbuscules and vesicles in plant roots have been measured. In the first test, grasses representing three classes of invasiveness were included: invasive species, resident species becoming abundant upon disturbance, and non-invasive native species. Each class contained one C3 and one C4 species. The AMF colonisation of the invasive Calamagrostis epigejos and Cynodon dactylon was consistently lower than that of the non-invasive native Chrysopogon gryllus and Bromus inermis, and contained fewer arbuscules than the post-disturbance dominant resident grasses Bothriochloa ischaemum and Brachypodium pinnatum. The C3 and C4 grasses behaved alike despite their displaced phenologies in these habitats. The second test compared AMF colonisation for sand grassland dominant grasses Festuca vaginata and Stipa borysthenica in stands invaded by either C. epigejos or C. dactylon, and in the uninvaded natural community. Resident grasses showed lower degree of AMF colonisation in the invaded stand compared to the uninvaded natural community with F. vaginata responding so to both invaders, while S. borysthenica responding to C. dactylon only. These results indicate that invasive grasses supposedly less reliant on AMF symbionts have the capacity of altering the soil mycorrhizal community in such a way that resident native species can establish a considerably reduced extent of the beneficial AMF associations, hence their growth, reproduction and ultimately abundance may decline. Accumulating evidence suggests that such indirect influences of invasive alien plants on resident native species mediated by AMF or other members of the soil biota is probably more the rule than the exception.","[Endresz, G.; Kalapos, T.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Somodi, I.] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary","Endresz, G (reprint author), Szent Laszlo Secondary Sch, Korosi Csoma S Ut 28-34, H-1102 Budapest, Hungary.",endreszgabor@gmail.com,"Kalapos, Tibor/C-3962-2009","Kalapos, Tibor/0000-0002-1393-5580",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) grantOrszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA) [PD-83522],Authors thank G.

Principal among these is herbivory of young plants, vegetative competition, and slow growth rates of cork oak seedlings. We evaluated the early development of cork oak seedlings treated using tree shelters and mulching in northwestern Tunisia. We tested three tree shelter treatments (non-vented, vented, and control) to shield seedlings from animal damage and five mulch types to control competing vegetation (Italian Stone Pine, Lentisk, combination of Italian Stone Pine and Lentisk (organic mulches), gravel (inorganic mulch) and no mulch). At the end of the two-year experiment, sheltered seedlings were 89-99% taller than unsheltered seedlings and had higher numbers and lengths of shoot growth flushes. In contrast, both stem diameter growth and dry weight biomass (from samples extracted after two years) were significantly reduced inside tree shelters. Root-to-shoot ratio was not significantly different in sheltered vs. unsheltered seedlings, suggesting that tree shelters do not adversely affect this parameter. Mulching alone did not favour growth, but could be beneficial when combined with tree shelters. The combination of vented tree shelters and gravel mulch was the most effective treatment for promoting diameter, height and stem volume growth.","[Mechergui, Taher] FSB, Jarzouna 7021, Tunisia; [Pardos, Marta] Ctr Invest Forestal, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Boussaidi, Naceur; Hasnaoui, Brahim] Inst Sylvo Pastoral Tabarka, Tabarka 8110, Tunisia; [Jacobs, Douglass F.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Mechergui, T (reprint author), Dolphin Serv Voyages, 56 Rue Russie, Bizerte 7000, Tunisia.",mecherguit@yahoo.fr,"Pardos, Marta/A-4797-2015","Pardos, Marta/0000-0002-5567-5406; Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516",laboratory of silvopastoral resources (Silvopastoral Institute - Tabarka),"This research received financial support from the laboratory of silvopastoral resources (Silvopastoral Institute - Tabarka).

The objective of this study was to evaluate early growth and productivity of two hybrid poplar clones, P. balsamifera x trichocarpa (PBT) and P. maximowiczii x balsamifera (PMB), one improved family of Norway spruce (Picea glauca (PA)) and one improved family of white spruce (Picea abies (PG)) growing under different spacings in monocultures and mixed plots. The plantations were established in 2003 in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada, in a split plot design with spacing as the whole plot factor (1 x 1 m, 3 x 3 m and 5 x 5 m) and mixture treatments as subplot factor (pure: PBT, PMB, PA and PG, and 1: 1 mixture PBT: PA, PBT: PG, PMB: PA and PMB: PG). Results showed a beneficial effect of the hybrid poplar-spruce mixture on diameter growth for hybrid poplar clones, but not for the 5 x 5 m spacing because of the relatively young age of the plantations. Diameter growth of the spruces decreased in mixed plantings in the 1 x 1 m, while their height growth increased, resulting in similar aboveground biomass per tree across treatments. Because of the large size differences between spruces and poplars, aboveground biomass in the mixed plantings was generally less than that in pure poplar plots. Leaf nitrogen concentration for the two spruce families and hybrid poplar clone PMB was greater in mixed plots than in monocultures, while leaf nitrogen concentration of clone PBT was similar among mixture treatments. Because of its faster growth rate and greater soil resources demands, clone PMB was the only one showing an increase in leaf N with increased spacing between trees. Fine roots density was greater for both hybrid poplars than spruces. The vertical distribution of fine roots was insensitive to mixture treatment.","[Benomar, Lahcen; DesRochers, Annie] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Chaire Ind CRSNG UQAT UQAM Amenagement Forestier, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada; [Larocque, Guy R.] Nat Resources Canada, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Benomar, L (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Chaire Ind CRSNG UQAT UQAM Amenagement Forestier, 341 Rue Principale Nord, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada.",Lahcen.benomar@uqat.ca,"benomar, lahcen/Q-3080-2019; DesRochers, Annie/B-8431-2015","DesRochers, Annie/0000-0002-4653-4062; benomar, lahcen/0000-0001-9301-5655; benomar, lahcen/0000-0003-4462-3755","Reseau Ligniculture Quebec; Norbord Inc.; Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.; CRSNG-UQAT-UQAM Industrial Chair in Sustainable Forest Management; Center for Forest Management (CEF); Natural Resources Canada, Laurentian Forestry CentreNatural Resources Canada","We thank Reseau Ligniculture Quebec, Norbord Inc., Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc., CRSNG-UQAT-UQAM Industrial Chair in Sustainable Forest Management, Center for Forest Management (CEF) and Natural Resources Canada, Laurentian Forestry Centre, for their support.",,41,7,7,0,62,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

Understanding of woody plant interactions with grasses in savannas has long been underpinned by Walter's two-layered niche differentiation hypothesis that postulates that grasses and trees source water from different depths. The Walter hypothesis persists in the literature, despite contrary evidence and a lack of quantitative empirical tests of the theory. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to determine the following: (1) whether tree seedlings and grasses obtain water from different depths on rocky and sandy soils; (2) whether interspecific competition affected tissue water content of clipped grasses; and (3) the influence of repeated grass clipping on soil moisture. Grass competition significantly reduced tree seedling rooting depth on both rocky and sandy substrates. Trees had significantly longer roots on rocky substrates than on sandy substrates for all combinations (trees only, trees with unclipped grasses and trees with clipped grasses). Results indicated a three-tier soil moisture depletion pattern, with a top layer (15cm) exclusively exploited by grasses, an intermediate zone (25-35cm) utilised by both grass and tree seedling roots and deeper subsoil exclusively tapped by tree seedling roots. Our results are consistent with Walter's hypothesis, but we distinguished between three rather than two layers of tree and grass root interactions in acquiring soil moisture.

Here we test whether contrasting vegetation types have similar or different responses to soil patches of differing resource availability. We examined the fine root responses of grassland and forest vegetation at the northern edge of the Great Plains to transplanted patches of resource-poor and resource-rich soils, using rhizotron imaging. Every aspect of measured root behavior, including root length, production, mortality, turnover, variability and size distribution, varied significantly between patch types, and most aspects also varied between vegetation types. Most importantly, differential responses to patches between grassland and forest were shown by significant interactions between patch type and vegetation for two response variables. First, root length variability was significantly lower in resource-rich compared to resource-poor patches in forest but not grassland. Second, the proportion of very fine roots was significantly greater in resource-rich than resource-poor patches in forests but not grassland. Thus, compared to grassland, forest more fully occupied resource-rich patches relative to resource-poor patches by allocating more growth to very fine roots. We report the first example of significant differences between vegetation types (grassland and forest) in root responses to soil resource heterogeneity measured in a field experiment. The relatively high ability of forest roots to more fully occupy resource-rich patches is consistent with the global expansion of woody vegetation and associated increases in soil heterogeneity.","[Pinno, Bradley D.; Wilson, Scott D.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Pinno, BD (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, No Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",bpinno@nrcan.gc.ca,,"Pinno, Brad/0000-0001-5680-3601",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank M.

We quantified the fate of belowground carbon by measuring C-13 enrichment of roots, rhizosphere soil, soil respiration, soil aggregates and microbial biomass. The pulse of C-13 contributed strongly to root and rhizosphere respiration for over a year, and respiration comprised about 75 % of total belowground C allocation (TBCA) in the first year. We estimate that rhizosphere carbon flux (RCF) during the dormant season comprises at least 6 % of TBCA. After 3 years, 3.8 % of the C allocated belowground was recovered in soil organic matter, mostly in water-stable aggregates.

Additionally, we evaluated litter chemical quality as an interface between the above and below-ground compartments. Plant community, and soil chemical and biochemical data from three post-mining degraded sites under reclamation and from one nearby forest site in the Brazilian Amazon Basin were analyzed. All studied sites presented distinct plant community, litter quality, SC and SMA. Plant community consistently affected the below-ground variation in both SC and SMA compartments. The influence of litter quality was greater in the plant community versus SMA relationship than in the plant community versus SC. Nevertheless, the SC affected significantly the SMA, but without influence of litter quality. Differently from previous studies, our findings suggest that plant community and soil chemistry can affect the soil microbial activity independently. Specifically for our study area, these results point to a rupture of the 'in nested' structure of the causal relationship between changes in vegetation, changes in the chemical litter quality, changes in the SC and the response of SMA.","[Lisboa, Francy J.

Increasing numbers of species introductions are also increasing the likelihood of new species interactions particularly between plants, microbes and insects. Frequently discovered interactions between plants, microbes and insects are giving rise to a new field: plantmicrobeinsect (PMI) interactions. This paper focuses on novel PMI interactions created from the introduction of new plant, insect and microbe species. In particular, this paper asks: Do novel PMI interactions promote or inhibit invasive plants, microbes and insects? And can we predict whether novel PMI interactions are likely to become invasive? While we might predict that novel PMI interactions are likely to be simple additive interactions due to their relatively short period of interaction, instead this review demonstrates that most novel PMI interactions are actually nonadditive. This manuscript shows that there are a great number of instances where invasive species are promoted by novel PMI interactions. By contrast, the studied cases where PMI interactions limit invasive species are predominantly biocontrol PMI interactions. Future research on novel PMI interactions should focus on predicting future novel PMI interactions that promote invasive species. Given that many novel PMI interactions involve plant pathogens and their insect vectors, this novel PMI interaction deserves more focus. New research should also focus on non-novel PMI interactions that could be manipulated to hinder the spread of invasive plant, microbe and insect species.","James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Bennett, AE (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Errol Rd, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",Alison.Bennett@hutton.ac.uk,,,Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division,"The author would like to thank James Hourston, Pete Goddard, Alison Karley, Adrian Newton, Arjen Biere and two anonymous reviewers for comments on the manuscript.

The sampled soils had been used for continuous greenhouse production of watermelon for 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. Glomus claroideum was the dominant species in the greenhouse soils planted for 5, 10, and 15 years in Laiyang, while Glomus mosseae and Glomus etunicatum were dominant in the nearby open farmland soil. Sorenson's similarity index of AMF community composition ranged from 0.67 to 0.84 in the soils planted for 5 years, and from 0.29 to 0.33 for 20 years among the three locations. Spore abundance, species richness, and the Shannon index were highest near the soil surface (0-10 cm) and decreased with soil depth, and higher in June and October than in August and December. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that available P and the number of years that soil had been used for greenhouse production were the main factors contributing to the variance of AMF community composition. It was concluded that the community structure of AMF was mainly influenced by soil available P and planting time of watermelon as well as by soil depth and seasonal variation in the commercial greenhouse.","[Liu Run-Jin; Li Yan; Diao Zhi-Kai; Li Min] Qingdao Agr Univ, Inst Mycorrhizal Biotechnol, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China; [Lin Xian-Gui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Lin, XG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",xglin@issas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30871737]; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [Y052010038]; Qingdao Municipal Natural Science Foundation of China [08-1-3-20-jch]","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.30871737), the Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. Y052010038), and the Qingdao Municipal Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 08-1-3-20-jch).",,41,4,7,1,40,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,JUN,2013,23,3,,,,,350,358,,10.1016/S1002-0160(13)60026-0,,,9,Soil Science,Agriculture,149HD,WOS:000319308700010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bauman, JM; Keiffer, CH; Hiremath, S; McCarthy, BC",,,,"Bauman, Jenise M.; Keiffer, Carolyn H.; Hiremath, Shiv; McCarthy, Brian C.",,,Soil preparation methods promoting ectomycorrhizal colonization and American chestnut Castanea dentata establishment in coal mine restoration,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative; ecological restoration; ectomycorrhizal fungi; Forestry Reclamation Approach; plantfungal interactions; soil subsurface treatments,FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; FOREST; TREE; LAND; MYCORRHIZAE; SPECIFICITY; COMPETITION; BARRIERS; ROOTS,"The objective of this research was to evaluate soil subsurface methods that may aid in seedling establishment and encourage root colonization from a diverse group of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi during restoration projects.

It is not clear whether ECM activity was the driver of plant growth; regardless, both are strong indicators of healthy tree establishment. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that the use of soil subsurface methods increased ectomycorrhizal (ECM) activity and seedling growth. Employing methods that encourage the root colonization by beneficial ECM and promote healthy seedling establishment may aid the long-term survival of chestnuts in restoration projects. This can be applied to other hardwood seedlings used in reforestation in soils compacted after anthropogenic disturbances.","[Bauman, Jenise M.; Keiffer, Carolyn H.] Miami Univ, Dept Bot, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Hiremath, Shiv] US Forest Serv, USDA, Delaware, OH 43015 USA; [McCarthy, Brian C.] Ohio Univ, Dept Environm & Plant Biol, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Bauman, JM (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Bot, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",baumanjm@miamioh.edu,,,US Department of Interior (Office of Surface Mining); US Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [06-JV-11242300-093]; Miami University's Department of Botany,"This study was supported by National Technology and Transfer funds from the US Department of Interior (Office of Surface Mining), part by a Joint Research Venture grant 06-JV-11242300-093 from the US Forest Service and by the Academic Challenge Grant from Miami University's Department of Botany.

However, these fractions are difficult to measure directly in soils. We examined patterns in the biomolecular composition of SOM and hot-water-extractable organic matter (HWEOM) by using a molecular mixing model (MMM) to estimate the content of carbohydrates, protein, lipids, and lignin. Organic-horizon soils from Spodosols at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in NH, USA were analyzed for this study. The MMM uses data from elemental analysis (C, H, and N) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning to estimate the percentage of total C in the various classes of biomolecules. Carbohydrate content decreased from about 50 % of the C in recent litter to approximately 35 % in the bottom of the humus layer. Lipids accounted for about 18 % of C in recent litter and increased to 40 % in the lower humus layers. The HWEOM fraction of SOM was dominated by carbohydrates (40-70 % of C). Carbohydrates and lipids in HWEOM exhibited depth patterns that were the opposite of the SOM. The results from the MMM confirmed the selective decomposition of carbohydrates and the relative accumulation of lipids during humus formation. The depth patterns in HWEOM suggest that the solubility of carbohydrates increases during decomposition, while the solubility of the lipid fraction decreases. The MMM was able to reproduce the spectral properties of SOM and HWEOM very accurately, although there were some discrepancies between the predicted and measured H/C and O/C ratios. The MMM approach is an accurate and cost-effective alternative to wet-chemical methods. Together, carbohydrates and proteins account for up to 85 % of the C in HWEOM, indicating that the HWEOM fraction represents a labile source of C for microbes. Humification resulted in a decrease in carbohydrate content and an increase in lipids in SOM, consistent with investigations carried out in diverse soil environments.","[Balaria, Ankit; Johnson, Chris E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA","Johnson, CE (reprint author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 151 Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",cejohns@syr.edu,"Johnson, Chris E/A-6979-2011","Johnson, Chris E/0000-0001-9079-813X","US Department of Agriculture National Research Initiative Competitive Grants programUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2005-35107-16200]; National Science Foundation, through the Long-Term Ecological Research program [1114804]; W.L.

Here, it is shown that disrupted spores (DS) homogenates and exudates from germinating spores (GS) of Glomus etunicatum caused marked alterations in the content of the tobacco alkaloids nicotine, anabasine, and nornicotine and the genes involved in their biosynthesis. GS and DS were applied to the base of Nicotiana tabacum seedling stems, and 3 or 10 days later, the leaves and roots were harvested for analyses. The alkaloid contents were influenced by both elicitors and varied depending on the harvest day. In general, such variations agree with the transcript levels of putrescine N-methyltransferase, oxide reductase A622 and nicotine N-demethylase CYP82E4. The results are discussed in light of recent insights on chemical signaling processes between plants and AMF able to trigger different elicitation responses and their possible effects on secondary metabolism in plants.","[de Andrade, Sara A.

The delta N-15, delta C-13, and C/N ratio of foliage of eight dominant plant species, including trees, understory shrubs, and a moss, as well as humus, were examined across a 361 years fire-driven chronosequence in boreal forest in northern Sweden. The delta C-13 and C/N ratio of plants and humus increased along the chronosequence, suggesting increasing plant stress through N limitation. Despite increasing biological N fixation by cyanobacteria associated with feather mosses, delta N-15 showed an overall decline, and delta N-15 of the feather moss and associated vascular plants diverged over time from that of atmospheric N-2. Across this chronosequence the N fixed by cyanobacteria is unlikely to be used by mosses and vascular plants without first undergoing mineralization and mycorrhizal transport, which would cause a change in delta N-15 signature due to isotopic fractionation. The decreasing trend of delta N-15 suggests that as the chronosequence proceeds, the plants may become more dependent on N transferred from mycorrhizal fungi or from N deposition.","[Hyodo, Fujio] Okayama Univ, Res Core Interdisciplinary Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Kusaka, Soichiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Wardle, David A.; Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hyodo, F (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Res Core Interdisciplinary Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",fhyodo@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,"Nilsson Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte/B-1802-2017; Wardle, David/F-6031-2011","Nilsson Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte/0000-0002-9254-2223; Wardle, David/0000-0002-0476-7335","VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (Japan); JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society of the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Morgan Karlsson for sample collection in this study.

We investigated the effect of dominant deciduous tree species of the Central European forest vegetation, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L) and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L), on soil biota and carbon dynamics differentiating between root- and leaf litter-mediated effects. The influence of beech and ash seedlings on carbon and nitrogen flow was investigated using leaf litter enriched in C-13 and N-15 in double split-root rhizotrons planted with beech and ash seedlings as well as a mixture of both tree species and a control without plants. Stable isotope and compound-specific fatty acid analysis (C-13-PLFA) were used to follow the incorporation of stable isotopes into microorganisms, soil animals and plants. Further, the bacterial community composition was analyzed using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Although beech root biomass was significantly lower than that of ash only beech significantly decreased soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations after 475 days of incubation. In addition, beech significantly decreased microbial carbon use efficiency as indicated by higher specific respiration. Low soil pH probably increased specific respiration of bacteria suggesting that rhizodeposits of beech roots induced increased microbial respiration and therefore carbon loss from soil. Compared to beech delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of gamasid mites in ash rhizotrons were significantly higher indicating higher amounts of litter-derived carbon and nitrogen to reach higher trophic levels. Similar delta C-13 signatures of bacteria and fine roots indicate that mainly bacteria incorporated root-derived carbon in beech rhizotrons. The results suggest that beech and ash differentially impact soil processes with beech more strongly affecting the belowground system via root exudates and associated changes in rhizosphere microorganisms and carbon dynamics than ash.

To achieve this, an effective symbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation between legumes and root nodule bacteria will be essential. Evaluation of effective Myanmar Bradyrhizobium (Jordan 1982) strains isolated from Myanmar soybean (Glycine max L.

N fixation ability of soybean was evaluated by acetylene reduction activity (ARA) by gas chromatography. It was found that MAS23 showed a relatively high degree of stability and a high level of ARA per plant on both Yezin-3 and Yezin-6 soybean varieties. In the symbiotic relationship between Bradyrhizobium strains and P4 experiments, the treatments consisted of six Bradyrhizobium strains (MAS23, MAS33, MAS34, MAS43, MAS48 and USDA110) and Streptomyces griseoflavus P4 were evaluated with four Myanmar soybean varieties (Yezin-3, Yezin-6, Hinthada and Shan Sein). In the Yezin-3 soybean variety, the best treatment for ARA per plant was found in the dual inoculation of P4 and MAS34. In the Yezin-6 soybean variety, the highest nodule dry weight was found in dual inoculation of P4 with MAS34 but the highest ARA per plant was observed in the dual inoculation of P4 and MAS23. On the other hand, single inoculation of MAS43 and coinoculation of P4 with MAS48 were significantly higher in N fixation of Hinthada, and coinoculation of P4 with MAS33 was significant improvement of ARA per plant (P<0.05) in Shan Sein soybean.","[Soe, Khin Myat] Kyushu Univ, Plant Nutr Lab, Fac Agr, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci,Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Yamakawa, Takeo] Kyushu Univ, Plant Nutr Laboratroy, Div Mol Biosci, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol,Fac Agr,Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Soe, KM (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Plant Nutr Lab, Fac Agr, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci,Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",khinmyatsoe@gmail.com,,,,,,40,5,5,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Previous studies revealed that fine root respiration was related to root morphology, tissue nitrogen (N) concentration and temperature, and varied with both soil depth and season. The underlying mechanisms governing the relationship between root respiration and root morphology, chemistry and anatomy along the root branch order have not been addressed. Here, we examined these relationships of the first- to fifth-order roots for near surface roots (0-10 cm) of 22-year-old larch (Larix gmelinii L.) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica L.) plantations. Root respiration rate at 18 degrees C was measured by gas phase O-2 electrodes across the first five branching order roots (the distal roots numbered as first order) at three times of the year. Root parameters of root diameter, specific root length (SRL), tissue N concentration, total non-structural carbohydrates (starch and soluble sugar) concentration (TNC), cortical thickness and stele diameter were also measured concurrently. With increasing root order, root diameter, TNC and the ratio of root TNC to tissue N concentration increased, while the SRL, tissue N concentration and cortical proportion decreased. Root respiration rate also monotonically decreased with increasing root order in both species. Cortical tissue (including exodermis, cortical parenchyma and endodermis) was present in the first three order roots, and cross sections of the cortex for the first-order root accounted for 68% (larch) and 86% (ash) of the total cross section of the root. Root respiration was closely related to root traits such as diameter, SRL, tissue N concentration, root TNC : tissue N ratio and stele-to-root diameter proportion among the first five orders, which explained up to 81-94% of variation in the rate of root respiration for larch and up to 83-93% for ash. These results suggest that the systematic variations of root respiration rate within tree fine root system are possibly due to the changes of tissue N concentration and anatomical structure along root branch orders in both tree species, which provide deeper understanding in the mechanism of how root traits affect root respiration in woody plants.","[Jia, Shuxia] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Jia, Shuxia; Gu, Jiacun; Wang, Zhengquan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang Pr, Peoples R China; [McLaughlin, Neil B.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal & Oilseed Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Li, Xingpeng] Jilin Prov Acad Forestry Sci, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China","Wang, ZQ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang Pr, Peoples R China.",wzqsilv@mail.nefu.edu.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416906]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41101241],This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2012CB416906) and Natural Science Foundation of China (41101241).,,55,37,43,1,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,2013,33,6,,,,,579,589,,10.1093/treephys/tpt040,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,178QZ,WOS:000321463800003,23824239,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Coince, A; Cael, O; Bach, C; Lengelle, J; Cruaud, C; Gavory, F; Morin, E; Murat, C; Marcais, B; Buee, M",,,,"Coince, Aurore; Cael, Olivier; Bach, Cyrille; Lengelle, Juliette; Cruaud, Corinne; Gavory, Frederick; Morin, Emmanuelle; Murat, Claude; Marcais, Benoit; Buee, Marc",,,Below-ground fine-scale distribution and soil versus fine root detection of fungal and soil oomycete communities in a French beech forest,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Diversity; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Fagus sylvatica; Fine roots; Oomycete; Phytophthora; Pyrosequencing; Soil; Spatial distribution,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; 454 PYROSEQUENCING ANALYSES; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; PINE ECTOMYCORRHIZAS; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; BOREAL FOREST; DNA BARCODE,"The use of next-generation DNA sequencing methods, which produce massive volumes of data, has transformed fungal molecular ecology. These technologies offer the opportunity to describe microbial communities in depth and to investigate fungal diversity at a large geographical scale. In particular, due to the emergence of studies conducted at a large scale (countries, continents), the definition of a compromise between the optimal and representative description of local diversity (plot scale) and the management of a greater number of sites for these studies is required. This work was performed to explore the local richness and the structure of the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal and oomycete communities in a temperate beech plot using 454 pyrosequencing technology. The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region was amplified and sequenced from fine roots and soil sampled from the two upper horizons. Our analyses suggest that soil could be a good substitute for fine roots in studying EcM fungi. The fungal assemblage exhibited a vertical distribution in the soil profile. Only four Pythiaceae were identified, which was insufficient to study the spatial distribution of this group. The fungal and particularly the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) richness was not correlated with any soil variable (pH, C, N or P), but the spatial structure was explained by the C:N ratio and phosphorus content. Our data reveal the importance of maintaining a minimal representative sampling at the plot scale for comparative geographical studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

In this context, the phenology, excavation of root systems and seedling establishment of these species were investigated in the southern Tunisia. Our data suggest that phenological differences between the studied species may depend on the rooting depth. The mean seedling emergence rate was 73% in H.deserti, 66% in A.henoniana, 60% in C.polygonoides and 50% in E.alata. Statistical analyses of seedling establishment showed a highly significant difference among the four species in both seasons (F=1595.15, P<0.0001), species (F=781.57, P<0.0001) and species/season interaction (F=61.84, P<0.0001). After 3years, seedling mortality ranged from 73% to 89%. Seedling mortality reached a maximum in the summer of the first year of study (P<0.001). This study provided further understanding of the ecological tolerance, adaptive strategy and the low density of these species in nature. Henophyton deserti appears to be better adapted to the harsh desert environment. These findings explain the very high density observed in the Sahara compared with other studied species. This species has therefore proven to be an excellent candidate for the ecological restoration of degraded desert rangelands and can be introduced successfully in to rehabilitation programmes.","[Derbel, Salma; Chaieb, Mohamed] Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Sfax 3018, Tunisia","Derbel, S (reprint author), Univ Sfax, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",derbelsalma@yahoo.fr,,,General Direction of Forests (Tunisia); World Bank,"We thank the General Direction of Forests (Tunisia) and the World Bank for the financial support of the study.

The ancestral symbiotic condition for all plants is, nonetheless, widely assumed to be arbuscular mycorrhizal with Glomeromycota fungi. Owing to a recent report of other fungi in some non-vascular plants, here we investigate the fungi associated with diverse hornworts worldwide, using electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetics. We found that both Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina fungi can form symbioses with most hornworts, often simultaneously. This discovery indicates that ancient terrestrial plants relied on a wider and more versatile symbiotic repertoire than previously thought, and it highlights the so far unappreciated ecological and evolutionary role of Mucoromycotina fungi.","[Desiro, Alessandro] Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Duckett, Jeffrey G.; Pressel, Silvia] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Plants Div, London SW7 5BD, England; [Villarreal, Juan Carlos] Univ Munich LMU, Munich, Germany; [Bidartondo, Martin I.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; [Bidartondo, Martin I.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England","Desiro, A (reprint author), Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Viale PA Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",alessandro.desiro@unito.it,"Pressel, Silvia/A-6616-2012; Aguilar, Juan Carlos Villarreal/C-6277-2018","Aguilar, Juan Carlos Villarreal/0000-0002-0770-1446; Desiro, Alessandro/0000-0003-1347-2843","University of Turin of the Regione Piemonte; University of Bando ad Alta Formazione of the Regione Piemonte; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RE-603/14-1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I027193/1, NE/I025360/1]","We thank J.

Due to the emergence of new energy sources and rural exodus, more than 1,200,000 hectares of coppice stands in Spain have been abandoned since 1970. Stand degradation, stem top drying, low production, scarce acorn yield and absence of sexual regeneration are major problems of these coppices. The need to establish new uses by conversion to high forest has been widely recognized and several attempts by thinning have been tested. We suggest that through a shift in the scale of species knowledge, from stand to clonal individual level, we can achieve a better understanding of Q. pyrenaica dynamics for the purpose of applying more effective silvicultural methods. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of individual stool (clonal clump) characteristics influencing stem growth. We performed genetic analyses to assess clonal membership in a one-hectare plot, and 145 stems belonging to 15 different stools were sampled to model individual stem section growth, considering both stem and clonal stool variables. Principal component and cluster analyses were performed to analyze variability among stools. Results revealed that initial stem diameter explained most of the variability in stem growth (R-adj(2) = 0.61). However, the inclusion of clonal stool variables and clonal membership as a qualitative variable improved every modeling performance criterion, reducing mean square error 11% and 25%, respectively. Stems belonging to large biomass stools (determined by large spatial extent, high number of stems within stool, and a high value of a stump root biomass indicator) had lower growth potential than those belonging to small biomass stools. Based on these results, we suggest that root aging (enlarged root biomass) leads to a root/shoot imbalance increase, which consumes, through root respiration, a great proportion of the resources supplied by photosynthesis, thus limiting stem growth. This work attempts to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary perspectives to successfully face management challenges in these forests. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of adding sulphur doses (0, 20, 50, 80, and 120 mg dm(-3) of S), as calcium sulphate, and the incubation time (1, 8, 15, 30, 60, and 90 d) on the equilibrium between labile and non-labile sulphur reserves, in 10 soils. An anion exchange resin membrane was used to determine labile sulphur. A shaking period of 48 h (of water, soil and resin mixture) extracted a greater part of labile sulphur, which was termed quickly-labile sulphur (QLS). The slowly-labile sulphur plus the non-labile sulphur (SLS+NLS) were determined by the difference between the soil sulphur by calcination and the SRL. The soil resistance against passing the SRL reserve to SLL+SNL was named labile sulphur buffering capacity (LSBC), computed by the inverse angular coefficient of the linear equations between SRL and SLL+SNL contents. In general, it was observed that incubation time (reactivity) and S doses, in the form of calcium sulphate, affect the sulphur dynamics between QLS reserves and SLS+NLS. The LSBC is sensitive to changes in the balance between sulfur reserves in the soil. The increase in LSBC in the soil was mainly related to the maximum adsorption capacity of sulphate (MACS), and contents of organic carbon, goethite and gibbsite in the clay fraction of the soils.","[Pereira Uchoa, Sandra Catia] Univ Fed Roraima UFRR, Dept Solos Engn Agr, BR-69314080 Boa Vista, PR, Brazil; [Alvarez V, Victor Hugo] UFV Bolsista CNPq, Dept Solos, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Freire, Francisco Morel] EPAMIG CPACD, BR-35700007 Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil","Uchoa, SCP (reprint author), Univ Fed Roraima UFRR, Dept Solos Engn Agr, Rodovia BR 174,Campus Cauame, BR-69314080 Boa Vista, PR, Brazil.",scpuchoa@dsi.uffr.br; vhav@ufv.br; freire@embrapa.br,,"Uchoa, Sandra/0000-0003-4224-070X",,,,39,1,1,0,7,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

For this purpose, a Taylor dispersion test in a capillary tube has been performed while suspended magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are subjected to both magnetic field and low Re shear flow field. Axial dispersion has been quantified from residence time distributions (RTDs) and tracer injection tests conducted in three distinct situations where the capillary is subjected to (a) uniform transverse rotating magnetic field ((RMF)-R-T), (b) uniform transverse oscillating magnetic field ((OMF)-O-T), and (c) uniform axial static magnetic field ((SMF)-S-A). The various types of magnetic fields have been generated in a specially designed stator energized by three phase, AC and DC currents. Results obtained from the three cases are reported in terms of axial dispersion coefficients. For (RMF)-R-T, an increase in lateral mixing is observed whereas no significant effect is detected for (OME)-O-T In (SMF)-S-A, the lateral mixing mechanism is retarded by magnetically locked MNPs. Both effects under (RMF)-R-T and (SMF)-S-A reach a plateau as MNP concentration in the liquid is increased. These findings highlight the effect of rotational viscosity on diffusion of other species hosted in dilute ferrofluids and point to attractive applications to engineering fields where transport phenomena are central. Analysis of RTD breakthrough times enabled laminar velocity profile in capillary flow to be reconstructed. It suggests that (magnetic field-free) parabolic velocity profiles evolve towards flattened and protruded shapes, respectively, in (RMF)-R-T and (SMF)-S-A. These results confirm that magnetically-excited MNPs may be considered as a potentially appealing tool to mediate molecular transport phenomena at the nanoscale such as in nano/microfluidic systems.

However, few studies have examined the potential importance of the direct foliar uptake of gaseous reactive N on foliar delta N-15. Using an experimental set-up in which the rate of mycorrhizal infection was reduced using a fungicide, we examined the influence of mycorrhizae on foliar delta N-15 in potted red maple (Acer rubrum) seedlings along a regional N deposition gradient in New York State. Mycorrhizal associations altered foliar delta N-15 values in red maple seedlings from 0.06 to 0.74 aEuro degrees across sites. At the same sites, we explored the predictive roles of direct foliar N uptake, soil delta N-15, and mycorrhizae on foliar delta N-15 in adult stands of A. rubrum, American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black birch (Betula lenta), and red oak (Quercus rubra). Multiple regression analysis indicated that ambient atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration explained 0, 69, 23, and 45 % of the variation in foliar delta N-15 in American beech, red maple, red oak, and black birch, respectively, after accounting for the influence of soil delta N-15. There was no correlation between foliar delta C-13 and foliar %N with increasing atmospheric NO2 concentration in most species. Our findings suggest that total canopy uptake, and likely direct foliar N uptake, of pollution-derived atmospheric N deposition may significantly impact foliar delta N-15 in several dominant species occurring in temperate forest ecosystems.","[Vallano, Dena M.; Sparks, Jed P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Vallano, DM (reprint author), Amer Assoc Advancement Sci, 1200 New York Ave Northwest, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",dena.vallano@gmail.com,,,Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship; Cornell NSF-IGERT in Biogeochemistry and Environmental Biocomplexity [DGE 0221658],"This research was funded by a Kieckhefer Adirondack Fellowship and by the Cornell NSF-IGERT in Biogeochemistry and Environmental Biocomplexity, Award #DGE 0221658 to D.

Five wild boar were monitored within a 125ha fenced area using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and behavioral monitoring over a 12-month period. Their activity budget, the relationship between foraging behavior and vegetation communities, and how these relationships vary between seasons was investigated. The results indicate that wild boar invested approximately four more hours daily to rooting during the autumn and winter than the spring and summer. During the spring and summer, grazing was the dominant foraging behavior (approximately 28% of foraging period) while rooting dominated in autumn and winter (approximately 76% of foraging period). Deep rooting behavior is particularly associated with bracken-dominated communities. Associations between rooting, vegetation community, and season will have a strong influence on the spatial and temporal distribution of rooting behavior. This variation could have important implications for the impacts of boar on vegetation community dynamics. These results detail some of wild boar's ecosystem engineering behaviors; however, further research is required to consider the wider impacts of a full reintroduction.","[Sandom, Christopher J.; Hughes, Joelene; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Sandom, Christopher J.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Sandom, CJ (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",chris.sandom@biology.au.dk,,"Sandom, Christopher/0000-0003-2294-1648",European Nature Trust,"We are grateful for financial support provided by the European Nature Trust, logistical support provided by the staff at the Alladale Wilderness Reserve and the comments of two anonymous reviewers.",,49,23,24,5,162,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Osmorhiza depauperata, a geophyte, acclimates to changes imposed because of forest openings. We studied which changes in biomass allocation allow acclimation of O. depauperata to the various environments that this species inhabits, and where it develops better. Three light intensities (I4 = 4 %, I26 = 26 %, I64 = 64 % of ambient sunlight) and two moisture levels (M40 = 40-60 %, M80 = 80-100 % field capacity) were evaluated on O. depauperata under greenhouse conditions. Plant biomasses per pot were 0.81, 0.56 and 0.48 g at I26, I4 and I64 light intensities, respectively, after one growing season. The biomass allocation to aboveground tissues and leaf area decreased as light intensity increased. Soil moisture modified only belowground biomass and weight of fine roots. The interaction between soil moisture content and light intensity was consistent. This was because of a significant reduction in total plant biomass under high both soil moisture content and high light intensity. Osmorhiza depauperata growth was favored most at medium light intensities. Changes in biomass allocation among various organs allow this species to inhabit forest habitats with different light intensities.","[Javier Selzer, Luciano; Vanessa Lencinas, Maria; Jose Martinez-Pastur, Guillermo] Ctr Austral Invest Cient CONICET, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina; [Alberto Busso, Carlos] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Alberto Busso, Carlos] Univ Nacl Sur, CERZOS CONICET, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Busso, CA (reprint author), Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",cebusso@criba.edu.ar,"Pastur, Guillermo Martinez/H-8480-2019; Lencinas, Maria/K-6208-2019","Pastur, Guillermo Martinez/0000-0003-2614-5403; Lencinas, Maria/0000-0002-2123-3976",,,,91,4,8,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We tested whether local adaptation in mycorrhizal symbioses would shape the community structure of these root symbionts in a way that maximizes their symbiotic functioning. We grew a native prairie grass (Andropogon gerardii) with all possible combinations of soils and AM fungal inocula from three different prairies that varied in soil characteristics and disturbance history (two native prairie remnants and one recently restored). We identified the AM fungi colonizing A.gerardii roots using PCR amplification and cloning of the small subunit rRNA gene. We observed 13 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to six genera in three families. Taxonomic richness was higher in the restored than the native prairies with one member of the Gigaspora dominating the roots of plants grown with inocula from native prairies. Inoculum source and the soil environment influenced the composition of AM fungi that colonized plant roots. Correspondingly, host plants and AM fungi responded significantly to the soilinoculum combinations such that home fungi often had the highest fitness and provided the greatest benefit to A.gerardii. Similar patterns were observed within the soilinoculum combinations originating from two native prairies, where five sequence types of a single Gigaspora OTU were virtually the only root colonizers. Our results indicate that indigenous assemblages of AM fungi were adapted to the local soil environment and that this process occurred both at a community scale and at the scale of fungal sequence types within a dominant OTU.","[Ji, Baoming; Gehring, Catherine A.; Flores-Renteria, Lluvia; Johnson, Nancy Collins] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Miller, R.

This study investigated the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus mosseae and Glomus constrictum) and water stress on the growth and physiological performance of S. davidii seedlings under greenhouse pot conditions. Two soil water availability treatments (well-watered (WW) -0.10 MPa; water-stressed (WS) -0.86 MPa) were applied for 61 days. At the end of this experiment, G. mosseae and G. constrictum had colonized the roots of S. davidii seedlings. Water stress inhibited AM colonization, plant growth, chlorophyll concentration, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of S. davidii seedlings. Mycorrhizal seedlings had greater shoot dry weight, root dry weight, plant height, root length, instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), lower intercellular CO2 concentration and photochemical quenching values (qP), when compared with non-mycorrhizal seedlings under both WW and WS conditions. Furthermore, G. constrictum was found to be more efficient at improving the shoot and root mass, plant height, iWUE, Pn, g(s), qP, and I broken vertical bar PSII of S. davidii seedlings, when compared with G. mosseae under both WW and WS conditions. Our results demonstrate that AM Glomus symbiosis enhanced S. davidii seedling resistance by improving its growth and physiological performance under water stress conditions. This suggests that Glomus inoculation is a potential tool for enhancing outplanting performance of S. davidii in semiarid areas of China.","[Gong, Minggui; Tang, Ming; Chen, Hui; Zhang, Qiaoming; Feng, Xinxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gong, Minggui] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Food & Bioengn, Luoyang 471003, Henan, Peoples R China","Tang, M (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tangm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30730073, 31170567]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the University of ChinaProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT1035]; Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20100204110033, 20110204130001]","This study was funded by the Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30730073, 31170567), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the University of China (IRT1035) and the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20100204110033, 20110204130001).

The objectives of this study were to understand and quantify the sources of error in the assessment of fine root biomass (< 2 mm) during the second year of a high-density Populus plantation. Soil cores were collected in winter (n = 35) and in summer (n = 20), and fine roots were picked by hand for varying lengths of time: 1, 2, 5, 20, 40, and 60 min. The root biomass data were used to identify the best combination of the time spent for root picking and the number of samples collected, that minimizes the overall uncertainty (i.e. the combination of the spatial error due to the incomplete sampling and the temporal error due to the incomplete core processing). On average, 25 min was enough time to pick 90 % of the fine root biomass in winter, while in summer only 10 min were needed. In winter fewer samples were needed, but more time for picking was necessary as compared to summer when root biomass was higher. Fine root sampling can be optimized by minimizing the uncertainty of the biomass estimates and simultaneously decreasing root sampling time investment.","[Berhongaray, G.; Janssens, I.

Understanding these effects is a major challenge since it is inherently difficult to measure and manipulate highly diverse soil communities. Mathematical models may advance this understanding by making the interplay of the various processes affecting plant-soil interaction explicit and by quantifying the relative importance of the factors involved. The aim of this paper is to provide a complete analysis of a pioneering plant-soil feedback model developed by Bever and colleagues (J Ecol 85: 561-573, 1997; Ecol Lett 2: 52-62, 1999; New Phytol 157: 465-473, 2003) to fully understand the range of possible impacts of plant-soil feedbacks on plant communities within this framework. We analyze this model by means of a new graphical method that provides a complete classification of the potential effects of soil communities on plant competition. Due to the graphical character of the method, the results are relatively easy to obtain and understand. We show that plant diversity depends crucially on two key parameters that may be viewed as measures of the intensity of plant competition and the direction and strength of plant-soil feedback, respectively. Our analysis provides a formal underpinning of earlier claims that plant-soil feedbacks, especially when they are negative, may enhance the diversity of plant communities. In particular, negative plant-soil feedbacks can enhance the range of plant coexistence by inducing competitive oscillations. However, these oscillations can also destabilize plant coexistence, leading to low population densities and extinctions. In addition, positive feedbacks can allow locally stable forms of plant coexistence by inducing alternative stable states. Our findings highlight that the inclusion of plant-soil interactions may fundamentally alter the predictions on the structure and functioning of above-ground ecosystems. The scenarios presented in this study can be used to formulate hypotheses about the ways soil community effects may influence plant competition that can be tested with empirical studies. This will advance our understanding of the role of plant-soil feedback in ecological communities.","[Revilla, Tomas A.; Weissing, Franz J.] Univ Groningen, Theoret Biol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Revilla, Tomas A.] CNRS Moulis, Stn Ecol Expt, USR 2936, F-09200 Moulis, St Girons, France; [Veen, G.

The concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb in roots were higher than in shoots, suggesting that roots are the primary accumulation organs for these metals and there exists an exclusion strategy for metal tolerance. In contrast, the rest of the metals showed an opposite trend, suggesting that they were not restricted in roots. Harvesting would particularly be an effective method to remove Mn from the environment. The concentrations of metals in shoots were generally higher in autumn than in summer, suggesting that Ph. australis possesses an efficient root-to-shoot translocation system, which is activated at the end of the growing season and allows more metals into the senescent tissues. Furthermore, metal bioaccumulation of Ph. australis was affected by vegetative periodic variation through the changing of physicochemical and microbial conditions. The rhizospheric microbial characteristics were significantly related to the concentrations of Mg, K, Zn, Fe and Cu, suggesting that microbial influence on metal accumulation is specific and selective, not eurytopic.","[Wu, Jieting; Wang, Li; Ma, Fang; Yang, Jixian; Li, Shiyang; Li, Zhe] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China","Wang, L (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China.",wanglihit@hotmail.com; mafang@hit.edu.cn,,"Wang, Li/0000-0003-0661-9149","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51179041]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2012ZX07201003]; National Creative Research Group from the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51121062]; State Key Lab of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, China (HIT) [2011TS07]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51179041), the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2012ZX07201003), the National Creative Research Group from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51121062), and the State Key Lab of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, China (HIT) (2011TS07).",,75,12,16,3,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,MAY,2013,22,4,,,,,608,618,,10.1007/s10646-013-1052-2,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,131FI,WOS:000317977600002,23455898,,,,10/31/19J,"Imada, S; Taniguchi, T; Acharya, K; Yamanaka, N",,,,"Imada, S.; Taniguchi, T.; Acharya, K.; Yamanaka, N.",,,Vertical distribution of fine roots of Tamarix ramosissima in an arid region of southern Nevada,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dry season; Invasive plant; Root morphology; Soil nitrogen; Tamarix,LOWER COLORADO RIVER; WATER-USE; RIPARIAN PLANTS; HYDRAULIC LIFT; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN; GROWTH; PATTERNS; SHRUBS; TOLERANCE,"To increase our understanding of soil water and nitrogen use strategies of invasive Tamarix ramosissima during dry seasons, the vertical distributions of fine roots and their associations with soil properties were examined in the Virgin River floodplain, southern Nevada, United States. We measured morphological traits of fine roots, such as fine-root mass density, fine-root length density, specific root length and specific root area at 10 cm increments to a depth of 2 m. Soil properties were analyzed at 20 cm increments. More than 60% of fine root length and biomass was concentrated at depths between 20 and 60 cm. Soil nitrogen (N) concentration had strong and positive relationships with fine-root mass and length densities, suggesting that the fine-root distribution may be influenced by soil N availability. A weak but positive relationship was observed between soil moisture and fine-root mass density. Soil salinity had no relationship with root morphological traits. These findings suggest that T. ramosissima fine roots may contribute to N uptake from the upper soil layers during dry seasons. This might be an important advantage over native riparian tree species in arid riparian areas of the southwestern United States. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

(Asteraceae) is a taxonomically and cytologically complex genus due to its high morphological and karyological variation. To gather consistent cytological information aiming to consolidate the existing knowledge, sustain the taxonomic revision of the genus and explore the evolutionary relationships among species, the genome size and chromosome number of the Iberian Peninsula representatives of this genus were assessed. The study included 11 taxa that occur in the Iberian Peninsula, one in Madeira and two from Morocco. Chromosome counts were made using the squash technique in root tips and flower buds, while nuclear DNA contents were assessed using propidium iodide flow cytometry. The following chromosome numbers are reported: 2n = 44 for C. arvensis, 2n = 30 for C. tripterocarpa, and 2n = 32 for the remaining Iberian taxa. The genome size of Calendula species was assessed for the first time and ranged from 1.75 pg/2C in C. maroccana to 5.41 pg/2C in C. arvensis. Within the complex formed by C. incana and C. suffruticosa, a gradient of genome size values was obtained. Intraspecific variation in genome size was detected in some taxa. The obtained genome size values and their variation are discussed in the light of the theories proposed for the speciation of the genus, with events of hybridization, genome duplication and dysploidy being hypothesized to play a major role in the evolution of this genus.","[Nora, Sofia] Univ Seville, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Fac Pharm, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Castro, Silvia; Loureiro, Joao; Castro, Mariana] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, CFE, P-3001455 Coimbra, Portugal; [Goncalves, Ana Carla; Oliveira, Helena; Santos, Conceicao; Silveira, Paulo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Goncalves, Ana Carla; Oliveira, Helena; Santos, Conceicao; Silveira, Paulo] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Silveira, P (reprint author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",psilveira@ua.pt,"Silveira, Paulo/G-9572-2011; Santos, Conceicao/A-8651-2008; Castro, Silvia/C-2469-2008; Loureiro, Joao/B-4830-2008; Oliveira, Helena/M-5068-2013","Silveira, Paulo/0000-0002-9253-5381; Santos, Conceicao/0000-0003-4129-6381; Castro, Silvia/0000-0002-7358-6685; Loureiro, Joao/0000-0002-9068-3954; Oliveira, Helena/0000-0002-4673-0696; Goncalves, Ana/0000-0002-8085-1336; Castro, Mariana/0000-0001-7603-6876; Nora, Sofia/0000-0001-6013-4009",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [FCT/BPD/41200/2007];  [SFRH/BPD/48853/2008];  [SFRH/BD/51464/2011],"The authors are grateful to the ICNF (Instituto de Conservacao da Natureza e das Florestas), namely Dr Luis Silva (UACI) and the Directors of several Departments (Departamento de Gestao de Areas Classificadas-Zonas Humidas, Departamento de Gestao de Areas Classificadas do Litoral de Lisboa e Oeste, Departamento de Gestao de Areas Classificadas Sul) for allowing the collection of samples on several nature reserves; to Miguel Sequeira, from the Biology Department of the University of Madeira, for providing Calendula incana ssp. maderensis material; to Abelardo Aparicio for methodological help in the chromosome counts.

However, widespread use of models is limited by the technical challenges of model-data synthesis and information management. To address these challenges, we present an ecoinformatic workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), which facilitates model analysis. Herein we describe the PEcAn modules that synthesize plant trait data to estimate model parameters, propagate parameter uncertainties through to model output, and evaluate the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty. We illustrate a comprehensive approach to the estimation of parameter values, starting with a statement of prior knowledge that is refined by species-level data using Bayesian meta-analysis; this is the first use of a rigorous meta-analysis to inform the parameters of a mechanistic ecosystem model. Parameter uncertainty is propagated using ensemble methods to estimate model uncertainty. Variance decomposition allows us to quantify the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty; this information can be used to prioritize subsequent data collection. By streamlining the use of models and focusing efforts to identify and constrain the dominant sources of uncertainty in model output, the approach used by PEcAn can speed scientific progress. We demonstrate PEcAn's ability to incorporate data to reduce uncertainty in productivity of a perennial grass monoculture (Panicum virgatum L.) modeled by the Ecosystem Demography model. Prior estimates were specified for 15 model parameters, and species-level data were available for seven of these. Meta-analysis of species-level data substantially reduced the contribution of three parameters (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate, and stomatal slope) to overall model uncertainty. By contrast, root turnover rate, root respiration rate, and leaf width had little effect on model output; therefore trait data had little impact on model uncertainty. For fine-root allocation, the decrease in parameter uncertainty was offset by an increase in model sensitivity. Remaining model uncertainty is driven by growth respiration, fine-root allocation, leaf turnover rater, and specific leaf area. By establishing robust channels of feedback between data collection and ecosystem modeling, PEcAn provides a framework for more efficient and integrative science.","[Lebauer, David S.; Wang, Dan; Dietze, Michael C.] Univ Illinois, Energy Biosci Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Richter, Katherine T.; Davidson, Carl C.; Dietze, Michael C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Lebauer, DS (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Energy Biosci Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",dlebauer@illinois.edu,"LeBauer, David/N-2735-2013; Dietze, Michael/A-5834-2009","LeBauer, David/0000-0001-7228-053X; Dietze, Michael/0000-0002-2324-2518",Energy Biosciences Institute; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1062547],Funding for this research was provided by the Energy Biosciences Institute and an NSF Advances in Bioinformatics grant # 1062547 to M.

Root longevity was assessed by survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Root longevity was correlated positively with root diameter. A 17.5 % decrease in the risk of mortality was associated with a 0.1-mm increase in diameter. Roots distributed in the top 10 cm of the soil had significantly shorter longevities than roots at greater depths, with a 48 % decrease of mortality risk for each 10-cm increase in soil depth from the surface to 40 cm. Of all the factors examined, the season of root emergence had the strongest effect on root lifespan. Roots that emerged in May and June had shorter longevity than roots that emerged later in the year, and roots that emerged in September and October were more likely to survive over winter. Our findings indicated that life-history traits of roots in K. humilis meadows are highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity should be considered when modeling the contribution of roots to carbon and nitrogen fluxes in this type of meadow ecosystem. Moreover, temporal, spatial, and compositional variations in root longevity must be considered.","[Wu, Yibo] Ningbo Univ, Coll Architectural Civil Engn & Environm, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yibo; Deng, Yongcui; Zhang, Jing; Wu, Jing; Cui, Xiaoyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yanhong] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan; [Cao, Guangmin; Zhang, Fawei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Plateau Inst Biol, Xining 810001, Peoples R China","Cui, XY (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",cuixy@ucas.ac.cn,"Cui, Xiaoyong/B-3669-2016; Tang, Yanhong/B-1699-2010","Cui, Xiaoyong/0000-0001-7592-5866; Tang, Yanhong/0000-0001-7207-1965","Natural Science Foundation of China, Zhejiang ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [41071174, 31200367, LQ12C03001]; Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department [Y201121042]; K.

Focused on the root systems of an oak-dominated temperate forest in Japan, we used 454 pyrosequencing to explore how phylogenetically diverse fungi constitute an ecological community of multiple ecotypes. In total, 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of fungi were found from 159 terminal-root samples from 12 plant species occurring in the forest. Due to the dominance of an oak species (Quercus serrata), diverse ectomycorrhizal clades such as Russula, Lactarius, Cortinarius, Tomentella, Amanita, Boletus, and Cenococcum were observed. Unexpectedly, the root-associated fungal community was dominated by root-endophytic ascomycetes in Helotiales, Chaetothyriales, and Rhytismatales. Overall, 55.3% of root samples were colonized by both the commonly observed ascomycetes and ectomycorrhizal fungi; 75.0% of the root samples of the dominant Q. serrata were so cocolonized. Overall, this study revealed that root-associated fungal communities of oak-dominated temperate forests were dominated not only by ectomycorrhizal fungi but also by diverse root endophytes and that potential ecological interactions between the two ecotypes may be important to understand the complex assembly processes of belowground fungal communities.","[Toju, Hirokazu; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Sato, Hirotoshi; Tanabe, Akifumi S.; Kadowaki, Kohmei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Toju, Hirokazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Tanabe, Akifumi S.] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan; [Gilbert, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Toju, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",toju.hirokazu.4c@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Toju, Hirokazu/S-7307-2017; Kadowaki, Kohmei/K-8117-2019; Sato, Hirotoshi/A-2429-2015; Tanabe, Akifumi/P-9381-2015","Toju, Hirokazu/0000-0002-3362-3285; Kadowaki, Kohmei/0000-0003-0512-1621; Tanabe, Akifumi/0000-0003-1017-6504","Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, the Japanese government [GS014]","This study was supported by the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, the Japanese government (to H.

Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in comparison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta-analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life-history traits of vascular plants. We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life-history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species. Intraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural populations. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of population origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental drivers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal. Synthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set-up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life-history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and confounding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, integrated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.","[De Frenne, Pieter; De Schrijver, An; Gruwez, Robert; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, BE-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium; [De Frenne, Pieter; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Francisco; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Graae, Bente J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Kolb, Annette; Diekmann, Martin] Univ Bremen, FB2, Inst Ecol, DE-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Chabrerie, Olivier; Decocq, Guillaume; Lenoir, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, EDYSAN, FRE CNRS 3498, FR-80037 Amiens, France; [De Kort, Hanne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Eriksson, Ove] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Plue, Jan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","De Frenne, P (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, BE-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium.",pieter.defrenne@ugent.be,"Diekmann, Martin/L-8854-2019; De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Francisco/A-9307-2008","De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Francisco/0000-0002-7981-1599; Kolb, Annette/0000-0002-8275-1814",FWOFWO; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [275094]; Ghent University (BOF)Ghent University; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)FWO,"We thank the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) for funding the scientific research network FLEUR (http://www.fleur.ugent.be) that made this review possible; WCS and CIESIN (http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu) for the human influence index data; Niels Batjes for the soil pH data; Gorik Verstraeten, Anna Orczewska, Frank Gilliam, Mike Hutchings and two anonymous referees for comments on the manuscript.

Here we report how an 11-week drought affected tracheid structure, gene expression, and above- and belowground growth in 5-year-old Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) under controlled conditions. The canopy of trees subjected to severe drought had significantly less current-year needle biomass, and fewer tracheids and tracheid rows in current-year shoots compared to fully watered control trees. Belowground tissues were more strongly affected by drought than aboveground tissues. In fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) severe drought significantly reduced root biomass, root diameter, root length density and root surface area per soil volume compared to the control. Tracheid diameter and hydraulic conductivity in fine roots were significantly lower and tracheid flatness higher in trees subjected to severe drought than in control trees, both for long and short roots. Transcripts of the drought-related dehydrins PaDhn1 and PaDhn6 were strongly upregulated in stem bark and current-year needles in response to drought, whereas PaDhn4.5 was down-regulated. This study demonstrates that drought reduces biomass and hydraulic conductivity in fine roots and needles. We suggest that the ratio between PaDhn6 and PaDhn4.5 may be a sensitive marker of drought stress in Norway spruce.","[Eldhuset, Toril Drablos; Nagy, Nina Elisabeth; Borja, Isabella; Yakovlev, Igor A.; Krokene, Paal] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, N-1431 As, Norway; [Volarik, Daniel; Gebauer, Roman] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocoenol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Krokene, P (reprint author), Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, POB 115, N-1431 As, Norway.",krp@skogoglandskap.no,"Borja, Isabella/A-8496-2010; Gebauer, R/C-4906-2014; Volarik, Daniel/E-5891-2014; Krokene, Paal/A-1835-2008","Borja, Isabella/0000-0002-3740-9948; Volarik, Daniel/0000-0002-3682-2992; Krokene, Paal/0000-0002-7205-0715; Gebauer, Roman/0000-0001-5661-7585; Yakovlev, Igor/0000-0002-2731-7433","Czech Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [6215648902]; EEA Financial Mechanism; Norwegian Financial Mechanism [A/CZ0046/2/0009]; Mendel University in Brno [IGA 12/2010]; Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute","We thank A.

When multiple stressors co-occur, their combined impact on plant growth is often greater than expected based on single-factor studies (i.e., synergistic), potentially causing catastrophic dysfunction of physiological processes from an otherwise recoverable situation. Drought and herbivory are two stressors that commonly co-occur in forested ecosystems, and have the potential to 'overlap' in their impacts on various plant traits and processes. However, the combined impacts from these two stressors may not be predictable based on additive models from single-stressor studies. Moreover, the impacts and subsequent recovery may be strongly influenced by the relative intensities of each stressor. Here, we applied drought stress and simulated bark-feeding herbivory at three levels of intensity (control, moderate and severe) in a full factorial design on young Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings. We assessed if the combined effects from two stressors were additive (responses were equal to the sum of the single-factor effects), synergistic (greater than expected) or antagonistic (less than expected) on a suite of morphological and physiological traits at the leaf-, tissue- and whole-plant level. We additionally investigated whether recovery from herbivory was dependent on relief from drought. The two stressors had synergistic impacts on specific leaf area and water-use efficiency, additive effects on height and root-to-shoot ratios, but antagonistic effects on photosynthesis, conductance and, most notably, on root, shoot and whole-plant biomass. Nevertheless, the magnitude and direction of the combined impacts were often dependent on the relative intensities of each stressor, leading to many additive or synergistic responses from specific stressor combinations. Also, seedling recovery was far more dependent on the previous year's drought compared with the previous year's herbivory, demonstrating the influence of one stressor over another during recovery. Our study reveals for the first time, the importance of not only the presence or absence of drought and herbivory stressors, but also shows that their relative intensities are critical in determining the direction and magnitude of their impacts on establishing seedlings.","[Bansal, Sheel; Hallsby, Goran; Lofvenius, Mikael O.; Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Bansal, S (reprint author), USDA ARS, Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, Burns, OR 97720 USA.",sheelbansal9@gmail.com,"Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017","Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; Bansal, Sheel/0000-0003-1233-1707",Anna och Nils Hakanssons Stiftelse; SLU,This work was supported by a grant from Anna och Nils Hakanssons Stiftelse and an SLU grant to M.-C.N.,,63,31,31,0,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2013,33,5,,,,,451,463,,10.1093/treephys/tpt019,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,150ZR,WOS:000319430900002,23525156,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Maire, V; Soussana, JF; Gross, N; Bachelet, B; Pages, L; Martin, R; Reinhold, T; Wirth, C; Hill, D",,,,"Maire, Vincent; Soussana, Jean-Francois; Gross, Nicolas; Bachelet, Bruno; Pages, Loic; Martin, Raphael; Reinhold, Tanja; Wirth, Christian; Hill, David",,,Plasticity of plant form and function sustains productivity and dominance along environment and competition gradients.

For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The GEMINI model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance.

LIEBL.; EUROPEAN BEECH; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; CONTRASTING SITES; SOUTHERN SWEDEN; DECIDUOUS TREES; FLOOD-TOLERANT; SESSILE OAK; CLIMATE; DROUGHT,"Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate-growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate-growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.","[Scharnweber, Tobias; Manthey, Michael; Wilmking, Martin] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany","Scharnweber, T (reprint author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Grimmer Str 88, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.",tobias.scharnweber@uni-greifswald.de,"Manthey, Michael/L-2586-2019","Scharnweber, Tobias/0000-0002-4933-5296","'Exzellenzforder-programm' of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [UG 08-035]; Helmholtz AssociationHelmholtz Association","T.S. received financial support from the 'Exzellenzforder-programm' of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (UG 08-035) and from the Helmholtz Association.

The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of 111 isolates from nodules of L. uliginosus collected from four fields with or without prior inoculation history were analyzed in this study. Genetic diversity estimated by ERIC-PCR revealed 75 different genomic fingerprints, and showed a relatively greater value compared with other methods and varied by soil type. 16S ribosomal RNA gene RFLP analysis revealed three different ribogroups, A, B and C, with 71 isolates in ribogroup A, three isolates in ribogroup B and only one in ribogroup C. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S RNA gene sequences, ITS, as well as atpD, recA and glnII gene sequences indicated that ribogroup A strains were affiliated with B. japonicum by. genistearum strains. The three isolates in ribogroup B did not clearly associate with any Bradyrhizobium species described previously and could represent a novel species within this genus. Unlike B. japonicum strains these isolates were able to nodulate and fix nitrogen with other Lotus species as well as with Spartium, a leguminous shrub. The unique isolate in ribogroup C clustered with Mesorhizobium and appeared genetically and phenotypically related to broad host-range Mesorhizobium sp. NZP2037. Our data suggest that Uruguayan soils contain native or naturalized bradyrhizobia that are able to nodulate L uliginosus as efficiently as the commercial strain NZP2309 but could have adaptive advantages making them more suitable for inoculant purposes.

Deep soil moisture is responsible for evergreen forest transpiration during this season. This study provides preliminary information on soil physicochemical properties in a large soil profile (800 cm deep) and evaluated the influences of deep-soil moisture dynamics on the transpiration of evergreen forests in Cambodia using a water flow model. In general, changes in soil physicochemical properties with depth were small, excluding topsoil. The soil texture in the large soil profile was characterized by very little gravel and a large sand fraction. The soil carbon stock was 71.7 and 130.1 Mg C ha(-1) at depths of 0-150 and 0-800 cm, respectively. The coarse pore volume (-100 <=Psi< - 0.2 cm) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) clearly decreased with depth from 100 to 600 cm and were extremely low at 600-700 cm. In the water flow simulation, a rooting depth deeper than 400 cm was necessary for the evergreen forest to maintain transpiration during the dry season. On the other hand, when the K-s of deep soil (550-750 cm depth) was assumed to be higher than that estimated by the cylinder sample, a rooting depth of 800 cm was necessary, since most of the soil water that was replenished during the rainy season was rapidly lost during the dry season. Also, it was necessary for evergreen forests to effectively use soil water within the deep root zone (400-800 cm depth).

The effects of sediment anoxia on growth and root respiratory metabolism of Iris pseudacorus were investigated using modified rhizobox systems with sediment anoxia simulated through sucrose/agar addition into sediment. The anoxia levels simulated included control (without sucrose addition), moderate anoxia (MA, 0.5% sucrose addition) and high anoxia (HA, 1.0% sucrose addition). The results indicated that the total biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), number and mean length of leaves and tiller number did not differ between the three anoxia levels (p > 0.05). However, the redox condition of sediment significantly affected the biomass allocation, root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) was 18.9% and 50.3% higher in the MA and HA treatments, and the roots were denser and shorter in anoxic conditions than in controls. There were no significant differences in physicochemical properties (redox potential and pH) between rhizospheric and non-vegetated sediment (p > 0.05). The present study indicated that L pseudacorus has a strong resistance to sediment anoxia through increasing root production and anaerobic respiration, which enables it to be an appropriate pioneer species in vegetation restoration engineering.

Three rain shelters were constructed in the stand to prevent the rainfall from reaching the soil and to reduce water availability in the rhizosphere. Fine root biomass and necromass were repeatedly measured throughout a growing season by soil coring. We established the quantities of fine root biomass (live) and necromass (dead) at soil depths of 05, 515, 1525 and 2535cm. Significant differences in soil moisture contents between control and drought plots were found in the top 15cm of soil after 20weeks of rainfall manipulation (lasting from early June to late October). Our observations show that even relatively light drought decreased total fine root biomass from 272.0 to 242.8gm2 and increased the amount of necromass from 79.2 to 101.2gm2 in the top 35cm of soil. Very fine roots (VFR), that is, those with diameter up to 1mm, were more affected than total fine roots defined as 02mm. The effect of reduced water availability was depth-specific; as a result, we observed a modification of vertical distribution of fine roots. More roots in drought treatment were produced in the wetter soil horizons at 2535cm depth than at the surface. We conclude that fine and VFR systems of Norway spruce have the capacity to re-allocate resources to roots at different depths in response to environmental signals, resulting in changes in necromass to biomass ratio.","[Konopka, B.] Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Konopka, B.] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lukac, M.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","Konopka, B (reprint author), Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Zvolen, Slovakia.",m.lukac@reading.ac.uk,"Lukac, Martin/A-4379-2013","Lukac, Martin/0000-0002-8535-6334","Slovak Research and Development Agency (Bratislava)Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0268-10, APVV-0111-10]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [QH81136]",The work was supported from the Slovak Research and Development Agency (Bratislava) specifically through the projects APVV-0268-10 and APVV-0111-10 as well as a grant of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic number QH81136.

Interactions (i) between plants and insect herbivores and (ii) between plants and mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems and may be linked via common host plants. Previous studies suggest that colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can modify plants induced responses to herbivore attack, but these indirect effects of fungal symbionts are poorly understood. I investigated the role of AMF in induced plant response to a generalist herbivore. I manipulated AMF status and herbivory in Cucumis sativus L. (cucumber, Cucurbitaceae) in a greenhouse to investigate induced responses in the presence and absence of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices (Glomeraceae). Spodoptera exigua Hbner (Noctuidae) were used to manipulate prior damage and later as assay caterpillars. I also measured G. intraradices and herbivory effects on plant N and effects on plant growth. AMF status affected the induced response of C. sativus, underscoring the importance of incorporating the roles of plant symbionts into plant defense theory. Assay caterpillars ate significantly more leaf tissue only on mycorrhizal plants that had experienced prior damage. Despite more consumption, biomass change in these caterpillars did not differ from those feeding on plants with other treatment combinations. Leaf N content was reduced by G. intraradices but unaffected by herbivory treatments, suggesting that the observed differences in assay caterpillar feeding were due to changes in defensive chemistry that depended on AMF.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA","Barber, NA (reprint author), No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",nbarber@niu.edu,"Barber, Nichlas A./N-1437-2014","Barber, Nichlas A./0000-0003-1653-0009","U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2008-02346]; Northern Illinois University Department of Biological Sciences; Northern Illinois University Institute for the Study of the Environment, Sustainability, and Energy","U.S. Department of Agriculture (NRI 2008-02346); Northern Illinois University Department of Biological Sciences; the Northern Illinois University Institute for the Study of the Environment, Sustainability, and Energy.",,42,11,15,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

The temperature-response curve of R-r differed from that of R-d. The dynamic variation of R-d was more related to the change of soil temperature as compared to R-r.

We applied (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling at three different times throughout the vegetation period: spring (April), early summer (June), and early autumn (October). Soil redox potentials (Eh) at 10 cm depth ranged from moderately reduced (October) to oxidized conditions (June). Based on combined PLFA relative abundance and C-13 enrichment results, we suggest that gram-negative bacteria play a main role in rhizodeposit-C uptake in these wetland ecosystems, especially when reduced soil conditions prevail in October. Arbuscular and saprotrophic fungi also take up a significant proportion of the belowground allocated C, though mostly in the summer period. Gram-positive bacteria showed only a minor reliance on rhizodeposit-C throughout the year. It is concluded that rhizodeposit-C-assimilating microbial communities are heterogeneous and temporal variable entities with groups that are capable of adapting differently to seasonally varying environmental conditions.","[Balasooriya, Wajira K.; Huygens, Dries; Roobroeck, Dries; Boeckx, Pascal] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Huygens, Dries] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Denef, Karolien] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Verhoest, Niko E.

We used data from a 12-year experiment to ask how plant species richness and composition influenced both observed and expected root depth distributions of plant communities. Expected root depth distributions were based on the abundance of species in each community and two traits of species that were measured in monocultures: root depth distributions and root-to-shoot ratios. The observed proportion of deep-root biomass increased more than expected with species richness and was positively correlated with aboveground productivity. Indeed, the proportion of deep-root biomass explained variation in productivity even after accounting for legume presence/abundance and greater nitrogen availability in diverse plots. Diverse plots had root depth distributions that were twice as deep as expected from their species composition and corresponding monoculture traits, partly due to interactions between C-4 grasses and legumes. These results suggest that the productivity of diverse plant communities was partly dependent on belowground plant interactions that caused roots to be distributed more deeply in soil.","[Mueller, Kevin E.; Tilman, David; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Fornara, Dario A.] Univ Ulster, Sch Environm Sci, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland","Mueller, KE (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol Bldg,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kevin.e.mueller@gmail.com,"Fornara, Dario/J-3315-2013; Mueller, Kevin E/I-3633-2019","Mueller, Kevin E/0000-0002-0739-7472; Fornara, Dario/0000-0002-5381-0803; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X",program for Long-Term Ecological Research (U.S. NSF),"We acknowledge funds from the program for Long-Term Ecological Research (U.S. NSF).

Bayesian statistics and global sensitivity analysis allow to reduce uncertainties in parameters and outputs, and they provide better insight of model behaviour. In this work two versions of a process-based model that differed in the autotrophic respiration modelling were analysed. The original version (3PGN) was based on a constant ratio between net and gross primary production, while in a new version (3PGN*) the autotrophic respiration was modelled as a function of temperature and biomass. A Bayesian framework, and a global sensitivity analysis (Morris method) were used to reduce parametric uncertainty, to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the models and to evaluate their performances. The Bayesian approach allowed also to identify the weaknesses and strengths of the dataset used for the analyses. The Morris method in combination with the Bayesian framework helped to identify key parameters and gave a deeper understanding of model behaviour. Both model versions reliably predicted average stand diameter at breast height, average stand height, stand volume and stem biomass. On the contrary, the models were not able to accurately predict net ecosystem production. Bayesian model comparison showed that 3PGN*, with the new autotrophic respiration model, has a higher conditional probability of being correct than the original 3PGN model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of plant invasions, mycorrhizal fungi and constitutive and induced resistance of plants against herbivores have received attention independently of each other. However, plants are frequently involved in complex multi-trophic interactions, which might differ between invasive and non-invasive alien plants. In a multi-species comparative experiment, we aimed to improve our understanding of plant traits associated with invasiveness. We tested whether eight invasive alien plant species use the mycorrhizal symbiosis in a more beneficial way, and have higher levels of constitutive or induced resistance against two generalist bioassay herbivores, than nine non-invasive alien species. We further assessed whether the presence of mycorrhizal fungi altered the resistance of the plant species, and whether this differed between invasive and non-invasive alien species. While invasive species produced more biomass, they did not differ in their biomass response to mycorrhizal fungi from non-invasive alien species. Invasive species also did not have higher levels of constitutive or induced resistance against the two generalist herbivores. Mycorrhizal fungi greatly affected the resistance of our plant species, however, this was also unrelated to whether the alien species were invasive or not. Our study confirms the previous findings that invasive species generally grow faster and produce more biomass than non-invasive alien species. We further show that alien plant species used a variety of defence strategies, and also varied in their interactions with mycorrhizal fungi. These multi-trophic interactions were not consistently related to invasiveness of the alien plant species. We suggest that awareness of the fact that alien plant species are involved in multi-trophic interactions might lead to a more complete understanding of the factors contributing to a plant's success.","[Kempel, Anne; Nater, Patrick; Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany","Kempel, A (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland.",anne.kempel@ips.unibe.ch,"Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008","Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Kempel, Anne/0000-0002-0563-901X",,,,74,20,22,2,175,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We then examined how the effect of fungal symbionts on plant growth was influenced by biotic (plant photosynthetic pathway) and abiotic (level of drought) factors. We also measured the phylogenetic signal of fungal symbionts on grass growth under control and drought conditions. Under drought conditions, grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than those without mycorrhizal symbionts. The increased growth of grasses conferred from fungal symbionts was greatest at the lowest soil moisture levels. Furthermore, under both drought and control conditions, C3 grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than C3 grasses without symbionts, but the biomass of C4 grasses was not affected by AM fungi. Endophytes did not increase plant biomass overall under any treatment. However, there was a phylogenetically conserved increase in plant biomass in grasses colonized by endophytes. Grasses and their fungal symbionts seem to interact within a context-dependent symbiosis, varying with biotic and abiotic conditions. Because plant-fungal symbioses significantly alter plant drought response, including these responses could improve our ability to predict grassland functioning under global change.","[Worchel, Elise R.; Giauque, Hannah E.; Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Kivlin, SN (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",stephanie.kivlin@utexas.edu,,,,,,53,44,46,3,182,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Orchidaceae is one of the most species-rich angiosperm families, and all orchids are fully dependent on fungi for their seed germination and some also for subsequent growth and survival. Given this obligate dependence, at least in the early growth stages, elucidating the patterns of orchidmycorrhizal relationships is critical to orchid biology, ecology and conservation. To assess whether rarity of an orchid is determined by its specificity towards its fungal hosts, we studied the spatial and temporal variability in the host fungi associated with one of the rarest North American terrestrial orchids, Piperia yadonii. The fungal internal transcribed spacer region was amplified and sequenced by sampling roots from eight populations of P.yadonii distributed across two habitats, Pinus radiata forest and maritime chaparral, in California. Across populations and sampling years, 26 operational taxonomic units representing three fungal families, the Ceratobasidiaceae, Sebacinaceae and Tulasnellaceae, were identified. Fungi belonging to the Sebacinaceae were documented in orchid roots only at P.radiata forest sites, while those from the Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae occurred in both habitats. Our results indicate that orchid rarity can be unrelated to the breadth of mycorrhizal associations. Our data also show that the dominance of various fungal families in mycorrhizal plants can be influenced by habitat preferences of mycorrhizal partners.","[Pandey, Madhav; Sharma, Jyotsna] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Taylor, Donald.

We conducted a study to determine how physical constraints in the root zone affected the water use of three tree species that commonly coexist on the Edwards Plateau of central Texas; cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), live oak (Quercus fusiformis), and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). The year of the study was unusually dry; minimum predawn water potentials measured in August were -8 MPa in juniper, less than -8 MPa in elm, and -5 MPa in oak. All year long, species used nearly identical water sources, based on stable isotope analysis of stem water. Sap flow velocities began to decline simultaneously in May, but the rate of decline was fastest for oak and slowest for juniper. Thus, species partitioned water by time when they could not partition water by source. Juniper lost 15-30 % of its stem hydraulic conductivity, while percent loss for oak was 70-75 %, and 90 % for elm. There was no tree mortality in the year of the study, but 2 years later, after an even more severe drought in 2011, we recorded 34, 14, 6, and 1 % mortality among oak, elm, juniper, and Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), respectively. Among the study species, mortality rates ranked in the same order as the rate of sap flow decline in 2009. Among the angiosperms, mortality rates correlated with wood density, lending further support to the hypothesis that species with more cavitation-resistant xylem are more susceptible to catastrophic hydraulic failure under acute drought.","[Kukowski, Kelly R.; Schwinning, Susanne; Schwartz, Benjamin F.] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Schwinning, S (reprint author), Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",schwinn@txstate.edu,"Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291",Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board; Norman Hackerman-Advanced Research Program Grant [003615-0021-2007]; Southwestern Association of Naturalists,"We thank Georgianne Moore for technical advice on sap flow sensor construction, implementation, and analysis.

At 22 years, the plots were reduced from 5900 to 4100 and 3000 trees per hectare in three replicates. Carbon stocks of above-ground tree materials were lowest in the heaviest thinned plots and highest in the control plots. Above-ground shrub carbon pools were the opposite, i.e., largest in the heaviest thinned plots and lowest in the controls. Soil and litter carbon stocks were not affected by thinning treatment.

Species introduced into areas outside of their native range face novel biotic and abiotic conditions, which probably impose novel selection pressures. Adaptation to these new conditions may increase the ability of introduced species to establish and spread. Like many other introduced plant populations, introduced genotypes of common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) are more successful in their introduced than in their native range, with increased growth and fecundity. These differences appear to be at least partly genetically based. The most successful introduced populations also grow in an environment that is drier and has fewer competitors than native populations. It is not known, however, whether differences between native and introduced mullein populations are related to these environmental differences between ranges. 2. We used a common garden experiment with 23 native and 27 introduced populations of common mullein to test whether common mullein in the introduced range exhibits evolutionary shifts with respect to responses to competition, drought stress and nitrogen (N) stress. We also used choice experiments to learn whether introduced mullein is more or less resistant to a generalist herbivore than native mullein. 3. Without competition, introduced genotypes grew larger than native genotypes under high resource availability (control) and N stress, but not water stress. Survival, however, was increased in native populations under competition and N stress. The introduced genotypes also had a lower root: shoot ratio than the native genotypes. With competition, introduced genotypes grew larger than native genotypes across all treatments, with that difference being significant under N stress. The introduced genotypes were also more resistant to a generalist herbivore. 4. Synthesis: Together, high biomass, strong responses to high water availability and low root: shoot ratio suggest that mullein has evolved a fast-growing, weedy phenotype in its introduced range rather than adapting to a low-water environment through increased root growth. Although fast-growing plants can be more palatable to herbivores, in this case there does not appear to be a trade-off between growth and defence against a generalist herbivore. Mullein appears to have evolved to be both faster growing and better defended in the introduced range.","[Kumschick, Sabrina; Hufbauer, Ruth A.; Alba, Christina] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kumschick, Sabrina] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Alba, Christina] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Dept Invas Ecol, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Blumenthal, Dana M.] ARS, USDA, Rangeland Resource Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Kumschick, S (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, 1177 Campus Mail, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",sabrina.kumschick@alumni.unibe.ch,"Alba, Christina/H-1579-2014","Alba, Christina/0000-0001-7040-8480; Kumschick, Sabrina/0000-0001-8034-5831; Hufbauer, Ruth/0000-0002-8270-0638",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939],"Many thanks to M Catanese, J Engle, C Miller, J Bushey, S Hylander, J Kray, J Matsuura, B & B Kumschick, M Bauerle, E Goldbach, E Kipping and K Dykgreve for help with root washing and assistance in the glasshouse.

AMF spore density and species richness as well as the numbers of infective AMF propagules and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) were analyzed. Four areas had been restored for 16, 12, 8 and 4years, and after being mined, reconstituted and re-vegetated, the fifth was mined and reconstituted but not yet re-vegetated, and the sixth had a native and undisturbed coastal forest vegetation. The soil samples were sampled in the dry and wet seasons of 2005. The number of infective propagules was significantly higher in the dry than in wet season, except in the un-vegetated dune area, which had less than 0 center dot 2propagulescm3 soil. AMF spore density and especially GRSP contents changed little between the seasons. GRSP contents were positively correlated to Al and Fe soil levels and were highest in the restinga forest. In total, 29 AMF species were identified, and glomoid and gigasporoid species predominated in all areas. AMF species richness and viable propagules of AMF were lowest in the un-vegetated dune area. Remarkably, higher species richness (28) was found in the re-vegetated areas, compared with the forest area that had only 10 species. The numbers of infective propagules tended to be also lower in the forest than in the re-vegetated sites. In conclusion, re-vegetation appears to favour the AMF communities in terms of infective propagule numbers and AMF species richness. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[de Souza, R.

Plant carbon budget is also unbalanced during spring reactivation: carbon demand is high to build new tissues and carbon may be provided by reserves only as new photoassimilates are not yet available. Using a stable isotope approach with C-13-labelled litter, we have estimated that after a six months experiment, less than 1% of carbon is derived from litter during spring reactivation and is channelled from the soil to the thick roots of Quercus petraea via ectomycorrhiza, even when leaves are photosynthetically active. Our results are promising for future detailed quantification of different carbon sources (i.e. reserves, photosynthesis and litter derived) in EMf oak trees. They also support the hypothesis that oak trees of Q petraea in north-eastern France are partially mixotrophic plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Roots from eight Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) cultivars were analyzed for root diameter size-class distribution and C:N ratio. Roots from each cultivar were mixed with C-3 soil according to five root diameter treatments: (1) 0-0.5 mm, (2) 0.5-1 mm, (3) 1-2.5 mm, (4) a 1:1:1 mixture of roots from each diameter size class, and (5) a mixture combining diameter classes in proportions representing measured size distributions for each cultivar. All treatments were incubated for 90 days under laboratory conditions. Respired CO2 was measured throughout and the microbial community structure was measured at termination of the experiment. Carbon-13 isotope techniques were used to partition respiration into root-derived C versus native SOC-derived C. Results indicated: (1) specific root length differed among the cultivars, (2) root decomposition rates within the three size classes varied by cultivar, but were not correlated with cultivar differences in root C:N ratios, (3) root diameter size class affected root and SOC decomposition, and (4) mixing roots of different diameters did not lead to synergistic increases in decomposition. We conclude that intraspecific variation in root architecture is significant and that fine root diameter size class distribution is an important trait for shaping decomposition processes.

However, the effects of N addition on the different components of soil respiration are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate how the components of soil respiration response to N addition and the potential mechanisms in a subtropical bamboo ecosystem. Four N treatment levels (0, 50, 150, 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were applied monthly in a Pleioblastus amarus bamboo plantation since November 2007. Total soil respiration (RST) and soil respiration derived from litter layer (RSL), root-free soil (RSs), and plant roots (RSR) were measured for one year (February 2010 to January 2011). The results showed that the mean rate of RST was 428 +/- 11 g C m(-2) year-1, and RSL, RSs, RSR contributed (30.2 +/- 0.7)%, (20.7 +/- 0.9)%, and (49.1 +/- 0.7)%, respectively. The temperature coefficients (Q(10)) of RST, RSL RSs, and RSR were 2.87, 2.28, 3.09, and 3.19, respectively, in control plots. Nitrogen additions significantly increased RS(T)and its three components. RSR was stimulated by N additions through increasing fine root biomass and root metabolic rate. The positive effects of N additions on soil fertility, microbial activity, and the quality and amount of aboveground litterfall also stimulated other CO2 production processes. In the background of increased N input, response of RST and components of RST are primarily due to the positive response of plant growth in this bamboo ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Spore number ranged from 20 to 192 in 100 g of soil. The number of viable mycorrhizal propagules ranged from 500 to 2,640 in 100 g of soil. Twenty species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were identified, the family Glomeracea comprising the greatest number of species (45 %). Two other fungi families Acaulosporaceae and Gigasporaceae made up 35 and 15 %, respectively. High alpha diversity and low beta diversity of AMF were found in this study. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species richness in A. potatorum is high and the associated fungi appear to be an important component in semiarid ecosystems in this region of Mexico.

Field work had been conducted for 2 years (2008-2009) to investigate the impacts of neighbouring plants on Manchurian Ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) seedling growth under the canopy of an old secondary forest and on the abandoned land exposed to full solar radiation in North-eastern China. Four different interaction treatments were designed for the study: neither shoot nor root interaction, shoot interaction only, root interaction only, and both shoot and root interaction. The presence of either the shoots or roots of neighbours had a competitive effect, reducing the growth of the target seedlings at each site. The total competitive effect of roots and shoots of neighbouring plants was significantly less than the sum of root and shoot competition separately on the abandoned land, but this difference was not significant beneath the forest canopy. Root competition was more restraining than shoot competition on the abandoned land. Target seedlings adjusted their root morphology and growth rates in response to the competitive effects from different parts of the neighbouring plants. Our results indicated that the root:shoot ratios of the target seedlings at the end of the experiment were affected by neither initial tree size nor the competition from either above- or belowground at either site. The results also highlight the importance of reducing root competition in boosting seedling regeneration and forest rehabilitation on the abandoned land.","[Wang, Jinsong; Zhao, Xiuhai; Fan, Juan; Zhang, Chunyu] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wu, L.] Rothamsted Res, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England; [von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Zhao, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,"Special Research Program for Forestry Welfare of China [200904022, 201004002]; 12th five-year National Science and Technology plan of ChinaChinese Academy of Sciences [2012BAC01B03]; Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (BBSRC), UKBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)","We thank Dr. X.P.

We also applied a sequential fumigation-incubation (SFI) procedure to characterize the chemical compositional change of soil organic carbon (SOC) during soil degradation. It was found that RP had 1.5-1.7 times greater in alkyl C0-45ppm proportions and smaller O-alkyls C45-110 fractions in litter and forest floor materials than SR. Degradation of labile organic carbon (LOC) in fresh litter was primarily limited to O-alkyl C and O-2-alkyl C in both forests, suggesting litters of RP were less decomposable than that of SR. SOC in RP was 2.3 percent higher in aromatics C110-160ppm proportions and 0.03 percent in aromaticity value than those in SR. With the absence of new C input and fauna, degradation of soil LOC companied with loss of carbonyls C160-220ppm in RP, and alkyl C and aromatics C110-160ppm in SR. Our data indicated that rubber planting induced carbon loss and extensive humification in the soil. Sources of the decomposed soil LOC can compose of both simple and complex chemical compounds.

We present new data and synthesize plant and soil results from the entire experimental period. Light-saturated photosynthesis (A (max)) of ca. 35-year-old Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata was stimulated by elevated CO2 throughout the experiment. Slight down-regulation of photosynthesis in Pinus was consistent with starch accumulation in needle tissue. Above-ground growth responses differed between tree species, with a 33 % mean annual stimulation in Larix but no response in Pinus. Species-specific CO2 responses also occurred for abundant dwarf shrub species in the understorey, where Vaccinium myrtillus showed a sustained shoot growth enhancement (+11 %) that was not apparent for Vaccinium gaultherioides or Empetrum hermaphroditum. Below ground, CO2 enrichment did not stimulate fine root or mycorrhizal mycelium growth, but increased CO2 effluxes from the soil (+24 %) indicated that enhanced C assimilation was partially offset by greater respiratory losses. The dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration in soil solutions was consistently higher under elevated CO2 (+14 %), suggesting accelerated soil organic matter turnover. CO2 enrichment hardly affected the C-N balance in plants and soil, with unaltered soil total or mineral N concentrations and little impact on plant leaf N concentration or the stable N isotope ratio. Sustained differences in plant species growth responses suggest future shifts in species composition with atmospheric change. Consistently increased C fixation, soil respiration and DOC production over 9 years of CO2 enrichment provide clear evidence for accelerated C cycling with no apparent consequences on the N cycle in this treeline ecosystem.","[Dawes, Melissa A.; Rixen, Christian] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Hagedorn, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Handa, Ira Tanya] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Streit, Kathrin] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Ekblad, Alf] Univ Orebro, Sch Sci & Technol, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Haettenschwiler, Stephan] CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Dawes, MA (reprint author), WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",melissa.dawes@slf.ch,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31-061428.00, 315200-116861]; ANR-biodiversite grantFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Velux foundation [371]; CCES-ETH project MOUNTLAND; Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [639, C07.0032, C07.0033]; WSL; University of Basel Botanical Institute; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment; Fonds quebecois de recherche sur la nature et les technologiesFQRNT","We thank many colleagues at the SLF, WSL, Paul-Scherrer Institute and University of Basel for their assistance with field and lab measurements and technical support.

Especially in orchid species, recruitment limitation is expected to be important because of their dependence on mycorrhiza for germination. Using a large seed introduction experiment we investigated the relative importance of dispersal versus recruitment limitation in the failure of three rare orchid species to colonize restored habitat patches. For all species, seeds developed successfully into protocorms in both occupied and unoccupied habitats, and no significant differences in the number of protocorms per seed packet were found between occupied and unoccupied habitats. These results show that orchid species do not necessarily suffer from recruitment limitation when introduced in restored habitats, and that manual introduction of orchid seeds can be a successful and necessary ecological restoration practice.","[De Hert, Koen; Jacquemyn, Hans; Honnay, Olivier] Univ Leuven, Lab Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Provoost, Sam] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","De Hert, K (reprint author), Univ Leuven, Lab Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",koen.dehert@bio.kuleuven.be,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Provoost, Sam/H-7278-2013","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Provoost, Sam/0000-0003-2751-5269; Honnay, Olivier/0000-0002-4287-8511",Flemish fund for scientific research (FWO)FWO [G.0592.08]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [260601],"The authors thank K.

In an effort to understand the role of these multiscale interactions in the dependence of forest structure on rainfall, we build a tractable model of individual plant competition for water and light. With game-theoretic analyses, we predict the dominant plant allocation strategy, forest productivity, and carbon storage. We find that the amount and timing of rainfall are critical to forest structure. Comparing two forests that differ only in the total time plants spend in water saturation, the model predicts that the wetter forest has fewer fine roots, more leaves, and more woody biomass than the drier forest. In contrast, if two forests differ only in the amount of water available during water limitation, the model predicts that the wetter forest has more fine roots than the drier forest and equivalent leaves and woody biomass. The difference in these responses to increases in water availability has significant implications for potential carbon sinks with rising atmospheric CO2. We predict that enhanced productivity from increased leaf-level water-use efficiency during water limitation will be allocated to fine roots if plants respond competitively, producing only a small and short-lived carbon sink.","[Farrior, Caroline E.; Dybzinski, Ray; Levin, Simon A.; Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Farrior, CE (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",cfarrior@princeton.edu,,"Farrior, Caroline/0000-0001-8999-4264; Dybzinski, Ray/0000-0002-1712-1875",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0646086]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [HR0011-09-1-055]; Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI); USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,"We thank S.

However, in recent times, severe defoliation of subarctic mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) by the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) has not induced such responses. This may be the result of a warming climate stimulating plant primary metabolism. We examined if increasing thermal sum (sum of daily mean temperatures above +5 A degrees C, d.d.) and complete foliage loss affected the concentrations of carbohydrates in sap, juvenile leaves, and fine roots of mountain birches in northern Finland and Norway. The sampling was conducted at the beginning of the growing season, two years after the insect outbreak. We also investigated the morphologic properties of mature leaves and the shoot growth of the trees. Our results showed that the carbohydrate concentrations in leaves and roots (averages 67.8 and 12.5 mg g(-1) DW, respectively) decreased in defoliated trees with increasing thermal sum (> 400 d.d.), whereas the response in intact trees was the opposite. The carbohydrates in the sap were unaffected by defoliation or thermal sum accumulation. The leaf area of mature leaves and the height growth of long shoots were greater in trees at warmer sites, irrespective of defoliation. However, defoliation increased the leaf weight per area (SLW: specific leaf weight). We conclude that under warmer growing conditions, low early-season leaf and fine root carbohydrate concentrations of previously defoliated trees cannot be used as indicators of aboveground growth.","[Huttunen, Liisa; Klemola, Tero] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Blande, James D.; Li, Tao] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Rousi, Matti] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, Vantaa 01301, Finland","Huttunen, L (reprint author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland.",liisa.huttunen@utu.fi,"Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014; Blande, James/Q-9611-2019","Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Blande, James/0000-0001-6822-0649","Kone Foundation (Finland); Turku University Foundation (Finland); Nordic Centre of Excellence Tundra within the ADAPT programme; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [129143, 256050]; Kevo Subarctic Research Station; University of Turku, Finland; Finnish Forest Research Institute, Kolari Research Unit","Financial support from the Kone Foundation (Finland), the Turku University Foundation (Finland), the Nordic Centre of Excellence Tundra within the ADAPT programme, and the Academy of Finland (projects numbered 129143 and 256050) are acknowledged.

Here we analyzed the performance of 0-4 year-old seedlings of seven tree species at three sites above and below the current altitudinal treeline in the Swiss Central Alps near Davos. Starting from sown seeds, we monitored the seedling performance as proportions of living seedlings, seedling shoot height growth, and biomass allocation over 4 years to examine changes along an elevational gradient. We evaluated the relative importance of the environmental factors soil temperature, light conditions, water use efficiency, and nitrogen availability on seedling performance. During the 4 years, the proportions of living seedlings differed only slightly along the elevational gradient even in species currently occurring at lower elevations. Microsite-specific soil temperature and light availability had only little effect on the proportion of living seedlings and seedling biomass across the elevational gradient. Conversely, seedling biomass and biomass allocation correlated well with the foliar stable nitrogen isotope abundance (delta N-15) that was used as an indicator for nitrogen availability. Collectively, our results suggested that the early establishment of seedlings of a variety of tree species in the treeline ecotone was not limited by current climatic conditions even beyond the species' actual upper distribution limit. Nitrogen dynamics appeared to be an important environmental co-driver for biomass production and allocation in very young tree seedlings.","[Zurbriggen, Natalie; Hagedorn, Frank] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Zurbriggen, Natalie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haettenschwiler, Stephan] CEFE CNRS, Ctr Funct Ecol & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Frei, Eva S.] Agrofutura, Agron, Econ & Ecol, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland; [Bebi, Peter] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland","Zurbriggen, N (reprint author), WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",natalie.zurbriggen@wsl.ch,"Bebi, Peter/L-8385-2016","Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776",Competence Centre Environment and Sustainability of the ETH Domain (CCES),"We would like to thank A.

What is the importance of Brazilian tropical wet grasslands as carbon sinks? Does fire frequency and season affect biomass and carbon allocation in Brazilian wet grasslands? Location Wet grasslands, tropical savanna, Jalapao, Tocantins, northern Brazil. Methods We determined biomass above- and below-ground, estimated carbon stocks in biennially burned plots (B2) and plots excluded from fire for 4 yr (B4). Moreover, we determined biomass in both rainy and dry seasons. Samples were 0.25 m x 0.25 m x 0.2 m (eight samples per treatment, applying a nested design, total of 48 samples). The biomass was classified in above-ground graminoids, forbs and dead matter, and below-ground roots and other below-ground organs. We used ANOVA to compare variables between treatments and seasons. Results More than 40% of the total biomass and carbon stocks were located below-ground, mostly in roots. A high proportion of dead biomass (B4) was found in the above-ground material, probably due to low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation over the years. Although these grasslands do not experience water stress, we found significant evidence of resource re-allocation from below-ground organs to the above-ground biomass in the rainy season. Conclusions We found more dead biomass in the rainy season, probably due to low decomposition rates, which can increase fire risk in these grasslands during the following dry season. These tropical wet grasslands stored high amounts of carbon (621 to 716 g C center dot m-2), mostly in the roots. Thus, policymakers should consider tropical grasslands as potential carbon stocks, since they are one of the most threatened and unprotected ecosystems in Brazil.","[Fidelis, Alessandra] UNESP Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, Brazil; [di Santi Lyra, Maria Fernanda; Pivello, Vania Regina] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ecol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Fidelis, A (reprint author), UNESP Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Bot, Av 24-A,1515, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, Brazil.",afidelis@rc.unesp.br; dslmafe@yahoo.com.br; vrpivel@usp.br,"Fidelis, Alessandra/B-9769-2012; Pivello, Vania Regina/B-5118-2013","Fidelis, Alessandra/0000-0001-9545-2285; Pivello, Vania Regina/0000-0001-8063-772X","FAPESP-Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2008/10049-9]; Neotropical Grassland Conservancy; CNPq-Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [475434/2010-2]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2008/10049-9, 2009/14978-7]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)","We thank the environmental authorities from the State Park of Jalapao for permission and support to carry out this research and to Isabel B.

Experiments consisted of a randomized factorial design of two factors: salinity (two levels, 0 and 150 mM NaCl) and symbiosis (three levels, uninoculated, Glomus intraradices, and M. tianshanense). Salinization led to increased proline levels regardless of plant organ and symbiotic status, excepting mycorrhizal L. tenuis roots. Salinity diminished the total polyamine level of control and rhizobial plants but not in mycorrhizal ones. Variations in the pattern response of the three individual polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) differed in accordance with the symbiotic status of the plant, highlighting a divergence on proline and polyamine metabolisms between rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Spermidine and spermine contributed the most with the salt-induced root polyamine increment observed upon salinization in roots of nodulated plants, suggesting that these polyamines might mediate an adaptive role of the plant-M. tianshanense symbiosis in L. tenuis plants growing in a saline environment.","[Echeverria, Mariela] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET FAUBA, Fac Agron, INBA,Inst Invest Biociencias Agr & Ambientales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ines Sannazzaro, Analia; Adolfo Ruiz, Oscar; Bernardina Menendez, Ana] IIB IINTECH UNSAM CONICET, Unidad Biotecnol 3, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bernardina Menendez, Ana] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Expt, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Echeverria, M (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET FAUBA, Fac Agron, INBA,Inst Invest Biociencias Agr & Ambientales, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mecheverria@agro.uba.ar; analia@intech.gov.ar; ruiz@intech.gov.ar; anamenendez@intech.gov.ar,,,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT 20517]; UBACYT [x143]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","This work was supported by: Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET, Argentina), Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT 20517), UBACYT x143.

Relative to underlying microsites, tussocks were warm, dry, and high in root density, productivity, % live biomass, and turnover. Root productivity averaged 649 g m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- 208) in reference sites, comprised 57 % (+/- 10) of total net production, and was concentrated in tussocks (70 % +/- 4). Root turnover rate averaged 0.63 yr(-1) (+/- 0.08), but tussocks had similar to 50 % faster root turnover than the underlying soil, and < 1 mm roots turned over similar to 40 % faster than 1-2 mm roots.

The contribution ratios of RR to SR were 23 % (-16 to 46 %), 11 % (-19 to 61 %), and 115 % (20 to 393 %), as estimated by the Tr, RR, and RE methods, respectively. The contribution ratio showed clear seasonal variation with high values in summer for the Tr method, while they were undetectable for the RR and RE methods because of some methodological problems. These results suggest the Tr method is the best of the three methods used to estimate the contribution ratio of RR and HR to SR in the forest. Annual SR, RR, and HR rates, estimated by the Tr method, were 479, 369, 110 gC m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The seasonal variation of SR was mainly influenced by HR (77 %) throughout the year, while the influence of RR on SR was strongest in summer (46 %). This effect occurred because RR (Q (10) = 7.5) is more sensitive to temperature than HR (Q (10) = 3.2). Also, the contribution of fine RR to total RR was higher than that of coarse RR because of high respiratory activity (Q (10) and R (10)) as well as the large biomass of fine roots. These results suggest that each component of SR responds differently to the same environmental factors and their relative influence on SR changes across the seasons.","[Tomotsune, Mitsutoshi; Yoshitake, Shinpei; Watanabe, Shinya] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628480, Japan; [Koizumi, Hiroshi] Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1628480, Japan","Tomotsune, M (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 2-2 Wakamatsucho, Tokyo 1628480, Japan.",tomo.32104@suou.waseda.jp,,,,,,49,15,22,2,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

The few quantitative data on the conjugal transfer of rhizobial plasmids in soil correspond to the pSym (symbiotic genes-carrying replicons), with no information available regarding transfer frequencies in soil of other (namely accessory/cryptic) plasmids that are present in several rhizobial species. Thus, we examined here the conjugal transfer in non-sterile soil of the model Sinorhizobium meliloti cryptic plasmid pSmeLPU88b. Under field conditions the proportion of nodules containing indigenous rhizobia that acquired the plasmid pSmeLPU88b and then nodulated the trapping plants could be estimated as <0.1% (transconjugants/nodule) over an 18-month sampling period that followed inoculation. The collected evidence showed that the release of rhizobia by means of standard seed-inoculation procedures did not result in a massive transfer of the introduced cryptic plasmid pSmeLPU88b to the indigenous bacteria that nodulate trapping alfalfa plants. Using a laboratory microcosm system performed with the same soil from the experimental field, we demonstrated that transconjugants were generated in the rhizosphere at a frequency of ea. 1.43 x 10(-6) transconjugants/recipient, a frequency from 10(2) to 10(3) times lower than that corresponding to the transfer of the same plasmid in rich-medium agar plates. The estimation of mobilization frequencies of rhizobial plasmids in soil is a necessary step toward the development of quantitative predictive models of gene-dispersal frequencies from inoculated strains to other rhizobia and soil bacteria.

The Baas-Becking hypothesis ('everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects') was tested by investigating the distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) at the landscape scale and the influence of environmental factors and geographical distance in determining community composition. AMF communities in Trifolium repens and Lolium perenne roots were assessed in 40 geographically dispersed sites in Ireland representing different land uses and soil types. Field sampling and laboratory bioassays were used, with AMF communities characterised using 18S rRNA terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Landscape-scale distribution of AMF was driven by the local environment. AMF community composition was influenced by abiotic variables (pH, rainfall and soil type), but not land use or geographical distance. Trifolium repens and L. perenne supported contrasting communities of AMF, and the communities colonising each plant species were consistent across pasture habitats and over distance. Furthermore, L. perenne AMF communities grouped by soil type within pasture habitats. This is the largest and most comprehensive study that has investigated the landscape-scale distribution of AMF. Our findings support the Baas-Becking hypothesis at the landscape scale and demonstrate the strong influence the local environment has on determining AMF community composition.

Plant-soil feedbacks is becoming an important concept for explaining vegetation dynamics, the invasiveness of introduced exotic species in new habitats and how terrestrial ecosystems respond to global land use and climate change. Using a new conceptual model, we show how critical alterations in plant-soil feedback interactions can change the assemblage of plant communities. We highlight recent advances, define terms and identify future challenges in this area of research and discuss how variations in strengths and directions of plant-soil feedbacks can explain succession, invasion, response to climate warming and diversity-productivity relationships. 2. While there has been a rapid increase in understanding the biological, chemical and physical mechanisms and their interdependencies underlying plant-soil feedback interactions, further progress is to be expected from applying new experimental techniques and technologies, linking empirical studies to modelling and field-based studies that can include plant-soil feedback interactions on longer time scales that also include long-term processes such as litter decomposition and mineralization. 3. Significant progress has also been made in analysing consequences of plant-soil feedbacks for biodiversity-functioning relationships, plant fitness and selection. 4. To further integrate plant-soil feedbacks into ecological theory, it will be important to determine where and how observed patterns may be generalized, and how they may influence evolution. 5. Synthesis. Gaining a greater understanding of plant-soil feedbacks and underlying mechanisms is improving our ability to predict consequences of these interactions for plant community composition and productivity under a variety of conditions. Future research will enable better prediction and mitigation of the consequences of human-induced global changes, improve efforts of restoration and conservation and promote sustainable provision of ecosystem services in a rapidly changing world.","[van der Putten, Wim H.; Bezemer, T.

Here, we first document the evolutionary changes of root size and shape of the anterior upper and lower dentition in a broad chronological and geographical framework. We then use the size and shape differences between RMH and Neanderthals to classify several isolated teeth from Kebara cave and Steinheim, and to interpret the anterior tooth roots of the Tabun C2 mandible. Our samples comprise permanent mandibular and maxillary incisors and canines from early Homo, Neanderthals, as well as extant and fossil modern humans (N = 359). In addition to root length, we measured cervical root diameter and area, total root volume, root pulp volume and root surface area from mu CT scans. We quantified root shape variation using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that Neanderthals have not only significantly larger anterior roots than RMH overall, but also different root shapes for each tooth type. In the context of the 'teeth-as-tools' hypothesis, this could be an adaptation to better sustain high or frequent loads on the front teeth. We demonstrate that the two isolated incisors stored with the Steinheim skull are very likely recent. Tabun C2 shows an anterior dentition similar in size and shape to Neanderthals while its molar roots are non-Neanderthal. Two of the five isolated teeth from Kebara are classified as Neanderthals. Interestingly, early modern humans overlap with Neanderthals and RMH in root size and shape. Anterior roots of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene specimens are at least as large as Neanderthals, suggesting that Neanderthals retained a primitive pattern, which should prompt caution in the assessment of the earliest forms of modern humans.

In a species-rich temperate broad-leaved forest, we analysed the fine root biomass (roots 2 mm) and necromass in 100 plots differing in tree species diversity (one to three species) and species composition (all possible combinations of five species of the genera Acer, Carpinus, Fagus, Fraxinus and Tilia) which allowed us to separate possible species diversity and species identity effects on fine root biomass. We found no evidence of a positive diversity effect on standing fine root biomass and thus of overyielding in terms of root biomass. Root necromass decreased with increasing species diversity at marginal significance. Various lines of evidence indicate significant species identity effects on fine root biomass (1020% higher fine root biomass in plots with presence of maple and beech than in plots with hornbeam; 100% higher fine root biomass in monospecific beech and ash plots than in hornbeam plots; differences significant). Ash fine roots tended to be over-represented in the 2- and 3-species mixed plots compared to monospecific ash plots pointing at apparent belowground competitive superiority of Fraxinus in this mixed forest. Our results indicate that belowground overyielding and spatial complementarity of root systems may be the exception rather than the rule in temperate mixed forests.","[Jacob, Andreas; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, DE-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Jacob, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, DE-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1086],"This study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, GRK 1086 'The role of biodiversity for biogeochemical cycles and biotic interactions in temperate deciduous forests').

The delta N-15, delta C-13, and C/N ratio of foliage of eight dominant plant species, including trees, understory shrubs, and a moss, as well as humus, were examined across a 361 years fire-driven chronosequence in boreal forest in northern Sweden. The delta C-13 and C/N ratio of plants and humus increased along the chronosequence, suggesting increasing plant stress through N limitation. Despite increasing biological N fixation by cyanobacteria associated with feather mosses, delta N-15 showed an overall decline, and delta N-15 of the feather moss and associated vascular plants diverged over time from that of atmospheric N-2. Across this chronosequence the N fixed by cyanobacteria is unlikely to be used by mosses and vascular plants without first undergoing mineralization and mycorrhizal transport, which would cause a change in delta N-15 signature due to isotopic fractionation. The decreasing trend of delta N-15 suggests that as the chronosequence proceeds, the plants may become more dependent on N transferred from mycorrhizal fungi or from N deposition.","[Hyodo, Fujio] Okayama Univ, Res Core Interdisciplinary Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Kusaka, Soichiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Wardle, David A.; Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hyodo, F (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Res Core Interdisciplinary Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",fhyodo@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017; HYODO, Fujio/B-2422-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; ","VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (Japan); JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Japan Society of the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We thank Morgan Karlsson for sample collection in this study.

Using minirhizotrons, we studied root growth, morphology, median longevity, risk of mortality and standing root pool in the upper soil horizon of a temperate grassland ecosystem for 3 years. Grassland monoliths were subjected to four climate treatments in a replicated additive design: control (C); elevated temperature (T); combined T and summer precipitation reduction (TD); combined TD and elevated atmospheric CO2 (TDCO2). Air warming (C vs T) and the combined climate change treatment (C vs TDCO2) had a positive effect on root growth rate and standing root pool. However, root responses to climate treatment varied depending on diameter size class. For fine roots (<= 0.1 mm), new root length and mortality increased under warming but decreased in response to elevated CO2 (TD vs TDCO2); for coarse roots (> 0.2 mm), length and mortality increased under both elevated CO2 and combined climate change drivers. Our data suggest that the standing roots pool in our grassland system may increase under future climatic conditions. Contrasted behaviour of fine and coarse roots may correspond to differential root activity of these extreme diameter classes in future climate.","[Pilon, R.; Picon-Cochard, C.; Bloor, J. M.

Both species are weakly dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for their growth and, therefore, under monotypic stands, the AMF network can become depauperate. We evaluated the impact of I. glandulifera and F. japonica on the performance (expressed as shoot biomass) of three UK native species (Plantago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium pratense) grown in soil collected from under stands of both invasive plants and compared to plants grown in soil from under stands of the corresponding native vegetation. All native species had a higher percentage colonisation of AMF when grown in uninvaded soil compared to the corresponding invaded soil. P. lanceolata and L. corniculatus had a higher biomass when grown in uninvaded soil compared to corresponding invaded soil indicating an indirect impact from the non-native species. However, for T. pratense there was no difference in biomass between soil types related to I. glandulifera, suggesting that the species is more reliant on rhizobial bacteria. We conclude that simply managing invasive populations of non-native species that are weakly, or non-dependent, on AMF is inadequate for habitat restoration as native plant colonisation and establishment may be hindered by the depleted levels of AMF in the soil below invaded monocultures. We suggest that the reintroduction of native plants to promote AMF proliferation should be incorporated into future management plans for habitats degraded by non-native plant species.","[Tanner, Robert A.] CABI, Egham TW20 9TY, Surrey, England; [Gange, Alan C.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Tanner, RA (reprint author), CABI, Bakeham Lane, Egham TW20 9TY, Surrey, England.",r.tanner@cabi.org,,,,,,49,28,29,3,221,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2013,214,3,,,,,423,432,,10.1007/s11258-013-0179-9,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,097RN,WOS:000315491300007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Corcobado, T; Cubera, E; Moreno, G; Solla, A",,,,"Corcobado, Tamara; Cubera, Elena; Moreno, Gerardo; Solla, Alejandro",,,"Quercus ilex forests are influenced by annual variations in water table, soil water deficit and fine root loss caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi",AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Saturated soil; Water deficit; Oak decline; Root density; Root-rot disease; Open woodlands,OAK DECLINE; SITE FACTORS; INVOLVEMENT; GROWTH; TREE; ROT; CONSTRAINTS; MORTALITY; INFECTION; SEEDLINGS,"It is hypothesised that major reductions in tree vitality are related to marked changes in soil water content, extremely wet winters followed by dry summers, and the presence of pathogenic organisms which take advantage of this situation. This study helps clarify the role of annual variations in water table, soil water content and fine root abundance in the decline of Quercus ilex forests, with special focus on trees growing in Phytophthora cinnamomi-infested soils. Conducted in western Spain, the study included 5 Q. ilex dehesa stands in which tree water status and soil water dynamic were compared in declining and non-declining trees, and 96 additional stands in which fine root abundance and pathogen assessment were compared in declining and non-declining trees. Declining trees showed significantly lower values than non-declining trees for leaf water potential and stomatal conductance. The period of waterlogging (2 months maximum, fluctuating from -0.5 to -4.5 m), the soil water content values observed in summer (significantly higher in declining trees) and the similar presence of Pythium spiculum in declining and non-declining trees are not sufficient in themselves to explain tree health status. However, fine root density was 16.2% lower in declining than non-declining trees and 42% lower in P. cinnamomi-infected than non-infected trees. Root damage caused by P. cinnamomi in combination with periods of saturated soils favourable for the pathogen but unfavourable for the tree, coupled with small-scale differences in soil water-holding capacity, explain the symptoms and water status of declining trees. The combination of root damage and water stress explained above-ground symptoms of declining trees and will probably determine tree survival. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A hierarchical model of soil aggregation (HM) is posited that predicts soils to be self-organising systems, mediated via interactions and feedbacks between their mineral constituents, organic matter and biotic activity, which serve to create and stabilise soil structure. To determine the contribution of these latter constituents, combinations of organic matter (compost), living plant roots (three perennial species: two woody, one grass) and a community of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi where added to a massive mine spoil in a controlled pot experiment. It was hypothesized that the absence of any of these three components would retard the development of stable soil structure, as assessed through the development of porosity, changes in bulk density, soil water retention characteristics and water-stable aggregation following a 6 month incubation period. The concentration and content of soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and pH were also determined. All three factors, organic matter, living plant roots and AM fungi were required for the development of stable soil structure, but in complex ways. Overall, the data indicate that in the presence of adequate organic matter, plant roots are key contributors to the development of soil structure which is further stabilized by AM fungi.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the involvement of nodule metabolism in the use efficiency of water and N in sludge-treated plants. Treatments comprised (1) plants inoculated with rhizobia and amended with sewage sludge; (2) plants inoculated with rhizobia without any amendment; and (3) noninoculated plants supplied with ammonium nitrate, each under well-watered and drought conditions. Under drought, sludge-treated plants had increased plant growth and higher photosynthetic and water-use efficiencies than untreated plants. Drought stimulated nitrate reductase and GS/GOGAT activities but did not affect the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase or the leghemoglobin concentration. The results suggest that under drought conditions, both N-2 fixation and nitrate assimilation in nodules of sludge-treated plants contributed to improve plant N supply and to increase the drought tolerance of alfalfa.","[Laura Fiasconaro, M.; Sanchez-Diaz, Manuel; Carmen Antolin, M.] Univ Navarra, Fac Ciencias & Farm, Dpto Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal,Unidad Asociada,CSIC, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Laura Fiasconaro, M.; Sanchez-Diaz, Manuel; Carmen Antolin, M.] EEAD, Zaragoza, Spain","Antolin, MC (reprint author), Univ Navarra, Fac Ciencias & Farm, Dpto Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal,Unidad Asociada,CSIC, C Irunlarrea 1, Pamplona 31008, Spain.",cantolin@unav.es,"Antolin, M.

In the present study we estimated root cohesion for four representative native desert shrub species: Artiplex lentiformis (Torr.) S. Watson, Lycium andersonii A. Gray, Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville, and Allenrolfea occidentalis (S. Watson) Kuntze to understand their suitability in streambank stabilization in the framework of a revegetation campaign. Field experiments were conducted to measure root length, root length density, root area ratio, and root tensile strength. Finally, the root cohesion values were assessed using a simple perpendicular model. Root area ratio estimates showed that on average plant roots occupy 0.46% of the area under the crown of the selected species. The root tensile strength ((T)r) was greatest for L tridentata (62.23 MPa) followed by L andersonii (53.53 MPa), A. lentiformis (49.17 MPa), and A. occidentalis (35.03 MPa). The root cohesion values could be used to rank the species according to their potential for shallow bank slope stabilization in riparian ecosystems of a desert environment. The maximum root cohesion in the present study was estimated for A. lentiformis (97.6 kPa) followed by L andersonii (89.3 kPa), L tridentata (35.6 kPa), and A. occidentalis (34.8 kPa). Root cohesion values were also estimated using Fiber bundle model (FBM) and compared to the perpendicular root model of Wu et al. (1979). The comparative root cohesion values for root diameter (>0.5 mm) suggest that Wu's model estimates are greater than those of the FBM by a reduction factor ranges between 0.35 and 0.56 for our studied species.

Differences in aboveground and belowground carbon allocation between individual genotypes could have significant implications for productivity and carbon sequestration and cycling in clonal plantations. We assessed biomass partitioning, allometry, coarse root morphology, and crown size of 10 P. taeda clones at age 6 in the Virginia Piedmont in control and operationally fertilized plots. Clonal effects were observed for biomass partitioning to foliar, branch, stem, taproot, and lateral root fractions; allometric relationships including root/shoot, stem/foliage, branch/foliage, and stem/taproot ratios; root morphology; and crown size. Clonal differences in biomass partitioning were the result of both differences in allometry and differences in growth rates. Growth efficiency (stem/foliage ratio) showed a twofold difference among the two most disparate clones even after standardizing for different growth rates. Clone-by-fertilizer interactions were observed for total, aboveground, and belowground biomass and for root depth sampled up to 1 m. Differences in partitioning and allometry were not clearly tied to tree or stem growth rates, indicating that there may be opportunities to select and deploy clones with rapid stem volume growth rates that have biomass partitioning patterns tailored to various precision-silviculture applications.

With this study in five tree species of a perhumid tropical rainforest in Sulawesi (Indonesia), we searched for patterns in hydraulic architecture and axial conductivity along the flow path from small-diameter roots through strong roots and the trunk to distal sun-canopy twigs. Wood density differed by not more than 10% across the different flow path positions in a species, and branch and stem wood density were closely related in three of the five species. Other than wood density, the wood anatomical and xylem hydraulic traits varied in dependence on the position along the flow path, but were unrelated to wood density within a tree. In contrast to reports from conifers and certain dicotyledonous species, we found a hump-shaped variation in vessel diameter and sapwood area--specific conductivity along the flow path in all five species with a maximum in the trunk and strong roots and minima in both small roots and twigs; the vessel size depended on the diameter of the organ. This pattern might be an adaptation to the perhumid climate with a low risk of hydraulic failure. Despite a similar mean vessel diameter in small roots and twigs, the two distal organs, hydraulically weighted mean vessel diameters were on average 30% larger in small roots, resulting in similar to 85% higher empirical and theoretical specific conductivities. Relative vessel lumen area in percent of sapwood area decreased linearly by 70% from roots to twigs, reflecting the increase in sclerenchymatic tissue and tracheids in acropetal direction in the xylem. Vessel size was more closely related to the organ diameter than to the distance along the root-to-shoot flow path. We conclude that (i) the five co-occurring tree species show convergent patterns in their hydraulic architecture despite different growth strategies, and (ii) the paradigm assuming continuous acropetal vessel tapering and decrease in specific conductance from fine roots towards distal twigs needs reconsideration.","[Schuldt, Bernhard; Leuschner, Christoph; Brock, Nicolai; Horna, Viviana] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,"Yang, Da/L-6267-2013; Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015","Yang, Da/0000-0001-7306-3289; ",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Collaborative Research CentreGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 552],Funding was received from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through Collaborative Research Centre SFB 552.,,96,38,39,0,117,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2013,33,2,,,,,161,174,,10.1093/treephys/tps122,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,096WO,WOS:000315435600005,23292668,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Gwata, ET; Wofford, DS",,,,"Gwata, Eastonce T.; Wofford, David S.",,,Potential of RAPD analysis of the promiscuous nodulation trait in soybean (Glycine max L),BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Decamer; RAPD fragment; Promiscuous nodulation; Rhizobia,MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; RESISTANCE GENES; IDENTIFICATION; ACCESSIONS; DIVERSITY; PRIMERS; LINES; SCAR,"Inoculation of soybean with cowpea-type rhizobia results in either a promiscuous type of nodulation which produces a plant with functional nodules capable of N fixation and has green leaves without N fertilization or nonpromiscuous type of nodulation which forms nonfunctional (or no nodules) and develops yellow leaves without N fertilization. Promiscuous soybean types are desirable in production regions where the availability of commercial inoculants is limited. Plant breeding efforts to develop improved promiscuous cultivars particularly in developing countries require inexpensive molecular tools for laboratory-based germplasm selection in order to reduce lengthy conventional breeding cycles. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method in identifying promiscuous soybean genotypes. Segregating plant populations created by reciprocal crosses of promiscuous x nonpromiscuous soybean lines were evaluated for useful RAPD markers for promiscuous nodulation. One hundred and sixty random decamers of arbitrary sequences were used in screening for polymorphic loci between the two parental lines. A RAPD pattern which is consistent with the soybean genotypes segregating for promiscuous nodulation was generated by one decamer, OPB06 (5'-TGCTCTGCCC-3'), indicating the potential of using RAPD markers in selecting for promiscuity in soybean breeding programs.","[Gwata, Eastonce T.] Univ Venda, Sch Agr, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa; [Wofford, David S.] Univ Florida, Dept Agron, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Gwata, ET (reprint author), Univ Venda, Sch Agr, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa.",ectgwata@yahoo.com; dwofford@ufl.edu,,,,,,21,1,1,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

In each site, a 20 x 20 m plot was established and 20 soil samples collected in a regular grid pattern. Fungal spores were extracted from each sample, counted and identified to species level. A total of 25 species were recovered belonging to seven genera and five families in the Glomeromycota. Gigaspora albida and Acaulospora scrobiculata occurred in >50 % of samples at all three sites. Other common species whose sample frequency was >50 % in one or two sites were Scutellospora weresubiae, Scutellospora cerradensis and Racocetra gregaria, while the remaining majority of species were detected in <25 % of samples within a given site. Dune sites could be differentiated based on the higher frequency of occurrence of S. cerradensis and Acaulospora morrowiae in Itapiruba, S. weresubiae in Joaquina, and Scutellospora hawaiiensis in Praia Grande. No differences across sites were observed for species richness and total spore numbers, the latter averaging from 28.8 to 31.8 spores per 100 ml soil. Shannon diversity was significantly higher in Praia Grande compared to the other two sites. Differences in the relative spore abundance of genera among dunes were detected only for Scutellospora, which was significantly more abundant in the Joaquina beach. Community structure, as depicted by species rank/log abundance graphs, was not significantly different between areas according to the Kolmogorov Smirnov two-sample test. Species accumulation curves demonstrated that 13 samples were enough to detect 90 % of all species. Overall, sand dune systems share similar arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities despite being geographically distant (150 km) from each other.

This long-term absence of sex in AMP is a puzzling evolutionary feature that has sparked scientific interest for some time, but a provoking explanation for their successful evolutionary history in the absence of an obvious sexual cycle is that these organisms may have cryptic sex, or a parasexual life cycle, allowing them to recombine alleles and compensate for deleterious mutations. Interestingly, the recent acquisition of large sequence data from many AMF species can finally allow this hypothesis to be tested more extensively. In this perspective, we highlight emerging evidence based on sequence data for the potential of AMF to have sexual reproduction, and propose a number of routes that could be taken to further explore the presence (or absence thereof) of sex in this poorly studied, yet highly relevant, fungal group.

Of 902 root-associated fungi isolated from plant roots, 118 were melanised. All but two of these fungi were re-isolated from inoculated T. subterraneum seedlings after 7 weeks in a controlled environment. Approximately 60 % of the melanised root-associated fungi did not reduce plant growth. Twenty-four isolates tended to increase plant growth and were tentatively identified as predominantly ascomycetes, and one zygomycete. Melanised root-associated fungi appeared to form complex interactions with T. subterraneum, the natures of which remain to be further explored.

Here, we use individual leaves as a natural sampling unit, comprising spatially distinct habitat and/or resource patches with unique histories and suites of resources. Spatial patterns in fungal beta diversity were tested for consistency with the metacommunity paradigms of species sorting and neutral dynamics. Thirty senesced leaves were collected from the forest floor (O horizon) in replicate upland forest, riparian forest and vernal pool habitats. We quantified spatial distance between leaves, and fungal community composition was assayed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Significant distance-decay relationships were detected at all but one upland site. This is the first study where changes in fungal community composition were quantified across discrete adjacent habitat patches, providing evidence that fungal distance decay is operational at a scale of centimetres. Although leaves of differing lignin contents were sampled from each site, leaf type was not consistently important in explaining variation in fungal community composition. However, depth of a leaf within the forest floor significantly influenced community composition at five of six sites. Environmental heterogeneity associated with depth could include moisture gradients, relative influence of soil or spore colonization, and impact of forest floor biotic community (i.e. collembola and earthworms). Because the influence of spatial distance and depth on fungal community composition could not be disentangled, both species-sorting and neutral processes may be embedded within the distance-decay relationships that we found.","[Feinstein, Larry M.; Blackwood, Christopher B.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA","Blackwood, CB (reprint author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 215 Cunningham Hall, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",feinsteinlm@gmail.com; cblackwo@kent.edu,"Blackwood, Christopher/B-3839-2010","Blackwood, Christopher/0000-0001-5764-6978",Kent State University; Kent State University Graduate Student Senate; Department of Biological Sciences Arthur & Margaret Herrick fund,This research was funded through Kent State University startup funding provided to C.B.B. and grants to L.M.F. from the Kent State University Graduate Student Senate and Department of Biological Sciences Arthur & Margaret Herrick fund.

Two populations of Quercus ilex L were selected in the southern Iberian Peninsula, these growing in similar climates but different soil types, namely a brown well-developed soil on slate rock, and a stressful lithosol on gypsum rock. In both localities, growth and maintenance respiration were measured in undetached young and mature leaves (trees under natural conditions) and fine roots (hydroponically grown seedling). Young leaves of the two populations displayed an almost identical growth cost (1.53 g glucose g(-1)). The maintenance cost was higher in the young (40.2 vs. 25.3 mg glucose g(-1) day(-1); P < 0.05) and in the mature (7.64 vs. 4.33 mg glucose g(-1) day(-1); P < 0.001) leaves of individuals growing in gypsum soils.

(L perenne) is a continuous distribution of diameters, or a collection of discrete diameters classes. Plants from tillers of five clones were grown in a local soil amended with lime. Roots were excavated after they were grown in soil for 54 days, washed and imaged with both a commercial scanner (94 px mm(-1)) and a high resolution, locally built, imager (204 px mm(-1)). Images were converted to diameter class length data with WinRhizo. Scanned images did not have enough resolution to accurately measure fine roots diameters (< 0.09 mm diam.). Therefore the high resolution images were used. The diameter class length distributions (DCLD) of these images demonstrated diameter class clusters (meso diameter classes) which could be modeled with a non-linear Gaussian (normal) curve model. Recreating the whole root system from a compilation of the DCLD, regenerated from the three parameters of each of the Gaussian curves for the root system, produced a distribution visually identical to the original whole root system curve. L perenne root systems are a collection of meso diameter classes easily described by non-linear Gaussian models.

However, our understanding of difference in soil respiration rates between agroforestry and natural forest systems is very limited. This study compared the seasonal variations in soil respiration rates in relation to fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and soil organic carbon between a secondary forest and two agroforestry systems dominated by Gmelina arborea and Dipterocarps in the Philippines during the dry and the wet seasons. The secondary forest had significantly higher (p < 0.05) soil respiration rate, fine root biomass and soil organic matter than the agroforestry systems in the dry season. However, in the wet season, soil respiration and soil organic matter in the G. arborea dominated agroforestry system were as high as in the secondary forest. Whereas soil respiration was generally higher in the wet than in the dry season, there were no differences in fine root biomass, microbial biomass and soil organic matter between the two seasons. Soil respiration rate correlated positively and significantly with fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and soil organic C in all three sites. The results of this study indicate, to some degree, that different land use management practices have different effects on fine root biomass, microbial biomass and soil organic C which may affect soil respiration as well. Therefore, when introducing agroforestry system, a proper choice of species and management techniques which are similar to natural forest is recommended.","[Bae, Kikang; Quaye, Amos K.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Lee, Don Koo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Fahey, Timothy J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Woo, Soo Young] Univ Seoul, Dept Environm Hort, Seoul 130743, South Korea; [Lee, Yong-Kwon] Korea Forest Serv, Taejon 302701, South Korea","Lee, YK (reprint author), Korea Forest Serv, Govt Complex Daejeon,Bldg 1,189 Cheongsa Ro, Taejon 302701, South Korea.",shorea@korea.kr,,,,,,36,9,12,3,121,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,1572-9680,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

In spite of the relevance of this symbiosis, the identity and origin of the symbionts involved in invasion are not well understood. We conducted a study to assess the diversity of symbiotic root-nodulating bacteria associated with the invasive Acacia saligna, in newly colonized areas in Portugal and Australia. BOX-PCR was used to discriminate the isolated bacteria and 16S rRNA and nifD genes were sequenced to identify the different isolates and their geographic origin. Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium nodulated A. saligna in Australia while only Bradyrhizobium spp. were found in Portugal. The dominant strains nodulating A. saligna were related to Bradyrhizobium liaoningense and Bradyrhizobium canariense. Co-occurring Acacia longifolia and A. saligna in Australia harbor different rhizobial communities. As an example, we found Mesorhizobium sp. and Phyllobacterium trifolii in A. saligna and A. longifolia respectively, being this the first report for this association. The analysis of the phylogeographic marker nifD clustered most of the sequences obtained in this study with sequences of Australian origin, indicating that exotic bradyrhizobia might have been co-introduced with A. saligna in Portugal. This result highlights the risks of introducing exotic inoculants that might facilitate the invasion of new areas and alter native soil bacterial communities, hindering the recovery of ecosystems.

Available SO42- (as the sum of soluble and adsorbed SO42-) accumulated in the soil near tree boles of both species, reflecting the influence of canopy intercepted SO42-. In jack pine stands, pH and soluble base cation concentrations decreased towards tree boles due to increased SO42- leaching; the reverse was found in aspen stands due to deposition of base cations leached from the canopy. As a result, Ca/Al ratios in the soluble fraction in soils near jack pine boles were 5-20 times lower than that near aspen boles. The Ca/Al ratio did not reach the critical limits of 1.0 for soil solution (ranged from 1.0 to 4.1) or 0.5 for fine roots (0.7-7.9) in the studied watersheds. However. Aln+ concentrations in the soil solution ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 mg L-1 in NE7 and from 0.1 to 8.5 mg L-1 in SM8 that can inhibit the growth of white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings that commonly succeed aspen in upland sites in the AOSR. We suggest that the spatial variation caused by tree canopies/stems will affect forest regeneration and the effect of acid deposition on forest succession in the AOSR should be further studied.

In glasshouse trials using nine native legume species and 40 rhizobial strains, we find that bacterial rRNA phylotype accounts for 68% of amoung isolate variability in symbiotic effectiveness and 79% of host specificity in growth response. We also find that rhizobial phylotype diversity and composition of soils collected from a geographical breadth of sites explains the growth responses of two acacia species. Positive soil microbial feedback between the two acacia hosts was largely driven by changes in diversity of rhizobia. Greater rhizobial diversity accumulated in association with the less responsive host species, Acacia salicina, and negatively affected the growth of the more responsive Acacia stenophylla. Together, this work demonstrates correspondence of phylotype with microbial function, and demonstrates that the dynamics of rhizobia on host species can feed back on plant population performance.","[Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Broadhurst, Linda M.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jbever@indiana.edu,"Thrall, Peter/J-6672-2013; Broadhurst, Linda/J-6907-2012","Broadhurst, Linda/0000-0002-9853-3328","NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM092660, 5 R01 GM092660]",,,50,42,45,6,277,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

This could be particularly true in forests with relatively open canopies. In maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) plantation forests in the southwest of France, a considerable amount of the direct radiation is transmitted through the canopy and is available for the growth of understory species. This study focused on five dominant understory species, including three woody species (Calluna vulgaris L., Erica cinerea L. and Cytisus scoparius L.) and two herbaceous perennials species (Molinia caerulea L. (Moench) and Pteridium aquilinum L. Khun). For each species five pine stands with varying amounts of understory were selected to predict biomass for a wide range of values. The number of pine trees and their dimensions were recorded enabling us to estimate the aboveground and root biomass of the pines using allometric relationships. Biometrical measurements of the understory and destructive harvests were carried out in each stand to measure aboveground, coarse and fine root biomass. The results showed that the understory represented an average of 6.8% of total ecosystem aboveground biomass and 27.4% of total ecosystem root bio-mass, underlining the need for a broader view of this component of the forest ecosystem. Allometric relationships derived from the biometrical data enabled satisfactory predictions of aboveground biomass for all five understory species and for belowground biomass of three species (M. caerulea, P. aquilinum, C. scoparius); allometric relationships failed to predict root biomass for two woody understory species (E. cinerea and C. vulgaris).

The model was slightly modified to improve predictions of volume, mortality and initial biomass growth. We hypothesized that because: (a) many physiological attributes of loblolly pine including rates of net photosynthesis, dark respiration, stomatal conductance and specific leaf area tend to be very similar across sites, and (b) leaf area is highly responsive to fertility but less so to water and other environmental factors, a single physiological parameter set would be suitable for predicting growth across a range of loblolly pine plantations which differed in soil type, climate, and silvicultural treatments. The parameter set was obtained from a combination of published values in the literature and model calibrations developed from a single highly productive stand in the Coastal Plain province in Georgia. Differences in potential productivity among sites were accounted for by only changing the value of the fertility rating and the soil type. The calibrated model was evaluated using observed growth data obtained from a slower growing stand at the same Coastal Plain site as the calibration stand, and three other sites, two in the Piedmont province and one in the Coastal Plain. At each of the four locations the model was evaluated using growth data from two plantations, one that received minimal silvicultural inputs and another that received a highly intensive silvicultural treatment, including complete and sustained competition control and annual fertilization. The model performed well on all stands and treatments, and accurately estimated stem biomass and diameter growth. The percent average deviation between predicted and observed values was less than 20% on most sites. The model did not accurately predict stand density in some cases and tended to overestimate volume on sites with low intensity silviculture. The inaccuracy in predicting volume was attributed to parameterization on a highly fertilized site and an inability to account for fertilization effects on wood density. Despite the discrepancies in measured and modeled stem density and volume it is our conclusion that, overall, the 3-PG model provided an accurate description of loblolly pine plantation growth and productivity and was a particularly good predictor of stand biomass in both the Piedmont and Coastal Plain provinces of the Southeastern US using a single set of physiological parameters.

In the present study, the endangered photosynthetic orchid Pseudorchis albida was screened for OrMF and RAF using culture-dependent (isolations from root sections and pelotons) and culture-independent (cloning from root sections) techniques. The efficiency of the different approaches for detecting the fungi and the effect of the sampling season (summer or autumn) were evaluated. In total, 66 distinct OTUs of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi were found, which, to our knowledge, is the highest diversity of RAF that has yet been detected in a single orchid species. The OrMF community was dominated by Tulasnella species, which were mainly detected by isolation from pelotons or cloning from root sections. The roots and tubers showed higher mycorrhizal colonization in summer, corroborating the frequent reports of Tulasnella from pelotons in this season.

Our results showed that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase (AcdS)-producing bacteria were abundant in the casing soil of A. bisporus and accounted for up to 20 % of total culturable bacteria. A. bisporus produced ACC and ethylene. The supplement of methionine increased the ACC concentrations within the hyphae, and aminooxyacetic acid displayed an opposite effect. Methionine and ACC promoted the ethylene production while CoCl2 suppressed the production. The AcdS-producing bacterial strain Pseudomonas putida UW4 co-cultured with A. bisporus could attach to hyphae, stimulate the hyphal growth, and reduce the ethylene production of A. bisporus. Added in sterilized casing soil, it induced the primordium formation of A. bisporus. In comparison, its AcdS-deficient mutant UW4-AcdS(-) displayed the opposite effects. These results indicated that the inhibitor to the primordium formation of A. bisporus was ethylene; the AcdS-producing bacteria within the casing layer cleaved ACC, lowered the ethylene level in mushroom hyphae, and relieved the inhibition of ethylene. This is a new model of the synergism between bacteria and fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

In this article we report results of a 3-year, fully factorial experimental study exploring how warming, snow addition, and their combination affect reproductive phenology, effort, and success of four alpine plant species belonging to three different life forms in a semiarid, alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that warming and snow addition change reproductive phenology and success, but responses are not uniform across species. Moreover, traits associated with resource acquisition, such as rooting depth and life history (early vs. late flowering), mediate plant phenology, and reproductive responses to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, we found that warming delayed the reproductive phenology and decreased number of inflorescences of Kobresia pygmaea C. B. Clarke, a shallow-rooted, early-flowering plant, which may be mainly constrained by upper-soil moisture availability. Because K. pygmaea is the dominant species in the alpine meadow ecosystem, these results may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and for pastoralists and wildlife in the region.","[Dorji, Tsechoe; Totland, Orjan; Moe, Stein R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Dorji, Tsechoe] Tibet Agr & Anim Husb Coll, Dept Plant Sci & Technol, Nyingchi 860000, Tibet, Peoples R China; [Hopping, Kelly A.; Klein, Julia A.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Pan, Jianbin] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Klein, Julia A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Dorji, T (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",tsechoedorji@gmail.com,"Moe, Stein R./G-1507-2011","Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; Hopping, Kelly/0000-0002-0557-0526","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); University Cooperation, Tibet-Norway Network","We thank The University Cooperation, Tibet-Norway Network for providing funds for Mr. Tsechoe Dorji to conduct his studies.

Short-term atmospheric elevated CO2 exposure has been shown to create major shifts in C flow routes and diversity of the active soil-borne microbial community. Long-term increases in CO2 have been hypothesized to have subtle effects due to the potential adaptation of soil microorganism to the increased flow of organic C. Here, we studied the effects of prolonged elevated atmospheric CO2 exposure on microbial C flow and microbial communities in the rhizosphere. Carex arenaria (a nonmycorrhizal plant species) and Festuca rubra (a mycorrhizal plant species) were grown at defined atmospheric conditions differing in CO2 concentration (350 and 700 ppm) for 3 years. During this period, C flow was assessed repeatedly (after 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years) by C-13 pulse-chase experiments, and label was tracked through the rhizosphere bacterial, general fungal, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities. Fatty acid biomarker analyses and RNA-stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP), in combination with real-time PCR and PCR-DGGE, were used to examine microbial community dynamics and abundance. Throughout the experiment the influence of elevated CO2 was highly plant dependent, with the mycorrhizal plant exerting a greater influence on both bacterial and fungal communities. Biomarker data confirmed that rhizodeposited C was first processed by AMF and subsequently transferred to bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil. Over the course of 3 years, elevated CO2 caused a continuous increase in the C-13 enrichment retained in AMF and an increasing delay in the transfer of C to the bacterial community. These results show that, not only do elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions induce changes in rhizosphere C flow and dynamics but also continue to develop over multiple seasons, thereby affecting terrestrial ecosystems C utilization processes.","[Drigo, Barbara] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Drigo, Barbara; Kowalchuk, George A.; Pijl, Agata S.; van Veen, Johannes A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Microbial Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kowalchuk, George A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Knapp, Brigitte A.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Microbiol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Boschker, Henricus T.

Our results indicated a possible allelopathic effect, although it varied by species. A ruderal grass (Andropogon arctatus) and ericaceous shrub (Lyonia ferruginea) were unaffected by irrigation with cogongrass soil ""leachate"" (relative to leachate from mixed native species), while a mid-successional grass (Aristida stricta Michx. var. beyrichiana) and tree (Pinus elliottii) were negatively affected. For A. stricta, we observed a 35.7 % reduction in aboveground biomass, a 21.9 % reduction in total root length, a 24.6 % reduction in specific root length and a 23.5 % reduction in total mycorrhizal root length, relative to the native leachate treatment. For P. elliottii, there was a 19.5 % reduction in percent mycorrhizal colonization and a 20.1 % reduction in total mycorrhizal root length. Comparisons with a DI water control in year two support the possibility that the treatment effects were due to the negative effects of cogongrass leachate, rather than a facilitative effect from the mixed natives. Chemical analyses identified 12 putative allelopathic compounds (mostly phenolics) in cogongrass leachate. The concentrations of most compounds were significantly lower, if they were present at all, in the native leachate. One compound was an alkaloid with a speculated structure of hexadecahydro-1-azachrysen-8-yl ester (C23H33NO4). This compound was not found in the native leachate. We hypothesize that the observed treatment effects may be attributable, at least partially, to these qualitative and quantitative differences in leachate chemistry.","[Hagan, Donald L.] Clemson Univ, Sch Agr Forest & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Hagan, Donald L.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jose, Shibu; Lin, Chung-Ho] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA","Hagan, DL (reprint author), Clemson Univ, Sch Agr Forest & Environm Sci, 212 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",dhagan@clemson.edu,,,,,,67,18,18,0,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

In addition, we also compared the carbon age of fine roots from soil cores of this study with reported values from the roots of the same diameter classes of ingrowth cores on the same sites. We used natural abundance of C-14 to estimate root carbon age in four boreal Norway spruce and Scots pine stands in Finland and Estonia. Age of fine root carbon was older in 1.5-2 mm diameter fine roots than in fine roots with < 0.5 mm diameter, and tended to be older in mineral soil than in organic soil. Fine root carbon was older in the less fertile Finnish spruce stands (11-12 years) than in the more fertile Estonian stand (3 and 8 years), implying that roots may live longer in less fertile soil. We further observed that on one of our sites carbon in live fine roots with the 1.5-2 mm diameter was of similar C age (7-12 years) than in the ingrowth core roots despite the reported root age in the ingrowth cores - being not older than 2 years. From this result, we conclude that new live roots may in some cases use old carbon reserves for their cellulose formation. Future research should be oriented towards improving our understanding of possible internal redistribution and uptake of C in trees.","[Sah, S.

Characterizing root initiation density and mortality, as well as how root growth is influenced by abiotic and biotic factors is essential for exploring a root system's capacity to reinforce soil. In this study, root demography data were monitored using field rhizotrons during 1.5 years in two naturally regenerated mixed forests in the French Alps. These forests are composed of trees growing in groups (tree islands) with large gaps between the islands. Three categories of driving variables were measured: (i) spatial factors: altitude (1,400 m, 1,700 m), ecological patch (gap, tree island), soil depth (0.0-1.0 m divided into five layers of 0.2 m); (ii) temporal factors: month (12 months from March 2010 to February 2011), winter (winter of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011); (iii) biological factors: root diameter classes (]0, 1] mm, ]1, 2] mm, ]2, 5] mm (according to the international standard ISO 31-11, ]x, y] denotes a left half-open interval from x (excluded) to y (included)). Two types of two-part models, a Hurdle model (H) and a Zero-inflated model (ZI) were used to fit root data with a high zero population, i.e. if root initiation or mortality was zero during a given time period, or if roots were not present at all points throughout a soil profile. Root initiation quantity decreased with increasing soil depth, as well as being lower in tree islands. Both soil depth and ecological patch interacted strongly with altitude. Root dynamics were significantly less active with a lower net production and c (r) increment in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. Roots which were ]1, 2] mm in diameter contributed the most to c (r) compared to other diameter classes, as they had a high production but a low mortality. With regard to model selection, both H and ZI demonstrated similar outcomes and underestimated extreme values of root demography data. All factors contributed towards explaining the variability of root demography and c (r) . We suggest taking into consideration the seasonality of root dynamics when studying root reinforcement.","[Mao, Zhun; Bonis, Marie-Laure; Pailler, Francois; Stokes, Alexia] INRA, UMR AMAP, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Jourdan, Christophe; Saint-Andre, Laurent] CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols Ecol Fonct & Biogeochim Sols & Agroe, Montpellier SupAgro CIRAD INRA IRD, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Rey, Herve] CIRAD, UMR AMAP, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Saint-Andre, Laurent] INRA, UR BEF Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Mao, Z (reprint author), IRSTEA, 2 Rue Papeterie, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",maozhun04@126.com,"JOURDAN, Christophe/Z-5836-2019","JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269; stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911; /0000-0001-8042-6316",AXA; French [ANR-2010-STRA-003-01]; INRA Jeune EquipeInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA),"This study was financed by an AXA PhD bursary (ZM), a French funded ANR project ECOSFIX (Ecosystem Services of Roots-Hydraulic Redistribution, Carbon Sequestration and Soil Fixation, ANR-2010-STRA-003-01) and an INRA Jeune Equipe.

The method was tested on soil cores from a California oak savanna, with roots from trees, Quercus douglasii, and annual grasses. In the randomized sampling method, one isolates the sample fraction consisting of roots and organic debris < = 1 cm in length, and randomizes it through immersion in water and vigorous mixing. Sub-samples from the mixture are then used to estimate the percentage of roots in this fraction, thereby enabling an estimate of total sample biomass. We found that root biomass estimates, determined through the randomization method, differed from total root biomass established by meticulously picking every root from a sample with an error of 3.0 % +/- 0.6 % s.e. This method greatly reduces the time and resources required for root processing from soil cores and monoliths, and improves the accuracy of root variable estimates compared to standard methods. This gives researchers the ability to increase sample frequency and reduce the error associated with studying roots at the landscape and plant scales.","[Koteen, Laura E.; Baldocchi, Dennis D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Koteen, LE (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lkoteen@berkeley.edu,"BALDOCCHI, Dennis/A-1625-2009","BALDOCCHI, Dennis/0000-0003-3496-4919",US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0005130]; Kearney Soil Science Foundation of the University of California,"The authors would like to thank Naama Raz-Yaseef, Melanie Hahn and Ricardo Lopez for dedicated work in the field; Hanna Buechi and Joseph Verfaillie for work and creative input in the field and the lab, and Siyan Ma for work in the field and helpful comments on this manuscript.

To quantify the changes in soil microbial biomass and to understand the mechanisms involved, two biochars were prepared at 350 degrees C (BC350) and 700 degrees C (BC700) from Miscanthus giganteus, a C4 plant, naturally enriched with C-13. The biochars were added to soils of about pH 4 and 8, which were both sampled from a soil pH gradient of the same soil type. Isotopic (C-13) techniques were used to investigate biochar C availability to the biomass. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microbial colonization, and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) to highlight structural changes at the surface of the biochars. After 90 days incubation, BC350 significantly increased the biomass C concentration relative to the controls in both the low (p < 0.05) and high pH soil (p <0.01). It declined between day 90 and 180. The same trend occurred with soil microbial ATP. Overall, biomass C and ATP concentrations were closely correlated over all treatments (R-2 = 0.87). This indicates that neither the biomass C, nor ATP analyses were affected by the biochars, unless, of course, they were both affected in the same way, which is highly unlikely. About 20% of microbial biomass BC was derived from BC350 after 90 days of incubation in both low and high pH soils. However, less than 2% of biomass C-13 was derived from BC700 in the high pH soil, showing very low biological availability of BC700. After 90 days of incubation, microbial colonization in the charsphere (defined here as the interface between soil and biochar) was more pronounced with the BC350 in the low pH soil. This was consistent with the biomass C and ATP results. The microbial colonization following biochar addition in our study was mainly attributed to biochar C availability and its large surface area. There was a close linear relationship between (CO2)-C-13 evolved and biomass C-13, suggesting that biochar mineralization is essentially a biological process. The interactions between non-living and living organic C forms, which are vital in terms of soil fertility and the global C cycle, may be favoured in the charsphere, which has unique properties, distinct from both the internal biochar and the bulk soil.

It allows interventions also in areas where climatic conditions and soil characteristics were until a few years ago considered prohibitive for the development of vegetation. An attractive application would be in abandoned landfills and dumps of mining scraps where the presence of heavy metals (As, Cd, Pb, Zn etc.) usually inhibits the vegetation survival. Germination tests were conducted on 9 deep roots grass species and 7 highly contaminated soil samples. By monitoring the 63 resulting test pots it was possible to select 4 best performing species that could also demonstrate to develop up to 1,80 m of root system after 1 year in same soil. These results are accompanied by the presentation of 3 full-scale cases (an urban wastes landfill and two abandoned quarries) where similar grasses allowed for a quick environmental recovery and protect the soil from erosion risks. The Authors are therefore confident that in similar situations renaturation may be achieved despite the presence of mentioned phytotoxic agents, thus making this innovative technology a unique and effective approach specifically where time constraints and high costs often prevent the use of traditional remediation procedures.","[Era, Nicola; Verrascina, Tiziana] Prati Armati Srl, Opera, MI, Italy","Era, N (reprint author), Prati Armati Srl, Opera, MI, Italy.",,,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,978-1-315-88490-5; 978-1-138-00060-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,401,406,,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental",Engineering,BB3BY,WOS:000342640400043,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hewitt, RE; Bent, E; Hollingsworth, TN; Chapin, FS; Taylor, DL",,,,"Hewitt, Rebecca E.; Bent, Elizabeth; Hollingsworth, Teresa N.; Chapin, F.

However, little is known about how fire may indirectly impact shrub performance by altering mycorrhizal symbionts. We used molecular tools, including ARISA and fungal ITS sequencing, to characterize the mycorrhizal communities on resprouting Betula nana shrubs across a fire-severity gradient after the largest tundra fire recorded in the Alaskan Arctic (July-October 2007). Fire effects on the components of fungal composition were dependant on the scale of taxonomic resolution. Variation in fungal community composition was correlated with fire severity. Fungal richness and relative abundance of dominant taxa declined with increased fire severity. Yet, in contrast to temperate and boreal regions with frequent wildfires, mycorrhizal fungi on resprouting shrubs in tundra were not strongly differentiated into fire-specialists and fire-sensitive fungi. Instead, dominant fungi, including taxa characteristic of late successional stages, were present regardless of fire severity. It is likely that the resprouting life history strategy of tundra shrubs confers resilience of dominant mycorrhizal fungi to fire disturbance by maintaining an inoculum source on the landscape after fire. Based on these results, we suggest that resprouting shrubs may facilitate post-fire vegetation regeneration and potentially the expansion of trees and shrubs under predicted scenarios of increased warming and fire disturbance in Arctic tundra.","[Hewitt, Rebecca E.; Bent, Elizabeth; Chapin, F.

The consequences on the environment of the introduction of these species, as the case invasive, are generally evaluated on their impact on plant biodiversity and soil physico-chemical characteristics but rarely on the composition of microbial communities. The soil microbiota, especially mycorhizal fungi, plays a key role vis-a-vis biological mechanisms governing the chemical soil fertility, productivity and stability of plant terrestrial ecosystems. Chosen approach was to describe the impact of exotic species on soil biological characteristics and the consequences of the recovering of vegetation cover composed of native species from the previous stand. After pointing out importance of the use of acacias worldwide, two case studies implemented in Senegal and Algeria, have shown that two Australian acacias, Acacia holosericea and Acacia mearnsii, induce deep changes in the functional diversity of soil microorganisms and in the structure of symbiotic microorganisms communities (mycorhizal fungi and rhizobia). These acacias inhibit the growth of two native tree species, Quercus suber and Faidherbia albida. These results confirm the need to identify the biological processes related to the actions of introducing exotic species in order to modulate their use. And this knowledge will prevent risks and ensure the performance of afforestation including rehabilitation of degraded land.","[Duponnois, Robin; Baudoin, Ezekiel; Dreyfus, Bernard] Ird, Umr Cirad Inra Ird Supagro Um2 113, Lstm, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Sanguin, Herve; Le Roux, Christine; Tournier, Estelle; Galiana, Antoine; Prin, Yves] Cirad, Umr Cirad Inra Ird Supagro Um2 113, Lstm, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Thioulouse, Jean] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Umr 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Duponnois, R (reprint author), Ird, Umr Cirad Inra Ird Supagro Um2 113, Lstm, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",,"Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016",,,,,19,1,2,0,26,CIRAD-CENTRE COOPERATION INT RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE POUR,MONTPELLIER,"B P 5035, MONTPELLIER, 00000, FRANCE",0006-579X,1777-5760,,BOIS FOR TROP,Bois For.

Brachiaria spp. are the most widely sown forage grasses in tropical America. Among commercial Brachiaria grasses, B. humidicola shows superior tolerance to waterlogged soils based on maintenance of growth and reduced leaf chlorophyll loss and senescence. However, little is known about the underlying traits of waterlogging tolerance in B. humidicola or their intraspecific variation. For this purpose, an outdoor study was conducted using 12 germplasm accessions of B. humidicola that were grown in soil cylinders under drained or waterlogged soil conditions for 21 days. Dry mass production and morpho-anatomical responses (aerenchyma in shoots and roots, root diameter, proportional area of stele in roots, number of nodal and lateral roots, and length of the longest root) were determined. All accessions showed shorter roots and reduced root dry mass under waterlogged soil conditions. All accessions showed aerenchyma in shoots and roots under drained conditions but were further increased under waterlogging. All accessions showed a reduction in the proportional area of stele of roots in response to waterlogging. The accession (CIAT 26570) that showed a higher proportion of aerenchyma in shoots and roots and an increased number of nodal roots (with higher diameter and a reduction in the number of lateral roots) showed longer roots, less reduction in root dry mass and increased shoot growth under waterlogged conditions. We conclude that superior growth of one accession (CIAT 26570) under waterlogged soil conditions is probably a result of morpho-anatomical traits acting together to enhance root aeration and shoot ventilation. Further research is needed to test the ability to recover from waterlogging in B. humidicola accessions.","[Andres Cardoso, Juan; Rincon, Joisse; de la Cruz Jimenez, Juan; Rao, Idupulapati M.] Ctr Int Agr Trop CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Andres Cardoso, Juan] Univ Granada, Programa Doctorado Biol Agr & Acuicultura, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Noguera, Diana] BIO UPMC Bioemco, CNRS, UMR 7618, F-93143 Bondy, France; [Noguera, Diana] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geog & Hist, Lab Cartog & SIG, Barcelona 08001, Spain","Cardoso, JA (reprint author), Ctr Int Agr Trop CIAT, Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia.",j.a.cardoso@cgiar.org,,"Rao, Idupulapati M./0000-0002-8381-9358",Fontagro (USA) [FTG-8060/08],This work was partially funded by Fontagro (USA) (project number: FTG-8060/08).,,66,12,12,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2013,5,,,,,,,,plt047,10.1093/aobpla/plt047,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AD5YH,WOS:000333328700001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"McCormick, MK; Parker, KL; Szlavecz, K; Whigham, DF",,,,"McCormick, Melissa K.; Parker, Kenneth L.; Szlavecz, Katalin; Whigham, Dennis F.",,,Native and exotic earthworms affect orchid seed loss,AOB PLANTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Earthworms; forest succession; mycorrhizae; orchids; seed burial; seed viability,TERRESTRIAL ORCHIDS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SOIL; POPULATIONS; FORESTS; RECRUITMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; INVASIONS; FIELD,"Non-native earthworms have invaded ecosystems around the world but have recently received increased attention as they invaded previously earthworm-free habitats in northern North America. Earthworms can affect plants by ingesting seeds and burying them in the soil. These effects can be negative or positive but are expected to become increasingly negative with decreasing seed size. Orchids have some of the smallest seeds of any plants, so we hypothesized that earthworm consumption of seeds would decrease seed viability and lead to burial of ingested seeds. We used a combination of mesocosms and field measurements to determine whether native and non-native earthworms would affect Goodyera pubescens seed germination by decreasing seed viability through digestion or burial. To determine soil depths at which seed burial would decrease chances of germination, we used field measurements of the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi needed for G. pubescens germination at different soil depths. We found that the combined effects of earthworm ingestion and burial would be expected to result in a loss of 49 % of orchid seeds in mature forests and 68 % of those in successional forests over an average year. Differences in seed ingestion and burial among soils from mature and successional forests were probably driven by differences in their ability to support earthworm biomass and not by differences in earthworm behaviour as a function of soil type. The combined effects of earthworm ingestion and burial have the potential to result in substantial loss of orchid seeds, particularly in successional forests. This effect may slow the ability of orchids to recolonize forests as they proceed through succession. Determining whether this strong effect of earthworms on G. pubescens viability and germination also applies to other orchid species awaits further testing.","[McCormick, Melissa K.; Parker, Kenneth L.; Whigham, Dennis F.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Szlavecz, Katalin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","McCormick, MK (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",mccormickm@si.edu,"Szlavecz, Katalin/A-5842-2008","Szlavecz, Katalin/0000-0003-2504-0298; Whigham, Dennis/0000-0003-1488-820X",United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [USDA-CSREES NRI 2007-35320-18375]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-0748442]; REU [REU-0353759],M.K.M. and K.S. were supported by grants from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-CSREES NRI 2007-35320-18375) and the National Science Foundation (EAR-0748442).

Small trees grow in the understory and allometric development is different from that of mature trees. However, less attention has been paid to biomass estimates of small trees, especially in mixed forest where tree competition is intensive. Tree allometric equations at both branch level and at whole tree level were, thus, developed and compared for the small trees of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) in a mixed stand in northeastern China. At branch level, the best model for live branch biomass was one which used a combination of branch diameter, branch length, whorl position and relative branch depth. For needle biomass, the best model did not significantly improve the estimate with more variables. At whole tree level, stem diameter at breast height (DBH) was a significant determinant of biomass for different components. Tree height did not significantly improve biomass estimation at all. Tree crown variables proved to be useful for estimating all biomass components except the fine roots. The variable measuring aboveground competition intensity was a significant negative determinant of biomass components except canopy biomass. Comparisons to published equations for the same species growing in Heilongjiang province in northeastern China and in central South Korea, were also presented. Both total aboveground biomass and belowground biomass in our study showed somewhat smaller values for a given diameter than the trees growing in other two places.","[Wang, Jinsong; Fan, Juan; Zhang, Chunyu] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resource & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wu, L.] Rothamsted Res, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England; [v Gadow, Klaus] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Fan, Xiuhua] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Fan, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",blfanxh@bjfu.edu.cn,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,"National Special Research Program for Forestry Welfare of China [200904022]; 12th five-year National Science and Technology Plan of ChinaChinese Academy of Sciences [2012BAC01B03]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200315]; Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (BBSRC), UKBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and helpful comments.

However, it remains unclear how variation of inter-annual precipitation by extreme rainfall events will alter the aboveground and belowground responses of plants, and how these responses may be contingent on N availability. In this study, we examined the interactive effects of inter-annual precipitation variation and N addition on aboveground and live fine root biomass of a semiarid grassland in northern China for two consecutive years (2007 and 2008). Inter-annual variation in precipitation resulting mainly from the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in 2008 significantly affected above-and belowground plant biomass responses to water addition. In addition, variation of inter-annual precipitation by this extreme rainfall event suppressed plant responses to nitrogen addition and reduced the interaction effects between water and nitrogen addition. These effects of inter-annual precipitation fluctuation could be attributed to the negative influence of the extreme rainfall event on soil N and water availability, ultimately reducing plant rainfall use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency. In conclusion, our results suggest ecosystem responses to water and N enrichment could be altered by inter-annual variation of precipitation regime caused by the naturally occurring extreme rainfall events.","[Kong, D.

Twelve months later we conducted an experiment to investigate the reasons behind the reduced N fixation. We took cuttings from white clover plants growing in the FACE and established individual plants in a glasshouse using soil from the appropriate ambient or elevated CO2 treatments. The established plants were then transplanted back into their ""rings of origin"" and sampled over a 6-week period. We used molecular ecological analyses targeting nifH genes and transcripts of rhizobia in symbiosis with white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to understand the potential mechanisms. Shoot biomass was significantly lower in eCO(2), but there was no difference in nodule number or mass per plant. The numbers of nifH genes and gene transcripts per nodule were significantly reduced under eCO(2), but the ratio of gene to transcript number and the strains of rhizobia present were the same in both treatments. We conclude that the capacity for biological nitrogen fixation was reduced by eCO(2) in white clover and was related to the reduced rhizobia numbers in nodules. We discuss the finding of reduced gene number in relation to factors controlling bacteroid DNA amount, which may imply an influence of nitrogen as well as phosphorus.","[Watanabe, T.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Lab Soil Biol & Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Bowatte, S.; Newton, P.

The test plots were established in the forest nursery Hajderovac, Forestry Office Kutjevo, Forest Administration Branch Pozega. The sowing of sessile oak acorns was carried out from 7 to 11 October 2005, and of pedunculate oak on 14 October 2005. Irrigation was taken as a treatment for the pedunculate oak seedlings (1 non-irrigated, 2 irrigated) while for the sessile oak seedlings it was the micro-relief (1 on slopes, 2 on flat terrain). At the end of the second growing season a random sample of seedlings was taken from the test plots for a morphological analysis. The morphological analysis of the washed root system was performed on the scanner Epson Expression 10000XL while the WinRhizo pro.V.2005 software was used to determine five root variables: length (cm), perimeter (cm(2)), average diameter (mm), volume (cm(3)) and number of root tips (pieces). For the seedlings of pedunculate oak a variance difference higher than the set limit (p=0,05) was established for the following variables: root length (p=0,293703), root perimeter (p=0,21999), root volume (p=0,281090) and the number of root tips (p=0,829142). Mann Whitney's U-test established a statistically significant difference in height (p=0,000000), root collar diameter (p=0,000284) and the average root diameter (p=0,011632) between the non-irrigated (1) and the irrigated (2) seedlings of pedunculate oak. With an average height of 578 mm (322-790 mm) the irrigated pedunculate oak seedlings (2+0) were by 305 mm higher compared to the non-irrigated ones. The average root collar diameter of the irrigated seedlings was also by 0,92 mm larger compared to the non-irrigated ones and amounted to 6,91 mm (4,93-9,90 mm). On average the root diameter of the irrigated seedlings was by 0,12 mm larger compared to the non-irrigated ones. The irrigated seedlings of pedunculate oak also showed a larger total root length (cm), root perimeter (cm2) and number of root tips (pcs) with respect to the non-irrigated ones but the mentioned characteristics are not significant. For the seedlings of sessile oak a variance difference higher than the set limit (p=0,05) was established for the following variables: height (p=0,178360), root collar diameter (p=0,077099) and root length (p=0,148820). Mann Whitney's U-test established a statistically significant difference in all the four tested variables (root perimeter (p=0,000010), average root diameter (p=0,025060), root volume (p=0,000037) and number of root tips (p=0,000427) between the sessile oak seedlings on slopes (1) and on the flat terrain (2). The average root perimeter of the sessile oak seedlings grown on slopes was by 85,39 cm(2) larger compared to the seedlings grown on flat terrain and amounted to 271,97 cm(2) (58,57-633,94 cm(2)). The average root diameter of the sessile oak seedlings on slopes was 1,60 mm (1,17-2,10 mm) which is by 0,10 mm longer compared to those on flat terrain. The average root volume of the seedlings on slopes was by 3,88 cm(3) larger compared to those on the flat terrain and amounted to 10,99 cm(3) (2,40-27,21 cm(3)). The seedlings on slopes had 818 root tips (111-2551 pcs), which is 226 pieces more compared to those from flat terrain. The seedlings of sessile oak growing on slopes had larger height (mm), root collar diameter (mm) and the total root length (cm) with respect to those on flat terrain but the mentioned characteristics are not significant. The research proves that irrigation of pedunculate oak seedlings in nursery influenced several quality variables (height, root collar diameter). Therefore, irrigation should become a required practice for the seedlings on the entire nursery production area. On the other hand, the seedlings of sessile oak display an increase in several root quality variables (perimeter, average diameter, volume, number of tips) when grown on slopes, and this practice should be adopted in all nurseries with developed micro-relief.","[Drvodelic, Damir; Orsanic, Milan] Sveucilista Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Peric, Sanja; Tijardovic, Martina] Hrvatski Sumarski Inst, Jastrebarsko 10450, Croatia","Drvodelic, D (reprint author), Sveucilista Zagrebu, Sumarski Fak, Svetosimunska 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ddrvodelic@inet.hr,,,,,,43,0,0,1,10,CROATIAN FORESTRY SOC,ZAGREB,"TRG MAZURANICA 11, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",0373-1332,,,SUMAR LIST,Sumar.

However, knowledge of their interactions, especially the direct influences of AM fungi on ammonia oxidizers is very limited to date. In the present study, a controlled microcosm experiment was established to examine the effects of AM fungi and N supply level on the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in the rhizosphere of alfalfa plants (Medicago sativa L) inoculated with AM fungus Glomus intraradices. Effects were studied using combined approaches of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The results showed that inoculation with AM fungi significantly increased the plant dry weights, total N and P uptake. Concomitantly, AM fungi significantly decreased the amoA gene copy numbers. of AOA and AOB in the root compartment (RC) but not in the hyphal compartment (HC). Moreover, AM fungi induced some changes in AOA community structure in HC and RC, while only marginal variations in AOA composition were observed to respond to N supply level in HC. Neither RC nor HC showed significant differences in AOB composition irrespective of experimental treatments. The experimental results suggested that AM fungi could directly shape AOA composition, but more likely exerted indirect influences on AOA and AOB abundance via the plant pathway. In general, AM fungi may play an important role in mediating ammonia oxidizers, but the AOA community appeared to be more sensitive than the AOB community to AM fungi. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

The product is called hydrochar and can be used as a soil amendment. However, applied in high dosages it may have detrimental effects on plants or soil biota. The potential impact of hydrochar amendment on beneficial soil organisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and earthworms and their interactions are not well understood. The goal of the present study was to determine effects of hydrochar on plant growth and soil biota and to evaluate interactions of earthworms and hydrochar on plant and AMF performance and to identify underlying mechanisms. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the effect of hydrochar at different addition rates (control, 1% and 10%, v/v) with or without the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa on the growth of Plantago lanceolata L and the performance of its AMF. We observed a positive interaction between earthworms and 10% hydrochar on shoot and root biomass: added as a single treatment hydrochar had a negative effect on plant growth at this dosage, but plant biomass increased significantly when hydrochar was added together with earthworms. Root colonization by AMF increased significantly with increasing concentration of hydrochar, but was not affected by earthworms. Contrastingly, extraradical hyphal length of AMF was reduced by earthworms, but not affected by hydrochar. Thus, hydrochar and earthworms affected the performance of AMF, albeit of different AMF tructures and in different directions.

This study was conducted to quantify the effects of belowground particulate litter (BPL) addition, increased precipitation and their interactions on soil C and N mineralization in two adjacent sites where belowground photosynthate allocation was manipulated through vegetation clipping in a temperate steppe of northeastern China from 2010 to 2011. The results show that BPL addition significantly increase soil C mineralization rate (CMR) and net N mineralization rate (NMR). Although increased precipitation-induced enhancement of soil CMR essentially ceased after the first year, stimulation of soil NMR and net nitrification rate continued into the second year. Clipping only marginally decreased soil CMR and NMR during the two years. There were significant synergistic interactions between BPL addition (and increased precipitation) and clipping on soil CMR and NMR, likely to reflect shifts in soil microbial community structure and a decrease in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomass due to the reduction of belowground photosynthate allocation. These results highlight the importance of plants in mediating the responses of soil C and N mineralization to potentially increased BPL and precipitation by controlling belowground photosynthate allocation in the temperate steppe.","[Ma, L.; Guo, C.; Yuan, S.; Wang, R.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Guo, C.; Yuan, S.] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xin, X.] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Wang, R (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",wangrz@ibcas.ac.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30590382, 30570273, 31300440]","The authors acknowledge the funding provided by the Natural Science Foundation of China (30590382, 30570273 and 31300440); the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences and Hulunber Grassland Ecosystem Observation and Research Station for help with logistics and access permission to the study site; and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which helped in improving the manuscript.",,63,11,12,3,78,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2013,10,11,,,,,7361,7372,,10.5194/bg-10-7361-2013,,,12,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,263NG,WOS:000327814700040,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Mendez-Cortes, H; Marmolejo-Monsivais, JG; Cantu-Ayala, C; Olalde-Portugal, V; Estrada-Castillon, E; Posadas-Leal, C",,,,"Mendez-Cortes, Heriberto; Marmolejo-Monsivais, Jose G.; Cantu-Ayala, Cesar; Olalde-Portugal, Victor; Estrada-Castillon, Eduardo; Posadas-Leal, Cesar",,,Response of Cedrela odorata L. to several mycorrhizal inoculants from two tropical ecosystems,MADERA Y BOSQUES,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Red cedar; growth; Glomeromycota; high tropical forest; medium tropical forest,FUNGI; PLANTS; ROOTS; COLONIZATION,"This study shows the effect of some inoculants of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the initial development Cedrela odorata L; for this, a bioassay was conducted with different inoculum sources of two tropical forests where this species is distributed in Veracruz state.

Estimation of genetic parameters for growth and biomass traits in young seedlings, as a tool for early indirect selection in the P. radiata breeding program, has not been explored yet. We aimed to estimate genetic parameters for growth and biomass traits. Five-month-old P. radiata seedlings grown under well-watered (WW) and water stress (WS) regimes were evaluated. Root collar diameter, height, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total dry weight, height/diameter ratio and root/shoot ratio were analyzed in both treatments. Trait with the highest heritability was root/shoot ratio in WW and WS regime (h(2) = 0.80 and 0.63 respectively). The highest genetic correlation was between height and shoot dry weight (r(g) = 0.90), under WW regime. In contrast, there were negative genetic correlations between root collar diameter and height/diameter ratio under WS regime. To breed for drought tolerance, traits such as height and root collar diameter would be effective targets for indirect selection since estimated heritabilities are high, there is sizable genetic variation, they are easily assessed, they can be measured non-destructively and they have a high genetic correlation with root/shoot ratio, a trait related to drought tolerance. The measurement of dry weights for early selection purposes is not recommended.","[Espinoza, S.] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Desarrollo Secano Interior, Talca, Chile; [Magni, C.

However, genomic analyses of C. lanceolata have lagged significantly behind those of other conifer species due to a lack of suitable markers. To address this issue, we examined 27,666,670 reads from C. lanceolata transcriptome sequences recorded in the SRA database. Assembly produced 35,633 contigs, 1,822 (5.11%) of which contained one or more SSRs. In total, 2,156 SSRs were identified, giving an average SSR density of 68.4 SSRs/Mb. The most common SSR types were tri-SSRs (41.7%), followed by hexa-(29.8%), penta-(12.7%), di-(11.1%) and tetra-(4.7%) SSRs. EST-SSR markers based on the 1,822 SSR-containing contigs were developed using the CMiB pipeline and primer pairs were designed to target 35 loci. Polymorphism was observed in 28 of these loci, for which the number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 12 over 16 plus-tree individuals. The observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He) and fixation index (F-IS) values for the targeted loci ranged from 0.125 to 0.938, 0.225 to 0.891 and -0.368 to 0.456, respectively. The corresponding PIC values ranged from 0.210 to 0.881, with an average of 0.573. Some of these markers have since been used in our ongoing genetic diversity analyses of C. lanceolata. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of SSRs and EST-SSR markers in C. lanceolata, and the identified EST-SSR markers will be useful in future genetic analyses of C. lanceolata and related species.","[Wen, Y.; Han, W.] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wen, Y.; Ueno, S.; Tsumura, Y.] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan","Wen, Y (reprint author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wenyafeng7107@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30972357]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [10JJ2018];  [11F00787],"This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30972357), the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (10JJ2018), and by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (11F00787).",,22,7,9,1,17,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",0037-5349,2509-8934,,SILVAE GENET,Silvae Genet.,,2013,62,3,,,,,137,141,,10.1515/sg-2013-0018,,,5,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,260EO,WOS:000327578000009,,Other Gold,,,10/31/19S,"Ibrahim, H; Hatira, A; Pansu, M",,"Romano, N; DUrso, G; Severino, G; Chirico, GB; Palladino, M",,"Ibrahim, Hatem; Hatira, Abdessatar; Pansu, Marc",,,"Modelling the functional role of microorganisms in the daily exchanges of carbon between atmosphere, plants and soil",FOUR DECADES OF PROGRESS IN MONITORING AND MODELING OF PROCESSES IN THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM: APPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES,Procedia Environmental Sciences,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Conference on Four Decades of Progress in Monitoring and Modeling of Processes in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere System,"JUN 19-21, 2013","Naples, ITALY",,,Modelling; Carbon; soil; plant; organic matter,ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; TROPICAL ANDES; SANDY SOIL; MINERALIZATION; NITROGEN; KINETICS; INPUTS; FUMIGATION; TIME,"There has been considerable research on organic carbon (OC) stocks in the upper layer of the soil but it has focused on semi-mechanistic predictions of OC stocks in the long term rather than on microbial processes acting on OC transformations. Published data lack of reference concerning the modelling of the short-term exchanges between atmosphere, plants, rhizobia and other microorganisms of soil. We think it is because the mechanistic role of microorganisms is poorly considered in most of the existing models. Compartmental theory is the most used to model the complex system of OC forms, with linear or no-linear propositions. Sometimes, the models did not consider explicitly an active microbial compartment and were often over parameterized. In contrast, the MOMOS proposition defined linearly the functional role of microorganisms with only a no-linear term linked to microbial respiration. It uses only 7 kinetic parameters having a clear ecological definition and being related to climate (all parameters), soil texture or pH (microbial respiration), and biological properties of debris inputs (enzymatic breakdown of plant debris and microbial mortality). The 3 other parameters (rates of humus stabilisation and enzyme assimilation of labile and stable humus) were found linked only to climate, suggesting that quality of humified materials should be more constant than OC forms from living materials. In coupling with soil water and production modules, the model emerges as a new theoretical basis to describe the life cycle and its applications to agro-ecology and global change.

This study shows that inclusion of FTWs in stormwater retention ponds has potential to moderately improve N removal. Median FTW outlet event mean concentrations (EMCs) were lower than median inlet and control pond outlet EMCs for all species of N, except for NH4-N. Performance was statistically better from late spring to end autumn due to higher organic nitrogen (ON) removal and denitrification in presence of the FTW. Low dissolved oxygen (DO), higher temperature and increased organic matter (OM) and microbial activity below the FTW, likely facilitated the higher denitrification rates observed over this period. Greater sediment N accumulation in the FTW pond also contributed to its higher overall N removal. Higher OM availability in the FTW pond due to release of root exudates and supply of detritus from plant die-back may have contributed to floc formation in the water column, increasing particulate ON settlement. Enhanced ON mineralisation may also be responsible but was probably limited in summer due to the low DO induced by the FTW. Direct uptake by the plants appears to be of less importance.","[Borne, Karine E.; Fassman-Beck, Elizabeth A.] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Tanner, Chris C.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton, New Zealand","Borne, KE (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Private Bag 92019 Auckland Mail Ctr, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",karine.borne@gmail.com,,"Tanner, Chris C./0000-0001-9343-5190; Fassman-Beck, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6214-6783",Auckland Council; Auckland Motorway Alliance/New Zealand Transport Agency,"The authors thank the Auckland Council and Auckland Motorway Alliance/New Zealand Transport Agency for their financial support as well as Waterclean Technologies/Kauri Park Group, manufacturer of the FTW, who provided technical support during the installation.

The aim of this study was to determine if establishment of kanuka and manuka from seed in grassland distant from stands of these species might be constrained by lack of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. Both species were grown in an unsterilised grassland soil from a low-productivity montane site assumed to be devoid of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi and inoculated with sterilised or unsterilised O-horizon or mineral soil from beneath three kanuka and three manuka communities expected to contain such fungi. Inoculation with unsterilised O-horizon soil improved kanuka biomass by 36-92%, depending on the source of the inoculant. Inoculation did not improve manuka biomass. No ectomycorrhizal infection was observed on either kanuka or manuka in samples examined under binocular microscope. The biomass response by kanuka to inoculation may be due to introduction of more effective arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from kanuka communities or possibly to the introduction of soil microorganisms. Testing of inoculation under field conditions will be essential to determine whether establishment of either species in grassland soil by seeding is seriously constrained by lack of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi or soil microorganisms.","[Davis, Murray] Scion, Christchurch 8540, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.; Carswell, Fiona] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Paul, Thomas] Scion, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand","Davis, M (reprint author), Scion, POB 29237, Christchurch 8540, New Zealand.",murray.davis@scionresearch.com,"Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128",MAF - SLMACC (Sustainable Land Management and Climate Change) Fund [C04X1002 284],"We thank Alwin Skye and Jessica Kerr for technical assistance and Graham Coker for assistance with statistical analysis.

It is not completely known how Siberian larch adapts to these stressors. We examined whether (i) these forests differ in their fine root bio- and necromass from more humid boreal forests further in the North and (ii) inter-annual fluctuations in fine root biomass are related to tree vitality. In two exceptionally dry summers, we found only 4-5 g DM m(-2) of fine root biomass (in 0-20 cm depth), which is far less than typical conifer fine root biomass figures from boreal forests (c. 200-400 g m(-2)) and the lowest forest fine root biomass reported worldwide; in a moist summer, fine root biomass was 20 fold higher. In contrast to fine root biomass, both necromass and non-tree root mass were high in all three years. From the large increase of fine root biomass in the moist summer and the generally high root necromass, we conclude that drought-induced fine root dieback was the likely cause of the very small amount of live root mass in the dry summers. Larch fine roots seem to be more drought-sensitive than shoots, since marked needle loss did not occur under the extreme conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Our major aim was to explore the plant-internal mechanisms behind the effects of mycorrhizal colonization on leaf chemistry of willow (Salix spp.). Combinations of 2 willow varieties (Loden, Tora) and 2 ectomycorrhizal fungal species (Hebeloma fastibile, Tricholoma cingulatum) were grown under controlled conditions. Host plant variety and fungal species effects on host resource allocation (biomass and leaf chemistry) varied in a complex way. Shoot biomass growth and allocation was mostly affected by host plant variety, whereas leaf and root biomass allocation were strongly affected by mycorrhizal treatment. Leaf biomass production was affected by willow variety, mycorrhizal treatment, and the interaction between them. The results indicate a strong effect of mycorrhizal colonization on host plant biomass allocation, which can mediate mycorrhizal effects on leaf chemistry. For example, leaf biomass allocation was inversely correlated with foliar concentrations of salicylic acid, suggesting a functional link between the two. However, the apparent complexity of the host plant variety-fungal species interaction makes any prediction of their possible outcome very difficult, especially in an ecological context. Still, fungal species identity seems to be more important for the responses of Salix to mycorrhizal colonization than the amount of fungal biomass.","[Fransson, Petra M.

We conducted a field experiment to study the responses of soil respiration to precipitation manipulations - precipitation exclusion to mimic drought, double precipitation to simulate flood, and ambient precipitation as control (abbr. EP, DP and AP, respectively) - in three subtropical forests in southern China. The three forest sites include Masson pine forest (PF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (BF). Our observations showed that altered precipitation strongly influenced soil respiration, not only through the well-known direct effects of soil moisture on plant and microbial activities, but also by modification of both moisture and temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. In the dry season, soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity, as well as fine root and soil microbial biomass, showed rising trends with precipitation increases in the three forest sites. Contrarily, the moisture sensitivity of soil respiration decreased with precipitation increases. In the wet season, different treatments showed different effects in three forest sites. The EP treatment decreased fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass, soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity, but enhanced soil moisture sensitivity in all three forest sites. The DP treatment significantly increased soil respiration, fine root and soil microbial biomass in the PF only, and no significant change was found for the soil temperature sensitivity. However, the DP treatment in the MF and BF reduced soil temperature sensitivity significantly in the wet season. Our results indicated that soil respiration would decrease in the three subtropical forests if soil moisture continues to decrease in the future. More rainfall in the wet season could have limited effect on the response of soil respiration to the rising of temperature in the BF and MF.","[Jiang, H.; Deng, Q.; Zhou, G.; Zhang, D.; Liu, S.; Chu, G.; Li, J.] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, H.] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Deng, Q.] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Hui, D.] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA","Deng, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",dengqi@scib.ac.cn,"Deng, Qi/M-3341-2019","Deng, Qi/0000-0001-8208-9763; Hui, Dafeng/0000-0002-5284-2897",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB42110x]; Strategic Priority Research Program - Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues of CAS [XDA05050205]; Dinghushan Forest Ecosystem Research Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0933958],"This work was financially supported by National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2009CB42110x), Strategic Priority Research Program - Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues of CAS (XDA05050205), Dinghushan Forest Ecosystem Research Station, and the National Science Foundation (0933958).",,98,34,45,1,161,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2013,10,6,,,,,3963,3982,,10.5194/bg-10-3963-2013,,,20,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,173ZQ,WOS:000321122700034,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Fodor, E",,,,"Fodor, E.",,,Linking biodiversity to mutualistic networks - woody species and ectomycorrhizal fungi,ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,temperate broadleaved mixed forest; ectomycorrhizal fungi; mutualistic bipartite networks; nestedness; modularity; connectance; C-score cluster analysis; non metric multidimensional scaling,NULL MODEL ANALYSIS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; MODULARITY; NESTEDNESS; ARCHITECTURE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; ROBUSTNESS,"Mutualistic interactions are currently mapped by bipartite networks with particular architecture and properties. The mycorrhizae connect the trees and permit them to share resources, therefore relaxing the competition. Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi associated with woody species (Quercus robur, Q. cerris, Q. petraea, Tilia tomentosa, Carpinus betulus, Corylus avellana, and Q. pubescens) growing in a temperate, broadleaved mixed forest, from a hilly area near the city of Cluj-Napoca, central Romania were included in a bipartite mutualistic network. Community structure was investigated using several network metrics, modularity and nestedness algorithms in conjunction with C-score index cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (the Kulczynski similarity was index used as most appropriate metric selected by minimal stress criterion). The results indicate that the network presents high asymmetry (hosts are outnumbered by mycobionts at a great extent), high connectance, low modularity, and high nestedness, competition playing a secondary role in community assemblage (non significant difference between simulated and observed C-score). The nestedness pattern is non-random and is comparable to previously published results for other similar interactions containing plants. In the proposed network, woody species function exclusively as generalists. Modularity analysis is a finer tool were identifying species roles than centrality measures, however, the two types of algorithms permit the separation of species according to their roles as for example connectors (generalist species) and ultraperipheral species (specialists). Supergeneralist woody species function as hubs for the diverse ectomycorrhizal community while supergeneralist ectomycorrhizal fungi glue the hubs into a coherent aggregate.","Univ Oradea, Fac Environm Protect, Dept Forestry, Oradea, Romania","Fodor, E (reprint author), Univ Oradea, Fac Environm Protect, Dept Forestry, Gen Magheru 26, Oradea, Romania.",ecaterina.fodor@gmail.com,"Fodor, Ecaterina/O-5144-2014","Fodor, Ecaterina/0000-0002-7787-2689",,,,108,4,6,0,43,EDITURA SILVICA,VOLUNTARI,"FOREST RESEARCH MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE ICAS, SOS STEFANESTI NR 128, VOLUNTARI, ILFOV 077190, ROMANIA",1844-8135,2065-2445,,ANN FOR RES,Ann.

The antibiotic effects of phenolic acids on Cylindrocaipon destructans were studied to investigate the relationships between the phenolic acids and the fungus in the plant-microbe interaction. Results show that the hyphal growth of C. destructans was inhibited by salicylic, cinnamic and benzoic acid. At the highest concentration (1600 mu g ml(-1)) of salicylic and cinnamic acid, the colony diameter of C. destructans decreased by 32.47% and 23.78%, respectively. C. destructans growth was powerfully repressed by benzoic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. However, activities of phytopathogenic enzymes (pectinase and cellulase) were greatly stimulated by the phenolic acids. It was concluded that phenolic acids inhibited the growth of C. destructans but dramatically stimulated activities of hydrolytic enzymes of C. destructans.","[Sun, Jiaman; Fu, Junfan; Zhou, Rujun; Yan, Xuerui] Shenyang Agr Univ, Plant Protect Coll, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China","Sun, JM (reprint author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Plant Protect Coll, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China.",jiamansun@hotmail.com; fujunfan@163.com; zrj5832@163.com; xuerui.yan@gmail.com,,,,,,44,1,1,0,15,TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,STAFA-ZURICH,"LAUBLSRUTISTR 24, CH-8717 STAFA-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",1660-9336,,978-3-03785-649-9,APPL MECH MATER,,,2013,295-298,,,,,,2294,2299,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.295-298.2294,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Petroleum; Environmental Sciences; Mining & Mineral Processing",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mining & Mineral Processing,BFO98,WOS:000320828201113,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ibrahim, AH",,,,"Ibrahim, Ali Hassan",,,Tolerance and avoidance responses to salinity and water stresses in Calotropis procera and Suaeda aegyptiaca,TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Amino acids; Calotropis; drought; leaf shedding; osmotic pressure; proline; salinity; Suaeda; waterlogging,LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; SALT TOLERANCE; AMINO-ACIDS; METABOLISM; GROWTH; NA+; CHROMATOGRAPHY; MECHANISMS; CULTIVARS; EVERGREEN,"This study was designed to evaluate the response of 2 wild shrubs, Calotropis procera and Suaeda aegyptiaca, to salinity (100% seawater), drought, and waterlogging stresses. The 90-day-old plants were subjected to the stress treatments for 3 weeks, and growth and some physiological parameters were evaluated. The total plant dry mass of C. procera plants was reduced by 40%, whereas S. aegyptiaca was not significantly affected by salinity stress. Water deficit and waterlogging stresses significantly reduced the total dry mass of both species. Under all conditions, the root/shoot ratio in C. procera was 3-fold higher than in S. aegyptiaca. All applied stresses markedly increased leaf shedding in C. procera plants only. These plants appeared to have a higher salinity and waterlogging stress intensity index as manifested by chlorophyll levels lower than those in S. aegyptiaca. Under all conditions, Na+ levels of S. aegyptiaca were twice those of C. procera plants. All stresses reduced the K+/Na+ ratio in C. procera leaves. On the other hand, S. aegyptiaca plants were able to maintain this ratio near control levels under salinity and drought stresses. Consequently, S. aegyptiaca leaves had higher partial osmotic pressure than C. procera. The proline and total free amino acids levels in C. procera were between 1.3- and 2-fold higher than in S. aegyptiaca. Among all amino acids, the common change in both species under all stresses was an accumulation of free proline and a decrease in methionine levels. The results revealed that the response of both species to salinity and water stresses included avoidance and tolerance mechanisms with some differences between them.","[Ibrahim, Ali Hassan] Umm Al Qura Univ, Univ Coll, Al Qunfida, Saudi Arabia; [Ibrahim, Ali Hassan] Suez Canal Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Biol Sci, Al Arish, North Sinai, Egypt","Ibrahim, AH (reprint author), Umm Al Qura Univ, Univ Coll, Al Qunfida, Saudi Arabia.",ibrahim2910@yahoo.com,,"Ibrahim, A.H./0000-0003-3892-7517",,,,48,8,8,2,17,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

Summer drought imposes severe limitations in Q. brantii forests, making reforestation with this species in general very difficult. This is further complicated by the limited ecophysiological information for this species. To improve our understanding of factors affecting the drought tolerance of Q. brantii at early critical life stages, we explored the influence of seed size and provenance on growth and survival of Q. brantii seedlings under drought. As expected, drought reduced growth and survival and increased the root-to-shoot ratio, with larger acorns rendering more vigorous growth than small ones. There was a positive correlation between seed size and root-to-shoot ratio under severe drought stress only for the provenance from the wetter region. Our results indicate that large seeds of Q. brantii from populations with good genetic material can render restoration programs in the Zagros forests more successful.","[Zolfaghari, Roghayeh; Fayyaz, Payam; Nazari, Mona] Univ Yasuj, Fac Agr, Dept Forestry, Yasuj 318755765, Iran; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Spanish Natl Res Council, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Zolfaghari, R (reprint author), Univ Yasuj, Fac Agr, Dept Forestry, Yasuj 318755765, Iran.",zolfaghari@mail.yu.ac.ir,"Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014","Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682",Yasouj University,This research was supported by grants from Yasouj University.,,33,5,8,4,23,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

Most of the larger remnants are protected within the limits of national parks and forest reserves. However, some of these are invaded by exotic conifers such as Pseudotsuga menziesii. In order to better understand the mycorrhizal condition within the Nothofagus-P. menziesii interaction, transects were established at six study sites along the effective recruitment area. Three treatments were established: Nothofagus forest without P. menziesii invasion (Forest), Nothofagus-P. menziesii matrix (Interface) and P. menziesii plantation lacking Nothofagus specimens (Plantation). A 2 kg mixed soil sample was taken at each treatment site and kept in brand-new plastic bags. A soil bioassay with Nothofagus seedlings acting as baits was set to evaluate the mycorrhizal inoculum potential and soil-fungi composition at each sampling treatment. Forty percent of the evaluated seedlings were found to be colonised by dark septate endophytes (DSE) fungi. Ectomycorrhizal colonisation percentage was significantly higher in plants growing in Forest soils (mean = 57.77%) when compared with Interface (mean = 42.53%) and Plantation (mean = 44.65%). The high incidence of DSE in young roots of Nothofagus seedlings in this study supports the hypothesis that DSE might be pioneering colonisers of young tree seedlings in secondary successional environments. For future interventions in the forest, either with productive or protective intentions, it should be taken into account the incidence of these fungi, which may have an important positive role in Nothofagus forest post-invasion recovery.","[Salgado Salomon, Maria E.; Barroetavena, Carolina; Rajchenberg, Mario] Ingn Forestal UNPSJB, Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Barroetavena, Carolina; Rajchenberg, Mario] Ctr Forestal CIEFAP, RA-9200 Esquel, Chubut, Argentina; [Salgado Salomon, Maria E.; Barroetavena, Carolina; Rajchenberg, Mario] Concejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Salomon, MES (reprint author), Ingn Forestal UNPSJB, Sarmiento 849, Esquel, Chubut, Argentina.",mesalgadosalomon@gmail.com,,,CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 80101000]; Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia SJ Bosco [PI-750]; National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"We are grateful to the owners and plantations keepers for allowing us to work in their properties.

To understand how the future climate will affect the boreal forest, we studied growth responses to climate variability in black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B. S. P.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), two major co-occurring boreal tree species of the eastern Canadian boreal forest. 2. We analysed climate-growth interaction during (i) periods of non-anomalous growth and (ii) in years with strong growth anomalies. We utilized paired tree-level data for both growth and soil variables, which helped ensure that the studied growth variability was a function of species-specific biology, and not of within stand variation in soil conditions. 3. Redundancy analysis conducted on spruce and aspen tree ring chronologies showed that their growth was affected differently by climate. During non-anomalous years, growth of spruce was favoured by cooler temperatures and wetter conditions, while aspen growth was favoured by higher temperatures and drier conditions. 4. Black spruce and trembling aspen also showed an inverse pattern in respect to expression of growth anomalies (pointer years). A negative growth anomaly in spruce tended to be associated with positive ones in aspen and vice versa. This suggested that spruce and aspen had largely contrasting species-specific responses to both 'average' weather conditions and extreme weather events. 5. Synthesis. Species-specific responses to environmental variability imply that tree responses to future climate will likely be not synchronized among species, which may translate into changes in structure and composition of future forest communities. In particular, we speculate that outcome of climate change in respect to relative abundance of black spruce and trembling aspen at the regional levels will be highly dependent on the balance between increasing temperatures and precipitation. Further, species-specific responses of trees to annual climate variability may enhance the resilience of mixed forests by constraining variability in their annual biomass accumulation, as compared with pure stands, under periods with high frequency of climatically extreme conditions.","[Drobyshev, Igor; Gewehr, Sylvie; Bergeron, Yves] UQAT, Chaire Ind CRSNG UQAT UQAM Amenagement Forestier, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Drobyshev, Igor] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Berninger, Frank] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Helsinki 00014, Finland","Drobyshev, I (reprint author), UQAT, Chaire Ind CRSNG UQAT UQAM Amenagement Forestier, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.",igor.drobyshev@uqat.ca,"Berninger, Frank/A-8891-2010; Drobyshev, Igor/D-9220-2016","Berninger, Frank/0000-0001-7718-1661; Drobyshev, Igor/0000-0002-5980-4316",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [STPSC 350413-07]; Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies (FQRNT)FQRNT [2008-PR-122675],"We thank Valerie Plante and Christine Vigeant for field assistance, Marc Mazerolle (UQAT, Canada) for help with the statistical analyses and Jacques Tardif (University of Winnipeg, Canada) for useful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.
