However, no studies on estimating root reinforcement have been performed using GPR. The aim of this study was to evaluate root reinforcement using GPR in thinned and unthinned stands of Cryptomeria Japonica in Andisols. Roots in each stand were detected using a 900 MHz GPR and the diameter and horizontal distribution of roots were estimated. Roots were also excavated to compare their GPR estimates. The relationships between root diameter and tensile force were established through field pullout tests. Finally, root reinforcements in each stand were estimated using the recently proposed root bundle model (RBM). There were no significant differences in the diameter frequency distribution of roots estimated between thinned and unthinned stands, determined using either the GPR or excavation methods. The detection frequency of the number of roots > 5 mm in diameter using GPR was 27.2%, but it increased to 58.7% for roots > 10 mm. The waveform indexes, determined using the sum of time intervals between zero crossings (ET) of all reflection waveforms of GPR, had a significant linear relationship with the diameters of excavated roots, indicating that waveform index could be used to estimate root diameter using the GPR index in these stands. Furthermore, the relationship between the root tensile force (F) and- root diameter (d) was estimated as F = 15.69 d(1.75) (R-2 = 0.87). The root reinforcements at the center of gaps between individual trees were estimated to be 23.4-32.9 kPa in the thinned stand and 8.8-23.9 kPa in the unthinned stand using GPR. These values ranged from 31.9% to 170.7% of those obtained by using the excavation method. There were no significant differences in root reinforcement between thinned and unthinned stands, regardless of the method used. This study revealed that GPR, together with diameter-tensile force relationships, can nondestructively estimate root reinforcement in managed forests. This protocol can be applied to manage forests to evaluate the effects of management on belowground roots.","[Yamase, Keitaro; Todo, Chikage] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, 430 Ikaba, Shiso, Hyogo 6712515, Japan; [Tanikawa, Toko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Todo, Chikage; Doi, Ryuusei; Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yamamoto, Tomonori; Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Sch Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ikeno, Hidetoshi; Ohashi, Mizue] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Aono, Kenji] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd KANSO Technos, Osaka 5410052, Japan; [Tanikawa, Toko] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Yamase, K (reprint author), Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, 430 Ikaba, Shiso, Hyogo 6712515, Japan.",kei-yamase@nike.eonet.ne.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25252027, 22380090]","This study was funded partly by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant number, 25252027, 22380090).",,58,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,DEC,2019,183,,,,,,,,UNSP 104227,10.1016/j.catena.2019.104227,,,12,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,JB2VV,WOS:000488417700045,,,,,10/31/19J,"Klichowska, E; Nobis, M; Piszczek, P; Blaszkowski, J; Zubek, S",,,,"Klichowska, Ewelina; Nobis, Marcin; Piszczek, Piotr; Blaszkowski, Janusz; Zubek, Szymon",,,"Soil properties rather than topography, climatic conditions, and vegetation type shape AMF-feathergrass relationship in semi-natural European grasslands",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); Species richness and composition; Fungal root endophytes; Grasslands; Niche heterogeneity; Steppe species; Stipa pennata,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; ROOTS; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; COLONIZATION; DYNAMICS; FIELD,"Due to the fact that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide water and elements (e.g. phosphorus) to the host, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is considered to be an important plant-fungi interaction and can be helpful for plants occupying extreme habitats. Such habitats include Central European semi-natural dry feathergrass grasslands. One of the main components of feathergrass steppes in Eurasia is Stipa pennata (Poaceae). Currently, because of a lack of land use leading to the overgrowth of grasslands and consequently to habitat deterioration, this species is rare and protected in many European countries. No information regarding the simultaneous impact of vegetation, topography, soil and climatic factors on the AMF-feathergrass relationship has been published to date. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate factors that shape AMF root colonisation and AMF community composition in different types of European semi-natural feathergrass niches occupied by S. pennata. To do that, we collected roots and soil samples along with data about topography, soil chemical and physical properties, climate and vegetation cover from three different types of edaphic niches. We found that AMF root colonisation was lower in sand than in gypsum or limestone soils and was largely explained by environmental factors. AMF root colonisation degree was predominantly influenced by soil nitrogen content, and increased along with pH. Soil physical stress disrupted relationships between AMF root colonisation degree and soil pH. The largest percentage of variance in the composition of AMF communities was explained by soil factors, followed by climate, topography and vegetation. AMF communities associated with S. pennata were composed mainly of 'generalists' species.","[Klichowska, Ewelina; Nobis, Marcin; Piszczek, Piotr; Zubek, Szymon] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Bot, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Klichowska, Ewelina] Polish Acad Sci, Bot Garden, Garden Ctr Biol Divers Conservat Powsin, Warsaw, Poland; [Nobis, Marcin] Tomsk State Univ, Res Lab Herbarium, Tomsk, Russia; [Blaszkowski, Janusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Dept Ecol Protect & Shaping Environm, Slowackiego 17, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland","Nobis, M (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Bot, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",m.nobis@uj.edu.pl,"; Piszczek, Piotr/L-7695-2018","Zubek, Szymon/0000-0003-1338-9572; Piszczek, Piotr/0000-0002-2773-8991","National Science Centre (Poland) [2014/15/N/NZ8/00340, 2013/09/B/NZ8/03287]","This work was supported by National Science Centre (Poland) [grant numbers 2014/15/N/NZ8/00340 and 2013/09/B/NZ8/03287].

While patterns of local adaptation in individual species are widely recorded, the importance of microevolutionary processes for plant community assembly and function is poorly understood. Here, we examined how a history of long-term co-existence, and thus potential for local co-adaptation, influenced the process of plant community assembly. Soil inocula and seeds of eight plant species were collected from three calcareous grasslands with a long history of grazing within a single geographical region. Mesocosm communities were established using local genotypes from a single site or an artificial mixture of genotypes from two different sites. To investigate the role of root exudates and local ('home') and non-local ('away') soil biota as mediators of plant species co-existence, the population origin treatment was combined with the addition of activated carbon, which is known to adsorb exudates from soil, and sterilization of soil inocula. Individual-, species- and mesocosm-level responses were measured over the course of three growing seasons. We found that root exudates promoted seedling survival, species co-existence and productivity in assemblages of genotypes originating from the same community but had a weak impact in mixed, novel communities. Soil biota promoted the growth of subordinate forbs and restrained the growth of dominant graminoids, particularly in communities composed of local genotypes. The effects of population origin were significant in the first 2 years of the experiment but were not detectable in the third year when interbreeding and new seedling establishment took place. Plant genotypes coupled with 'home' microbial inoculum experienced a stronger reduction in growth compared with genotypes exposed to 'away' inoculum, indicating that plants experienced home-field disadvantage in interactions with soil biota. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the mechanisms of initial grassland community assembly depend on community history, with below-ground chemical interactions and plant interactions with soil biota becoming stronger drivers of dynamics in established and potentially co-evolved communities.","[Semchenko, Marina] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Nettan, Slim; Sepp, Anette; Zhang, Qiaoying; Abakumova, Maria; Davison, John; Kalamees, Rein; Lepik, Anu; Pussa, Kersti; Saar, Sirgi; Saarma, Merilin; Thetloff, Marge; Zobel, Kristjan] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Zhang, Qiaoying] China West Normal Univ, Sch Land & Resources, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Saar, Sirgi] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ist BioRobot, Scuola Super St Anna, Pontedera, Italy","Semchenko, M (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",marina.semchenko@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,68,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Abiotic and biotic filters are probabilistic 'sieves' that allow species with certain functional traits to become a part of the community, or not. We manipulated natural plant assemblies in order to identify variations in the timings of biotic and abiotic filters that determine community trait assemblies. We extracted soil portions when the investigated annual plant community was in its seed phase ('community monolith'), thereby maintaining the structure and similar soil characteristics to the field conditions. Community monoliths were subjected to experimental manipulation in terms of the rainfall timing and amount, and perturbations of the biological soil crust (BSC; intact vs. perturbed). We surveyed the experimental community assembly over time based on the functional diversity by considering important functional traits in different life stages. We found that autumn droughts acted as abiotic filters by favouring the germination and establishment of species with greater investment in the root biomass. Under severe droughts (66% water reduction), the experimental assemblies were dominated by species with functional traits adapted to water shortage conditions: high leaf dry matter content, low specific leaf area, small individual size, low reproductive ratio and high root:shoot ratio. We identified two roles of BSCs in annual plant species assemblies: (a) as a biotic filter that limited the establishment of species based on seed size, and (b) as a buffer against water stress conditions by reducing soil evapotranspiration. Synthesis. We demonstrated the importance of the timing and amount of rainfall for shaping annual plant communities, and identified germination filters as the main process that determined community assemblies. Our results suggest that the phenotypic integration of functional traits facilitates resistance to drought during the life cycle. The BSC-annual plant relationship shifted from negative, by acting as a germination filter, to positive, by acting as a buffer in later stages. Climatic fluctuations and fine scale biotic determinants of spatial heterogeneity emerged as sources of changes in the community assembly in time and space to possibly promote species coexistence and trait differences among the communities studied.","[Peralta, Ana M.

As standard EGR substrates often lack potentially mutualistic soil microorganisms, it has been stated that inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) might increase plant performance and drought resistance. Aiming to support native biodiversity on EGRs, we tested whether AMF inoculation into standard green roof substrate can enhance plant performance and drought resistance of regionally occurring native dry grassland species. The results of a pot experiment with 11 native plant species growing with and without AMF inoculation showed considerable differences in fitness-relevant plant traits. Over 88 days of moderate drought conditions, inoculated plants produced 2.5 times more above-ground biomass than control plants. In addition, the number of inflorescences on inoculated plants was significantly higher in 5 out of 7 flowering species. Under severe drought stress created by stopping the water supply, however, inoculated plants wilted on average 2.38 days earlier than control plants. Although the underlying mechanisms of the observed results remain unresolved, AMF inoculation might help to enhance an earlier and higher seed set, facilitating the establishment of a soil seed bank, which is necessary for a self-sustaining plant population in drought-governed habitats such as EGRs.","[Schroeder, Roland; Kiehl, Kathrin] Osnabruck Univ Appl Sci, Oldenburger Landstr 24, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany; [Mohri, Milena] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany","Schroder, R (reprint author), Osnabruck Univ Appl Sci, Oldenburger Landstr 24, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany.",r.schroeder@hs-osnabrueck.de,,,European Union (European Regional Development Fund)European Union (EU); German Federal State of Lower Saxony,We thank Daniel Jeschke for support in conducting the experiment and Daniel Janko for drawing the graphical abstract.

Extensive karst area of southwest China has undergone rocky desertification because of soil erosion and vegetation degradation. Karst soils in this area are mainly composed of silty clay loam developed from carbonate rock erosion under subtropical humid monsoon climate. We tested the hypothesis that AMF colonization of tree seedlings would improve water stable aggregates of degraded karst soil and enhance seedling growth. Seedlings of two tree species, Toona sinensis and Delavaya toxocarpa suitable for afforestation in karst area, were inoculated separately with three AMF, Funneliformis mosseae, Glomus versiforme and Rhizophagus intraradices in pots containing rocky desertified soil. Non-inoculated seedlings were used as control. After 12 months we found that the percentage of water stable aggregates (diameter > 0.25 mm; WSA (> 0.25)) in the rhizosphere soil of the inoculated seedlings was increased by 15.6-20.5% compared to control. AMF colonization significantly increased the quantity of aggregates with diameter > 2 mm compared to control but soil aggregates of size class 0.25 - 0.5 mm decreased significantly in inoculated seedlings, regardless of tree species. Shoot biomass of inoculated T. sinensis and D. toxocarpa seedling was increased by 15.7-21.2% and 8.5-20.4%, respectively compared to non-inoculated seedlings. In contrast, AMF inoculation minimally influenced the root biomass of the two tree species. The easily extractable glomalin (EEG) content and mean weight diameter (MWD) of rhizospheric soil of the inoculated seedlings increased by 28.9-75.1% and 31.7-48.1%, respectively compared to control. The AMF colonization was highly correlated with WSA (> 0.25), EEG and MWD. Overall results support our hypothesis that AMF colonization enhance the quantity of rhizospheric soil aggregates and improve the growth of host seedlings. We conclude that planting tree species inoculated with AMF has a potential for restoration of degraded karst ecosystem. In future research other locally adapted tree and shrub species should be tested following AMF inoculation to prepare a wider planting stocks to be used in restoration of degraded karsts.","[Zhang, Zhongfeng; Mallik, Azim; Huang, Yuqing; Zhou, Longwu] Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg & Chinese Acad Sci, Guangxi Inst Bot, Guangxi Key Lab Plant Conservat & Restorat Ecol K, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Mallik, Azim] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Zhang, Jinchi] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZF; Mallik, A (reprint author), Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg & Chinese Acad Sci, Guangxi Inst Bot, Guangxi Key Lab Plant Conservat & Restorat Ecol K, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.; Mallik, A (reprint author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",78228546@qq.com; amallik@lakeheadu.ca,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41603079, 31470709]; Guangxi Scientific and Technological Project [Guike AB18126065, Guikegong 1598016-12]; Fundamental Research Funds of Guangxi Institute of Botany [15005]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41603079; 31470709), the Guangxi Scientific and Technological Project (Guike AB18126065; Guikegong 1598016-12), and the Fundamental Research Funds of Guangxi Institute of Botany (15005).

Additionally, the contribution of soil microbial biomass to SOM was studied in five forest stands with different dominant tree species. The study was conducted at the afforested spoil heap 'Sophienhohe' located at the lignite open-cast mine Hambach near Julich, Germany. The 35 year-old afforested sites consisted of monocultural stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mienziesii), pine (Pinus nigra), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and red oak (Quercus rubra) as well as a mixed deciduous stand site planted mainly with hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), lime (Tilia cordata) and common oak (Quercus robur). There, boundary conditions regarding soil, climate, topography and management were highly similar, equivalent to a common garden experiment but on landscape level. Because the parent material used for site recultivation was free from organic matter or coal material, the SOM accumulation is a result of in situ soil development. Tree species had a significant effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, stoichiometric patterns of C, hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) and the microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content in the forest floor and the top mineral soil layers (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-30 cm). In general, forest floor SOC stocks were significantly higher in coniferous forest stands compared to deciduous tree species. Differences in SOM quantity became less pronounced with increasing depth, while stoichiometric molar ratios of SOM as indices of litter turnover and SOM composition differed also in deeper layers. Differences in H:C and O:C ratios among tree species clearly increased along the depth gradient in mineral soils, indicating that SOM turnover by oxidative processes depends on tree species. Differences in depth gradients of the microbial quotient (MBC to SOC ratio) among tree species emphasized differences in the microbial C turnover. Furthermore, the relationship between the microbial quotient and SOM stoichiometry (C:N and C:S ratio) became stronger with increasing soil depth. This suggests that N and especially S limitation determined the microbial turnover of SOM in deeper mineral soil layers.","[Lorenz, Marcel; Thiele-Bruhn, Soeren] Univ Trier, Soil Sci, FB 6,Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany","Thiele-Bruhn, S (reprint author), Univ Trier, Soil Sci, FB 6,Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",thiele@uni-trier.de,,,,,,77,0,0,40,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,1-Nov,2019,353,,,,,,35,46,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.021,,,12,Soil Science,Agriculture,IT0CI,WOS:000482513900004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sheng, M; Zhang, XL; Chen, XD; Hamel, C; Huang, S; Tang, M",,,,"Sheng, Min; Zhang, Xinlu; Chen, Xuedong; Hamel, Chantal; Huang, Shan; Tang, Ming",,,Biogeography of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in saline ecosystems of northern China,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Geographic distance; Habitat characteristics; Robinia pseudoacacia; Saline soil,ROBINIA-PSEUDOACACIA; BLACK LOCUST; SALT STRESS; HOST-PLANTS; SOIL; DIVERSITY; ROOTS; TREE; CHRONOSEQUENCE; TOLERANCE,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, influencing many important ecosystem processes, widely occur in saline soils, and thus understanding their biogeographic patterns is of primary interest in saline ecosystem restoration. Fine roots and rhizosphere soils were sampled in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantations in four saline sites in northern China to detect soil properties and AM fungal attributes including their colonization level, spore density, hyphal density and community composition. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal attributes varied with sampling sites, and this variation was mostly attributed to changes in habitat characteristics and geographic distance. Habitat characteristics shape the root- and soil-inhabiting AM fungal communities to the same extent, whereas geographic distance seems to contribute more to root-inhabiting AM fungal assemblages. The level of root colonization by vesicles, arbuscules and hyphae and the density of AM fungal spores and hyphae in soils were found to be related to the relative abundance of AM fungal species such as root-inhabiting Rhizophagus intraradices and soil-inhabiting Sclerocystis sinuosa. All the results suggest that changes in habitat characteristics and geographic distance may induce biogeographic patterns of AM fungi, and these patterns are closely related to AM symbiosis in roots and the development of AM fungi in soils.","[Sheng, Min; Zhang, Xinlu; Chen, Xuedong; Huang, Shan; Tang, Ming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ming] South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Guangdong Key Lab Innovat Dev & Utilizat Forest P, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Min] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab State Forestry Adm Management Forest Biod, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hamel, Chantal] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Quebec Res & Dev Ctr, 2560 Hochelaga Blvd, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada","Tang, M (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tangm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0504400, 2017YFC0504404]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400524, 41671268]","This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (""Eco-security Technology for Coal Mining Bases in the Northwestern Arid Desert Regions in China"" [2017YFC0504400], ""Study on Geomorphic Reclamation and Earthy Composition in Coal Mining Abandoned Area"" [2017YFC0504404]), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400524, 41671268).",,82,0,0,18,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

However, the geographical distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) and how their communities vary over large geographical areas are less well understood. Because climatic and environmental similarity may decrease with geographical distance or because some OMF have limited dispersal capabilities, similarities in orchid mycorrhizal communities can be expected to decrease with increasing distances separating orchid populations. However, up till now empirical evidence is largely lacking. Location Eurasia. Taxa Gymnadenia conopsea (L.) R. Brown and Epipactis helleborine (L.) Crantz. Methods High-throughput sequencing was used to perform a cross-continental comparison of OMF that associate with two widespread Eurasian terrestrial orchids, Epipactis helleborine and Gymnadenia conopsea. Both phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic measures of community dissimilarity and their components were calculated and related to geographical distances using Mantel tests. Results Our results showed that in both orchid species similarity in mycorrhizal communities decreased significantly with geographical distance. Decomposing the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to overall dissimilarity showed that the observed dissimilarity was mainly the result of species replacement between regions, and not of species loss. Similarly, a strong relationship was observed between phylogenetic community dissimilarity and geographical distance. Decomposing PCD values into a nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic component showed that orchid populations located closely next to each other were likely to contain the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs), but that the non-shared taxa came from different phylogenetic clades. Species indicator analyses showed that the majority of OMF OTUs were restricted to particular geographical areas. However, some OTUs occurred in both continents, indicating that some fungi have very wide distributions. Main conclusions Overall, these results demonstrate that orchid mycorrhizal communities differ substantially across large geographical areas, but that the distribution of orchids is not necessarily restricted by the distribution of particular OMF. Hence, widespread orchid species can be considered mycorrhizal generalists that are flexible in the OMF with which they associate across large geographical areas.","[Xing, Xiaoke; Gao, Yue; Liu, Na; Guo, Shunxing] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xiaoke; Gao, Yue; Zhao, Zeyu; Liu, Na] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Waud, Michael; Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Leuven, Belgium; [Duffy, Karl J.] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Naples, Italy; [Selosse, Marc-Andre] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Syst Evolut Biodiversite, ISYEB,Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS,UMR 7205,MNHN,UPMC,EPHE, Paris, France; [Selosse, Marc-Andre; Jakalski, Marcin] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Gdansk, Poland","Xing, XK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Xing, XK (reprint author), Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xkxing2009@hotmail.com,,"Jakalski, Marcin/0000-0002-5481-9148; Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794",CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine [2016-I2M-2-002]; Fund for Scientific Research [G093019N],"CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine, Grant/Award Number: 2016-I2M-2-002; Fund for Scientific Research, Grant/Award Number: FWO grant G093019N",,83,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Methods Plant water sources and leaf physiological parameters of Hippophae rhamnoides and two neighbor species were investigated in pure and mixed plantations. Then, N stable isotope and N content of leaves were analyzed to examine the N facilitation of H. rhamnoides to neighbor species. Finally, interactions between plant water sources and N acquisition were detected using the dissimilarity analysis. Results H. rhamnoides and Pinus tabuliformis obtained water from similar soil depths, whereas, water sources were partitioned between H. rhamnoides and Ulmus pumila. Compared with pure plantations, P. tabuliformis and H. rhamnoides could not maintain a stable net photosynthetic rate (P-n) during the dry period in mixed plantation. However, H. rhamnoides and U. pumila in mixed plantation could alleviate drought effect on P-n through stomatal adjustments, comapred with pure plantations. Furthermore, H. rhamnoides facilitated N to neighbor species regardless of their water source relations, however, this facilitation only significantly improved the leaf N content of U. pumila. Conclusions Water source partitioning, stomatal adjustment, and N facilitation promoted stable coexistence of NFS and neighbor species in water- and N-limited environments.","[Tang, Yakun; Wu, Xu; Chen, Chen; Jia, Chang; Chen, Yunming] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xu] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chen, YM (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",ymchen@ms.iswc.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41977425]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604801]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2452016105],"We are grateful to the constructive and insightful suggestions of section editor Rafael S.

However, we know little about the impact of increasing temperature and changing rainfall patterns on the interactions between plants and their beneficial and antagonistic root symbionts. Here, we used a reciprocal multifactorial growth chamber experiment with seeds and soil microbial communities from three origins to investigate the impact of temperature and soil moisture on the growth, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and root-associated fungal community of a perennial herb. Moreover, we tested whether plants and AM fungi performed better or worse when plants were grown with their local soil biota, for example, due to plant adaptation or changes in the genetic or species composition of the soil microbial community. Temperature and soil moisture generally increased plant growth, whereas temperature but not soil moisture increased AM fungal colonization. The strength and direction of the plants' response to temperature were dependent on soil moisture and differed among plant populations, and AM fungal colonization was further affected by the origin of the soil microbial community. The root-associated fungal community structure was impacted by temperature, soil moisture and the soil microbial origin, with interactive effects between the microbial origin and the abiotic environment. Plant biomass was lower when plants were grown with their local soil microbes, potentially due to intraspecific negative plant-soil feedbacks. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that, beyond a relatively uniform increase of plant growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization with increasing temperature, plants and root-associated fungi of different origins will vary in their response to climate change (i.e. elevated temperature and shifts in rainfall). This may create pronounced, but difficult to predict, spatial and temporal variation in the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions with a changing climate.","[Rasmussen, Pil U.; Tack, Ayco J.

This study investigated the decomposition rates of leaves and fine roots of Croton sonderianus Mull. Arg., Poincianella pyramidalis Tul., and Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart. over 12 months in a semiarid ecosystem in Brazil. Twelve biotic and abiotic factors were also evaluated as local determinants of decomposition rates. A 2000 x 500 m grid was delimited within which thirty 20 x 20 m plots were established. Two sets of litterbags were installed in each plot, one containing a mixture of leaves and the other a mixture of roots. The approximate mean lost mass was 90% for leaf material and 47% for roots after 10 and 12 months, respectively. Due to the litterbag incubation sites being distributed in a heterogeneous area, values for the intrinsic decay coefficient (k) (through month) varied widely from a minimum of 0.073 to a maximum of 0.458 for leaf litter and from 0.045 to 0.077 for roots. Variation in the decay coefficients for leaves and roots was significantly explained by aerial plant biomass and litterfall production, respectively; more open areas exhibited the highest rates of decomposition. Vegetation structure that favors the exposure of soil to solar radiation can influence the decomposition process, promoting an increase in leaf, and fine root decomposition rates at small spatial scales in tropical semiarid ecosystems.","[Oliveira, Uirande] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, CB, Postgrad Program Ecol PPG ECO, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Amado, Andre Megali] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, CB, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Amado, Andre Megali] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Biol, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Vasconcellos, Alexandre] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil","Vasconcellos, A (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, CCEN, Dept Sistemat & Ecol, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.",avasconceilos@dse.ufpb.br,,,,,,59,0,0,6,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-4982,1532-4990,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

One hypothesis suggests that high N2O emissions may stem from increased denitrification induced by CO2 enhancement of plant carbon (C) allocation belowground. However, direct evidence illustrating linkages among N2O emissions, plant C allocation, and denitrifying microbes under eCO(2) is still lacking. We examined the impact of eCO(2) on plant C allocation to roots and their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and its subsequent effects on N2O emissions and denitrifying microbes in the presence of two distinct N sources, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). Our results showed that the form of the N inputs dominated the effects of eCO(2) on N2O emissions: eCO(2) significantly increased N2O emissions with NO3--N inputs but had no effect with NH4+-N inputs. eCO(2) increased plant biomass N more with NH4+-N than with NO3--N inputs, likely reducing microbial access to available N under NH4+-N inputs and/or contributing to higher N2O emissions under NO3--N inputs. eCO(2) enhanced root and mycorrhizal N uptake and also increased N2O emissions under NO3--N inputs. Further, eCO(2) enhancement of N2O emissions under NO3--N inputs concurred with a shift in the soil denitrifier community composition in favor of N2O-producing (nirK- and nirS-type) over N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers. Together, these results indicate that eCO(2) stimulated N2O emissions mainly through altering plant N preference in favor of NH4+ over NO3- and thus stimulating soil denitrifiers and their activities. These findings suggest that effective management of N sources may mitigate N2O emissions by negating the eCO(2) stimulation of soil denitrifying microbes and their activities.","[Qiu, Yunpeng; Zhang, Lin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Inst Appl Ecol, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Yunpeng; Jiang, Yu; Guo, Lijin; Shew, H.

Experiments on plants have focused largely on novel competitive interactions; other species interactions, such as plant-microbe symbioses, while less studied, may also influence plant responses to climate change. In this greenhouse study, we evaluated interactions between soil microbes and alpine-restricted plant species, simulating a warming scenario in which low-elevation microbes migrate upslope into the distribution of alpine plants. We examined three alpine grasses from the Rocky Mountains, CO, USA (Poa alpina, Festuca brachyphylla, and Elymus scribneri). We used soil inocula from within (resident) or below (novel) the plants' current elevation range and examined responses in plant biomass, plant traits, and fungal colonization of roots. Resident soil inocula from the species' home range decreased biomass to a greater extent than novel soil inocula. The depressed growth in resident soils suggested that these soils harbor more carbon-demanding microbes, as plant biomass generally declined with greater fungal colonization of roots, especially in resident soil inocula. Although plant traits did not respond to the provenance of soil inocula, specific leaf area declined and root:shoot ratio increased when soil inocula were sterilized, indicating microbial mediation of plant trait expression. Contrary to current predictions, our findings suggest that if upwardly migrating microbes were to displace current soil microbes, alpine plants may benefit from this warming-induced microbial re-shuffling.","[Lynn, Joshua S.; Duarte, Danielle A.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Lynn, Joshua S.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO 81224 USA; [Lynn, Joshua S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, N-5006 Bergen, Norway","Lynn, JS (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.; Lynn, JS (reprint author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO 81224 USA.; Lynn, JS (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, N-5006 Bergen, Norway.",Joshua.Lynn@uib.no,,"Lynn, Joshua/0000-0002-7190-7991",University of New Mexico Biology Department Grove Summer Scholarship; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Fund; United States National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology [1354972],"We thank the Rudgers-Whitney lab for comments on early analyses for the project and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

We predicted that soil fungal communities would change seasonally, that decades of fire cessation and nitrogen (N) fertilization would alter fungal distributions, and that plant and fungal community change would be correlated. Surface soils were sampled monthly for 1 y from a 30-y fire by fertilization experiment to evaluate fungal community dynamics and assess correlation with plant community heterogeneity. ITS gene community composition was seasonally stable, excepting increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal summer abundance in the burned, fertilized treatment. Long-term treatments affected soil fungal and plant communities, with correlated heterogeneity patterns. Despite woody encroachment in the fire cessation treatment, soil fungal communities did not resemble those of forests. This study provides evidence supporting the strength of feedbacks between fungal and plant community change in response to long-term grassland fire and N management changes.

These AM parameters were significantly higher in summer than in winter in the control treatment, but only AM fungal extra-radical hyphal density exhibited the same seasonal trend in the drought treatment. In total, 45 AM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level using Illumina sequencing of 18S rDNA, Drought and season had no significant effects on AM fungal OTU richness in soil and roots. AM fungal community composition in soil and roots was significantly affected by season but not by drought.

The sequential coring and minirhizotron methods were applied to quantify fine root biomass, production, and turnover of a N-rich but P-limited subtropical forest in southern China and to assess the responses of these root variables to a gradient of N additions (control (0), low-N (35), medium-N (70), and high-N (105 kg N ha(-1) year(-1))) during the first 3 years of experimentation. The high- and medium-N additions significantly reduced fine root diameter by about 30% but increased the specific root length by 20-105%, i.e., fine roots became thinner and longer under the experimental N addition. Both low- and medium-N additions generally stimulated fine root production (10-88%) and turnover (3-40%), whereas high-N suppressed them by 32-70% and 8-54%, respectively, varying with sampling season and estimation method. The stimulatory effects were presumably ascribed to the increased fine root growth for P acquisition, the suppressive effect, to the deleterious damage to the root health and micronutrient availability. Overall, the N effects were more pronounced in the surface (0-10 cm) than in the deeper (10-40 cm) soil layers and for the first-order than the higher-order fine roots. Our results indicate that lower-order absorptive fine roots are responsive to elevated N deposition, and complex responses could emerge due to the interactive influences of the N deposition rate, seasonality, and soil depth.","[Wang, Wenjuan; Han, Xiaoge; Shen, Weijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mo, Qifeng] South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hui, Dafeng] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA","Shen, WJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shenweij@scbg.ac.cn,"Shen, Weijun/G-2942-2010; Mo, Qifeng/E-6502-2016","Shen, Weijun/0000-0001-7574-8839; Mo, Qifeng/0000-0002-5064-3851","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31425005, 31290222]; National Ten Thousand Talents Program","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31425005, 31290222), and the National Ten Thousand Talents Program.",,62,0,0,9,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The bacterial diversity of many urban parks around the world has been reported; however, the role of fungi is often ignored. There are only one or two published reports of fungal community composition analysis from urban parks. In the present study, we investigated soil fungal diversity in 24 urban parks in Shanghai using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. At the taxonomic level, 540,657 effective fungal sequences were acquired from the soil from 24 urban parks. Other than some unclassified phyla, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) collected from all 24 urban park soils were distributed into five fungal phyla; of these, Ascomycota was the most dominant phylum, followed by Zygomycota and Basidiomycota. Many fungi identified in the present study are known to play key roles in the environment, with particularly important roles in maintaining sustainability in the soil ecosystem. The identified mycorrhizal fungi may play a major role in the biogeochemical cycle, as these fungi obtain carbon from their host plants and allocate it to the soil ecosystem; they also participate in mineralisation of various inorganic substances, helping with the growth of plants.","[Zhang, Jing] Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin; Wu, Jiang; Kumari, Deepika] Tongji Univ, CAUP, MOE Joint Lab Int Cooperat Ecourban Design, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Kumari, D (reprint author), Tongji Univ, CAUP, MOE Joint Lab Int Cooperat Ecourban Design, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",deepikakumari@tongji.edu.cn,,,Key Projects of the National Social Science Fund [17AZD011]; Research Programs of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Foundation [17DZ1202100],This research has received funding from Key Projects of the National Social Science Fund 17AZD011 and Research Programs of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Foundation 17DZ1202100.,,40,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,OCT,2019,22,5,,,,,855,863,,10.1007/s11252-019-00867-5,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,IY2LF,WOS:000486221100006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wang, H; Liu, SR; Song, ZC; Yang, YJ; Wang, JX; You, YM; Zhang, X; Shi, ZM; Nong, Y; Ming, AG; Lu, LH; Cai, DX",,,,"Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Song, Zhanchao; Yang, Yujing; Wang, Jingxin; You, Yeming; Zhang, Xiao; Shi, Zuomin; Nong, You; Ming, Angang; Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong",,,Introducing nitrogen-fixing tree species and mixing with Pinus massoniana alters and evenly distributes various chemical compositions of soil organic carbon in a planted forest in southern China,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Litter quality; Organic carbon chemical composition; Planted forests; Soil microbial biomass and diversity; Tree species,MATTER DECOMPOSITION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; LITTER QUALITY; PLANTATION; C-13; SENSITIVITY; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; POOLS; STABILIZATION,"There are potential effects of converting a planted-forest type from conifer to broadleaf or mixed-species on soil organic carbon (SOC) chemical composition, and the quantity and distribution of various chemical compositions of SOC remain uncertain. An afforestation experiment with different tree species (Pinus massoniana, Erythrophleurn fordii [N-fixing species], and mixed P. massoniana and E. fordii) was conducted in clear-cut sites of P. massoniana-planted forests in a subtropical region. Topsoil organic C quality and microbial diversity were assessed after eight years of afforestation. Referring to the species diversity index in the community, Pielou's evenness index was used for estimating the evenness of distribution of various organic C compositions in the total organic C of soil, litter, and fine roots. The proportions of alkyl C and carbonyl C in SOC, as well as the alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) ratios and the distributed evenness of the four main SOC chemical compositions were higher in the monospecific E. fordii and mixed-species-planted forests than in the monospecific P. massoniana-planted forest. Positive relationships of the A/O-A ratio and the evenness of distribution of various SOC chemical compositions in the litter as well as fine root C quality were observed. Microbial biomass C was positively correlated with the labile SOC (O-alkyl C). Multivariate analysis showed that the fine roots had a closer correlation with the chemical composition of SOC than the litter. These results highlight that introducing native N-fixing broadleaf tree species and mixing N-fixing species into conifer forests probably enhances the SOC chemical stability. It also minimizes the risk of C decomposition posed by any one soil organic matter (SOM) constituent having a huge impact during climate change through increasing the proportion of recalcitrant C components and even distribution of various SOM chemical compositions.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Song, Zhanchao; Shi, Zuomin] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yujing] Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingxin] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 6215, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [You, Yeming] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao; Ming, Angang] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Nong, You; Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosyst Natl Res Stn, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",liusr@caf.ac.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds of Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2017QB004]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470627]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2018YFC0507305, 2017YFC0505006]","We would like to thank the Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosystem Research Station for experimental and logistical support, as well as H Chen, RM He and ZY Li for assistance with fieldwork and laboratory analysis.

The relationship between biopores and subsurface flow during rainstorms is poorly understood. Here, we examined the link between subsurface flow and biopores formed through different processes, including soil faunal activity and abundance of fine and coarse roots. As the distribution of biopores is influenced by the type of vegetation present, we investigated the effect of plant diversity (forest with or without understorey vegetation) on the pattern of water infiltration throughout the soil. We hypothesized that increased species diversity would enhance the extension of subsurface flow because biopores would be distributed throughout the soil profile and that more coarse roots would create large biopores, increasing subsurface flow. In situ experiments were conducted on hillslopes with plantations of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) growing on terraces, or with secondary mixed forests, in the tropical zone of Yunnan province, China. Three sites with Ferralsol soils and different vegetation types were examined: (1) plantation with no understorey; (2) clear-cut plantation with understorey; and (3) secondary mixed forest with understorey. Irrigation experiments with Brilliant Blue FCF dyed water were performed upslope of trees at each site and staining patterns resulting from infiltrated dyed water were examined at two different scales. After dye irrigation, soil was removed in 1.0 x 0.8 m slices starting 1 m downslope and soil profiles were photographed for subsequent mapping of dyed areas in the profile (macroscale). Each profile was then divided into a 0.1 x 0.1 m grid (microscale) and burrows formed by macrofauna and fine and coarse root densities were measured. At the macroscale, the greatest lateral extension in subsurface flow occurred in the natural forest and the least in the rubber tree plantation with no understorey vegetation. At the microscale, and in all types of vegetation, fine roots significantly increased the incidence of subsurface flow compared to coarse roots and macrofauna activity. We conclude that in tropical Ferralsols, fine roots, and hence understorey vegetation, play a positive role in promoting subsurface flow and therefore reducing water erosion and mass wasting processes. Thus, planting mixtures that include a diversity of species and strata could significantly improve soil conservation.","[Nespoulous, Jerome; Merino-Martin, Luis; Monnier, Yogan; Bouchet, Diane C.; Ramel, Merlin; Dombey, Rodolphe; Viennois, Gaelle; Mao, Zhun; Stokes, Alexia] Univ Montpellier, AMAP, INRA, CIRAD,IRD,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Merino-Martin, Luis] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Zhang, Jiao-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cao, Kun-Fang] Guangxi Univ, State Key Lab Coll Forestay Conservat & Utilizat, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Le Bissonnais, Yves] INRA, UMR LISAH, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Sidle, Roy C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Sidle, Roy C.] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Khorog Gbao, Tajikistan","Stokes, A (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, AMAP, INRA, CIRAD,IRD,CNRS, Montpellier, France.",alexia.stokes@cirad.fr,"Merino-Martin, Luis/H-7207-2013","Merino-Martin, Luis/0000-0002-0343-0546","BMU (Germany) International Climate Initiative funded project 'Ecosystems protecting infrastructure and communities' [11_II+_005_A_EPIC]; Campus France Xuguangqi program ""IMMORTEL"" [34442WB]; INRA PhD demi-bursary","Funding was jointed provided by the BMU (Germany) International Climate Initiative funded project 'Ecosystems protecting infrastructure and communities' (11_II+_005_A_EPIC), a Campus France Xuguangqi program ""IMMORTEL"" (Interactions between biomechanical and morphological root traits and their impact on soil erosion and landslide mitigation, XGC - 34442WB) and an INRA PhD demi-bursary (JN).

In this study, diversity effects on biomass of 12 companion species and 12 genotypes of the dominant species (Stipa grandis) in the Inner Mongolia Steppe of China were examined by two independent diversity experiments. In order to explain the diversity effects, seven plant functional traits for each species or each genotype of S. grandis per mixture treatment were measured and their Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) was estimated. There was significantly positive net species diversity effect on aboveground biomass, which was mainly contributed by complementarity effect; however, net diversity effects were not significant in genotypic diversity experiment. The FDQ among S. grandis genotypes was significantly lower than that among the companion species, and the relatively lower FDQ would increase niche overlap and limit complementarity effect among genotypes. Neither species diversity nor genotypic diversity of S. grandis showed significant influences on belowground biomass, suggesting the non-consistent results of diversity effect between belowground and aboveground systems.

However, knowledge on how biochar addition induces the changes in soil microbial communities with soil depth and time and affects soil respiration is limited in forest ecosystems. We investigated the effects of biochar addition on soil respiration rate and its sensitivity to soil temperature and microbial community composition in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys eduis) plantations in subtropical China for two years. We set up four treatments of biochar addition onto the soil surface of the plantations with the level of 0 (control, CK), 5 (low biochar, LB), 10 (medium biochar, MB), or 20 t biochar ha(-1) (high biochar, HB) in April 2014. Biochar addition significantly improved soil moisture at 5 cm soil depth but did not affect soil temperature. Microbial biomass increased significantly with biochar addition at 10-20 cm soil depth but showed no response in the 0-10 cm depth soil layer. Compared to CK, biochar addition significantly affected the mean soil respiration rate during the two-year experiment, but the difference between CK and biochar treatments decreased both with time following biochar addition and with increasing biochar dosage. Annual cumulative soil respiration was significantly and positively correlated with the biomass of total PLFAs, gram-negative bacteria, bacteria, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (P < 0.05) at 0-10 cm soil depth but not at 10-20 cm. Overall, only LB significant decreased the total CO2 emissions. Our results suggest that lower dosage additions of biochar have a positive effect in reducing total CO2 emissions and promote soil organic carbon sequestration in bamboo forests in subtropical China.","[Ge, Xiaogai; Cao, Yonghui; Zhou, Benzhi; Wang, Xiaoming; Yang, Zhenya] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Subtrop Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ge, Xiaogai; Li, Mai-He] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Ge, Xiaogai; Cao, Yonghui; Zhou, Benzhi; Wang, Xiaoming; Yang, Zhenya] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm China, Qianjiangyuan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Zhou, B (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Subtrop Forestry, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Li, MH (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",bzzhou@caf.ac.cn; maihe.li@wsl.ch,"Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31600492, 31670607]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution [CAFYBB2016SY006, CAFYBB2017ZX002-2, CAFRISF2013002, CAFRISF2014005]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201703270004]; Qianjiangyuan National Forest Ecological Research Station; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds for excellent academic achievements","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31600492 and 31670607), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution (grant nos.

As plant spatial patterns constitute a mosaic of AM fungi habitats, we hypothesized that AM fungal community assembly is determined by plant community structure, both in space and time. We tested our hypothesis by sampling individuals of two host-plant species, Brachypodium pinnatum and Elytrigia repens, from experimental communities cultivated in mesocosms, and assessed their AM fungal root colonizers by mass sequencing. We related AM fungal community structure to the distribution of neighbouring plant species at different spatio-temporal scales. We demonstrated that AM fungal community assembly depends mostly on past plant spatial patterns at a small spatial scale (5 cm), indicating that plants growing at given locations leave a footprint on the AM fungi community. This spatial scale of response was also influenced by the host-plant species, probably by its clonal propagation. Synthesis. Overall, we highlighted that processes involved in Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community assembly do not operate at the rough scale of the overall plant community mosaic but are instead locally determined, delineating the AM fungal 'eye-view' of the host-plant community.","[Bittebiere, Anne-Kristel; Vandenkoornhuyse, Philippe; Maluenda, Elodie; Gareil, Agnes; Mony, Cendrine] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS UMR 6553, Ecobio, Rennes, France; [Bittebiere, Anne-Kristel] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5023, LEHNA, Villeurbanne, France; [Dheilly, Alexandra; Coudouel, Sophie] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS UMS 3343, OSUR, Rennes, France; [Bahin, Mathieu] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS UMR 6074, IRISA, Rennes, France","Bittebiere, AK (reprint author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS UMR 6553, Ecobio, Rennes, France.; Bittebiere, AK (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5023, LEHNA, Villeurbanne, France.",anne-kristel.bittebiere@univ-lyon1.fr,,,"Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-SYSC-012, ANR-10-STRA-002]","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR-08-SYSC-012 and ANR-10-STRA-002",,93,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Further, forest vulnerability to flood is being exacerbated by large hydroelectric dams on Amazon rivers that put upland environments not adapted to flood at unique risk. To address this critical knowledge gap, we evaluated the effects of the extreme 2014 rainfall coupled with the newly constructed Jirau hydroelectric dam on tree survival and forest functionality, in the upper Madeira River basin. We used surveys of campinarana white-sand forests (stems >1 cm in seven 1 ha plots) conducted before and after the extreme flood to test trait-based ecological theory predictions of the impact of flood on overall community function. We found that flooding increased mortality by nearly five-fold (from 3.2% to 15.1%), mostly in smaller trees. This large mortality induced significant and consistent shifts in community function, towards species with conservative life strategies: direct comparison of trait differences between surviving and dying trees showed that survivors had smaller, high density stomata, and higher leaf dry matter content, wood density and root tissue density (RTD). Size and density of stomata and RTD were the most important predictors of species mortality rates. Synthesis and applications. Although focused on a single event in one type of forest, this work highlights the general importance, and need for further study, of interaction between climate change and mega-dams in Amazon forests. In particular, we expect that continued expansion of hydroelectric dams in Amazonia will likely intensify the impact of large floods on forests made newly vulnerable by these dams, with substantial effect on future forest functionality in expanded floodplain areas across the Basin. Hence, these interaction analyses should be required in the Brazilian legal instruments such as the environmental impact assessments and its accompanying Environmental Impacts Reports for large infrastructure projects in Amazon.","[Moser, Pamela] Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Simon, Marcelo Fragomeni; de Medeiros, Marcelo Brilhante] Embrapa Recursos Genet & Biotecnol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Gontijo, Alexandre Bahia] Serv Florestal Brasileiro, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Capelotto Costa, Flavia Regina] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Moser, P (reprint author), Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",moserpamela2@gmail.com,"Simon, Marcelo F./AAA-7161-2019","Simon, Marcelo F./0000-0002-5732-1716",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Energia Sustentavel do Brasil; Fundacao Arthur Bernardes,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Energia Sustentavel do Brasil and Fundacao Arthur Bernardes,,58,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

However, the role of plant economic strategies in the effects of living root activity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics through rhizodeposition remains unexplored, despite SOC being the largest terrestrial carbon pool. Using a continuous C-13-labelling method allowing partitioning of plant and soil sources to carbon fluxes and pools, we studied here the linkages between plant economic strategies and SOC cycling processes in a 'common garden' greenhouse experiment. It includes a panel of 12 grassland species selected along a gradient of economic traits and belonging to three functionnal groups (C3 grasses, forbs and legumes). All species induced an acceleration of native SOC mineralization but this rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) substantially differed across species and varied eleven-fold by the end of the experiment (from +26% to +295% relative to unplanted soil). Interspecific variation in RPE was primarily linked to plant photosynthetic activity associated to species economic strategies of light and CO2 resource acquisition and processing. Fast-growing acquisitive species, such as legumes, featured large RPE, in relation with their high canopy photosynthesis coupled to high leaf photosynthetic capacity and large net primary productivity allocated above-ground. This large RPE was further associated with high root metabolic activity, rhizodeposition and soil microbial activity. In contrast, fine-root growth and economic traits related to soil resource foraging ability were poor predictors of RPE. The formation of new root-derived SOC varied nine-fold across species and was similarly positively related to the net primary productivity allocated above-ground. Fast-growing acquisitive species with a high photosynthetic activity induced a disproportionately large RPE relative to SOC formation. Synthesis. Overall, our study demonstrates that rhizodeposition is a major mechanism through which plant economic strategies of grassland species control soil carbon dynamics. Acquisitive versus conservative species were associated with high versus low rates of photosynthesis and rhizodeposition, in turn leading to fast versus slow SOC turnover. This emphasizes the importance of considering rhizosphere processes for understanding plant species effects on soil biogeochemistry.","[Henneron, Ludovic; Cros, Camille; Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Rahimian, Vida; Fontaine, Sebastien] INRA, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Henneron, Ludovic] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden","Henneron, L (reprint author), INRA, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France.; Henneron, L (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden.",ludovic_henneron@hotmail.com,,,"French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR 14-CE01-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","French National Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: ANR 14-CE01-0004 and ANR-11-LABX-0002-01",,94,0,0,19,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In this study, both field experiment and laboratory incubation (at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C temperatures) were undertaken to examine the effects of N, P and N + P additions on Rs and Rh. Our results showed that N addition significantly increased Rs by 21.09%, but P and N + P additions exhibited no effects on Rs under field conditions. Under laboratory condition, N addition significantly suppressed Rh whereas P and N + P additions increased Rh compared with control. Meanwhile, N and P additions exhibited an antagonistic interaction on Rs, but N and P additions synergistically affected Rh under laboratory incubations at both incubation temperatures of 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Cumulative Rh was negatively correlated with fine root biomass, but was positively correlated with microbial biomass carbon regardless of incubation temperatures.

Below-ground deep anoxic soil is especially important for C accumulation. However, quantitative data on below-ground soil C stocks in mangrove ecosystems are lacking compared with data on above-ground biomass. In addition, soil C accumulation processes in mangrove ecosystems have not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, we quantified soil C stocks and focused on the mass of fallen litter and below-ground roots, which are produced by tree and that may directly influence soil C stocks in a mature subtropical mangrove in the estuary of Fukido River, Ishigaki Island, southwestern Japan. The principal species in this study site were Bruguiera gymnorhiza and Rhizophora stylosa, and total above-ground biomass at the site was 80.7 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- SD) Mg C ha(-1) over the period from 2014 to 2016. Litter was collected in six litter traps from May 2013 to November 2016, it ranged from 7.8 to 11.5 Mg C ha(-1), with the major proportion of litter being from foliage (leaves and stipules). The root C density at 90-cm depth was 27.1 +/- 11.3 Mg C ha(-1). The soil C stock in the mangrove forest at a depth of 90 cm at the study site was 251.0 +/- 34.8 Mg C ha(-1), and it seems to be lower value in the tropical region but it to be higher in subtropical East Asian mangrove sites. Dead roots, especially dead fine roots, but not fallen litter, were significantly positively correlated with soil C stocks. The delta C-13 values obtained from soils ranged from -29.3 parts per thousand to -27.0 parts per thousand; these values are consistent with those for below-ground fine roots. These results strongly suggest that dead fine roots could be a main factor controlling soil C stocks at this study site.","[Limura, Yasuo] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan; [Kinjo, Kazutoshi] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Agr, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan; [Kondo, Miyuki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Measurement & Anal, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, Gifu, Japan","Limura, Y (reprint author), Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan.",iimura.y@ses.usp.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K12186]; Sumitomo Foundation","We thank the members of Laboratory of Soil Science, The University of Shiga Prefecture and Laboratory of Vegetation Function, River Basin Research Center, Gufi University for their assistance with field survey.

Mycologists have traditionally considered fungi to be a nearly exclusively terrestrial group of organisms, but it is now known that fungi have a significant presence in aquatic environments as well. We know little about most fungi in limnic and marine systems, including aspects of their taxonomy, ecology, and geographic distribution. The present study seeks to improve our knowledge of fungi in the marine environment. The fungal communities of two coastal marine environments of the Kattegat sea, Sweden, were explored with metabarcoding techniques using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcode. Our data add new information to the current picture of fungal community composition in benthic and coastal habitats in Northern Europe. New information The dataset describes the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their taxonomic affiliations in two littoral gradients sampled on the Swedish west coast, Gothenburg municipality. Our data include basic diversity indices as well as chemical and edaphic sediment/soil parameters of the sampling sites. From the sites, 3470 and 4315 fungal OTUs, respectively, were recovered. The number of reads were 673,711 and 779,899, respectively, after quality filtering. Within the benthic sites, more than 80% of the sequences could not be classified taxonomically. The phylum composition of the classifiable sequences was dominated in both localities by Dikarya, which made up around 33% of the OTUs. Within Dikarya, Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Guild assignment failed for more than half of the classifiable OTUs, with undefined saprotrophs being the most common resolved guild. This guild classification was slightly more common in the ocean sediment samples than in the terrestrial ones. Our metadata indicated that ocean sites contain organisms at a lower trophic level and that there are predominantly endophytic, parasitic, and pathogenic fungi in the marine environments. This hints at the presence of interesting and currently poorly understood fungus-driven ecological processes. It is also clear from our results that a very large number of marine fungi are in urgent need of taxonomic study and formal description.","[Retter, Alice] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Nilsson, R.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may help plants to cope with expected changes but may also be impacted by changing rainfall, either via the direct effects of low soil moisture on survival and function or indirectly via changes in the plant community. In an Australian mesic grassland (former pasture) system, we characterized plant and AM fungal communities every 6 months for nearly 4 years to two altered rainfall regimes: (a) ambient, (b) rainfall reduced by 50% relative to ambient over the entire year and (c) total summer rainfall exclusion. Using Illumina sequencing, we assessed the response of AM fungal communities sampled from contrasting rainfall treatments and evaluated whether variation in AM fungal communities was associated with variation in plant community richness and composition. We found that rainfall reduction influenced the fungal communities, with the nature of the response depending on the type of manipulation, but that consistent results were only observed after more than 2 years of rainfall manipulation. We observed significant co-associations between plant and AM fungal communities on multiple dates. Predictive co-correspondence analyses indicated more support for the hypothesis that fungal community composition influenced plant community composition than vice versa. However, we found no evidence that altered rainfall regimes were leading to distinct co-associations between plants and AM fungi. Overall, our results provide evidence that grassland plant communities are intricately tied to variation in AM fungal communities. However, in this system, plant responses to climate change may not be directly related to impacts of altered rainfall regimes on AM fungal communities. Synthesis. Our study shows that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities respond to changes in rainfall but that this effect was not immediate. The AM fungal community may influence the composition of the plant community. However, our results suggest that plant responses to altered rainfall regimes at our site may not be resulting via changes in the AM fungal communities.","[Deveautour, Coline; Power, Sally A.; Donn, Suzanne; Powell, Jeff R.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Barnett, Kirk L.] SWCA Environm Consulting, Lombard, IL USA; [Ochoa-Hueso, Raul] Univ Cadiz, Dept Biol, IVAGRO, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario CeiA3, Cadiz, Spain; [Bennett, Alison E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Aronoff Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Deveautour, C (reprint author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia.",c.deveautour@westernsydney.edu.au,"Ochoa-Hueso, Raul/K-1113-2016","Ochoa-Hueso, Raul/0000-0002-1839-6926",Western Sydney University; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP140103936]; OECD Co-operative Research Programme Secretariat; Stapledon Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment Research Exchange Program; Royal Entomological Society Outreach Fund; British Ecological Society; Scottish Government Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division; MICIU; Hermon Slade Foundation; Trade and Agriculture Directorate,"Western Sydney University; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP140103936; Hermon Slade Foundation; OECD Co-operative Research Programme Secretariat; Trade and Agriculture Directorate; Stapledon Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment Research Exchange Program; Royal Entomological Society Outreach Fund; British Ecological Society Grant; Scottish Government Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division; MICIU",,51,0,0,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, the side-effects of this land-use transformation have been in many cases underestimated. Particularly, the hydrological impacts may become relevant in (semi)arid regions where water is a key element. In this work, we evaluated the hydrological effects triggered by afforestation with ponderosa pine in the semiarid Argentine Patagonia that is currently a focus of afforestation programs. For this purpose, we used complementary approaches that included hydrological modelling (DINAQUA model), satellite image analysis, and soil wetness data. All analyses provided convergent results into hydrological effects of afforestation. The modelling results showed that afforestation significantly increased transpiration in relation to native grass-shrub steppe. In the steppe in degraded condition, transpiration accounted for only 10% (40 mm year(-1)) of total water flux, whereas in adult pine plantations, it accounted for up to 73% (277 mm year(-1)). Deep drainage was also severely affected by afforestation as it decreased from 182 mm year(-1) in the steppe to zero in adult plantations, according to model simulations. Estimates from Landsat images also showed that evapotranspiration was higher in plantations compared with the steppe. Soil wetness data also revealed significantly drier soils in plantations. Our results indicate that pine plantations in the semiarid Patagonia evaporate all rainfall inputs, resulting in zero deep drainage and groundwater recharge. If the afforested area in the region increases, downstream meadow ecosystems, which are hotspots of primary productivity, may be negatively impacted.","[Milkovic, Mayra] Fdn Vida Silvestre Argentina, Dept Desarrollo Sustentable, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paruelo, Jose M.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, IFEVA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paruelo, Jose M.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paruelo, Jose M.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paruelo, Jose M.] INIA, Estn Expt Estanzuela, Colonia, Uruguay; [Paruelo, Jose M.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, IECA, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Nosetto, Marcelo D.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IMASL, Grp Estudios Ambientales, San Luis, Argentina; [Nosetto, Marcelo D.] Univ Nacl San Luis, San Luis, Argentina; [Nosetto, Marcelo D.] UNER, Fac Ciencias Agr, Oro Verde, Argentina","Nosetto, MD (reprint author), UNER, Fac Ciencias Agr, Catedra Climatol Agr, Ruta 11,Km 10, Oro Verde, Entre Rios, Argentina.",marcelo.nosetto@gmail.com,,,,,,75,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,SEP,2019,12,6,,,,,,,UNSP e2113,10.1002/eco.2113,,,11,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JC4SL,WOS:000489267200010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Xu, YD; Zhang, W; Zhong, ZK; Guo, SJ; Han, XH; Yang, GH; Ren, CJ; Chen, ZX; Dai, YY; Qiao, WJ",,,,"Xu, Yadong; Zhang, Wei; Zhong, Zekun; Guo, Shujuan; Han, Xinhui; Yang, Gaihe; Ren, Chengjie; Chen, Zhengxing; Dai, Yinyue; Qiao, Wenjing",,,Vegetation Restoration Alters the Diversity and Community Composition of Soil Nitrogen-Fixing Microorganisms in the Loess Hilly Region of China,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; CNP STOICHIOMETRY; FINE-ROOT; RHIZOSPHERE; FIXATION; PLANT; AFFORESTATION; DIAZOTROPHS; DYNAMICS,"In this study, we determined the variations in the diversity and structure of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms during afforestation and how this variability correlates with the soil physicochemical factors. Soils were sampled from replicated plots representing three revegetation types (Robinia pseudoacacia L. [Rp], Caragana korshimkii Kom [Ck], and abandoned land) with adjacent farmland as the control at a research site in Ansai District, Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province, China. Using high-throughput sequencing of the nifH rRNA gene, we found that revegetation significantly increased the Shannon diversity index, and for the richness index Chao1 was highest in Ck and have no significant difference in other three lands. From farmland to vegetation types abandoned land, Ck, and Rp, the dominant phylum of nifH microorganisms changed from Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria. Furthormore, variation in the Chao1 richness index was significantly influenced by pH (p = 0.002), soil organic carbon (SOC; p = 0.025) and total nitrogen (TN; p = 0.015). The Shannon diversity index was significantly influenced by SOC, nitrate nitrogen (NN), C to P ratio, TN, AN, N to P ratio, TP, and sand. The changes of nifH microorganism composition at the phylum level were significantly correlated with the soil N to P ratio, which explained 53.1% of the variation among environmental factors (F = 11.8, p = 0.002). The ratio of N to P (interpretation rate 65.2%, F = 18.8, p = 0.002) was also a key factor that influenced the composition at the genus level. Based on the diversity and composition, Ck was a more advantageous recovery method to increase the capacity for N fixation. This study provides a basis for the study of N-fixation characteristics in the Loess Hilly Region.","[Yang, Gaihe; Ren, Chengjie] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Yang, GH; Ren, CJ (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",ygh@nwsuaf.edu.cn; rencj1991@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,National Natural Key Research and Development Program of China [41877543]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571501],"This study was supported by the National Natural Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 41877543) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41571501).

Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) may accelerate soil structure regeneration as it can grow roots under anaerobic soil conditions. However, symbiotic nitrogen fixation by alder can have undesirable side-effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this study, we evaluated the possible trade-off between alder-mediated structure recovery and GHG emissions. We compared two directly adjacent 15-year old beech (Fagus sylvatica) and alder stands (loamy texture, pH 5-6), including old planted skid trails. The last soil trafficking on the skid trails took place in 1999. GHG fluxes were measured over one year. Undisturbed plots with beech had a moderately higher total porosity and were lower in soil moisture and soil organic carbon than undisturbed alder plots. No differences in mineral nitrogen were found. N2O emissions in the undisturbed beech stand were 0.4 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and 3.1 kg ha(-1) y(-1) in the undisturbed alder stand. CH4 uptake was 4.0 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and 1.5 kg ha(-1) y(-1) under beech and alder, respectively. On the beech planted skid trail, topsoil compaction was still evident by reduced macro porosity and soil aeration; on the alder planted skid trail, soil structure of the uppermost soil layer was completely recovered. Skid trail N2O fluxes under beech were five times higher and CH4 oxidation was 0.6 times lower compared to the adjacent undisturbed beech stand. Under alder, no skid-trail-effects on GHG fluxes were evident. Multiple regression modelling revealed that N2O and CH4 emissions were mainly governed by soil aeration and soil temperature. Compared to beech, alder considerably increased net fluxes of GHG on undisturbed plots. However, for skid trails we suggest that black alder improves soil structure without deterioration of the stand's greenhouse gas balance, when planted only on the compacted areas.","[Warlo, Hannes; Lang, Friederike; Schack-Kirchner, Helmer] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [von Wilpert, Klaus] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Soil & Environm, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Warlo, H (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",hannes.warlo@bodenkunde.uni-freiburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture [FNR-22029114],"This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, grant number FNR-22029114.",,84,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2019,10,9,,,,,,,726,10.3390/f10090726,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,JA6VA,WOS:000487978700082,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Lubin, TK; Schultz, P; Bever, JD; Alexander, HM",,,,"Lubin, Terra K.; Schultz, Peggy; Bever, James D.; Alexander, Helen M.",,,Are two strategies better than one?

Knowledge of how to best use multiple strategies could improve restoration outcomes. Here, we examine two commonly suggested strategies in a single tallgrass prairie restoration experiment: increased forb sowing density and prairie soil inoculation. We designed a study with two different forb seeding densities. Within these densities, we transplanted seedlings into 1-m(2) plots that had been grown in either a whole prairie soil inoculum or sterilized prairie soil. After 4 years, we found positive effects of both high forb sowing density and inoculation treatments on the ratio of seeded to nonseeded plant cover in these plots, and negative effects of both treatments on nonseeded plant diversity. No effects of either treatment were seen on seeded plant diversity. Each strategy also affected the plant community in different ways: high forb sowing density increased seeded forb richness and decreased native nonseeded plant cover, while inoculation decreased non-native cover, and tended to increase average successional stage of the community. These effects on restoration outcome were typically independent of each other, with the result that plots with both manipulations had the most positive effects on restoration outcomes. We thus advocate the combined use of these restoration strategies, and further studies which focus on both seeding and soil community manipulation in restoration.","[Lubin, Terra K.; Bever, James D.; Alexander, Helen M.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lubin, Terra K.; Schultz, Peggy; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Schultz, Peggy] Univ Kansas, Environm Studies Program, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Lubin, TK (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Lubin, TK (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",tkachina@ku.edu,,,,,,86,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Methods Rhizobia trapped with V. sativa plants from soils at six sites in the northwest of China were classified into genotypes by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) and 16S rRNA genes, and phylogenetic analyses of housekeeping (16S rRNA, recA, atpD) and symbiotic genes were performed for the representative strains. Soil physicochemical characteristics were recorded and canonical correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlations between soil features and distribution of rhizobial genotypes. Results A total of 202 rhizobial isolates were discriminated by RFLP analyses into 15 IGS types and a single 16S rRNA type, which were identified as Rhizobium by 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and as four clusters by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). Cluster 1 covering 86 strains and 7 IGS types prevalent in all sites was identified as Rhizobium laguerreae; cluster 2 was R. sophorae with 18 strains in 2 IGS types found in the site Q-GD. Each of cluster 3 and cluster 4 contained three IGS types representing two novel Rhizobium genospecies specific to Gansu Province and Shanxi Province, respectively. Four nodC phylogenetic clades were defined among the isolates. Conclusions R. sophorae, R. laguerreae, and two novel Rhizobium genospecies with diverse symbiotic genotypes are associated with Vicia sativa L. in Northwest China. Their biogeographic patterns are mainly directed by soil pH and salinity. This is the first study on the diversity of rhizobia nodulating Vicia sativa in China.","[Zhang, Junjie; Shang, Yimin; Peng, Shanshan; Guo, Chen] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Henan Key Lab Cold Chain Food Qual & Safety Contr, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Food Prod & Safety Henan P, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Rhizobium Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Entao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [de Lajudie, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, IRD, LSTM, CIRAD,INRA,SupAgro, Campus Baillarguet TA-A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Li, Benyin; Liu, Chunzeng] Henan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Nutr & Resource Environm, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China","Zhang, JJ (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.; Liu, CZ (reprint author), Henan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Nutr & Resource Environm, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",kirka640@163.com; liucz321@aliyun.com,"de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008","de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352","China Agriculture Research System - Green Manure [CARS-22]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400008]; National Human and Social Security Ministry of Science and Technology for Overseas Returnees [21104000005]; Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico [SIP20171259]","This work was financed by China Agriculture Research System - Green Manure (Project No. CARS-22), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31400008), and National Human and Social Security Ministry of Science and Technology for Overseas Returnees (Project No. 21104000005).

To do this, the use of mass-balance models in combination with hyphal in-growth mesh bags (""in-growth bags"") was proposed in recent studies. However, poor knowledge on the decomposition of field-grown EMH prevents confirmation of assumed EMH decomposition dynamics. In this study, we determined the decrease in hyphal length density of field-grown EMH of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) over eight months in in-growth bags incubated in a warm-temperate Chamaecyparis obtusa forest, to study EMH decomposition under field conditions. We used exponential decay models to describe the changes in the decomposition rate of EMH over the incubation time, between EMH diameter classes, and between seasons. A rapid decrease of the decomposition rate of EMH within two months from 2.5 to 0.1 month(-1) was estimated, corresponding to an increase in half-life from 0.3 to 7 months. Furthermore, significant differences in the initial maximum decomposition rate were estimated between fine (1.6 month(-1); minimum half-life: 0.4 months) and coarse EMH (3.1 month(-1); minimum half-life: 0.2 months) and between incubations during spring-summer (April and August; 2.7 month(-1); minimum half-life: 0.3 months) and autumn-winter (October and February; 1.1 month(-1); minimum half-life: 0.6 months). This large variability in the decomposition rates of EMH of AM fungi has to be considered in mass-balance models to estimate C fluxes between plants, soil, and the atmosphere.","[Schafer, Holger; Dannoura, Masako; Osawa, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Lab Ecosyst Prod & Dynam, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako; Osawa, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Forest Utilizat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Ataka, Mioko] Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto 6110011, Japan","Schafer, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Lab Ecosyst Prod & Dynam, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",schaefer.holger.24x@kyoto-u.jp,,,Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society [29-516],"The authors thank Jerome Bertrand for assistance with fieldwork and Yoshiko Kosugi for providing access to the Kiryu Experimental Watershed, her advice on the plot location, and comments on the manuscript.

One of the most important interactions involving plants is the interaction between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. While there is a mounting body of research that has studied the architecture of plant-fungus interaction networks, less is known about the potential factors that drive network architecture. In this study, we described the architecture of the network of interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and 44 orchid species that represented different life forms and co-occurred in tropical forest and assessed the relative importance of ecological, evolutionary and co-evolutionary mechanisms determining network architecture. We found 87 different fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), most of which were members of the Tulasnellaceae. Most orchid species associated with multiple fungi simultaneously, indicating that extreme host selectivity was rare. However, an increasing specificity towards Tulasnellaceae fungal associates from terrestrial to epiphytic and lithophytic orchids was observed. The network of interactions showed an association pattern that was significantly modular (M = 0.7389, M-random = 0.6998) and nested (NODF = 5.53, p < 0.05). Terrestrial orchids had almost no links to modules containing epiphytic or lithophytic orchids, while modules containing epiphytic orchids also contained lithophytic orchids. Within each life form several modules were observed, suggesting that the processes that organize orchid-fungus interactions are independent of life form. The overall phylogenetic signal for both partners in the interaction network was very weak. Overall, these results indicate that tropical orchids associate with a wide number of mycorrhizal fungi and that ecological rather than phylogenetic constraints determine network architecture.","[Xing, Xiaoke; Gai, Xuege; Gao, Yue; Zhao, Zeyu; Guo, Shunxing] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, CN-100193 Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xiaoke; Gai, Xuege; Gao, Yue; Zhao, Zeyu; Guo, Shunxing] Peking Union Med Coll, CN-100193 Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Leuven, Belgium; [Liu, Qiang] Yunnan Forestry Technol Coll, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Xing, XK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioact Subst & Resources Utilizat Chinese, CN-100193 Beijing, Peoples R China.; Xing, XK (reprint author), Peking Union Med Coll, CN-100193 Beijing, Peoples R China.",xkxing2009@hotmail.com,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Xing, Xiaoke/0000-0002-1845-5076",Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81274197]; CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine [2016-I2M-2-002]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201708110111],"This research was financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (81274197), CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine (No. 2016-I2M-2-002) and China Scholarship Council (201708110111).",,69,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2019,128,9,,,,,1254,1264,,10.1111/oik.06363,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IU6PR,WOS:000483708700003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Buckton, G; Cheesman, AW; Munksgaard, NC; Wurster, CM; Liddell, MJ; Cernusak, LA",,,,"Buckton, Genevieve; Cheesman, Alexander W.; Munksgaard, Niels C.; Wurster, Chris M.; Liddell, Michael J.; Cernusak, Lucas A.",,,Functional traits of lianas in an Australian lowland rainforest align with post-disturbance rather than dry season advantage,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,functional traits; leaf gas exchange; liana; stable isotopes; tropical rainforest,REDUCE CARBON ACCUMULATION; TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; ELEVATED CO2; INCLUDING LIANAS; WATER-UPTAKE; PLANT WATER; TREES; DELTA-O-18; ABUNDANCE,"Lianas are an important component of tropical forests; they alter tree mortality and recruitment and impact biogeochemical cycling. Recent evidence suggests that the abundance of lianas in tropical forests is increasing. To understand and predict the effect of lianas on ecosystem processes in tropical forests, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which they compete with trees. In this study, we investigated the functional traits of lianas and trees in a lowland tropical forest in northeast Queensland, Australia. The site is located at 16.1 degrees south latitude and experiences significant seasonality in rainfall, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. It is also subject to relatively frequent disturbance by cyclones. We asked the question of whether the canopy liana community at this site would display functional traits consistent with a competitive advantage over trees in response to disturbance, or in response to dry season water stress. We found that traits that we considered indicative of a dry season advantage (xylem water delta O-18 as an indicator of rooting depth; leaf and stem tissue delta C-13 and instantaneous gas exchange as measures of water-use efficiency) did not differ between canopy lianas and canopy trees. On the other hand, lianas differed from trees in traits that should confer an advantage in response to disturbance (low wood density; low leaf dry matter content; high leaf N concentration; high mass-based photosynthetic rates). We conclude that the liana community at the study site expressed functional traits geared towards rapid resource acquisition and growth in response to disturbance, rather than outcompeting trees during periods of water stress. These results contribute to a body of literature which will be useful for parameterising a liana functional type in ecosystem models.","[Buckton, Genevieve; Cheesman, Alexander W.; Munksgaard, Niels C.; Wurster, Chris M.; Liddell, Michael J.; Cernusak, Lucas A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Buckton, Genevieve; Cheesman, Alexander W.; Munksgaard, Niels C.; Wurster, Chris M.; Liddell, Michael J.; Cernusak, Lucas A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Munksgaard, Niels C.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Ellengowan Dr, Darwin, NT, Australia","Cernusak, LA (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld, Australia.; Cernusak, LA (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld, Australia.",lucas.cernusak@jcu.edu.au,"Cernusak, Lucas/A-6859-2011; Cheesman, Alexander/H-5918-2013","Cernusak, Lucas/0000-0002-7575-5526; Cheesman, Alexander/0000-0003-3931-5766",,,,63,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,SEP,2019,44,6,,,,,983,994,,10.1111/aec.12764,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IT6HN,WOS:000482972800004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ahmed, IU; Smith, AR; Godbold, DL",,,,"Ahmed, Iftekhar U.; Smith, Andrew R.; Godbold, Douglas L.",,,Polyculture affects biomass production of component species but not total standing biomass and soil carbon stocks in a temperate forest plantation,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Woody biomass; Root biomass; Tree polyculture; Mixture effect; Soil C,SPRUCE PICEA-ABIES; TREE PLANTATIONS; ORGANIC-CARBON; EUCALYPTUS; AFFORESTATION; DIVERSITY; TURNOVER; IDENTITY; STORAGE; SYSTEM,"Key message Over-yielding of stand biomass did not occur in a tree polyculture comprised of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Fagus sylvatica selected for contrasting traits.

Gaertn, Betula pendula Roth and Fagus sylvatica L. in a plantation forest to examine the effectiveness of species mixtures as a tool for increased biomass production and soil C accumulation. Methods Tree biomass was estimated by developing species-specific allometric models and 3 years tree measurement. Fine root biomass and production were estimated by root coring and root-mesh methods. The 'relative yield of mixture' approach was used to examine the mixture effect. Results In mixture, an additive effect was observed in A. glutinosa (13% increase in basal diameter relative to the monoculture); however, there was no overall effect of mixture on total standing biomass due to the suppression of F. sylvatica (2.75 g m(-2) reduction in woody biomass). Fine root biomass production showed no mixture effect. The quantity and quality of soil C (top 0.5 m) was not affected by tree mixture. Conclusion We conclude that the contrasting growth responses of the A. glutinosa, B. pendula and F. sylvatica in polyculture resulted in no over-yielding of standing biomass despite the complementary traits of the component species.","[Ahmed, Iftekhar U.; Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Bodenkultur BOKU, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Smith, Andrew R.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Godbold, Douglas L.] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Dept Landscape Carbon Deposit, Global Change Res Inst, Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic","Ahmed, IU (reprint author), Univ Bodenkultur BOKU, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",iftekhar.ahmed@boku.ac.at,,"Ahmed, Iftekhar Uddin/0000-0002-2747-1561",University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU); ForeStClim; Forestry Commission UK; INTERREG IVB North-West Europe project 003A ForeStClim,Open access funding provided by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU).

We found that AM fungal colonization declined significantly at the highest P level and was negatively related to soil available phosphorus, suggesting a decreased reliance on AM fungi at this high P level. A total of 22 operational taxonomic units (OTU5) from three families were detected in roots and 25 in soil. Both AM fungal OTU richness and diversity in soil were higher than that in roots. The AM fungal diversity in roots declined significantly when P was the highest. The indicator species in roots increased in relative abundance in the P1 treatment (75 kg P2O5 ha(-1) a(-1)). Although P addition had no significant effect on OTU richness or AM fungal community composition in soil, we found that pH and soil organic matter structured roots and soil mycorrhizal communities, respectively. In conclusion, P addition affected root and soil AM fungal communities differently. Further research is needed to determine how individual AM fungal species may respond to P fertilization, and how this may impact plant productivity.","[Hu, Jiali; Lin, Xin; Ji, Baoming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Grassland Sci, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Bentivenga, Stephen P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Hou, Xiang-yang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grassland Res Inst, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China","Ji, BM (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Grassland Sci, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",baomingji@bjfu.edu.cn,,,"Chengdu Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31770542, 31761123001-1]; Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare [201404204-05A]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017jc08]","We would like to thank Ping Wang and Ai-bao Li for the assistance with field sampling, and Chengdu Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for the support on high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

Materials and methods We have used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (3D GM) to analyze the distal radius ligament insertion sites in 31 Homo sapiens, 25 Pan troglodytes, 31 Gorilla gorilla, and 15 Pongo pygmaeus. We have also dissected the radioscaphocapitate (RSC), long radiolunate (LRL) and short radiolunate (SRL) ligaments in six H. sapiens and five P. troglodytes to obtain quantitative values that were then compared with the results of the 3D GM analysis. Results H. sapiens had a relatively larger insertion site of the RSC + LRL ligament than the other hominoid primates. P. pygmaeus and P. troglodytes had a relatively large SRL ligament insertion site with a palmar orientation. In G. gorilla, the two ligament insertion sites were relatively smaller and the SRL insertion site had an ulnopalmar orientation. Discussion The morphological differences observed can be related to the types of locomotion used by the different species and to quantitative data obtained from the dissection of ligaments in H. sapiens and P. troglodytes. 3D GM analysis of ligament insertion sites can help in interpreting the types of locomotion used by extinct hominoid primates through the analysis of preserved fossilized fragments of the distal radius.","[Casado, Aroa; Punsola, Vicenc; Gomez, Monica; de Diego, Marina; Potau, Josep M.] Univ Barcelona, Unit Human Anat & Embryol, C Casanova 143, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Barbosa, Mercedes; de Paz, Felix J.; Pastor, Juan F.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Anat & Radiol, Valladolid, Spain","Potau, JM (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Unit Human Anat & Embryol, C Casanova 143, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain.",jpotau@ub.edu,"barbosa, mercedes/AAA-2027-2019; De Paz, FAlix/Z-5771-2019; Pastor, J F/Z-5770-2019; Potau, Josep Maria/L-1037-2016","De Paz, FAlix/0000-0001-9197-7471; Pastor, J F/0000-0001-8371-5025; Potau, Josep Maria/0000-0003-3387-8760",European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU) [CGL2014-52611-C2-2-P]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Ministry of Economy & Competitiveness; Universitat de Barcelona [APIF-UB 2016/2017],,,45,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Feb-83,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

The experiment was performed with two grass species (Poa compressa, Festuca rubra) and two herb species (Centaurea jacea, Lotus corniculatus) which are characteristic of intermediate succession stages in post-mining sites. Three months before the start of the experiment, bacteria, saprophytic fungi, protists, and their combined treatments were inoculated into the soil. At the start of the experiment, half of the pots were inoculated with mycorrhiza. After 60 days, plants were harvested and shoot and root biomass and microbial respiration and biomass were assessed. Above- and belowground plant biomass was significantly lower in the treatments with mycorrhiza. The effect was significant for aboveground biomass of grasses, especially that of Poa compressa, and for grass/herb ratio but not for herbs. Microbial respiration was also lower with mycorrhiza. Among microbial community treatments, saprophytic fungi showed significant effects on plant growth. The results showed the importance of mycorrhizal fungi on plant biomass and its interaction with different plant species and microbial groups which would be useful when extrapolating these results to a natural environment.","[Ardestani, Masoud M.; Frouz, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic; [Ardestani, Masoud M.; Jilkova, Veronika; Frouz, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Soil Biol, Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Ardestani, Masoud M.; Jilkova, Veronika; Frouz, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, SoWa RI, Biol Ctr, Sadkach 7, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Bonkowski, Michael] Univ Cologne, Terr Ecol, Inst Zool, Zulpicher Str 47b, D-50674 Cologne, Germany","Ardestani, MM (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic.",mortazavi_m2000@yahoo.com,,,"Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [L200961602]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-MEYSMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LM2015075, EF16_013/0001782]; Charles University Research Centre program [204069]","This study was supported by the Czech Academy of Sciences (Grant No. L200961602) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic-MEYS (Projects LM2015075, EF16_013/0001782).

These patterns are similar to those observed in arid and semiarid systems around the globe, but our ability to predict which species will experience increased drought-induced mortality in response to climate change remains limited. We investigated meteorological drought-induced mortality of nine dominant plant species in the Colorado Plateau Desert by experimentally imposing a year-round 35% precipitation reduction for eight continuous years. We distributed experimental plots across numerous plant, soil, and parent material types, resulting in 40 distinct sites across a 4,500 km(2) region of the Colorado Plateau Desert. For all 8 years, we tracked c. 400 individual plants and evaluated mortality responses to treatments within and across species, and through time. We also examined the influence of abiotic and biotic site factors in driving mortality responses. Overall, high mortality trends were driven by dominant grass species, including Achnatherum hymenoides, Pleuraphis jamesii, and Sporobolus cryptandrus. Responses varied widely from year to year and dominant shrub species were generally resistant to meteorological drought, likely due to their ability to access deeper soil water. Importantly, mortality increased in the presence of invasive species regardless of treatment, and native plant die-off occurred even under ambient conditions, suggesting that recent climate changes are already negatively impacting dominant species in these systems. Results from this long-term drought experiment suggest major shifts in community composition and, as a result, ecosystem function. Patterns also show that, across multiple soil and plant community types, native perennial grass species may be replaced by shrubs and invasive annuals in the Colorado Plateau Desert.","[Winkler, Daniel E.; Belnap, Jayne; Reed, Sasha C.; Duniway, Michael C.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Hoover, David] ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, USDA, Ft Collins, CO USA","Winkler, DE (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA.",dwinkler@usgs.gov,"Winkler, Daniel E./C-5710-2019","Winkler, Daniel E./0000-0003-4825-9073",,,,141,3,3,20,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Hook plantations differed significantly among tissue types and were greater for aboveground than belowground tissues. Plantation C stock increased with a developmental stage from young to mature to overmature, but at all stages, the majority occurred as soil organic carbon (SOC) and was more influenced by belowground fine roots than by aboveground litterfall.ContextFailing to account for tissue-specific variation in the C concentration can result in inaccurate forest C stock estimates.AimsWe aimed to quantify the relative magnitudes of C stock for Chinese fir plantations at different developmental stages. Specifically, we focused on assessing tissue-specific C concentrations and C dynamics return of above- and belowground litterfall.MethodsCarbon traits (C concentration, C flux, C stock, and distribution at tree and ecosystem scales) were quantified in a chronosequence of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) monoculture plantation stands at young (10), mature (22), and overmature (34 years old) developmental stages.ResultsCarbon concentrations differed significantly among tissue types, with mean values of 48.5 0.1% and 42.5 +/- 0.2% for above- and belowground biomass, respectively. The aboveground tissue C concentration, tree- and plantation-scale C stock, and SOC stock depended on developmental stage. Carbon return in litterfall, tree C stock, and SOC increased from the young to the overmature stage. SOC stock accounted for the majority of plantation C stock at all developmental stages (78.3, 59.6, and 55.7% in the young, mature, and overmature stages, respectively) and was more highly influenced by belowground fine roots than aboveground litterfall. Carbon stocks in Chinese fir plantations were 86, 129, and 153 t ha(-2) at the young, mature, and overmature stages.ConclusionProlonging Chinese fir rotation increases C sequestration potential and should be the focus of forest management strategies. The tissue-specific C concentrations provide detailed information for more accurate biomass C stock estimates for Chinese fir plantations and other subtropical coniferous forests. They indicate that current guidelines result in an overestimation of belowground biomass C stocks. Using the standard 0.47 biomass to C conversion factor, the belowground C stock would have been overestimated by 7.6-13.0% for the Chinese fir developmental stages investigated, while tree C stock would be underestimated by 0.08-3.24%. Therefore, developing species- and tissue-specific conversion factors are required for supporting C plantation and forest C accounting strategies.","[Zhou, Lili] Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lili; Ma, Xiangqing] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Fujian Prov Coll & Univ Engn Res Ctr Sustainable, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Shubin; Liu, Bo; Wu, Pengfei; Ma, Xiangqing] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Forestry Coll, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Shubin; Liu, Bo; Wu, Pengfei; Ma, Xiangqing] State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Chinese Fir Engn Technol Res Ctr, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Heal, Kate V.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland","Ma, XQ (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Fujian Prov Coll & Univ Engn Res Ctr Sustainable, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Ma, XQ (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Forestry Coll, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Ma, XQ (reprint author), State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Chinese Fir Engn Technol Res Ctr, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lxymxq@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31800532]; National Natural Science Foundation of Fujian ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2018J05059]; National key research and development plan [2016YFD0600301]; Forestry Science and Technology Project of Fujian Province [16]; Open project of Fujian Provincial Colleges and University Engineering Research Center of Plantation Sustainable Management [PSM2017002],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31800532), the National Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (No. 2018J05059), the National key research and development plan (No. 2016YFD0600301), Forestry Science and Technology Project of Fujian Province (No. 16, 2019) and the Open project of Fujian Provincial Colleges and University Engineering Research Center of Plantation Sustainable Management (No. PSM2017002).",,72,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

The objective of the study was to examine the effect of different fertilisation regimes on fungal and oomycete pathogen- and mycorrhizal symbiont diversity and community structure in both soil and roots, using PacBio SMRT sequencing. The field experiment included three fertilisation treatments that have been applied since 1989: nitrogen fertilisation (WOM), nitrogen fertilisation with manure amendment (FYM) and alternative organic fertilisation (AOF), each applied at five different rates. Soil samples were collected three times during the growing season, while root samples were collected during the flowering stage. There was no influence of the studied variables on soil and root pathogen richness. Contrary to our hypothesis, pathogen relative abundance in both soil and roots was significantly higher in plots with the AOF treatment. Furthermore, richness and relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi decreased significantly in the AOF treatment. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) demonstrated the effect of fertilisation treatment on pathogen community composition in both soil and roots. Our findings indicate that organic fertilisers may not always benefit soil microbial community composition. Therefore, further studies are needed to understand how fertilisation affects mycorrhizal mutualists and pathogens.","[Soonvald, Liina; Loit, Kaire; Runno-Paurson, Eve; Astover, Alar] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Tedersoo, Leho] Univ Tartu, Nat Hist Museum, Ravila 14a, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia","Soonvald, L (reprint author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",Liina.Soonvald@emu.ee,,"Astover, Alar/0000-0002-8924-6925","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Southeastern Regional Health Authorities; Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [PUT1399, RESIST 3.2.0701.11-0003]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT36-2]; Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [9432]; Estonian University of Life Sciences [PM170156PKTK, P17006PKML]","The sequencing service was provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (www.sequencing.uio.no), a national technology platform hosted by the University of Oslo and supported by the ""Functional Genomics"" and ""Infrastructure"" programs of the Research Council of Norway and the Southeastern Regional Health Authorities.

Currently, we do not have a predictive framework for understanding which plant species are sensitive to different AM fungal species. In two greenhouse studies, we tested for differences in plant sensitivity to different AM fungal species and mycorrhizal responsiveness across 17 grassland plant species of North America that varied in successional stage, native status, and plant family by growing plants with different AM fungal treatments including eight single AM fungal isolates, diverse mixtures of AM fungi, and non-inoculated controls. We found that late successional grassland plant species were highly responsive to AM fungi and exhibited stronger sensitivity in their response to individual AM fungal taxa compared to nonnative or early successional native grassland plant species. We confirmed these results using a meta-analysis that included 13 experiments, 37 plant species, and 40 fungal isolates (from nine publications and two greenhouse experiments presented herein). Mycorrhizal responsiveness and sensitivity of response (i.e., variation in plant biomass response to different AM fungal taxa) did not differ by the source of fungal inocula (i.e., local or not local) or plant family. Sensitivity of plant response to AM fungal species was consistently correlated with the average mycorrhizal response of that plant species. This study identifies that AM fungal identity is more important to the growth of late successional plant species than early successional or nonnative plant species, thereby predicting that AM fungal composition will be more important to plant community dynamics in late successional communities than in early successional or invaded plant communities.","[Cheeke, Tanya E.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 2710 Crimson Way, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Zheng, Chaoyuan] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, 15 Shangxiadian Rd, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Koziol, Liz] Kansas Biol Stn, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66044 USA; [Gurholt, Carli R.] Wisconsin Sch Profess Psychol, 9120 W Hampton Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53225 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Stn & Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA","Cheeke, TE (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 2710 Crimson Way, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",tanya.cheeke@wsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellowship in BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1401729]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919434, DEB-1556664, DEB 1738041, OIA 1656006]; SERDP [RC-2330]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2016-67011-25166]; Perennial Agricultural Project - Malone Family Foundation; Land Institute; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41601244]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2016J01176]","Funding for this work was provided by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology to T.

Shift in precipitation is one of the most pertinent global change factors driving changes in structure and function of grasslands. However, few studies have investigated intraspecific variation of root traits in response to precipitation change under field conditions. We conducted a 10-year simulated increased precipitation experiment in a temperate grassland and a 700-km regional scale transect along a precipitation gradient ranging from 144.23 to 412.29 mm in northern China. The morphological, chemical and anatomical traits of the first two-order roots were determined on 15 common herbaceous species in the manipulation experiment and two regionally common species (Leymus chinensis, Artemisia frigida) along a precipitation gradient. We found that most of the root traits of the herbaceous species exhibited no significant responses to water addition. The two regionally common species adjusted their root traits at sites with the annual precipitation lower than certain value, that is 250 and 160 mm for L. chinensis and A. frigida, respectively. These results indicate that root traits of the herbaceous species exhibit little plasticity in response to precipitation change and that the adjustment of root traits occurs when the range of annual precipitation exceeds a certain threshold. Root traits of L. chinensis and A. frigida varied differently both in manipulation experiment and along the precipitation gradient. Root traits of L. chinensis were relatively constant, while A. frigida adjusted their morphological root traits in response to water addition. Moreover, L. chinensis showed higher specific root length (SRL) and area, and root N contents at sites with annual precipitation lower than c. 250 mm. In contrast, A. frigida displayed thicker roots with lower SRL and area at sites with annual precipitation lower than c. 160 mm. Our results showed that root traits of herbaceous species in temperate grasslands exhibited little plasticity and that different species have evolved diverse adaptive strategies in response to precipitation change. These novel findings provide valuable information to predict responses of temperate grasslands to future climate change.","[Zhou, Meng; Wang, Jing; Bai, Wenming; Zhang, Yushi; Zhang, Wen-Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Meng; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Yushi; Zhang, Wen-Hao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bai, Wenming; Zhang, Wen-Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inner Mongolia Res Ctr Prataculture, Beijing, Peoples R China","Bai, WM; Zhang, WH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhang, WH (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Bai, WM; Zhang, WH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inner Mongolia Res Ctr Prataculture, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bwming@ibcas.ac.cn; whzhang@ibcas.ac.cn,"Zhang, Wen-Hao/B-5805-2009","Zhang, Wen-Hao/0000-0003-2708-2221","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670481, 31370468]; State Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2016YFC0500706]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31670481, 31370468; State Key Basic Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500706",,76,0,0,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Little is known about the coordinated variations of performance and functional traits of different organs in invasive plants, especially in response to their adaptation to environmental stressors. To identify the responses of the invasive species Solidago canadensis to drought, 180 individuals were randomly collected from 15 populations and 212 ramets were replanted in a greenhouse to investigate both the response and coordination between root and leaf functional traits. Drought significantly decreased plant growth and most of the root and leaf functional traits, that is, root length, surface area, volume and leaf size, number, and mass fraction, except for the root length ratio and root mass fraction. Phenotypic plasticity was higher in root traits than in leaf traits in response to drought, and populations did not differ significantly. The plasticity of most root functional traits, that is, root length (RL), root surface area (RSA), root volume (RV), and root mass fraction (RMF), were significantly positively correlated with biomass between control and drought. However, the opposite was found for leaf functional traits, that is, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), and leaf mass fraction (LMF). Drought enhanced the relationship between root and leaf, that is, 26 pairwise root-leaf traits were significantly correlated under drought, while only 15 pairwise root-leaf traits were significantly correlated under control conditions. Significant correlations were found between biomass and all measured functional traits except for leaf size. RV, root length ratio, RMF, total area of leaves, and LMF responded differently to water availability. These responses enable S. canadensis to cope with drought conditions and may help to explain the reason of the vast ecological amplitude of this species.","[Du, Leshan; Liu, Haiyan; Li, Junsheng] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Reg Ecol Proc & Fu, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Du, Leshan; Liu, Haiyan; Li, Junmin] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Evolutionary Ecol & Conserv, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Du, Leshan; Guan, Wenbin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Li, JS (reprint author), Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Reg Ecol Proc & Fu, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Li, JM (reprint author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Evolutionary Ecol & Conserv, Taizhou, Peoples R China.",lijmtzc@126.com; lijsh@craes.org.cn,,"Leshan, Du/0000-0002-4418-4011",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1201100]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270461],"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC1201100; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: No. 31270461.",,59,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Yet, how environmental change and substrate quality affect root humification still remains poorly understood. A two-year litterbag experiment was conducted to assess the root mass remaining and accumulation of humic substances in roots of three diameter classes (0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 mm) of two common subalpine tree species (Picea asperata and Abies faxoniana) at two elevations (3037 m and 3580 m) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. No significant differences were found between elevation treatments in the concentration of humic substances. Both root mass loss and concentrations of humic substance, humic acid and fulvic acid decreased with increasing root diameter. Both fulvic acid concentration and humification degree declined as root decomposition progressed but humic acid concentration exhibited an opposite trend. Our results reveal that the diameter-associated variations in accumulation of humic substances were substantially stronger than altitudinal and interspecific differences in decomposing root litters. These findings have important implications for carbon sequestration via root humification in the subalpine forests experiencing snow-covered winter.","[Liu, Qun; Ni, Xiangyin; You, Chengming; Yue, Kai; Tan, Bo; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Li; Xu, Zhenfeng] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol & Forestry, Key Lab Ecol Forestry Engn, Long Term Res Stn Alpine Forest Ecosyst, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Liyan] Forschungszentrum Julich, Agrosphere IBG 3, Julich, Germany; [Yin, Rui] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06110 Halle, Saale, Germany","Xu, ZF (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol & Forestry, 211 Huimin Rd, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xuzf@sicau.edu.cn,"Yue, Kai/N-6962-2017","Yue, Kai/0000-0002-7709-8523; Ni, Xiangyin/0000-0002-2507-3463","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570601, 31800521, 31700542]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502505, 2017YFC0505003]; Key Program of Sichuan Education Department [17ZA0321]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570601, 31800521 and 31700542) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502505 and 2017YFC0505003) and the Key Program of Sichuan Education Department (17ZA0321).",,43,0,0,25,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,15-Aug,2019,348,,,,,,68,75,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.016,,,8,Soil Science,Agriculture,IB1RO,WOS:000470042500008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Argiroff, WA; Zak, DR; Upchurch, RA; Salley, SO; Grandy, AS",,,,"Argiroff, William A.; Zak, Donald R.; Upchurch, Rima A.; Salley, Sydney O.; Grandy, A.

We previously established that similar to 20 years of experimental nitrogen (N) deposition has slowed fine root decay and increased the storage of soil carbon (C; +18%) across a widespread northern hardwood forest ecosystem. However, the microbial mechanisms that have directly slowed fine root decay are unknown. Here, we show that experimental N deposition has decreased the relative abundance of Agaricales fungi (-31%) and increased that of partially ligninolytic Actinobacteria (+24%) on decaying fine roots. Moreover, experimental N deposition has increased the relative abundance of lignin-derived compounds residing in SOM (+53%), and this biochemical response is significantly related to shifts in both fungal and bacterial community composition. Specifically, the accumulation of lignin-derived compounds in SOM is negatively related to the relative abundance of ligninolytic Mycena and Kuehneromyces fungi, and positively related to Microbacteriaceae. Our findings suggest that by altering the composition of microbial communities on decaying fine roots such that their capacity for lignin degradation is reduced, experimental N deposition has slowed fine root litter decay, and increased the contribution of lignin-derived compounds from fine roots to SOM. The microbial responses we observed may explain widespread findings that anthropogenic N deposition increases soil C storage in terrestrial ecosystems. More broadly, our findings directly link composition to function in soil microbial communities, and implicate compositional shifts in mediating biogeochemical processes of global significance.","[Argiroff, William A.; Zak, Donald R.; Upchurch, Rima A.; Salley, Sydney O.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Grandy, A.

This raises the questions of whether above-ground results are the product of a reduced allocation below-ground in more diverse forests, which could imply a more efficient acquisition of below-ground resources per unit root, and whether the effects of diversity have been correctly quantified and interpreted in the past. We addressed these issues using data from a tree-based functional diversity experiment where 24 mixtures and their respective monocultures were analysed in a fully replicated design. We used species-level measurements of above- and below-ground biomass to assess how adding below-ground biomass changes our interpretations regarding the roles of complementarity effects (niche partitioning or facilitation between species) and selection effects (dominance of high-yielding species within mixtures). Mixtures showed overyielding of above-ground biomass but not below-ground. Although remaining significantly positive, this translated into diversity effects of a lesser magnitude when adding below-ground biomass. However, species did not reduce their allocation to below-ground biomass within mixtures compared to monocultures. Rather, this combination of above-ground overyielding and below-ground neutral effect was caused by the dominance in mixtures of species with a low below-ground allocation strategy. Another consequence of these species dominance is that their actual contribution to total productivity within mixtures was overestimated when using only above-ground biomass, due to their relatively small below-ground biomass. This caused an overestimation of the selection or dominance effects, thereby causing an underestimation of the relative importance of complementarity effects. Synthesis. This study emphasizes the need to consider both above- and below-ground biomass components when determining the origin and strength of diversity effects, or when attempting to link tree diversity to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. The statistical partitioning of net effects is a widely used method, but one which can lead to an overestimation of the role of individual dominant species when below-ground biomass is not taken into account, hence diminishing the role of positive interactions between species.","[Martin-Guay, Marc-Olivier; Messier, Christian] UQO, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia","Martin-Guay, MO (reprint author), UQO, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ, Canada.",marcoliviermartinguay@hotmail.com,,,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,43,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The majority of rhizobial bacteria are found in the soil. However, they also live symbiotically inside nodules of legume hosts and each nodule can release thousands of daughter cells back into the soil. We tested how past selection (i.e., legacies) by two plant genotypes and by the soil alone affected selection and genetic diversity within a population of 101 strains of Ensifer meliloti. We also identified allelic variants most strongly associated with soil- and host-dependent fitness. In addition to imposing direct selection on rhizobia populations, soil and host environments had lasting effects across host generations. Host presence and genotype during the legacy period explained 22% and 12% of the variance in the strain composition of nodule communities in the second cohort, respectively. Although strains with high host fitness in the legacy cohort tended to be enriched in the second cohort, the diversity of the strain community was greater when the second cohort was preceded by host rather than soil legacies.

Despite the evident changes above ground, the effect of rainforest conversion on the channeling of energy in soil food webs was not studied. Here, we investigated community-level neutral lipid fatty acid profiles in dominant soil fauna to track energy channels in rainforest, rubber, and oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia. Abundant macrofauna including Araneae, Chilopoda, and Diplopoda contained high amounts of plant and fungal biomarker fatty acids (FAs). Lumbricina had the lowest amount of plant, but the highest amount of animal-synthesized C20 poly-unsaturated FAs as compared to other soil taxa. Mesofauna detritivores (Collembola and Oribatida) contained high amounts of algal biomarker FAs. The differences in FA profiles between taxa were evident if data were analyzed across land-use systems, suggesting that soil fauna of different size (macro-and mesofauna) are associated with different energy channels. Despite that, rainforest conversion changed the biomarker FA composition of soil fauna at the community level. Conversion of rainforest into oil palm plantations enhanced the plant energy channel in soil food webs and reduced the bacterial energy channel; conversion into rubber plantations reduced the AMF-based energy channel. The changes in energy distribution within soil food webs may have significant implications for the functioning of tropical ecosystems and their response to environmental changes.

We examined N deposition effects on soil carbon (C) and N in temperate, N-rich forest plots fertilized annually (100 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) since 1993. After nearly two decades, soil C in O, A, and upper 50 cm of B horizons of N-addition plots was 17% greater (14.2 +/- 0.7 kg C m(-2)) than control plots. Aboveground tree biomass growth and litterfall were not affected by fertilization. Fine root mass (0-1 mm) was 34% greater in N-addition plots, but did not explain soil C increases. Rather, reduced decomposition of litter and soil organic matter drove C increases in N-addition plots. Decomposition rates of black cherry, sugar maple, and mixed leaf litter were 43, 67, and 36%, greater, respectively, in control than N-addition plots. Light fraction organic matter was greater in N-addition plots than in control plots, due to either enhanced root production or decreased decomposition of soil organic matter. Soil respiration was reduced, and microbial biomass in O, A, and upper-B horizons was lower in N-addition plots than controls. The soil microbial community composition was also altered dramatically with N additions. Recalcitrant organic matter enzyme activity (peroxidase) was reduced in the O-horizon by N addition. Available Ca, Mg, and K were reduced in O and A horizons by N fertilization. These results suggest that chronic elevated atmospheric N inputs can increase forest soil C storage by decreasing decomposition, however the long-term stability of this additional C sequestration is unknown.","[Bowden, Richard D.; Coble, Adrienne E.; Johnson, Brittany] Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Wurzbacher, Sarah J.] Penn State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Washko, Susan E.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resour Environ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Wind, Lauren] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Rice, Alexandrea M.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environ Sci & For, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Baldauf, Nicholas] Allegheny Cty Hlth Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA; [Wang, Jun-Jian] Southern Univ Sci & Tech, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Simpson, Myrna] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Lajtha, Kate] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Bowden, RD (reprint author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",richard.bowden@allegheny.edu,,"Washko, Susan/0000-0002-8748-7784",Allegheny College Harold State; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Class of 39 Fund Student Scholarships,"We thank Brandi Baros, Bruce Caldwell, Andrew Culp, Lauren Deem, Ivan Fernandez, Guinevere Fredriksen, Colleen Friel, Cedric Gamble, Christy Goodale, Ben Hedin, Emma Helverson, Sonya Korzeniwsky, Mike Larkin, Kristen Locy, Owen Ludwig, Anna Oehser, Milt Ostrofsky, Chris Plano, Kelsey Ream, Sam Reese, Rachel Rihaly, Jesse Sadowsky, Noah Spiro, Ali Trunzo, Haley Urben, Taylor Weiss, Michelle Woods, Scott Wissinger, Howard Wurzbacher, and Ruth Yanai for advice and field and laboratory assistance.

Methods A mesocosm experiment was used to assess the acid-tolerance of the seedlings of four target species. Field experiment 1 tested the nurse effects of an adult plant (Lespedeza formosa) on germination rate, seedling survival rate, growth and AMF colonization rate of target seedlings growing in an acid soil. Field experiment 2 tested the influence of AMF root colonization on nurse-plant effects. Results Target species greatly varied in their tolerance to soil acidity while nurse-effect on target species were mediated by target species acid-tolerance and AMF root colonization. In field experiment 1, as expected, nurse-effect was positive for acid-sensitive species and negative for acid-tolerant species. While nurse plant presence facilitated the germination, survival, growth, and AMF colonization of the two acid-sensitive species it competed with the two acid-tolerant species. In field experiment 2, the nurse plant facilitated the growth of the acid-sensitive seedlings more under AMF not suppressed treatment than AMF suppressed treatment. For the acid-tolerant seedlings, however, the nurse plant reduced their growth under AMF not suppressed treatment, but did not affect their growth under AMF suppressed treatment. Conclusion Nurse plant facilitated the acid-sensitive species in an acid soil, and the facilitation was enhanced by increasing AMF in the soil. These findings highlight how acid-tolerance of target species and AMF colonization mediates nurse plant facilitation and has important implications for the use of nurse plants in the restoration of acid soils ecosystems.","[He, Lei; Xu, Jing; Hu, Liangliang; Ren, Minglei; Tang, Jianjun; Chen, Xin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jing] Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm Resources & Soil Fertilizers, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Tang, JJ; Chen, X (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",helei8705@126.com; 21307103@zju.edu.cn; zjuhull@126.com; renminglei3@163.com; chen-tang@zju.edu.cn; chandt@zju.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502703-4]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570411]; Zhejiang Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [Y15C030005],"This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2016YFC0502703-4), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31570411), and the Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation (no.

Our study aims to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of plant growth promotion and disease protection. Methods We generated transcriptome profiles from ZNC-treated seedlings using RNA sequencing. The function of salicylic acid (SA) in ZNC-mediated immunity was examined using SA biosynthesis and signaling pathway mutants. The concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in seedlings under ZNC treatment were measured. The effect of ZNC on the level of the hormone auxin in roots was tested using transgenic plants containing DR5::GFP. Results ZNC exhibited ultrahigh activity in promoting plant growth and enhancing disease resistance, even at concentrations as low as 1-10 ng/ml. ZNC induced ROS accumulation, callose deposition, and expression of PR genes. SA biosynthesis and signaling pathways were required for the ZNC-mediated defense response. Moreover, in improving plant growth, ZNC increased the level of auxin in root tips and regulated the absorption of N and P. Conclusion According to these results, ZNC is a highly effective plant elicitor that promotes plant growth by inducing auxin accumulation at the root tip at low concentrations and enhances plant disease resistance by activating the SA signaling pathway at high concentrations.","[Lu, Chongchong; Liu, Haifeng; Jiang, Depeng; Wang, Lulu; Jiang, Yanke; Tang, Shuya; Hou, Xuwen; Han, Xinyi; Chu, Zhaohui; Ding, Xinhua] Shandong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Crop Biol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biol Vegetable Dis & Insect, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lulu] Shandong Pengbo Biotechnol Co LTD, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhiguang; Zhang, Min] Shandong Agr Univ, Natl Engn Lab Efficient Utilizat Soil & Fertilize, Coll Recourses & Environm, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China","Ding, XH (reprint author), Shandong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Crop Biol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biol Vegetable Dis & Insect, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xhding@sdau.edu.cn,,"Chu, Zhaohui/0000-0001-8320-7872","Major Agricultural Application Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province (2016); Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of Shandong Province [JQ201807]; National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31872925]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0200706]; funds of the Shandong ""Double Tops"" Program; Taishan Industrial Experts Program [tscy20150621]; Shandong Modern Agricultural Technology & Industry System [SDAIT-17-06]","This study was supported by the Major Agricultural Application Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province (2016), the Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of Shandong Province (JQ201807), the National Natural Science Foundation (31872925), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0200706), funds of the Shandong ""Double Tops"" Program, the Taishan Industrial Experts Program (No. tscy20150621), and the Shandong Modern Agricultural Technology & Industry System (SDAIT-17-06).",,65,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2019,441,2-Jan,,,,,383,397,,10.1007/s11104-019-04130-w,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,IS8PR,WOS:000482412400024,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, B; Weston, PA; Gu, L; Zhang, BY; Li, MJ; Wang, FQ; Tu, WQ; Wang, JM; Weston, LA; Zhang, ZY",,,,"Zhang, Bao; Weston, Paul A.; Gu, Li; Zhang, Bingyong; Li, Mingjie; Wang, Fengqing; Tu, Wanqian; Wang, Jianming; Weston, Leslie A.; Zhang, Zhongyi",,,Identification of phytotoxic metabolites released from Rehmannia glutinosa suggest their importance in the formation of its replant problem,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Allelopathy; Metabolomics; Replant problems; Root exudates,PHENYLETHANOID GLYCOSIDES; CUCUMIS-SATIVUS; PHENOLIC-ACIDS; ROOTS; RHIZOSPHERE; ALLELOCHEMICALS; PLANT; COMMUNITY; WEED; MECHANISMS,"Background and aims The yield and quality of medicinal tubers of Rehmannia glutinosa are seriously restricted by replanting problems. However, the origin and identification of the potential allelochemicals associated with this issue have not been well described. Therefore, in a series of related studies, we aimed to identify the key phytotoxic metabolites released from R. glutinosa. Methods R. glutinosa residues were harvested and extracted for metabolic profiling and bioassay-directed identification. Metabolites in the leaf, tuber, and soil surrounding R. glutinosa roots were profiled using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole/time of flight mass spectormeter. A Petri dish-filter paper and modified Parker bioassay were used to evaluate the phytotoxicity of plant residues and candidate allelochemicals. Results Seventeen metabolites specific to R. glutinosa were identified/annotated using non-targeted metabolic profiling combined with known standards. Assay results suggested an iridoid glycoside and several phenylethanoid glycosides as key allelochemicals originating from R. glutinosa. Conclusion Identification of bioactive metabolites in planta and in the rhizosphere has increased our understanding of the phytochemistry of R. glutinosa. Further evaluation of the soil persistence and ecological functions of these bioactive compounds will be important for determination of the specific mechanisms associated with R. glutinosa replanting issues.","[Gu, Li; Li, Mingjie; Wang, Jianming; Zhang, Zhongyi] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Minist Educ Genet Breeding & Multiple Utilizat Cr, Key Lab, Coll Crop Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Weston, Paul A.; Weston, Leslie A.] Charles Sturt Univ, Graham Ctr Agr Innovat, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia; Henan Prov Peoples Hosp, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fengqing] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Tu, Wanqian] Henan Prov Chinese Med Res Inst, Zhengzhou 450004, Henan, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZY (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Minist Educ Genet Breeding & Multiple Utilizat Cr, Key Lab, Coll Crop Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",zyzhang@fafu.edu.cn,"Weston, Leslie/M-4557-2015","Weston, Leslie/0000-0002-1029-7982",Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University [324-1122yb028]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81603243]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1700705]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2017 J01804],"We acknowledge the contribution of Russell Barrow in reviewing the paper and providing helpful suggestions, and the help of Xiaocheng Zhu, Saliya Gurusinghe and Graeme Heath from Graham Centre for Agricultural Innovation, Charles Sturt University.

This study explores how microbes and nematodes alter the temporal dynamics of specific plant species and functional groups (i.e. grasses and forbs) in mixed grassland communities. Methods We extracted communities of nematodes and microorganisms from natural grassland soil and inoculated them, separately and in combination, into containers filled with sterilized grassland soil to examine how these groups of soil organisms influence the compositional dynamics of a diverse grassland plant community consisting of 12 species. Results Addition of soil microorganisms altered the composition of the plant community by enhancing forb species and promoting evenness, but these effects took time to develop and became significant only 6 months after inoculation. Addition of soil nematodes showed faster effects and reduced plant community evenness via suppressing several subordinate plant species. The nematode community was dominated by root-feeding nematodes that were less abundant when microorganisms were present, indicating a potential inhibitory effect of microorganisms on plant-feeding nematodes. Conclusions Our results show that soil microorganisms and nematodes may differ in the magnitude and direction of their effects on the compositional dynamics of plant communities in natural grasslands, and that these effects may operate at different timespans. This study highlights the complexity of plant-soil biotic interactions and the importance to explore these interactions at multiple temporal scales.","[Wang, Minggang; Bezemer, T.

We tested the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the isotopic composition of Acacia caven xylem water. As the most common plant-fungal association, AMF might explain this isotopic mismatch. Methods Seedlings were grown with and without AMF and irrigated with the same water. After 120 days, stem and soil samples were collected and following cryogenic distillation, H and O isotopic composition of xylem and soil water, as well as irrigation water, was measured. Results Xylem water of non-mycorrhizal seedlings was significantly depleted in H-2 compared to soil water (differences up to -15.6 parts per thousand). When AMF were present, the depletion was significantly higher and appeared for both H and O (differences up to -24.6 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and - 2.9 parts per thousand for delta O-18 between soil and xylem water). Conclusions Results suggest that isotopic fractionation occurred during water uptake in this xerophytic species. To explain this, we propose an aquaporin-driven mechanism mediating water transport via transmembrane passage. Furthermore, we show for the first time, that AMF enhance the observed discrimination against heavy isotopes, probably by enforcing water passage through aquaporins. Given their ubiquity, AMF could question the fractionation-free assumption during root water uptake.","[Poca, Maria] Univ Nacl San Luis, Inst Matemat Aplicada San Luis, CONICET, Grp Estudios Ambientales, San Luis, Argentina; [Poca, Maria; Urcelay, Carlos; Zeballos, Sebastian R.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, Cordoba, Argentina; [Coomans, Olivia] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Ghent, Belgium; [Bode, Samuel; Boeckx, Pascal] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, Fac Biosci Engn, Ghent, Belgium","Poca, M (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, Cordoba, Argentina.",pocamaria@gmail.com,,"Poca, Maria/0000-0001-9160-1036","Commissie Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (CWO), Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, UGent; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECyT) - Universidad Nacional de CordobaSecretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT)","The authors are thankful to the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (UNC) and the Isotope Bioscience Laboratory (ISOFYS) of the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, which provided facilities used for this study.

However, employing X-ray CT to identify the spatio-temporal dynamics of RSA still remains a challenge due to non-automatic, time-consuming image processing protocols and their poor recovery of fine roots in soil. Methods Here we present a new protocol (Rootine) to segment roots rapidly and precisely down to fine roots with two voxels in diameter (90 mu m in pots with 70 mm in diameter). This is facilitated by feature detection of the tubular shape of roots, an approach that was originally developed for detecting blood vessels in medical imaging. Results In comparison to established root segmentation methods, Rootine produced a more accurate root network, i.e. more roots and less over-segmentation. Root length quantified by X-ray CT showed high correlation with results by root washing combined with 2D light scanning (R-2 = 0.92). Tests with different soil materials showed that the recovery of roots depends on signal-to-noise ratio but can be up to 99% for a favorable contrast between fine roots and background. Conclusions This new protocol provides great efficiency to study RSA in undisturbed soil. As it is fully automated it has the potential for high-throughput root phenotyping and related modelling.","[Gao, Wei; Shen, Jianbo] China Agr Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Plant Soil Interact, Ctr Resources Environm & Food Secur,Dept Plant Nu, 2 Yuan Ming Yuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wei; Schlueter, Steffen; Blaser, Sebastian R.

Urban trees are considered to play an important role in fixing carbon, improving air quality, reducing noise and providing other ecosystem services. However, data on the response of urban trees to climate change, particularly to drought, as well as the relationship between their below- and above-ground processes in this context, are still limited, which prevents a comprehensive understanding of the role of urban trees in ameliorating some of the adverse effects of climate change and their ability to cope with it. To investigate whole-plant responses to water shortages, we studied the growth of Tilia cordata Greenspire, a commonly planted urban tree, including development of its roots and stem diameter, leaf parameters and the harvested biomass. Our results showed that this cultivar was susceptible to drought and had reduced biomass in all three compartments: branch (30.7%), stem (16.7%) and coarse roots (45.2%). The decrease in the root:shoot ratio under drought suggested that more carbon was invested in the above-ground biomass. The development of fine roots and the loss of coarse root biomass showed that T. cordata Greenspire prioritised the growth of fine roots within the root system. The CityTree model's simulation showed that the ability of this cultivar to provide ecosystem services, including cooling and CO2 fixation, was severely reduced. For use in harsh and dry urban environments, we recommend that urban managers take into account the capacity of trees to adapt to drought stress and provide sufficient rooting space, especially vertically, to help trees cope with drought.","[Zhang, Chi; Pretzsch, Hans; Roetzer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Stratopoulos, Laura Myrtia Fani] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture, Weihenstephaner Berg 17, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Zhang, C (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",forestrychi.zhang@tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868",municipal nursery of Munich,We thank the municipal nursery of Munich for the support and encouragement to conduct our field study there.

The effects of plant diversity on the bioavailable forms of P involved in biologically mediated rhizospheric processes and how the link between plant and soil microbial diversity facilitates soil P bioavailability, however, remain poorly understood. This study quantified four forms of bioavailable P (CaCl2-P, citric-P, enzyme-P and HCl-P) in mature subtropical forests using a novel biologically based approach, which emulates how rhizospheric processes influence the release and supply of available P. Soil microbial diversity was measured by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Our results suggest that tree species richness significantly affects soil microbial diversity (p < 0.05), increases litter decomposition, fine-root biomass and length and soil organic carbon and thus increases the four forms of bioavailable P. A structural equation model that links plants, soil microbes and P forms indicated that soil bacterial and fungal diversity play dominant roles in mediating the effects of tree species richness on soil P bioavailability. An increase in the biodiversity of plants, soil bacteria and fungi could maintain soil P bioavailability and alleviate soil P limitations. Our results imply that biodiversity strengthens plant and soil feedback and increases P recycling.

F. mandshurica seedlings were treated with various concentrations of P (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM KH2PO4) for 15 d. The growth of lateral roots was quantified by the number of lateral roots, total root length, total root surface area, and root : shoot ratio. Additionally, the levels of endogenous hormones and acid phosphatase were determined in the lateral roots of F. mandshurica seedlings using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The transcription of 17 FmWRKYs and FmPHR1 was detected in the lateral roots of F. mandshurica seedlings using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). F. mandshurica seedlings under P deficiency (0 mM) exhibited significantly higher number of lateral roots, total root length, total root surface area, and root : shoot ratio than those under P supply. P deficiency significantly decreased the levels of indole-3-acetic acid, brassinolide, and ethylene, and increased the levels of gibberellins 3, cytokinin, abscisic acid, and acid phosphatase in the lateral roots of F. mandshurica seedlings when compared to seedlings with P supply. In addition, the transcription of four FmWRKYs, including FmWRKY6, FmWRKY23, FmWRKY44, and FmWRKY71, as well as FmPHR1 were significantly higher in the lateral roots of F. mandshurica seedlings under P deficiency compared to seedlings treated with 1 mM P. Phosphorus deficiency promoted the lateral root growth of F. mandshurica seedlings and this process may be associated with the up-regulation of FmWRKY6, FmWRKY23, FmWRKY44, FmWRKY71, and FmPHR1.","[Huang, Wengong; Zhao, Xingtang; Liang, Nansong; He, Liming; Yu, Lei; Zhan, Yaguang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Life Sci Coll, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wengong] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ind Crops, Harbin 150086, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Yaguang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Natl Key Lab Forest Genet & Breeding, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Zhan, YG (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Life Sci Coll, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.; Zhan, YG (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Natl Key Lab Forest Genet & Breeding, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",zhanyaguang2002@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFD0600605-01]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270697],This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFD0600605-01) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.31270697).,,35,0,0,8,8,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

Altitudinal gradient studies and warming experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve predictions. We examined whether plant-fungal symbioses responded similarly to altitude and 23 yr of experimental warming. Root- and leaf-associated fungi, which can mediate plants' climate sensitivity, responded divergently to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors; other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities. Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight into how climate change may alter plant-symbiont interactions, but our results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants.","[Kazenel, Melanie R.; Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Taylor, D.

The justification for this broadly applied approach is based on the assumption that differences among species are always greater than within species. This is likely true for local communities, but species are often broadly distributed across a wide range of environments and patterns of intraspecific variation might surpass differences among species. Therefore, an appropriate interpretation of the functional diversity requires an assessment of patterns of trait variation across different ecological scales. In this study, we examine and characterize patterns of leaf trait variation for species that are broadly distributed along an elevational gradient. We focus on seven leaf traits that represent a main axis of functional differentiation in plants reflecting the balance between photosynthetic efficiency, display, and stomatal conductance. We evaluated patterns of trait variance across ecological scales (elevation, species, populations, and individuals) and examined trait covariance at both within species and across species levels, along the elevation gradient. Our results show three key patterns: (1) intraspecific leaf trait variation for broadly distributed species is comparable to the interspecific trait variation, (2) the trait variance structure is highly variable across species, and (3) trait coordination between pairs of leaf traits is evident across species along the gradient, but not always within species. Combined, our results show that trait coordination and covariance are highly idiosyncratic across broadly distributed and co-occurring species, indicating that species may achieve similar functional roles even when exhibiting different phenotypes. This result challenges the traditional paradigm of functional ecology that assumes single trait values as optimal solutions for environments. In conclusion, patterns of trait variation both across and within species should be considered in future studies that assess trade-offs among traits over environmental gradients.","[Umana, Maria N.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48019 USA; [Swenson, Nathan G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Umana, MN (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48019 USA.",maumana@umich.edu,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation ImprovementNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1501341],,,77,0,0,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2019,100,8,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.2745,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IM6KY,WOS:000478103000012,31032887,,,,10/31/19J,"Thakur, MP; Quast, V; van Dam, NM; Eisenhauer, N; Roscher, C; Biere, A; Martinez-Medina, A",,,,"Thakur, Madhav P.; Quast, Vera; van Dam, Nicole M.; Eisenhauer, Nico; Roscher, Christiane; Biere, Arjen; Martinez-Medina, Ainhoa",,,Interactions between functionally diverse fungal mutualists inconsistently affect plant performance and competition,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; fungal symbionts; fungal-fungal interactions; plant-fungal interactions; plant-plant interactions; Trichoderma,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TRICHODERMA-HARZIANUM; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; HERBIVORES; INSECT; ECOLOGY; COEXISTENCE; STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; DECLINES,"Plants form mutualistic relationship with a variety of belowground fungal species. Such a mutualistic relationship can enhance plant growth and resistance to pathogens. Yet, we know little about how interactions between functionally diverse groups of fungal mutualists affect plant performance and competition. We experimentally determined the effects of interaction between two functional groups of belowground fungi that form mutualistic relationship with plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and Trichoderma, on interspecific competition between pairs of closely related plant species from four different genera. We hypothesized that the combination of two functionally diverse belowground fungal species would allow plants and fungi to partition their symbiotic relationships and relax plant-plant competition. Our results show that: 1) the AM fungal species consistently outcompeted the Trichoderma species independent of plant combinations; 2) the fungal species generally had limited effects on competitive interactions between plants; 3) however, the combination of fungal species relaxed interspecific competition in one of the four instances of plant-plant competition, despite the general competitive superiority of AM fungi over Trichoderma. We highlight that the competitive outcome between functionally diverse fungal species may show high consistency across a broad range of host plants and their combinations. However, despite this consistent competitive hierarchy, the consequences of their interaction for plant performance and competition can strongly vary among plant communities.","[Thakur, Madhav P.; van Dam, Nicole M.; Eisenhauer, Nico; Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, DE-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Thakur, Madhav P.; Biere, Arjen] NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Thakur, Madhav P.; Quast, Vera; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [van Dam, Nicole M.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [Martinez-Medina, Ainhoa] IRNASA CSIC, Inst Nat Resources & Agrobiol Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain","Thakur, MP (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, DE-04103 Leipzig, Germany.; Thakur, MP (reprint author), NIOO KNAW, Netherlands Inst Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.; Thakur, MP (reprint author), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany.",madhav.prakash.thakur@gmail.com,,"Thakur, Madhav/0000-0001-9426-1313",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [TH 2307/1-1]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and Innovation programme [765290]; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FA1405]; Fundacion Salamanca Ciudad de Cultura y Saberes; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118],"MPT acknowledges funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG, TH 2307/1-1).

It is not clear as to how phenotypic plasticity in response to a certain environmental factor is affected by another ecological factor. Water and light are important factors affecting the phenotype of plants. The interactive effects between drought and shade on plants differ markedly among studies. To address these questions, we subjected Acer davidii Franch. seedlings to five water regimes, combined with two light intensities. Drought decreased all growth and biomass parameters, and all leaf and root traits measured, and increased the root to shoot ratio and root biomass ratio. Shade decreased the shoot height, the diameter at ground height, the root surface area, and all biomass parameters, and increased leaf water content, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, and total chlorophyll concentration. Significant interactive effects were found on all biomass parameters, half of the growth parameters, and most of the leaf and root traits; shade generally alleviated the negative effects on A. davidii seedlings to some extent. The simplified relative distance phenotypic plasticity indices (RDPIs) of A. davidii responding to light increased with the increase in soil water content whereas no significant trend was observed between the RDPIs and the light regime. The RDPIs of all growth parameters, average leaf area, and all biomass allocation parameters in response to water were greater than those of light.

We conducted a greenhouse experiment in Beijing, China to examine effects of aboveground herbivory (by a beetle Agasicles hygrophila or not) and nitrogen availability (high vs. low) on growth and physiology of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its coexisting native congener A. sessilis. Herbivory by A. hygrophila significantly reduced total mass and aboveground development of both plant species, and the negative effects of herbivory on leaf mass, ramet number, and leaf number were more remarkable at the high than at the low nitrogen level. On the other hand, herbivory did not affect root mass and even increased root to shoot ratio of both plant species. The increase in root to shoot ratio and relative ratio of root mass caused by herbivory was also stronger in A. philoxeroides than in A. sessilis. Besides, herbivory exerted neutral or positive effects on the concentrations of starch and total non-structural carbohydrates in stems and roots of A. philoxeroides, but negative effects on the physiological measures of A. sessilis. We conclude that A. philoxeroides may possess a stronger tolerance to herbivory than A. sessilis and that increased resource allocation to roots could potentially contribute to compensatory responses of A. philoxeroides to aboveground herbivory. Our findings also suggest that the control of A. hygrophila may be invalid in belowground invasion of A. philoxeroides, and that belowground herbivores should be considered in the future management of invasive species.","[Hu, Xiao-Ting; Dong, Bi-Cheng] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Dong, BC (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",bcdong@bjfu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500331]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2016YFC1201100]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-BH-01],"We are grateful to Yi-Xuan Zhu and Rui Dong for experimental assistance.

We conducted a snow-exclusion experiment to investigate the immediate and cross-seasonal effects of increased soil frost on soil CO2 efflux and biological activity in a subalpine spruce forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The increased frost reduced soil CO2 efflux by similar to 15 and similar to 19% in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively. Increased frost also tended to decrease soil basal respiration, the amount of microbial phospholipid fatty acids and the activities of enzymes involved in soil carbon cycling during the winters. Winter soil nitrogen availabilities were higher in the snow-exclusion treatment than in the control plots. However, these effects did not carry over to the following growing season. Our results suggest that increased frost reduces winter soil respiration by direct environmental effects (e.g. soil temperature) and indirect biological processes (e.g. microbial biomass and activity), whereas increased frost did not induce any cross-seasonal effects. These findings underscore the ecological importance of seasonal snowpack and microbe-associated carbon processes in sub alpine forests where winter snowfall is decreasing substantially.","[Yang, Kaijun; Li, Zhijie; Zhang, Li; Ni, Xiangyin; Yue, Kai; Tan, Bo; Xu, Zhenfeng] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol & Forest, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Kaijun; Penuelas, Josep] CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF CSIC UAB, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec Montreal, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Peng, Changhui] Northwest Agr & Forest Univ, Coll Forestry, Ctr Ecol Forecasting & Global Change, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Barcelona, Spain; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Li, Zhijie] Forschungszentrum Julich, Agrosphere IBG 3, Julich, Germany; [Yin, Rui] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06110 Halle, Saale, Germany","Xu, ZF (reprint author), 211 Huimin Rd, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xuzf@sicau.edu.cn,"; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015","Tan, Bo/0000-0003-0019-9446; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Ni, Xiangyin/0000-0002-2507-3463; YIN, RUI/0000-0002-4580-1317","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570601, 31700542, 31870602]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502505, 2017YFC0505003]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council","We are very grateful to Fan Yang, Liyan Zhuang, Yu Tan and Rui Cao for their great support in the field and lab.

We thus predicted that fertilizing with phosphate-P would reduce AMF abundance and, in turn, reduce RPE of mutant barley. We packed microcosms with a P-responsive soil in which we grew mutant barley lacking root hairs as well as wild type barley and narrowleaf plantain, each possessing root hairs. One set of microcosms was fertilized with phosphate-P while another set was not fertilized. The plants were grown in a labelling chamber with C-13-depleted CO2. Soil respiration and delta C-13 of headspace CO2 were measured after 3, 4 and 5 weeks and RPE was calculated using an isotope mass balance approach. Root hair length was measured and soils were analyzed for the 16:1 omega 5 neutral lipid fatty acid (i.e. AMF biomarker). AMF abundance was greater, whereas RPE was lower, in mutant barley soil under low-P than under high-P conditions. In the other two plant-types, P had no effect on AMF or on RPE. As our results contradict our prediction, we propose an alternative explanation based on plant N demand under high-P.","[Boilard, Gabriel; Bradley, Robert L.; Carubba, Aaron] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1J 2R1, Canada; [Paterson, Eric; Sim, Allan] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Brown, Lawrie K.; George, Timothy S.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Bainard, Luke] Swift Current Res & Dev Ctr, Agr & Agri Food Canada, Swift Current, SK S9H 3X2, Canada","Bradley, RL (reprint author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1J 2R1, Canada.",robert.bradley@usherbrooke.ca,"Paterson, Eric/A-7756-2008","Paterson, Eric/0000-0003-1512-7787",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This study was financially supported by an Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(NSERC) of Canada Discovery Grant awarded to R.L.

However, we lack a comprehensive view of the likelihood of feedback-driven coexistence, partly because of a failure to analyse pairwise PSF, the metric directly linked to plant species coexistence. Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence. By combining results over several independent studies, our results confirm that PSF may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and the phylogenetic diversification of plant communities.","[Crawford, Kerri M.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.] Miami Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Comita, Liza S.; Queenborough, Simon A.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Eppinga, Maarten B.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Johnson, Daniel J.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Tallahassee, FL USA; [Mangan, Scott A.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Strand, Allan E.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Umbanhowar, James] Univ N Carolina, Biol Dept, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Crawford, KM (reprint author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",kmcrawford3@uh.edu,,"Johnson, Daniel/0000-0002-8585-2143; Crawford, Kerri/0000-0003-4421-2243","National Science Foundation through NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1556664, DEB1738041, DBI-1103667, DEB-1754287]","This work is the product of the Plant-Soil Feedback Theory Working Group at the National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), sponsored by the National Science Foundation through NSF Award #DBI-1300426, with additional support from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and from NSF DEB-1556664 (JDB and JU), DEB1738041 (JDB and MBE), DBI-1103667 (KMC), and DEB-1754287 (KMC).

Vertically explicit SOC models typically assume that the depth distribution of belowground production follows the depth distribution of belowground biomass, but this assumption has not been tested. In addition to the effects of soil temperature and moisture on decomposition, some vertically explicit SOC models implement an intrinsic decrease in belowground decomposition with depth, yet this effect has rarely been observed empirically. We simultaneously measured the depth distributions of belowground biomass, production, and litter decomposition to assess whether belowground biomass depth distributions were suitable predictors of belowground production and whether belowground decomposition decreased with soil profile depth. We found that live and total (live + dead) belowground biomass was distributed relatively more shallowly than total belowground production, and thus total belowground biomass was a biased predictor of the vertical distribution of belowground production. The depth distribution of live roots < 2 mm in diameter was found to be the best predictor of total belowground production depth distribution. Using an intact decay core method, we found that belowground litter decomposition decreased by 49% from 0-10 to 30-40 cm depth, and model-simulated effects of soil temperature and moisture accounted for only 9% of the observed decrease with depth. Vertically explicit SOC models can be improved with more accurate empirical belowground production depth distribution estimates, but depth-specific decomposition rates currently implemented in SOC models are necessary to explain observed decreases in belowground litter decay with depth.","[Von Haden, Adam C.] Univ Wisconsin, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA; [Von Haden, Adam C.] Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Dornbush, Mathew E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nat & Appl Sci, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA","Von Haden, AC (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Environm Sci & Policy Grad Program, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA.; Von Haden, AC (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",avonhaden@wisc.edu,,"von Haden, Adam/0000-0003-3817-9352","Wisconsin Focus on Energy Environmental and Economic Research and Development Program through the Environmental Management and Business Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, USA; Barbra Hauxhurst Cofrin Graduate Research Fellowship in Environmental Science and Policy at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, USA","This project was funded through a grant from the Wisconsin Focus on Energy Environmental and Economic Research and Development Program awarded to the second author M.

Through these changes in vegetation, cattle grazing can generate changes in allocation to total, fine and coarse root biomass, which can further affect ecosystem processes. The objective of this work was to evaluate differences in root biomass, in the proportions of fine and coarse root biomass and in root C:N ratio across physiognomies from 0 to 30cm. We selected plots of grazing lawns (associated to relatively high stocking rates), and plots of thin and thick tussock grasslands (associated to relatively low stocking rates) within the Pampa de Achala system in central Argentina. We found that total, coarse, and fine root biomass were highest in grazing lawns, intermediate in thin tussock grasslands, and lowest in thick tussock grasslands. Thick tussock grasslands showed the highest relative proportion of fine roots while root C:N ratio did not vary among physiognomies. Higher root biomass in lawns was probably caused by the dominance of species that allocate more biomass to roots than to shoots, as well as by the complementarity of soil resource extraction and by compensatory root growth in response to herbivory. In addition, and contrary to what was expected based on their above-ground attributes, thick tussock grasslands presented higher proportion of fine roots, which suggests a more acquisitive resource use strategy. However, root C:N from thick tussock grasslands did not differ from other physiognomies which might indicate there are not clear differences in below-ground resource use strategies. Our results show that grassland root biomass in this study system can increase in patches associated to higher cattle grazing due to changes in plant composition and physiognomy, while changes in root quality seem to be uncoupled from the above-ground traits.","[Sarquis, Agustin; Pestoni, Sofia; Maria Cingolani, Ana; Perez Harguindeguy, Natalia] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Av Velez Sarsfield 1611,X5016GCA, Cordoba, Argentina; [Sarquis, Agustin] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr IFEVA, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pestoni, Sofia; Maria Cingolani, Ana; Perez Harguindeguy, Natalia] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, Cordoba, Argentina","Sarquis, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Av Velez Sarsfield 1611,X5016GCA, Cordoba, Argentina.; Sarquis, A (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr IFEVA, Av San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",agusarquis@agro.uba.ar,,"Sarquis, Agustin/0000-0001-5089-600X",SeCyT-Universidad Nacional de CordobaSecretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT) [30720150101608CB]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 11220150100387CO],"We are grateful to SeCyT-Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (30720150101608CB) and CONICET (PIP 11220150100387CO) who funded this study, to the authorities of the Quebrada del Condorito National Park for permissions and logistic support, to ranch owners G.

In this study, we sought to determine whether the impact of mycorrhizas on resource allocation occurs throughout the entire ramet network. The optimal division of resources is decisive for the potential ecological and evolutionary success of an individual. The study was carried out under uniform conditions on Hieracium pilosella (L.) networks with the same age. Data related to growth and reproduction were collected from the total of 47 mother plants and 210 daughter ramets that they generated. The differences between AMF-inoculated and non-inoculated plants with respect to continuous variables were tested using a one-way ANOVA. Mother plants that were inoculated with a mycorrhizal fungus displayed lower belowground dry biomass than the non-inoculated plants. The presence of the fungus did not affect the allocation of resources to other examined traits of the mother plants. The daughter ramets formed by the fungus-inoculated plants had larger rosette diameters and produced more inflorescence heads than did the non-mycorrhizal daughter ramets. In our study, the positive effect of mycorrhizas on resource allocation was observed only in the next vegetatively produced generation. The distribution of resources is a dynamic process and, from an evolutionary standpoint, it cannot be approached as a mere balance of benefits and losses observed at a given time point.","[Dominiak, Martyna; Lembicz, Marlena] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Taxon, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Olejniczak, Pawel] Inst Nat Conservat PAS, Ctr Res & Conservat Mt Plants, Al Adama Mickiewicza 33, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland","Dominiak, M (reprint author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Taxon, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",martyna.dominiak@amu.edu.pl; olejniczak@ipo.krakow.pl; lembicz@amu.edu.pl,,,"KNOW RNA Research Centre in Pozna [01/KNOW2/2014]; Faculty of Biology Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna, Poland","This manuscript was supported by the KNOW RNA Research Centre in Pozna (No. 01/KNOW2/2014) and the Faculty of Biology Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna, Poland.

The results indicated that the vertical distribution of Mongolian pine roots displayed an hourglass-type characteristic that indicated high density in the shallow (5-35 cm) and deep (85-145 cm) layers, but a low density in the middle layer (35-85 cm). Fine roots, which have a strong relationship with water utilization, displayed typical hourglass-type distribution characteristics. The proportion of fine roots in shallow soil layers (5-35 cm), middle layers (35-85 cm) and deep layers (85-145 cm) was 44.67%, 11.8% and 43.53%, respectively. Corresponding to root distribution characteristic, the shallow (0-40 cm) layer and the deep (90-150 cm) layer have a high soil water content than the middle layer. From May to October, the depth of groundwater table in the Mongolian pine plantation showed an increasing trend, from 185 to 291 cm, and the average groundwater table depth was 251 cm. The average height of capillary fringe above the groundwater table was 75.27 cm. Rainfall and groundwater have effects on the soil water content in a Mongolian pine plantation, and that determines the root distribution characteristics of Mongolian pine. The deep root system of Mongolian pine was effectively supplemented by groundwater, which is a necessary condition to maintain Mongolian pine survival and growth in the western Horqin Sandy Land.","[Musa, Ala; Zhang, Yuanhao; Cao, Jing; Wang, Yongcui; Liu, Ya] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuanhao; Cao, Jing; Liu, Ya] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Musa, A (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",alamusa@iae.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670712]; Key Project of Chinese National Programs for Research and Development [2016YFC0500803],This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31670712) and Key Project of Chinese National Programs for Research and Development (2016YFC0500803).,,30,0,0,10,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

In the present study the AMF in the rhizosphere of R. acicularis Luhe were identified and AMF diversity and community composition were assessed using morphological and molecular techniques. Vesicles, hyphae, and arbuscular structures were observed in seedlings of different ages. Result shows that AMF established a good symbiotic relationship with R. acicularis Luhe. The colonization rate and spore density tended to increase over time. The AMF diversity in the rhizosphere of R. acicularis Luhe was low and four species of AMF were validated: Rhizophagus irregularis, Glomus aggregatum, Septoglomus furcatum, and Funneliformis mosseae. Of these, R. irregularis and G. aggregatum were dominant and have high salt tolerance.

We explored community-level changes to mycorrhizal features and leaf traits along a primary successional gradient on a sedimentation coast. We found that community weighted mean values of mycorrhizal features and leaf traits varied systematically along the successional series, representing a transition from communities dominated by more stress-tolerant plant species (less mycorrhizal colonization and lower specific leaf area) to less stress-tolerant plant species (higher mycorrhizal colonization and specific leaf area). Despite the co-variation in leaf traits and mycorrhizal features at the community level, only mycorrhizal features showed an increasing functional diversity with successional age. These results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi should not be forgotten in trait-based plant community ecology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

We characterized AMF communities in soil samples (n = 108), based on morphological taxonomy, at three sampling occasions and from six areas (typical Caatinga, extremely sandy Caatinga, stony Caatinga, rocky Caatinga, and two typical Caatinga areas that had been modified by human activities), at the National Park of Catimbau, Northeast Brazil. Eighty AMF species were recorded, with Glomus and Acaulospora predominating at all sites. There were significant differences in the composition of AMF communities between natural and anthropized sites, and among sampling occasions. Habitat-types also influenced AMF communities in Caatinga. Extensive tropical dry forest areas, such as the Catimbau National Park possess distinct niches, which maintain diverse AMF communities that are determined by anthropogenic activities, as well as vegetation types and environmental conditions.

Overgrazing can negatively affect plant performance, and consequently unbalance the association with AMF. We studied the grazing effect on AMF colonization for preferred (Bromus pictus and Poa ligularis) and unpreferred grasses (Pappostipa speciosa and Pappostipa humilis) by sheep in the Patagonian steppe. For each species, AMF colonization in ungrazed, moderate and intense grazing sites was quantified. In ungrazed areas, B. pictus showed the highest extent of AMF colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher during the active season, and largely reduced by intense grazing conditions. The decrease of AMF colonization was maximal for the most preferred species, but also significant for the unpreferred species. Our results suggest that overgrazing could reduce mycorrhizal benefits for the plant by reduction of AMF colonization, which can be a good indicator of ecosystem functioning, eventually revealing an increasing degree of environmental degradation.

However, our mechanistic understanding of its influence on the outcome of plant-plant interactions is still expanding. In this review we propose a framework that might be useful to efficiently approach the effects of mycorrhizal fungi (MF) on plant-plant interactions. We propose several scenarios that can theoretically result in different outcomes of plant-plant interactions based on the combination of two processes: the diversity of resources provided by MF taxa to their host (resource dissimilarity) and contrasting ways of distributing those resources (resource distribution). Then, we illustrate our arguments with different ecological contexts where certain combinations of these two processes are prone to occur. The proposed framework suggests testable hypotheses that can contribute to elucidate relevant processes underlying the effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant-plant interactions.

This study examines the relative importance of two global change drivers - atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and annual grass invasion - on structuring fungal communities in a California chaparral ecosystem, with emphasis on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used molecular markers, functional groupings, generalized linear statistics and joint distribution modeling, to examine how environmental variables structure taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities. Invasive grasses had a lower richness and relative abundance of symbiotic fungi (both AMF and other fungi) compared to native shrubs. We found a higher richness and abundance of rhizophilic (e.g. Glomeraceae) and edaphophilic (e.g. Gigasporaceae) AMF with increasing soil NO3. Our findings suggest that invasive persistence may decrease the presence of multiple soil symbionts that native species depend on for pathogen protection and increased access to soil resources.

The main goal of this work was to determine the effects of environmental and temporal factors on AMF living in sand dunes (Gulf of Valencia, Spain). Soil samples were collected seasonally at 6 sites, during 2 yrs, from three habitats and four plant species and the frequency and relative abundance of AMF was examined. AMF were more frequent in mobile than in embryonic dunes, in spring and in sites with old vegetation. Ten AMF species were identified, their distribution depending mainly on the anthropogenic disturbance of the site. Gigasporaceae Cetraspora sp. and Dentiscutata sp. preferred undisturbed soil whereas Diversisporaceae, Glomeraceae and other Gigasporaceae were associated with recently restored soils. All AMF species were found in all plant species although Corymbiglomus corymbiforme was mainly associated with Echinophora spinosa. Our results might be of help for Mediterranean sand dune restoration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis of field studies to elucidate conditions in which adding mycorrhizal fungi enhances restoration success. We found inoculation increased plant biomass by an average effect size of 1.7 in 70 independent comparisons from 26 field-based studies, with the largest increases to N-fixing woody plants, C4-grasses and plants growing in soils with low plant-available P. Growth responses to inoculation increased with time for the first 3 yr after inoculation, especially for N-fixing woody plants and plants growing in severely altered soils. We found that mycorrhizal inoculation increased species richness of restored plant communities by 30%, promoted establishment of target species, and enhanced similarity of restored to reference communities. We conclude that the addition of mycorrhizal fungi to restoration sites can facilitate rapid establishment of vegetation cover, and restoration of diverse plant communities more akin to reference sites.

Glomerospore abundance was higher in the dry season in dunes and in the rainy season in restinga. Redundancy analysis revealed significant relationships between AMF-physical and chemical soil parameters. Shannon's index and Pielou's evenness indicated greater AMF diversity in dunes than restinga, despite the lower number of glomerospores in dunes.

Our study aimed to assess the effect of dear-cutting and drought on fine-root dynamics down to the water table in Brazilian ferralsol under eucalypt plantations conducted in coppice. Fine roots (i.e. diameter < 2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m deep.in a throughfall exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W) and stands without rain exclusion (+ W). Root dynamics were studied using minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to 17 m deep, over 1 year before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to 4 m deep in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. After harvesting, a spectacular fine root growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred in very deep soil layers (> 13 m) and, surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely low whatever the depth and the treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 17 m depth was 1266 and 1017 g m(-2) in + W and -W, respectively, at 1.5 year after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m(-2) in NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific root length and specific root area were about 15% higher in -W than in + W. Proliferation of fine roots at great depths could be an adaptive mechanism for tree survival, enhancing the access to water stored in the subsoil. The root system established before clear-cutting provides access to water stored in very deep layers that probably contribute to mitigate the risk of tree mortality during prolonged drought periods when the eucalypt plantations is conducted in coppice after the clear-cut.","[Germon, Amandine; Guerrini, Irae Amaral; Laclau, Jean-Paul] UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Sch Agr Sci, BR-18610307 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Germon, Amandine; Jourdan, Christophe; Robin, Agnes; Nouvellon, Yann; Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie; Pradier, Celine; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Montpellier, Eco & Sols, CIRAD, INRA,IRD,Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; [Jourdan, Christophe; Robin, Agnes; Nouvellon, Yann; Pradier, Celine; Laclau, Jean-Paul] CIRAD, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Bordron, Bruno; Nouvellon, Yann; de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Forest Sci Dept, ESALQ, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Robin, Agnes] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Soil Sci Dept, ESALQ, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Chapuis-Lardy, Lydie] IRD, UMR Eco & Sols, LMI IESOL, BP 1380, Dakar 18524, Senegal","Germon, A (reprint author), UNESP Sao Paulo State Univ, Sch Agr Sci, BR-18610307 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",amandine.germon@gmail.com,"Guerrini, Irae Amaral/C-5472-2012","Guerrini, Irae Amaral/0000-0002-1336-0318; Robin, Agnes/0000-0003-3044-2304",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2015/24911-8]; Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD); Sao Paulo University; Ecofor; Allenvi; French National Research Infrastructure ANAEE-F,"The study was funded by Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Project 2015/24911-8), Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD) and Sao Paulo University.

However, few studies have directly examined the ecological significance of clonal integration in the ability of clonal plants to tolerate biotic stress such as herbivory. Methods We grew clonal fragments of an invasive clonal plant Alternanthera philoxeroides, each consisting of an apical part (relatively young) and a basal part (relatively old), at two levels (low and high) of soil nitrogen (N). For each fragment, the apical part was subjected to either no herbivory or herbivory for 2 weeks by a specialist insect, Agasicles hygrophila, and was either connected with or disconnected from the basal part not subjected to herbivory. Important Findings Herbivory in the apical part severely reduced leaf growth (leaf mass, leaf number or leaf area) and ramet production of both apical and basal parts, and increased root to shoot ratio of the apical part. Irrespective of herbivory and soil N, stem connection between the apical and the basal part decreased root to shoot ratio of the apical part, but did not change its growth measures. Meanwhile, connection increased stem N concentration of the apical part growing under high-N supply and decreased stem carbon (C) concentration of the apical part under low-N supply. By contrast, connection increased root to shoot ratio of the basal part, but reduced its leaf and ramet production. Connection also increased leaf and stem C concentrations of the basal part under low-N supply. Thus, clonal integration can be beneficial for the early development of young A. philoxeroides ramets, but not for their local adaptation to herbivory damage by A. hygrophila.","[Dong, Bi-Cheng; Zhang, Li-Min; Li, Kai-Yu; Hu, Xiao-Ting; Luo, Fang-Li; Li, Hong-Li; Yu, Fei-Hai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong-Jian] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fei-Hai] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Inst Wetland Ecol & Clone Ecol, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China","Yu, FH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",feihaiyu@126.com,,"Dong, Bi-Cheng/0000-0002-9658-9969","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1201101, 2016YFC1202102]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500331, 31670428]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-BH-01]; Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Beijing Forestry University [X201710022152]","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1201101, 2016YFC1202102), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500331, 31670428), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015ZCQ-BH-01) and Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Beijing Forestry University (X201710022152).",,59,0,0,6,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

However, we know little about how frequently PSFs affect plants at the seed stage, and the compositional shifts in fungi that accompany PSFs on germination. We conducted a pairwise PSF experiment to test whether seed germination was differentially impacted by conspecific versus heterospecific soils for seven grassland species. We used metagenomics to characterize shifts in fungal community composition in soils conditioned by each plant species. To investigate whether changes in the abundance of certain fungal taxa were associated with multiple PSFs, we assigned taxonomy to soil fungi and identified putative pathogens that were significantly more abundant in soils conditioned by plant species that experienced negative or positive PSFs. We observed negative, positive, and neutral PSFs on seed germination. Although conspecific and heterospecific soils for pairs with significant PSFs contained host-specialized soil fungal communities, soils with specialized microbial communities did not always lead to PSFs. The identity of host-specialized pathogens, that is, taxa uniquely present or significantly more abundant in soils conditioned by plant species experiencing negative PSFs, overlapped among plant species, while putative pathogens within a single host plant species differed depending on the identity of the heterospecific plant partner. Finally, the magnitude of feedback on germination was not related to the degree of fungal community differentiation between species pairs involved in negative PSFs. Synthesis. Our findings reveal the potential importance of PSFs at the seed stage. Although plant species developed specialized fungal communities in rhizosphere soil, pathogens were not strictly host-specific and varied not just between plant species, but according to the identity of plant partner. These results illustrate the complexity of microbe-mediated interactions between plants at different life stages that next-generation sequencing can begin to unravel.","[Miller, Elizabeth C.; Perron, Gabriel G.; Collins, Cathy D.] Bard Coll, Biol Program, POB 5000, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA","Collins, CD (reprint author), Bard Coll, Biol Program, POB 5000, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",ccollins@bard.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1655972],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB 1655972",,75,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The dual-frequency GPR system used in this study simultaneously collects data with two antenna frequencies (400 and 900 MHz). The GPR surveys were repeated in a grid (11 x 4.8 m(2) with a total of 46 survey lines) in summer and winter. Both antenna frequencies and seasonal GPR surveys generated a consistent pattern of the distribution of lateral coarse roots, indicating reliable interpretation of GPR data for coarse roots mapping. The 400 MHz GPR and the winter survey detected more roots in the deeper soil (>0.6 m depth), whereas the 900 MHz GPR and the summer survey detected more in the shallower soil (<0.6 m depth). The higher wave velocity and lower degree of GPR energy attenuation in the frozen soil enhanced the detection of deep coarse roots. Combining root detection results obtained under all conditions revealed a higher distribution density of lateral coarse roots beneath a depression and at the depth of 0.4-0.6 m, but a lower abundance under the intershrub area (i.e. showing the avoidance of intershrub root overlap). These patterns were not evident in GPR images collected using a single frequency antenna in one season. Ground truthing confirmed that pairing GPR data collected at two frequencies improved the detection frequency of the number of lateral coarse roots. More field tests are required to validate the application of repeated dual-frequency GPR surveys to detect and quantify coarse roots in other ecosystems. Highlights The detection of lateral coarse roots by GPR needs to be further improved in field soils. Dual-frequency GPR surveys were repeated in summer and winter to enhance coarse roots mapping. Combining seasonal dual-frequency GPR data improved detection frequency of the number of roots.

This species requires physical or chemical treatments to overcome physical seed dormancy. In this report, we assessed the effect of different treatments with hot water (40 degrees C for 24 h; 60 degrees C for 5 min; 80 degrees C for 5 min; 90 degrees C for 5 min and 100 degrees C for 5 min) on seed dormancy, rhizobial inoculation (Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA 6164 = BR 3608) and two different incubation temperature (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) on germination of A. mearnsii. The results indicated that the immersion of seeds in hot water at 80 degrees C was the most optimum treatment as indicated by total germination (83.0%), germination index (187.5), germination speed (19.5) and accumulated germination speed (24.5). The elevation of incubation temperature from 20 degrees C to 25 degrees C enhanced the germination index by 7.4%. Inoculation of SEMIA 6164 also increased the speed and accumulated speed of germination by 8.7% and 10.1%, respectively. The present study revealed that the immersion of seeds in hot water at 80 degrees C for 5 min, incubation at 25 degrees C and inoculation with SEMIA 6164 offered the most favourable conditions for the maximum and quick recovery of uniform seedlings and can be recommended for raising the forestry nurseries of A. mearnsii.","[Sao Jose, J.

This is particularly true for the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which form mutualistic associations with over two-thirds of terrestrial plant species and are entirely dependent on their plant hosts for carbon. Here, we use high-resolution amplicon sequencing (Illumina, HiSeq) to quantify the response of AM fungal communities to the longest running (>15 years) free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment in the Northern Hemisphere (GiFACE); providing the first evaluation of these responses from old-growth (>100 years) semi-natural grasslands subjected to a 20% increase in atmospheric CO2. eCO(2) significantly increased AM fungal richness but had a less-pronounced impact on the composition of their communities. However, while broader changes in community composition were not observed, more subtle responses of specific AM fungal taxa were with populations both increasing and decreasing in abundance in response to eCO(2). Most population-level responses to eCO(2) were not consistent through time, with a significant interaction between sampling time and eCO(2) treatment being observed. This suggests that the temporal dynamics of AM fungal populations may be disturbed by anthropogenic stressors. As AM fungi are functionally differentiated, with different taxa providing different benefits to host plants, changes in population densities in response to eCO(2) may significantly impact terrestrial plant communities and their productivity. Thus, predictions regarding future terrestrial ecosystems must consider changes both aboveground and belowground, but avoid relying on broad-scale community-level responses of soil microbes observed on single occasions.","[Macek, Irena; Sibanc, Natasa; Vodnik, Dominik] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Macek, Irena; Sibanc, Natasa] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol FAMNIT, Koper, Slovenia; [Clark, Dave R.; Dumbrell, Alex J.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Sibanc, Natasa] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Moser, Gerald; Mueller, Christoph] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Plant Ecol, Giessen, Germany; [Mueller, Christoph] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol, Dublin, Ireland; [Mueller, Christoph] Univ Coll Dublin, Environm Sci & Earth Inst, Dublin, Ireland","Macek, I (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.; Dumbrell, AJ (reprint author), Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",irena.macek@bf.uni-lj.si; adumbrell@essex.ac.uk,"Clark, Dave/H-9148-2019; Muller, Christoph/F-9521-2010","Clark, Dave/0000-0002-2306-0220; ","Hessian State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (LOEWE); Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS [J4-5526, J4-7052, P4-008]; European Cooperation in Science and TechnologyEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1305]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [471757]","Hessian State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (LOEWE); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, Grant/Award Number: J4-5526, J4-7052 and P4-008; European Cooperation in Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: FP1305; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 471757",,96,1,1,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Understanding the temporal variations of NPP could provide new insights into the responses of communities to environmental factors. However, few studies based on long-term field biomass measurements have directly addressed this subject in the unique environment of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP). We examined the interannual variations of NPP during 2008-2015 by monitoring both aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and identified their relationships with environmental factors with the general linear model (GLM) and structural equation model (SEM). In addition, the interannual variation of root turnover and its controls were also investigated. The results show that the ANPP and BNPP increased by rates of 15.01 and 143.09 g/m(2) per year during 2008-2015, respectively. BNPP was mainly affected by growing season air temperature (GST) and growing season precipitation (GSP) rather than mean annual air temperature (MAT) or mean annual precipitation (MAP), while ANPP was only controlled by GST. In addition, available nitrogen (AN) was significantly positively associated with BNPP and ANPP. Root turnover rate averaged 30%/year, increased with soil depth, and was largely controlled by GST. Our results suggest that alpine Kobresia meadow was an N-limited ecosystem, and the NPP on the QTP might increase further in the future in the context of global warming and nitrogen deposition.","[Dai, Licong; Ke, Xun; Du, Yangong; Zhang, Fawei; Li, Yikang; Li, Qian; Lin, Li; Peng, Cuoji; Shu, Kai; Cao, Guangmin; Guo, Xiaowei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Bot, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Dai, Licong; Ke, Xun; Peng, Cuoji; Shu, Kai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fawei] Luoyang Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Luoyang, Peoples R China","Guo, XW (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Bot, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",xwguo1206@163.com,,"Dai, Licong/0000-0002-9686-4262","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400483, 31700395, 31770532, 41730752]; Comprehensive Management and Application Demonstration of Small Watershed in Hainan Prefecture [2019-SF-152]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31400483, 31700395, 31770532 and 41730752; Comprehensive Management and Application Demonstration of Small Watershed in Hainan Prefecture, Grant/Award Number: 2019-SF-152",,55,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, we tested the relative importance of common management tools used in restoration-species planted and soil placement-on the recovery of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities over 4 years. Importantly, we further compared the community assembly of fungi on reclaimed landscapes to that in reference ecosystems disturbed to different degrees. This latter test addresses whether disturbance intensity is more important than common management interventions to restore fungal communities in these ecosystems. Three main findings emerged. (1) The effect of tree species planted and soil placement on ectomycorrhizal fungal communities establishing on reclaimed landscapes was dynamic through time. (2) Disturbances that remove or disrupt the organic layer of soils substantially affect the composition of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. (3) Shifts in the community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi were driven to a greater extent by disturbance severity than either tree species planted or soil placement.","[Pec, Gregory J.; Scott, Natalie M.; Hupperts, Stefan F.; Hankin, Shanon L.; Landhausser, Simon M.; Karst, Justine] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Pec, Gregory J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Pec, GJ (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.; Pec, GJ (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",gregory.pec@unh.edu,"Pec, Gregory J/L-8542-2013","Pec, Gregory J/0000-0002-6781-9112; Hupperts, Stefan/0000-0002-9498-5183",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Total EP Canada Ltd.; Imperial Oil Resources Ltd.; Shell Canada Energy; Molecular Biology Service Unit at the University of Alberta; Canada Natural Resources Ltd.,"This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada Natural Resources Ltd., Syncrude Canada Ltd., Total E&P Canada Ltd., Imperial Oil Resources Ltd., and Shell Canada Energy.

Comparing responses of functional traits to warming and precipitation variability and determining critical water threshold of dominate steppe grasses from Inner Mongolia facilitates the identification and monitoring of water stress effects. A combination of warming (ambient temperature, +1.5 degrees C and +2.0 degrees C) and varying precipitation (-30%, -15%, ambient, +15%, and +30%) manipulation experiments were performed on four Stipa species (S. baicalensis, S. bungeana, S. grandis, and S. breviflora) from Inner Mongolia steppe. The results showed that the functional traits of the four grasses differed in their responses to precipitation, but they shared common sensitive traits (root/shoot ratio, R/S, and specific leaf area; SLA) under ambient temperature condition. Warming increased the response of the four grasses to changing precipitation, and these differences in functional traits resulted in changes to their total biomass, with leaf area, SLA, and R/S making the largest contributions. Critical water thresholds of the four grasses were identified, and warming led to their higher optimum precipitation requirements. The four steppe grasses were able to adapt better to mild drought (summer precipitation decreased by 12%-28%) when warming 1.5 degrees C rather than 2.0 degrees C. These results indicated that if the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C will be accomplished, this will increase the probability for sustained viability of the Stipa steppes in the next 50-100 years.","[Lv, Xiaomin; Zhou, Guangsheng] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [He, Qijin] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangsheng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhou, GS (reprint author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhougs@cma.gov.cn,,,China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest [GYHY201506001-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31661143028]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620984],"China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects), Grant/Award Number: GYHY201506001-3; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31661143028; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project, Grant/Award Number: 2017M620984",,62,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The three beech stands on deep soil ( > 2 m profile depth) had on average by 38% larger FRB totals than the stands on shallow soil (60-80 cm), suggesting that limited root space is an important determinant of fine root system size in F. sylvatica. Despite large variation among sites, soil chemistry influenced root morphology only little: fine root diameter depended on soil C/N ratio and root tip frequency on base saturation in a few soil horizons. Much larger morphological differences were found between topsoil and subsoil roots within a profile.

We tested the hypotheses that biochar and AMF can interact to affect greenhouse gas emissions due to promoted plant biomass and changed soil N availability. We assembled microcosms, each initially grown with three rarnets (vegetative individuals) of a clonal, wetland plant Phragmites australis, with or without AMF in soil and with or without biochar addition to soil. Biochar addition alone and AMF presence alone both significantly enhanced biomass of P. australis, but such effects became weaker when they were present simultaneously. The presence of AMF significantly decreased concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen (N) in P. australis and concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3--N, inorganic N and total N in soil, but such effects became weaker when biochar was added to soil than when it was not. Biochar addition significantly increased concentrations of chlorophyll and N in P. australis when AMF were present, but had little impact when AMF were absent. The presence of AMF increased CO2 emission and CO2 equivalent independent of biochar addition. The presence of AMF also increased N2O emission when biochar was added, but decreased it when biochar was not added. We conclude that biochar addition and AMF presence can interact to affect plant growth and N uptake, soil N availability and greenhouse gas emissions from plant-soil ecosystems.","[Liang, Jin-Feng; An, Jing; Gao, Jun-Qin; Zhang, Xiao-Ya; Yu, Fei-Hai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Song, Ming-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fei-Hai] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Evolutionary Ecol & Conserv, Inst Wetland Ecol & Clone Ecol, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [An, Jing] Beijing Songshan Natl Nat Reserve Adm, Beijing 102115, Peoples R China","Gao, JQ; Yu, FH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",gaojq@bjfu.edu.cn; feihaiyu@126.com,,"Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0505903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571084, 41871077]",We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

However, the relationships between rhizosphere respiration and RPE and root traits (such as biomass and nitrogen (N) concentration) across plant species and growing conditions are not fully resolved. In this study, we investigated rhizosphere respiration rate and RPE of three grassland species (a grass, a forb and a legume) using a continuous isotope-labeling technique. We found a significantly positive relationship between root-mass-specific rhizosphere respiration rate and root N concentration across the three species and two types of mesocosms (small pots and large buckets), and the scaling exponents were approximately one (indicating isometric scaling). Further, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rate was not statistically different between the planted treatments and the unplanted control, suggesting insignificant RPE at the early flowering stage (90 days after seeding) for these three species. Likely, respiration from rhizodeposition (root inputs to soil during the 90-day labeling period) was not included in SOM decomposition by the isotope labeling method, which underestimates SOM decomposition and may partly contribute to the lack of RPE of the three species. Overall, our results show that rhizosphere respiration rate is scalable with root N concentration across different plant species and growing conditions, while RPE of these grassland species at the early flowering stage was insignificant.","[Tang, Mao; Zeng, Hui; Zhu, Biao] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Inst Ecol,Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Tang, Mao; Zeng, Hui] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Keck, Daniel C.; Cheng, Weixin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Zhu, BA (reprint author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Inst Ecol,Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",biaozhu@pku.edu.cn,"Zhu, Biao/F-8712-2010; Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011","Zhu, Biao/0000-0001-9858-7943; Cheng, Weixin/0000-0003-2964-2376","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670525, 31622013, 31621091]; National Science Foundation of USANational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354098]; Kearney Foundation of Soil Science","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670525, 31622013, and 31621091), the National Science Foundation of USA (DEB-1354098) and the Kearney Foundation of Soil Science.

In this study, photoelectrocatalysis was applied as an effective technology to degrade MCs. The effects of different dimensionally stable anodes and cathodes were evaluated. Detoxification effects were investigated using a luminescence inhibition assay, a micronucleus assay of Vicia faba root tips and a single cell gel electrophoresis assay. The results show that RuO2-TiO2/Ti and stainless steel were the best among the six anodes and four cathodes tested for MCLR degradation. Compared to photodegradation, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis obtained the highest efficiency on MCLR degradation, nearly 100% at 254 nm and 5.0 mA/cm(2). The degradation kinetics agreed with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. When NaCl was used as an electrolyte, the degradation efficiency of MCLR reached 100% even under 0.002 mol/L, which was much better than that of Na2SO4, Na2HPO4 and NaNO3. The toxicity assays showed that although MCLR was completely degraded, acute toxicity still occurred in the solution at relative luminosities from 0 to 9.37%. However, the micronucleus efficiency and DNA damage of cells returned to normal levels at the end of the reaction. This indicates that genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were eliminated with the degradation of MCLR.","[Zhao, Yuan; Fan, Qianlong; Wang, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Wenwen; Hu, Xinxin; Liu, Chuang; Liang, Wenyan] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Source Control Technol Water Poll, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Liang, WY (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Source Control Technol Water Poll, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",lwy@bjfu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51672028]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-HJ-02]; National Water Pollution Control and Management Technology Major Projects of China [2018ZX07105-001]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201706510033],"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51672028), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015ZCQ-HJ-02), National Water Pollution Control and Management Technology Major Projects of China (2018ZX07105-001), and the China Scholarship Council (201706510033).

This study was, thus, aimed at quantifying the impact of IWSM on soil-health under dolerite and sandstone geological formations. Twelve soil samples were taken from two watersheds with IWSM and another 12 soil samples from two watersheds without IWSM at 30 cm soil depth. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of these soil samples were then analysed in a laboratory. Soil moisture content, Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus (Pav) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore density of soils were significantly high in watersheds with IWSM as compared to watersheds without IWSM. Although insignificant, total porosity, cation exchange capacity, Exchangeable bases and micronutrients also had higher mean value on watersheds with IWSM practices than watersheds without. Thus, this study reviled that an introduction of these IWSM practices has a positive impact in improving soil-health. Moreover, IWSM practices implemented on dolerite geological formation showed a higher impact on soil-health as compared to management practices implemented on sandstone geological formation.","[Gebremeskel, Kassa; Teka, Kassa; Birhane, Emiru] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resource Management & Environm Protect, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Negash, Emnet] Mekelle Univ, Inst Climate & Soc, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia","Negash, E (reprint author), Mekelle Univ, Inst Climate & Soc, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia.",emnet.gis@gmail.com,,"Negash, Emnet/0000-0001-8553-6602; birhane, emiru/0000-0002-8644-5961",,,,38,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

The last remnants of the European Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were particularly vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of habitat use and foraging of large herbivores to natural and anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions during the Holocene, we investigated carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of moose (Alces alces), European bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in Central and Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to changing environmental conditions. All three species showed significant changes in their delta C-13 values reflecting a shift of foraging habitats from more open in the Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more forest during the Neolithic and Late Holocene. This shift was strongest in European bison, suggesting higher plasticity, more limited in moose, and the least in aurochs. Significant increases of delta N-15 values in European bison and moose are evidence of a diet change towards more grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils following deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples), longitude and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and forest cover in aurochs. None of the analysed factors explained isotope variations in moose. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic (deforestation and human pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large herbivores, with forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the Neolithic, particularly for European bison and aurochs. We propose that high flexibility in foraging strategy was the key for survival of large herbivores in the changing environmental conditions of the Holocene.","[Hofman-Kaminska, Emilia; Samojlik, Tomasz; Kowalczyk, Rafal] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Bocherens, Herve] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Res Area Paleobiol, Tubingen, Germany; [Bocherens, Herve; Drucker, Dorothee G.] Univ Tubingen, Senckenberg Ctr Human Evolut & Palaeoenvironm HEP, Tubingen, Germany; [Fyfe, Ralph M.; Woodbridge, Jessie] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Guminski, Witold] Warsaw Univ, Inst Archaeol, Warsaw, Poland; [Makowiecki, Daniel] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Inst Archaeol, Torun, Poland; [Pacher, Martina] Univ Wien, Geozentrum, UZA 2, Inst Palaontol, Vienna, Austria; [Piliciauskiene, Giedre] Vilnius Univ, Fac Hist, Vilnius, Lithuania","Hofman-Kaminska, E (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",ehofman@ibs.bialowieza.pl,"BOCHERENS, Herve/F-3580-2011","BOCHERENS, Herve/0000-0002-0494-0126","Polish National Science Centre [N N304 301940, 2013/11/B/NZ8/00914]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [F00568W]; FP7 Ideas: European Research Council [PIRSES-GA-2009-247652, 245737]","Polish National Science Centre, Grant/Award Number: N N304 301940 and 2013/11/B/NZ8/00914; Leverhulme Trust, Grant/Award Number: F00568W; FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: PIRSES-GA-2009-247652, FP7 2010-2013 and 245737",,120,2,2,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, it is unclear how free-living saprotrophs (bacteria and fungi, SAP) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi responses to N addition impact soil C dynamics. Our aim was to investigate how SAP and EM communities are impacted by N enrichment and to estimate whether these changes influence decay of litter and humus. We conducted a long-term experiment in northern Sweden, maintained since 2004, consisting of ambient, low N additions (0, 3, 6, and 12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) simulating current N deposition rates in the boreal region, as well as a high N addition (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Our data showed that long-term N enrichment impeded mass loss of litter, but not of humus, and only in response to the highest N addition treatment. Furthermore, our data showed that EM fungi reduced the mass of N and P in both substrates during the incubation period compared to when only SAP organisms were present. Low N additions had no effect on microbial community structure, while the high N addition decreased fungal and bacterial biomasses and altered EM fungi and SAP community composition. Actinomycetes were the only bacterial SAP to show increased biomass in response to the highest N addition. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic N enrichment can influence soil C accumulation rates and suggest that current N deposition rates in the boreal region (<= 12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) are likely to have a minor impact on the soil microbial community and the decomposition of humus and litter.","[Maaroufi, Nadia, I] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Maaroufi, Nadia, I; Hasselquist, Niles J.; Forsmark, Benjamin; Gundale, Michael J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden; [Maaroufi, Nadia, I] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Nordin, Annika] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, Umea, Sweden; [Palmqvist, Kristin] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Rosenstock, Nicholas P.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden; [Wallander, Hakan] Lund Univ, Dept Microbial Ecol, Lund, Sweden","Maaroufi, NI (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland.",Nadia.Maaroufi@slu.se,,"Maaroufi, Nadia/0000-0002-8028-1409",Center for Environmental Research in Umea [CMF1122373]; Royal Swedish Academy of Agrilculture and Forestry [H14-0018-GBN]; Svenska Forskningsradet FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2014-00497],"Center for Environmental Research in Umea, Grant/Award Number: CMF1122373; Royal Swedish Academy of Agrilculture and Forestry, Grant/Award Number: H14-0018-GBN; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2014-00497",,93,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Trophic relationships are difficult to disentangle due to the cryptic lifestyle of soil animals and inevitable microbial contributions to their diet. Compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (AAs) is increasingly used to explore complex food webs. The combined use of AA delta C-13 and delta N-15 values is a promising new approach to disentangle trophic relationships since it provides independent but complementary information on basal resources, as well as the trophic position of consumers. We conducted a controlled feeding study in which we reconstructed trophic chains from main basal resources (bacteria, fungi, plants) to primary consumers (springtails, oribatid mites) and predators (gamasid mites, spiders). We analyzed dual compound-specific isotope AA values of both resources and consumers. By applying an approach termed ""stable isotope (C-13) fingerprinting"" we identified basal resources, and concomitantly calculated trophic positions using N-15 values of trophic and source AAs in consumers. In the C-13 fingerprinting analysis, consumers in general grouped close to their basal resources. However, higher than usual offsets in AA delta C-13 between diet and consumers suggest either gut microbial supplementation or the utilization of specific resource fractions. Identification of trophic position crucially depends on correct estimates of the trophic discrimination factor (TDFGlu-Phe), which was close to the commonly applied value of 7.6 parts per thousand in primary consumers feeding on microbial resources, but considerably lower in arachnid predators (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand), presumably due to higher diet quality, excretion of guanine, and fluid feeding. While our feeding study demonstrates that dual compound-specific AA analyses hold great promise in delineating trophic linkages among soil-dwelling consumers and their resources, it also highlights that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to TDFGlu-Phe does not apply to soil food webs.","[Pollierer, Melanie M.; Potapov, Anton; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Larsen, Thomas] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Kahlaische Str, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Potapov, Anton] Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Brueckner, Adrian; Heethoff, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Dyckmans, Jens] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, Ctr Stable Isotope Res & Anal, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Biodiversiry & Sustainable Land Use, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Brueckner, Adrian] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, 1200 East Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Pollierer, MM (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mpollie@gwdg.de,"Potapov, Anton/M-2370-2016; Pollierer, Melanie Mira/J-9336-2019","Potapov, Anton/0000-0002-4456-1710; ",University of Gottingen; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [MA 7145/1-1],"We thank Felix Quade for providing spiders and their cocoons used in the feeding experiment.

The relationships between leaf and fine root traits have been extensively explored at global and regional scales, but remain unclear at local scales. Here, we measured six pairs of analogous leaf and fine root traits related to resource economy and organ size for coexisting dominant and subordinate vascular plants at three successional stages of temperate forest swamps in Lingfeng National Nature Reserve in the Greater Hinggan Mountains, NE China. Leaf and fine root traits related to resource acquisition (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA], leaf N, leaf P, root water content, and root P) decreased with succession. Overall, we found strong linear relationships between leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and root water content, and between leaf and root C, N, and P concentrations, but only weak correlations were observed between leaf area and root diameter, and between SLA and specific root length (SRL). The strong relationships between LDMC and root water content and between leaf and root C, N, and P held at the early and late stages, but disappeared at the middle stage. Besides, C and P of leaves were significantly correlated with those of roots for woody plants, while strong linkages existed between LDMC and root water content and between leaf N and root N for herbaceous species. These results provided evidence for the existence of strong coordination between leaf and root traits at the local scale. Meanwhile, the leaf-root trait relationships could be modulated by successional stage and growth form, indicating the complexity of coordination of aboveground and belowground traits at the local scale.","[Hu, Yu-Kun; Pan, Xu; Zhang, Man-Yin; Cui, Li-Juan] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Wetland Res, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yu-Kun; Pan, Xu; Zhang, Man-Yin; Cui, Li-Juan] Beijing Key Lab Wetland Serv & Restorat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xue-Jun; Liu, Guo-Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xu-Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Yao-Bin; Dong, Ming] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Key Lab Hangzhou City Ecosyst Protect & Restorat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Zhang, MY; Cui, LJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Wetland Res, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",cneco@126.com; lkyclj@126.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds of the Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2017QA039]; Key Laboratory of Hangzhou City for Ecosystem Protection and Restoration [ECR-2017-03],"The Fundamental Research Funds of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, Grant/Award Number: CAFYBB2017QA039; the Open Fund from the Key Laboratory of Hangzhou City for Ecosystem Protection and Restoration, Grant/Award Number: ECR-2017-03",,41,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Notably, it remains unclear whether observed interaction patterns between two trophic groups are a result of (a) preferential partner selection between groups, or (b) species interactions within groups. We conducted an experiment in order to disentangle these two drivers, using the plant-mycorrhizal symbiosis as a model system. We followed mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots growing either with or without neighbours. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of interaction within trophic groups (here, plant-to-plant interactions) on ecological network assembly. Results showed that plants were not equally affected by the presence of neighbours and that network nestedness was higher when plants grew without neighbours. We also found a poor correlation between the centrality (i.e., standardized number of interactions) of plant species grown in communities and those grown without neighbours, while the reverse was true for mycorrhizal fungi. This suggests that the optimum level of specificity or generalism in mycorrhizal selection is not a fixed plant trait, but a plastic, context-dependent one. Synthesis. Our results show that ecological networks are not only shaped by preferential partner selection, but also by interactions within a given trophic group. This finding should be considered in future modelling exercises on ecological network dynamics. Moreover, our nestedness results suggest that in the presence of multiple host plants, mycorrhizal fungi display preferences for specific interactions, suggesting that local plant diversity may shape mycorrhizal fungal community structure.","[Chagnon, Pierre-Luc] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chagnon, Pierre-Luc; Bradley, Robert L.] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada","Chagnon, PL (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Chagnon, PL (reprint author), Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",pierre-luc.chagnon@umontreal.ca,,,Canada National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Killam Trust,Canada National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Killam Trust,,83,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, to date, most of the studies on the ecological consequences of antagonistic interactions between invasive plants and the resident biota focused only on pairwise interactions. A full understanding of invasion dynamics requires studies that test the effects of multiple antagonists on fitness of invasive plants and co-occurring native plants. Here, we used an invasive plant Mikania micrantha, a co-occurring native plant Coix lacryma-jobi, and a native holoparasitic plant Cuscuta campestris to test whether parasitism on M. micrantha interacts with soil fungi and bacteria to reduce fitness of the invader and promote growth of the co-occurring native plant. In a factorial setup, M. micrantha and C. lacryma-jobi were grown together in pots in the presence versus absence of parasitism on M. micrantha by C. campestris and in the presence versus absence of full complements of soil bacteria and fungi. Fungicide and bactericide were used to suppress soil fungi and bacteria, respectively. Findings show that heavy parasitism by C. campestris caused the greatest reduction in M. micrantha biomass when soil fungi and bacteria were suppressed. In contrast, the co-occurring native plant C. lacryma-jobi experienced the greatest increase in biomass when grown with heavily parasitized M. micrantha and in the presence of a full complement of soil fungi and bacteria. Taken together, our results suggest that selective parasitism on susceptible invasive plants by native parasitic plants and soil microorganisms may diminish competitive ability of invasive plants and facilitate native plant coexistence with invasive plants.","[Li, Junmin; Oduor, Ayub M.

Studying the variation patterns of soil respiration under acid rain conditions is critically important for understanding forest C balance and performing rational forest management and operations.MethodsA split-plot design field experiment was performed in a mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of Jinyun Mountain, Chongqing from January 2016-January 2018. There were 4 main blocks; each was split into untrenched (UT) and trenched (T) treatments. Treatments with four gradient pH levels of 4.5 (control), 4.0, 3.25 and 2.5 were randomly assigned to the untrenched and trenched treatments. The soil CO2 fluxes, soil temperature, and soil moisture content were evaluated under simulated acid rain. Additionally, the effects of soil properties (soil pH, organic C, C:N ratio, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity) on soil respiration were analysed.ResultsThe soil CO2 fluxes exhibited seasonal variation trends. The annual mean soil respiration rates of the UTCK (control), UT4.0, UT3.25, and UT2.5 treatments in untrenched plots were 1.91, 1.91, 1.77, and 1.74 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in 2016 and 1.91, 1.81, 1.55 and 1.37 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in 2017, respectively. The annual mean heterotrophic respiration rates of the TCK (control), T4.0, T3.25, and T2.5 treatments in the trenched plots were 1.39, 1.32, 1.19 and 1.14 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in 2016 and 1.28, 1.18, 1.02 and 0.83 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in 2017, respectively. Acid rain had a significant cumulative effect on soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration (P<0.01). In 2016, soil respiration was similar in the UTCK versus the UT4.0 treatment but significantly inhibited under higher acidity. In 2017, soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration were significantly decreased by simulated acid rain. The treatments increased the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration but did not significantly affect the soil temperature or moisture content (P>0.05); moreover, they significantly increased the soil organic C content and C:N ratio, lowered the hydrolysable N and total P concentrations, and lowered the soil pH and fine root biomass at a later experimental stage. Urease and sucrase activities were significantly reduced in the higher-acidity treatments. Soil respiration rate was significantly positively correlated with the soil pH, fine root biomass, and urease and sucrase activity and significantly negatively correlated with the soil organic C and C:N ratio.ConclusionsAcid rain had a significant cumulative and inhibitory effect on soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration, while soil temperature and moisture had a limited effect on soil respiration under simulated acid rain. The variation in soil properties (e.g., soil organic C, C:N ratio, and fine root biomass) caused by acid rain inhibited the microbial utilization of substrates, which was the main cause of the respiration differences.","[Li, Yifan; Wang, Yunqi; Wang, Yujie; Wang, Bin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Yifan; Wang, Yunqi; Wang, Yujie; Wang, Bin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Chongqing Jinyun Forest Ecol Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Wang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Wang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Chongqing Jinyun Forest Ecol Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wangyunqi@bjfu.edu.cn,,,"Forestry Science and Technology Research Project in China [2017-02]; ""Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"" in China [2015ZCQ-SB-01]","The study was funded by the ""Forestry Science and Technology Research Project (2017-02)"" and "" the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015ZCQ-SB-01)"" in China.",,53,0,0,13,13,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-6355,2197-5620,,FOR ECOSYST,For.

As these species are frequent in disturbed areas and also occur on slopes, they can be used efficiently for bioengineering measures. We also assessed the effect of season on the mechanical properties of roots and the increased cohesion of soil supplied by the roots of the examined tree species. Six sample trees were selected randomly for each species, and two trenches were dug on the uphill and downhill sides of each sample tree. We next estimated the root area ratio (RAR), tensile force, tensile strength, and root reinforcement at each side of each sample tree. Our results showed that in shallower depths was RAR higher, and near profile walls exhibited significantly higher RAR than far walls. Downhill trenches likewise had significantly higher RAR values compared to uphill trenchers. On the other hand, the RAR values did not significantly differ between the three tree species. Tensile force and strength versus root diameter followed a positive and negative power law relationship, respectively. Tensile force was highest for Persian ironwood roots and tensile strength was significantly higher in winter compared to summer. Root reinforcement was significantly higher in winter, for Persian ironwood, at downhill slopes, and for shallow soil layers. The effect of the distance from the stem was only significant for Persian ironwood. Since little information regarding mechanical and biotechnical properties of these species have been available, this study now helps us to understand the root characteristics of important pioneer species needed to evaluate their contribution to root reinforcement and slope stability.","[Abdi, Ehsan; Deljouei, Azade] Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Karaj, Iran","Abdi, E (reprint author), Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Karaj, Iran.",abdie@ut.ac.ir,,,"Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [93022486]	The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) under the project number 93022486.

In many of the appraisal methods used, tree value is influenced by vitality, size, and lifespan. These three factors can all be negatively impacted by nearby construction activities - ultimately impacting the monetary value of urban trees and the greater urban forest. The objectives of this study were to determine whether tree value was affected by root pruning, and to compare the effectiveness of four common, parametric tree appraisal methods for this purpose. Data from three individual root pruning studies (with varying levels of root pruning) were used. Four different tree valuation methods (CTLA Trunk Formula Method 9th Edition (CTLA), the Revised Burnley Method (Burnley), the Helliwell Method (Helliwell), and the Standard Tree Evaluation Method (STEM)) were used to assess the value of trees prior to and one growing season after root removal, as well as the average of all four methods. By examining the effects of root removal (reduced growth and vitality) over the course of a growing season, the results show that appraised tree value was negatively affected (Delta value (%)) by root pruning. A general trend towards greater loss in value with increasing root removal intensity was observed for all methods for one or more treatment type (p < 0.01) when compared to control (non-root pruned) trees. The values appraised using the CTLA and Burnley methods changed incrementally across treatments given the fine resolution of the scales in the awarding criteria. STEM and Helliwell were generally insensitive to root removal treatments. Linear mixed model analyses using four independent variables (maximum severed root diameter, % tree protection zone removed, total number of severed roots, and an allometric variable (Ar-(GL)) defined as the total cross-sectional area of severed roots as a proportion of trunk cross-sectional area at ground level) revealed that % tree protection zone removal was the best performing tool for predicting percentage loss in value following root removal. Our results may be useful to those seeking compensation when tree damage has occurred due to construction-related activities.","[Benson, Andrew R.; Morgenroth, Justin] Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Sch Forestry, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand","Benson, AR (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Sch Forestry, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand.",benson_99@hotmail.co.uk,,,Tree Research and Education Endowment Fund,"This work was supported by the Tree Research and Education Endowment Fund [John Z.

A layer of gravel has been shown to deter root growth in some situations, including beneath footpaths. Used to manage storm water in highly urbanised catchments, permeable paving incorporates a gravel layer in its base for structural and hydrological purposes. Conducted in Adelaide, South Australia, the experiment reported in this paper tested whether a gravel base layer beneath permeable paving deterred shallow growth of Pyres calleryana 'Chanticleer' roots. After nearly five years of tree growth, results revealed that roots of larger diameter were fewer in number and they grew deeper in the subgrade beneath permeable paving than beneath impermeable paving. Fine root turnover in the permeable pavement base layer indicated that the gravel functioned as a buffer between the footpath surface and roots in the subgrade, potentially minimising pavement damage and maintenance requirements. No differences in tree height or trunk diameter were observed between trees grown in permeable paving and those grown in impermeable paving.","[Johnson, Timothy; Cameron, Donald] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Nat & Built Environm Res Ctr, Mawson Lakes Campus,Mawson Lakes Blvd, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia; [Moore, Gregory] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Resources, Burnely Campus,500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3132, Australia; [Brien, Chris] Univ South Australia, Sch Informat Technol & Math Sci, Phen & Bioinformat Res Ctr, Mawson Lakes Campus,Mawson Lakes Blvd, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia; [Johnson, Timothy] City Mitcham, 131 Belair Rd, Torrens Park, SA 5062, Australia","Johnson, T (reprint author), Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Nat & Built Environm Res Ctr, Mawson Lakes Campus,Mawson Lakes Blvd, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia.; Johnson, T (reprint author), City Mitcham, 131 Belair Rd, Torrens Park, SA 5062, Australia.",timothy.joluison@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Brien, Chris/D-5630-2009","Brien, Chris/0000-0003-0581-1817; cameron, donald/0000-0003-3816-779X",City of Mitcham; Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board; Research Training Program of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Education and Training; Government of South Australia's Department for Environment and Water,"The authors acknowledge the in-kind and financial support of the City of Mitcham, the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board, the Research Training Program of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Education and Training, and the Government of South Australia's Department for Environment and Water.

Reforestation of these areas after mining helps to restore ecosystem functions and land value. In Appalachia, native topsoil is normally replaced on the surface during reclamation, but waivers allow for brown and gray sandstone materials to be used as topsoil substitutes. Numerous studies report the growth of trees in these substitute mine soil materials, but few studies have compared the height of trees grown in reclaimed mine soils to the heights of trees grown in native soils. This study determined the growth of red oak (Q. rubra L.), white oak (Quercus alba L.), and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) in two mine soil types which were compared to projected growth in native soils. Heights of tree seedlings in native soils at 11 years were estimated from site indices (SI) from USDA Soil Survey data. At the mine sites, areas with brown and gray mine soils (one site with a mulch treatment) had 12 tree species planted and growth was measured annually for 11 years. Mine soil pH after 11 years was 5.3 for brown mine soils, 6.6 for gray mine soils, 7.0 for mulched mine soils, and 4.1 to 5.2 for native forest soils. After 11 years, tree heights in gray mine soils were significantly lower (0.5 m) than tree heights in brown mine soils (2.8 to 4 m) for all three species. Trees in mulched mine soils were up to 0.7 m taller than trees in un-mulched brown mine soils. After 11 years, red oak height was 6.3 m in native soils and 3 m in brown and mulched mine soils (52% lower); white oak was 7.3 m tall in native soils compared to 3.6 m in brown mine soils (50% lower); and tulip poplar was 11.5 m tall in native soils and 3.5 to 4 m tall in brown and mulched mine soils (70% lower). In gray mine soils, trees were not growing at all. While the trees in brown mine soils are growing, tree growth has not reached projected levels of tree growth in native soils during the first 11 years after planting. The purpose of forestry reclamation is to restore ecosystem diversity and function. This study showed that one measure of ecosystem function, tree growth, was 50% lower on reclaimed mine soils than native forest soils. Maturing mine soils may develop properties over time that are similar to native soils and, with the increased rooting depth, may provide conditions where increased tree growth rates and height may be attained during the next several decades.","[Dallaire, Kara] Paragon Soil & Environm Consulting, Edmonton, AB T5L 2N9, Canada; [Skousen, Jeffrey] West Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Skousen, J (reprint author), West Virginia Univ, Div Plant & Soil Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",jskousen@wvu.edu,,"Skousen, Jeff/0000-0001-5416-5941",Hatch Act at West Virginia University; Arch Coal-Birch River; Catenary Coal,"This research was funded by funds provided by the Hatch Act at West Virginia University, Arch Coal-Birch River, and Catenary Coal.",,54,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,549,10.3390/f10070549,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,IS3VE,WOS:000482080800080,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Ruess, RW; Swanson, MM; Kielland, K; McFarland, JW; Olson, KD; Taylor, DL",,,,"Ruess, Roger W.; Swanson, Michaela M.; Kielland, Knut; McFarland, Jack W.; Olson, Karl D.; Taylor, D.

We examined whether Alnus shifts EMF communities in coordination with increasingly more complex organic P forms across a 200-year-old successional sequence along the Tanana River in interior Alaska. Root-tip activities of acid phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase of A. tenuifolia-associated EMF were positively intercorrelated but did not change in a predictable manner across the shrub, to hardwood to coniferous forest successional sequence. Approximately half of all Alnus roots were colonized by Alnicola and Tomentella taxa, and ordination analysis indicated that the EMF community on Alnus is a relatively distinct, host-specific group. Despite differences in the activities of the two Alnus dominants to mobilize acid phosphatase and phosphodiesterase, the root-tip activities of P-mobilizing enzymes of the Alnus-EMF community were not dramatically different from other co-occurring boreal plant hosts. This suggests that if Alnus has a greater influence on P cycling than other plant functional types, additional factors influencing P mobilization and uptake at the root and / or whole-plant level must be involved.","[Ruess, Roger W.; Swanson, Michaela M.; Kielland, Knut; Olson, Karl D.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [McFarland, Jack W.] US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Taylor, D.

With dendrometer data at the upper and lower stem and coarse roots, we calculated the TWD and growth (ZGmax) (referring to the stem/root basal area) to show (1) the relationship of TWD in different tree heights (50% tree height (H50), breast height (BH), and roots) and the corresponding leaf water potential and (2) how mixture and drought influence the partitioning of growth and tree water. The analyses were made in a mature temperate forest of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)). Half of the plots were placed under conditions of extreme drought through automatic closing roof systems within the stand. We found a tight relationship of leaf water potentials and TWD at all tree compartments. Through this proven correlation at all tree heights we were also able to study the differences of TWD in all tree compartments next to the growth allocation. Whereas at the beginning of the growing period, trees prioritized growth of the upper stem, during the course of the year the growth of lower stem became a greater priority. Growth allocation of mixed spruces showed a tendency of a higher growth of the roots compared to the BH. However, spruces in interspecific neighborhoods exhibited a lesser TWD in the roots as spruces in intraspecific neighborhood. Beeches in intraspecific neighborhoods showed a higher TWD in BH compared to H50 as beeches in interspecific neighborhoods. Mixture seems to enhance the water supply of spruce trees, which should increase the stability of this species in a time of climatic warming.","[Schaefer, Cynthia; Roetzer, Thomas; Biber, Peter; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Thurm, Eric Andreas] Bavarian State Inst Forestry LWF, Dept Soil & Climate, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 1, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Kallenbach, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Chair Ecophysiol Plants, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Schafer, C (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",cynthia.schaefer@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868","German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)German Research Foundation (DFG) [PR 292/12-1, MA 1763/7-1, MU 831/23-1]; Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry; Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection","This research was funded by the German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), grant number PR 292/12-1, MA 1763/7-1, MU 831/23-1 ""Tree and stand-level growth reactions on drought in mixed versus pure forests of Norway spruce and European beech"", the Bavarian State Ministry for Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry, and the Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Consumer Protection.",,85,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,577,10.3390/f10070577,,,20,Forestry,Forestry,IS3VE,WOS:000482080800036,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Viera, M; Rodriguez-Soalleiro, R",,,,"Viera, Marcio; Rodriguez-Soalleiro, Roque",,,A Complete Assessment of Carbon Stocks in Above and Belowground Biomass Components of a Hybrid Eucalyptus Plantation in Southern Brazil,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon fixation; Eucalyptus stands; soil carbon; biomass carbon; allometric equations,SOIL CARBON; ABOVEGROUND CARBON; WATER; NITROGEN; FORESTS; CHRONOSEQUENCE; SEQUESTRATION; AFFORESTATION; ALLOCATION; AUSTRALIA,"Hybrid eucalypt clones are grown for fiber production worldwide and to provide an ecosystem service that can store atmospheric carbon at a very fast rate. This study assessed the carbon stocks in the soil and various tree fractions in a 10-year-old plantation of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake x Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in Southern Brazil. Four experimental plots were established, and an inventory of Eucalyptus trees was conducted by considering five diametric classes. Three trees in each diametric class were harvested for biomass and carbon quantification. The understory biomass of native trees was quantified in five subplots and the litter was quantified in 16 subplots. Organic C was quantified in the soil (SOC) and roots (diameter <= 0.5 cm) to a depth of 100 cm. The C concentration in the di ff erent biomass fractions of the eucalyptus trees were 55.7% (+/- 0.6), 50.4% (+/- 0.4), 49.5% (+/- 0.6) and 45.4 % (+/- 0.9) for leaves, branches, wood and bark, respectively. The C concentrations in the understory fractions were 51.4% (+/- 1.0) for the canopy and 50.0% (+/- 0.9) for the stem. The carbon concentration in the fine root biomass was 45.7% (+/- 1.4). Soil C concentrations were 1.23% (+/- 0.32), 0.97% (+/- 0.10), 0.45% (+/- 0.14), and 0.24% (+/- 0.10) for depths of 0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100 cm. C was allocated in: (a) the trees (aboveground fraction = 118.45 Mg ha(-1) and belowground fraction = 30.06 Mg ha(-1)), (b) the understory = 1.44 Mg ha(-1), (c) the litter = 8.34 Mg ha(-1), and (d) the soil (without roots) = 99.7 Mg ha(-1). The share of total C stock (a + b + c + d = 258.0 Mg ha(-1)) was similar in the aboveground (49.7%) and belowground (50.3%) fractions, thus indicating a very high rate of C sequestration in the biomass. Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are fast growing (for this study = 36.7 m3 ha(-1) year 1) and contribute to intense carbon sequestration in above and belowground biomass (14.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)).","[Viera, Marcio] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, UFSM Polytech Sch, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Rodriguez-Soalleiro, Roque] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Vegetal Prod, Lugo 27154, Spain","Viera, M (reprint author), Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, UFSM Polytech Sch, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",marcio.viera@ufsm.br,,,National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq-Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [200589/2014-8],The National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq-Brazil) awarded the first author with a research grant (Award Number 200589/2014-8) for a one-year stay at the USC in Spain.,,46,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,536,10.3390/f10070536,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,IS3VE,WOS:000482080800021,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Zheng, XJ; Xu, GQ; Li, Y; Wu, X",,,,"Zheng, Xin-Jun; Xu, Gui-Qing; Li, Yan; Wu, Xue",,,Deepening Rooting Depths Improve Plant Water and Carbon Status of a Xeric Tree during Summer Drought,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,drought; tree size; leaf water potential; root depth; non-structural carbohydrates,AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CARBOHYDRATE DYNAMICS; WOODY ANGIOSPERMS; MORTALITY-RATES; GROWTH; SEEDLINGS; RESPONSES; DESERT; ALLOCATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Exploring the e ff ects of drought on trees of di ff erent sizes is an important research topic because the size-dependent mortality pattern of the major dominant species significantly a ff ects the structure and function of plant communities. Here we studied the physiological performance and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) dynamics of a small xeric tree species, Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) of di ff erent tree size with varying rooting depth, during summer drought. We measured predawn (Y pd) and midday (Y m) leaf water potential, osmotic potential at saturated turgor ( 100), and turgor lost point (Y tlp), stomatal conductance (gs) at noon, maximum photochemical e ffi ciency of photosystem II (Fv /Fm) in the morning, and NSCs concentration, from June-September. Our results demonstrated that the summer drought reduces the overall performance of physiological traits of the small young trees more than the larger adult trees. Y pd, gs and Fv /Fm dropped larger in the small-diameter groups than the larger diameter groups. Substantial osmotic adjustments were observed in small size individuals (with lower 100 and Y tlp) to cope with summer drought. Furthermore, mean concentration of NSCs for the leaf and shoot were higher in September than in July in every basal stem diameter classes suggested the leaf and shoot acted as reserve for NSC. However the root NSCs concentrations within each basal stem diameter class exhibited less increase in September than in the July. At the same time, the small young tress had lower root NSCs concentrations than the larger adult tree in both July and September. The contrasting root NSC concentrations across the basal stem diameter classes indicated that the roots of smaller trees may be more vulnerable to carbon starvation under non-lethal summer drought. The significant positive relationship between rooting depth and physiological traits & root NSCs concentration emphasize the importance of rooting depth in determining the seasonal variation of water status, gas exchange and NSCs.","[Zheng, Xin-Jun; Xu, Gui-Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xin-Jun; Xu, Gui-Qing; Wu, Xue] Chinese Acad Sci, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, Fukang 831505, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xin-Jun; Xu, Gui-Qing; Wu, Xue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Siviculture, 666 Wusu St, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Xu, GQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.; Xu, GQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, Fukang 831505, Peoples R China.; Xu, GQ (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xugq@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"program of Joint Foundation of the National Natural Science Foundation; Government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China [U1603105]; Key Research Project of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC014]","This work was funded by the program of Joint Foundation of the National Natural Science Foundation and the Government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China [grant number U1603105] and the Key Research Project of Frontier Sciences, CAS (No. QYZDJ-SSW-DQC014).",,66,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,592,10.3390/f10070592,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,IS3VE,WOS:000482080800062,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Miyauchi, T; Machimura, T; Saito, M",,,,"Miyauchi, Tatsuya; Machimura, Takashi; Saito, Makoto",,,Estimating carbon fixation of plant organs for afforestation monitoring using a process-based ecosystem model and ecophysiological parameter optimization,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,afforestation; carbon cycle; Clean Development Mechanism; monitoring; parameter optimization; process-based ecosystem model,BIOME-BGC MODEL; CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM; DAILY SOLAR-RADIATION; WATER-STRESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEQUESTRATION; FORESTS; HUMIDITY; LEAF; CONDUCTANCE,"Afforestation projects for mitigating CO2 emissions require to monitor the carbon fixation and plant growth as key indicators. We proposed a monitoring method for predicting carbon fixation in afforestation projects, combining a process-based ecosystem model and field data and addressed the uncertainty of predicted carbon fixation and ecophysiological characteristics with plant growth. Carbon pools were simulated using the Biome-BGC model tuned by parameter optimization using measured carbon density of biomass pools on an 11-year-old Eucommia ulmoides plantation on Loess Plateau, China. The allocation parameters fine root carbon to leaf carbon (FRC:LC) and stem carbon to leaf carbon (SC:LC), along with specific leaf area (SLA) and maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) strongly affected aboveground woody (AC) and leaf carbon (LC) density in sensitivity analysis and were selected as adjusting parameters. We assessed the uncertainty of carbon fixation and plant growth predictions by modeling three growth phases with corresponding parameters: (i) before afforestation using default parameters, (ii) early monitoring using parameters optimized with data from years 1 to 5, and (iii) updated monitoring at year 11 using parameters optimized with 11-year data. The predicted carbon fixation and optimized parameters differed in the three phases. Overall, 30-year average carbon fixation rate in plantation (AC, LC, belowground woody parts and soil pools) was ranged 0.14-0.35 kg-C m(-2) y(-1) in simulations using parameters of phases (i)-(iii). Updating parameters by periodic field surveys reduced the uncertainty and revealed changes in ecophysiological characteristics with plant growth. This monitoring method should support management of afforestation projects by carbon fixation estimation adapting to observation gap, noncommon species and variable growing conditions such as climate change, land use change.","[Miyauchi, Tatsuya; Saito, Makoto] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Miyauchi, Tatsuya; Machimura, Takashi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Osaka, Japan","Miyauchi, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",miyauchi.tatsuya@nies.go.jp,,"Miyauchi, Tatsuya/0000-0002-8601-5099",,,,71,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Across southeast Alaska, USA, and British Columbia, Canada, Callitropsis nootkatensis (Alaska yellow-cedar) is experiencing extensive climate change-induced canopy mortality due to fine-root death during soil freezing events following warmer winters and the loss of insulating snowpack. Here, we examine the effects of ongoing, climate-driven canopy mortality on forest community composition and identify potential shifts in stand trajectories due to the loss of a single canopy species. We sampled canopy and regenerating forest communities across the extent of C. nootkatensis decline in southeast Alaska to quantify the effects of climate, community, and stand-level drivers on C. nootkatensis canopy mortality and regeneration as well as postdecline regenerating community composition. Across the plot network, C. nootkatensis exhibited significantly higher mortality than co-occurring conifers across all size classes and locations. Regenerating community composition was highly variable but closely related to the severity of C. nootkatensis mortality. Callitropsis nootkatensis canopy mortality was correlated with winter temperatures and precipitation as well as local soil drainage, with regenerating community composition and C. nootkatensis regeneration abundances best explained by available seed source. In areas of high C. nootkatensis mortality, C. nootkatensis regeneration was low and replaced by Tsuga. Our study suggests that climate-induced forest mortality is driving alternate successional pathways in forests where C. nootkatensis was once a major component. These pathways are likely to lead to long-term shifts in forest community composition and stand dynamics. Our analysis fills a critical knowledge gap on forest ecosystem response and rearrangement following the climate-driven decline of a single species, providing new insight into stand dynamics in a changing climate. As tree species across the globe are increasingly stressed by climate change-induced alteration of suitable habitat, identifying the autecological factors contributing to successful regeneration, or lack thereof, will provide key insight into forest resilience and persistence on the landscape.","[Bisbing, Sarah M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Buma, Brian J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Biol, Denver, CO USA; [Oakes, Lauren E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA USA; [Oakes, Lauren E.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Climate Change Amer Program, Bozeman, MT USA; [Krapek, John] Univ Alaska Southeast, Dept Nat Sci, Juneau, AK USA; [Bidlack, Allison L.] Univ Alaska Southeast, Alaska Coastal Rainforest Ctr, Juneau, AK USA","Bisbing, SM (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",sbisbing@unr.edu,,,,,,73,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Simultaneously, herbivores utilize volatile cues to identify appropriate hosts. Despite extensive efforts to understand sources of variation in plant communication by VOCs, we lack an understanding of how ubiquitous belowground mutualists, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), influence plant VOC emissions. In a full factorial experiment, we subjected plants of two milkweed (Asclepias) species under three levels of AMF availability to damage by aphids (Aphis nerii). We then measured plant headspace volatiles and chemical defenses (cardenolides) and compared these to VOCs emitted and cardenolides produced by plants without herbivores. We found that AMF have plant species-specific effects on constitutive and aphid-induced VOC emissions. High AMF availability increased emissions of total VOCs, two green leaf volatiles (3-hexenyl acetate and hexyl acetate), and methyl salicylate in A. curassavica, but did not affect emissions in A. incarnata. In contrast, aphids consistently increased emissions of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and benzeneacetaldehyde in both species, independent of AMF availability. Both high AMF availability and aphids alone suppressed emissions of individual terpenes. However, aphid damage on plants under high AMF availability increased, or did not affect, emissions of those terpenes. Lastly, aphid feeding suppressed cardenolide concentrations only in A. curassavica, and AMF did not affect cardenolides in either plant species. Our findings suggest that by altering milkweed VOC profiles, AMF may affect both herbivore performance and natural enemy attraction.","[Meier, Amanda R.; Hunter, Mark D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Meier, Amanda R.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Meier, AR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Meier, AR (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",armeier@umich.edu,,"Meier, Amanda/0000-0003-1085-4715",University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1256115],"We would like to thank the Matthaei Botanical Gardens for greenhouse space and help with plant care.

The allelopathic disruption of arbuscular mycorrhizal mutualism is a potentially powerful mechanism by which non-native species can negatively impact native plant diversity. However, there is limited understanding of this mechanism on woody species in forest ecosystems. In this study, we carried out a set of experiments to explore the allelopathy of Eucalyptus urophylla on mycorrhizal mutualists. Methods First, we examined allelopathic effects on the mycorrhizal growth responses of woody species by collecting leachates from the understory of an E. urophylla plantation. Second, we examined if AMF could counteract the allelopathy of E. urophylla by treating the target species with and without aqueous extract of E. urophylla and AMF inoculum. We conducted a third in vitro experiment to characterize the effects of identified putative allelochemicals (IPAs) of E. urophylla on AMF spore germination, namely Glomus mosseae, Claroideoglomus etunicatum and mixed spores extracted from field soil. Results There was a positive correlation between the stimulatory effects of natural leachates of E. urophylla and the mycorrhizal growth responses of target woody species. AMF could counteract the negative impact of E. urophylla allelopathy at a relatively low concentration. The IPAs of E. urophylla had variable effects on germination of AMF spores, from stimulatory to inhibitory, depending on chemical types and AMF species. Moreover, the AMF G. mosseae was the least sensitive to allelopathic inhibition of E. urophylla IPAs. Conclusions This study does not support the hypothesis that allelopathy degrades mycorrhizal symbioses. Our study first provides preliminary evidence for a positive correlation between allelopathy and mycorrhizal growth responses and suggests that higher mycorrhizal growth responses could better protect woody species from allelopathic inhibition in E. urophylla plantations.","[Qin, Fangcuo; Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Yu, SX (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lssysx@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Shixiao/0000-0003-1943-0185",National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31361140363]; Zhang-Hongda Science Foundation in Sun Yat-sen University,We are grateful to Yan Xie and Lufeng Zhao for their assistance in the experiments.

While variability in root traits plays a key role in belowground processes, few studies have identified the presence of an intraspecific ""Root Economics Spectrum"" (RES) within domesticated plants. Furthermore, little is known regarding if an intraspecific RES changes through plant ontogeny, and how trophic interactions - namely root nodulation - relate to above- or belowground trait spectra. Methods We evaluated covariation among 12 root, nodule, leaf, and stem traits in 134 plants of a single genotype of soy (Glycine max). Variation in these traits was assessed across five managed environmental conditions, and three plant ontogenetic stages. Results Root traits covaried along an intraspecific RES that represents a trade-off between resource acquisition and resource conservation. Variation along the RES was closely coordinated with hydraulic traits, but was orthogonal to nodule and leaf economics traits. Trait relationships varied strongly across managed environmental conditions and plant developmental stages. Conclusions Our results indicate the presence of an intraspecific RES in soy that is independent of root nodule investment. Patterns of phenotypic variation in below and aboveground soy traits demonstrate multivariate trait syndromes vary across environmental gradients and are dynamic through plant ontogeny.","[Martin, Adam R.; Hayes, Fallon J.; Borden, Kira A.; Buchanan, Serra W.; Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Martin, Adam R.; Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Ctr Crit Dev Studies, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Gordon, Andrew M.; Thevathasan, Naresh V.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada","Martin, AR (reprint author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Scarborough, ON, Canada.",adam.martin@utoronto.ca,,"Borden, Kira/0000-0002-9835-4151",Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors with to thank Jacky Tong, Mahendra Doraisami, Victor Truong, Ravin Dyal, Sylwia Pucek, Arika Hisatsune, Senping Zhang, Jason Ngo, Tom Man Hui, Motaseem Jamal, Manisha Mistry, Anisha Prasad, Luke Greco, Julia Romano, Maimuna Hafiz, and Maathura Perapakaran for their assistance in the lab.

We aim to document the ability of young grass seedlings to adjust their root system architecture, root morphology and biomass allocation to roots to promote water uptake and survival under progressive drought. Methods Seedlings growing in columns filled with sand and exposed to drought or well-watered controls were repeatedly harvested for determination of biomass fractions, root length, -architecture and -morphology in a greenhouse experiment. Allometric scaling exponents and standardised major axis regression were used to investigate allocation patterns. Results Young seedlings were able to sustain leaf turgor and functions during eight weeks of progressive drought through phenotypic plasticity of the primary root system producing deeper and simpler roots. Biomass allocation to roots decreased or did not respond, and other components of root morphology showed only moderate plasticity. Conclusion Our results suggest that morphological and architectural plasticity of the primary root system may well be key features for dehydration avoidance and survival in grass seedlings under moderate drought when allocation of biomass to roots and development of secondary roots are constrained.","[Hanslin, Hans Martin] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Dept Urban Greening & Environm Engn, Postbox 115, N-1431 As, Norway; [Bischoff, Armin] Avignon Univ, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Mediterranean Inst Biodivers & Ecol,IMBE,IRD,IUT, Agroparc,BP 61207, F-84911 Avignon 9, France; [Hovstad, Knut Anders] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Dept Landscape & Biodivers, Postbox 115, N-1431 As, Norway","Hanslin, HM (reprint author), Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Dept Urban Greening & Environm Engn, Postbox 115, N-1431 As, Norway.",hans.martin.hanslin@nibio.no,"Hanslin, Hans Martin/E-3048-2016","Hanslin, Hans Martin/0000-0002-3224-2368",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [208204],"This study was funded by The Research Council of Norway, grant no. 208204.

However, estimation of root biomass remains a challenge. We have developed a method to quantify fine root biomass of trees, tested on Pinus sylvestris L. and Betula sp. in soils in natural environment, by applying specific qPCR primers to soil DNA extracts. Methods We first validated the molecular probes in the laboratory by constructing regression equations among known root biomass in soil and the number of gene copies obtained by qPCR. Then, to test the applicability of the method in an ecosystem setting and because Pinus and Betula are important components of boreal forests after wildfire, we quantified fine root biomass from these trees in soils from forests with different degrees of tree mortality after wildfire. Results The new primers specifically amplified ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) markers from DNA extracted from fine roots of Pinus and Betula, and regression equations allowed us to calculate root biomass in soil from the number of gene copies obtained by qPCR. Root biomass of Pinus correlated positively with fire-induced canopy mortality, confirming the adequacy of the method. The biomass of Betula roots in soil did not differ across the fire severity gradient due to an overall low and stochastic presence of birch, and did not relate to the establishment of new birch seedlings. Conclusions This study shows that DNA-based qPCR methods can be used for rapid, quantitative and species-specific analysis of tree root biomass in natural forest ecosystems.","[Perez-Izquierdo, Leticia; Lindahl, Bjoern D.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Clemmensen, Karina E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Strengbom, Joachim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Perez-Izquierdo, L (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",leticia.perez@slu.se; karina.clemmensen@slu.se; joachim.strengbom@slu.se; Marie-Charlotte.Nilsson@slu.se; Bjorn.Lindahl@slu.se,"Clemmensen, Karina/C-9555-2014","Clemmensen, Karina/0000-0002-9627-6428",Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2014-01858]; LPI - Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,This research was supported by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (2014-01858).

There are two potential pathways for non-native plants to reassemble mutualisms: cointroduction (i.e. familiar associations with cointroduced mutualists) or ecological fitting (i.e. forming or adapting novel associations with resident native mutualists). We assessed the importance of each pathway for mutualist reassembly in four Australian Acacia species (A. baileyana, A. dealbata, A. decurrens and A. melanoxylon) and their associated nitrogen-fixing rhizobial symbionts in two non-native locations. Location Native ranges of acacias in south-eastern Australia and two non-native ranges in New Zealand and South Africa. Methods Rhizobia associated with each acacia species in each country were isolated and identified based on DNA sequencing of the housekeeping recA gene and the symbiotic nodA gene. Separate phylogenies were reconstructed for each gene region to infer biogeographic histories of acacia-associated rhizobia. Selected rhizobial strains for each acacia species by country combination were used as inocula in a glasshouse experiment and early growth kinetics and nitrogen fixation efficiency of acacia seedlings were compared between inoculum treatments to determine symbiotic effectiveness. Results All isolated rhizobial strains belonged to the genus Bradyrhizobium. Phylogenetic analyses revealed almost no country- or species-specific clusters of these strains for either gene region and indicated that most acacia-associated bradyrhizobia in New Zealand and South Africa were cointroduced from Australia. These results were supported by little variation in the growth performances of acacia seedlings, irrespective of inoculum treatment. Main conclusions This study revealed that cointroduction of Australian acacias and their rhizobia may be more prevalent than previously thought. Additionally, a single rhizobium cointroduction event may be sufficient to facilitate the establishment of effective mutualisms in numerous Acacia species, potentially leading to an invasion meltdown.","[Warrington, Staci; Novoa, Ana] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Matieland, South Africa; [Warrington, Staci; Ellis, Allan; Valentine, Alex; Le Roux, Johannes J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Matieland, South Africa; [Novoa, Ana] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, Claremont, South Africa; [Novoa, Ana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dept Invas Ecol, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Wandrag, Elizabeth M.; Duncan, Richard P.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Le Roux, Johannes J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Le Roux, JJ (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",jaco.leroux@mq.edu.au,"; Duncan, Richard/E-7899-2013; Valentine, Alex/G-6385-2019","Le Roux, Johannes/0000-0001-7911-9810; Wandrag, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8140-539X; Duncan, Richard/0000-0003-2295-449X; Valentine, Alex/0000-0002-7995-0900; Novoa, Ana/0000-0001-7092-3917","South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement [112097]; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); National Research Foundation [112097, 14-36079G]; South African National Department of Environment Affairs; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences","South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement, Grant/Award Number: 112097; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (CIB); National Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 112097 and 14-36079G; South African National Department of Environment Affairs; Czech Science Foundation; Czech Academy of Sciences",,56,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In mountain environments, plant cover is difficult to enhance due to harsh conditions during the dry season and steep slopes. Our objective was to evaluate the percentage of the soil surface covered by plants and the AMF community associated with trees 12.5 years after planting during forest restoration efforts in microsites at different levels of soil degradation. The study was performed in the first montane forest restoration initiative of Central Argentina, where one of the trials consisted of planting Polylepis australis saplings at microsites with different levels of soil degradation: high, intermediate, and low. After 12.5 years, percentage of bare soil cover was significantly reduced by 36 and 37% in the high and intermediate degradation microsites, respectively. Low degradation microsites were initially very low in bare soil and did not significantly change. Mycorrhizal colonization, hyphae, vesicles, arbuscules, AMF diversity, and community structure were similar among microsite types. Percentage of hyphal entry points was higher at microsites with low degradation, number of spores was higher in high and intermediate degradation, and species richness was higher in high degradation. Acaulospora and Glomus were the most abundant genera in all microsites. We conclude that even in the most degraded microsites around 2.8% of the bare soil is covered by vegetation each year and that the arbuscular mycorrhizal community is highly tolerant and adapted to soils with different disturbance types.","[Becerra, Alejandra G.; Divan, Adriana] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Casilla Correo 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Renison, Daniel] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Ctr Ecol & Recursos Nat Renovables IIByT CERNAR, Inst Invest Biol & Tecnol, Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Becerra, AG (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Casilla Correo 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",abecerra@unc.edu.ar,,"Becerra, Alejandra Gabriela/0000-0002-9055-5223",Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT 2008-438]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 0269]; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica of the National University of Cordoba (SECyT-UNC),"This work was financially supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica-PICT 2008-438, the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)-PIP 0269, and the Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica of the National University of Cordoba (SECyT-UNC).",,83,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Such plant-soil feedbacks in turn depend on the degree to which spatial distance and phylogenetic relatedness of host trees structure pathogen and mutualist communities, but research detailing these aspects of RAF communities is lacking. Here, we characterize plant-RAF associations across a diverse plant community, focusing on the degree to which RAF communities are structured by spatial distance, host phylogenetic relatedness, and host abundance. We compare results for different functional groups, including both putative mutualists and pathogens, an aspect poorly examined hitherto. We collected roots at regular intervals along ten 50 m by 2 m transects, then used DNA barcoding to identify host plants, and characterize the associated fungal community. Variance partitioning was used to measure the relative contributions of host phylogenetic relatedness and spatial distance to explaining RAF community composition. A weighted linear regression was used to measure the correlation between host abundance and RAF diversity. Phylogenetic distance among hosts was a better predictor of RAF community composition than spatial distance, but this relationship was stronger for putative pathogens than for mutualists, suggesting that pathogens show stronger host preference than mutualists. Across all functional groups, RAF showed similar levels of spatial structure. Additionally, RAF communities of locally abundant plants were less diverse than RAF communities of rare plants. Synthesis. We found that RAF communities are structured by the phylogenetic relatedness of hosts and, to a lesser extent, by spatial distance, with pathogens showing stronger host preference than mutualists. Abundant hosts had less diverse RAF communities than rare hosts, which is notable because abundant plants tend to experience weaker negative plant-soil feedback. Going forward, mechanisms underlying the host abundance-RAF diversity relationship warrant further investigation. Additionally, the survey approach presented here could be paired with experiments linking RAF community composition to plant recruitment.","[Schroeder, John W.; Martin, Jessica T.; Arias-Del Razo, Itzel; Barbosa, Jomar M.; Perea, Ramon; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther; Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Angulo, Diego F.] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Angulo, Diego F.] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Ecol Trop, Merida, Mexico; [Arias-Del Razo, Itzel] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Tlaxcala Biol Conducta, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Barbosa, Jomar M.; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Alicante, Spain; [Perea, Ramon] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Sistemas & Recursos Nat, Madrid, Spain","Schroeder, JW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jwschro@alumni.stanford.edu,"PEREA GARCIA-CALVO, RAMON/A-9120-2017; Angulo, Diego/B-3152-2015","PEREA GARCIA-CALVO, RAMON/0000-0002-2206-3614; Barbosa, Jomar Magalhaes/0000-0001-7869-5533; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845; Angulo, Diego/0000-0002-5678-4946","Stanford Global Studies Division; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/02819-7, IJCI-2015-24947]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IOF-627450]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [204053]","Stanford Global Studies Division; FAPESP, Grant/Award Number: 2013/02819-7 and IJCI-2015-24947; European Union, Grant/Award Number: FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IOF-627450; CONACYT, Grant/Award Number: 204053",,65,1,1,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The evolutionary processes that generate such generalized interactions remain unknown, partly due to the difficulty in comparing their breadth. We argue that the interaction specificity of species involved in broad interactions evolves in three ways: (a) assemblage specialization, in which a species specializes on particular host species that contribute unique resources, yielding specialization on the entire host assemblage; (b) apparent generalism, in which a species specializes on one or few host species that contribute unique resources, but also associates with other host species that contribute functionally redundant resources; and (c) true generalism, in which a species associates with multiple hosts that overlap functionally, and that are geographically interchangeable based on opportunity for encounter, leading to frequent host switching. We performed a phylogenetically controlled analysis of data on mycorrhizal fungal associations for approximately 25% of the orchid subfamily Cypripedioideae to determine whether these plants have specialized on their mycorrhizal fungal communities, or whether they are true generalists. We also assessed the impact of environmental factors on these associations. Our results suggested strong support for apparent generalism, suggesting strong specialization on particular, dominant fungi and weak specialization on others. Large orchid clades associated with dominant fungal species, notably Tulasnella cystidiophora for genus Cypripedium, and T. cystidiophora and T. calospora for genus Paphiopedilum. Significant phylogenetic signal in fungal species richness per plant species, but not in the fungal phylogenetic diversity per plant species nor in the composition of fungal assemblages across orchid species suggested that plant phylogeny is an important determinant of fungal association. Mixed linear models showed that environment influenced specificity across plant species, and that observed differences were strongly driven by differences in sampling effort. Synthesis. We found evidence of specialization of plant species on dominant fungal species, and to a lesser extent on their close relatives. The strong dominance of particular fungal species in these associations suggests important ecological roles for them, while environmental gradients in specificity suggest strong environmental filtering of these interactions.","[Shefferson, Richard P.] Univ Tokyo, Org Programs Environm Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Bunch, William] US EPA, Denver, CO USA; [Cowden, Charles C.] Valent Biosci, New Technol Res, Libertyville, IL USA; [Lee, Yung-I] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Kartzinel, Tyler R.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Yukawa, Tomohisa] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Tsukuba Bot Garden, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Downing, Jason] Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, Coral Gables, FL USA; [Jiang, Hong] Yunnan Acad Forestry, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Shefferson, RP (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Org Programs Environm Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",dormancy@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K07503]; University of Georgia","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 16K07503; University of Georgia",,52,2,2,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, there is uncertainty about how root-inhabiting fungal communities are structured, and if fungal community characteristics are significant predictors of host plant abundance. In this study, we first assessed how root-inhabiting fungal communities were structured in relation to the phylogeny and geographic origins (native vs. exotic) of their host plants in an old-field community. In addition, we took into consideration the spatial arrangements (i.e. physical locations) of the individual host plants. We then tested if the relative abundances of pathogenic and beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi could predict host plant abundances. We found that host plant phylogeny was an important factor in structuring the whole fungal community, irrespective of host plant origin. Furthermore, the spatial arrangements of individual host plants were a strong predictor of AM fungal community structure. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements appeared to similarly affect the structure of pathogenic fungal communities. No distinct differences were observed between native and exotic plant species in fungal community characteristics. The relative abundances of AM and pathogenic fungi were not significant predictors for observed abundances of their host plants. Synthesis. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements can structure naturally occurring root-inhabiting fungal communities. The absence of distinct differences in fungal community composition, including pathogens, in exotic and native plants suggests long residence times and the consequent naturalization of exotic species in the region, allowing for the establishment of similar plant-microbial interactions between native and exotic species.","[Koyama, Akihiro; Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada; [Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Koyama, Akihiro] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Koyama, A (reprint author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada.; Koyama, A (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",koyamaak@msu.edu,"Koyama, Akihiro/E-4868-2019","Koyama, Akihiro/0000-0002-3854-1035","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2015-06060, RGPIN-261300-2013]","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: RGPIN-2015-06060 and RGPIN-261300-2013",,126,1,1,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Soil aggregation, which is the major driver of mechanical soil stability, is often treated as a static phenomenon, even though aggregate turnover is continually ongoing. In fact, some breakdown of macroaggregates is necessary to allow new aggregate formation and inclusion of new organic matter into microaggregates. We determined how aggregate turnover times were affected by AMF by tracking movement of rare earth elements (REE), applied as their immobile oxides, between aggregate size classes, and using X-ray fluorescence microscopy to spatially localize REEs in a sample of aggregates. Here we show that AMF increased large macroaggregate formation and slowed down disintegration of large and small macroaggregates. Microaggregate turnover was increased in the presence of AMF. Internal aggregate organization suggested that although formation of microaggregates by accretion of soil to particulate organic matter is common, it is not the only mechanism in operation.","[Morris, E.

The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. C-13-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in C-13-SIP incubations compared to C-12-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of C-13-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps. Our study reveals hitherto underestimated functional interactions for full microbial detoxification in contaminated soils.","[Thomas, Francois; Cebron, Aurelie] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIEC, F-54500 Nancy, France; [Thomas, Francois] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Integrat Biol Marine Models LBI2M, SBR, F-29680 Roscoff, France; [Corre, Erwan] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, FR2424, ABiMS,Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29680 Roscoff, France","Cebron, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIEC, F-54500 Nancy, France.",aurelie.cebron@univ-lorraine.fr,,"Thomas, Francois/0000-0003-1896-0774",ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-JSV7-0007_01],"This study was part of the RhizOrg project funded by the ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR-13-JSV7-0007_01 project allocated to A.C.).

A systematic comparison of microbial communities using the same host species across study environments can inform the generalizability of such experiments. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize the root-associated fungi of two foundation grasses from a greenhouse PSF experiment, a field PSF experiment, field monoculture stands, and naturally occurring resident plants in the field. A core community consisting <10% of total fungal OTU richness but >50% of total sequence abundance occurred in plants from all study types, demonstrating the ability of field and greenhouse experiments to capture the dominant component of natural communities. Fungal communities were plant species-specific across the study types, with the core community showing stronger host specificity than peripheral taxa. Roots from the greenhouse and field PSF experiments had lower among sample variability in community composition and higher diversity than those from naturally occurring, or planted monoculture plants from the field. Core and total fungal composition differed substantially across study types, and dissimilarity between fungal communities did not predict plant-soil feedbacks measured in experiments. These results suggest that rhizobiome assembly mechanisms in nature differ from the dynamics of short-term, inoculation studies. Our results validate the efficacy of common PSF experiment designs to test soil inoculum effects, and highlight the challenges of scaling the underlying microbial mechanisms of plant responses from whole-community inoculation experiments to natural ecosystems.","[Chung, Y.

Here, we aimed to understand how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) affect the growth and drought tolerance of tree species used for afforestation, with the ultimate aim of using them to restore degraded karst ecosystems. A pot experiment was conducted in which Zenia insignis seedlings were inoculated separately with three AMF (Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizoglomus intraradices, and Diversispora versiformis) and a mixture of all three species under two water regimes (drought stress and normal water) in a greenhouse. The results showed that AMF have a positive effect on plant biomass, osmolytes, and antioxidant enzyme activity under drought conditions. Shoot/root biomass increased by 12.5-33.8% and plant height increased by 13.6-32.1% after inoculation with AMF under drought conditions. The phosphorus content of the shoots significantly increased in mycorrhized plants, whereas nitrogen content was minimally affected. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was higher under drought stress in mycorrhized plants than in non-mycorrhized plants. The same pattern was found for soluble sugar and proline content in mycorrhized seedings under water deficit conditions. Mixed AMF inoculation had a more beneficial effect on plant growth than single AMF inoculation. In conclusion, our results indicate that AMF inoculation could help restore degraded ecosystems in desertified karst regions.","[Zhang, Zhongfeng; Xu, Guangping; Zhou, Longwu; Li, Yanqiong] Guangxi Inst Bot, Guangxi Key Lab Plant Conservat & Restorat Ecol K, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhongfeng; Xu, Guangping; Zhou, Longwu; Li, Yanqiong] Chinese Acad Sci, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinchi] Nanjing Forestry Univ, CoInnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZF (reprint author), Guangxi Inst Bot, Guangxi Key Lab Plant Conservat & Restorat Ecol K, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",78228546@qq.com,"zhang, zhongfeng/V-7237-2019","zhang, zhongfeng/0000-0001-7578-4960; Li, Yanqiong/0000-0002-3362-7366","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470709, 41603079]; Guangxi Scientific and Technological Project [Guikegong 1598016-12]; Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration [JSSBL2017-4]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470709; 41603079), the Guangxi Scientific and Technological Project (Guikegong 1598016-12), and the Funds of Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Soil and Water Conservation and Ecological Restoration (JSSBL2017-4).

We investigated this question using provenance/progeny tests (12 provenances, 108 families) of Balanites aegyptiaca from semi-arid Niger. The nursery test included treatments for time (12-16months) and watering regime (reduced and normal). Family variation was significant for shoot diameter (Sdia), height (Sht), dry weight (Swt) and root dry weight (Rwt) in the nursery, and for tree height at 1 and 2years (Fht-1, Fht-2) but not at 13.5years (Fht-13.5) in the field. Provenance variation was significant only for root/shoot weight ratio (RSwt) in the nursery. Family mean Fht-1 and Fht-2 were positively correlated with all nursery growth variables except RSwt. Provenance mean Fht-2 was positively correlated with Sht, while provenance mean Fht-13.5 was negatively correlated with Swt and positively correlated with RSwt. Family mean survival at 13.5years was positively correlated with Swt, Sdia, Fht-1 and Fht-2. Family mean Rwt, RSwt and Fht-2 increased from the more humid western to the drier eastern locations. Most correlations with nursery growth variables were stronger at 16 than at 12months and in the normal compared with the reduced watering regime. Results suggest that Swt and Sdia may be useful for predicting family survival in the field, and Rwt and RSwt may be useful for investigating geographic variation in growth in the field. We recommend conducting both nursery and long-term field tests.","[Weber, John C.; Sotelo Montes, Carmen] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Bamako, Mali; [Soumana, Idrissa] Inst Natl Rech Agron Niger, Niamey, Niger; [Diallo, Boukary Ousmane; Bationo, Andre Babou] Inst Natl Environm & Rech Agr, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Abasse, Tougiani] Inst Natl Rech Agron Niger, Maradi, Niger; [Larwanou, Mahamane] African Forest Forum, Nairobi, Kenya; [Weber, John C.; Sotelo Montes, Carmen] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lima, Peru","Weber, JC (reprint author), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Bamako, Mali.; Weber, JC (reprint author), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lima, Peru.",johncrweber@aol.com,,,International Fund for Agricultural Development,"We thank the International Fund for Agricultural Development for financial support, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics for logistical support, and Richard Coe for technical advice regarding the experimental design and analysis of variance.",,41,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,JUL,2019,50,4,,,,,643,661,,10.1007/s11056-018-9686-9,,,19,Forestry,Forestry,IB5TJ,WOS:000470334100008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Liao, ZY; Scheepens, JF; Li, WT; Wang, RF; Zheng, YL; Feng, YL",,,,"Liao, Zhi-Yong; Scheepens, J.

In the introduced range, the evolution of functional traits or plasticity might occur as an adaptive response to novel environmental pressures. Chromolaena odorata originates from the Americas, but now is a noxiously invasive species in some other tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, plant growth, morphology, photosynthesis and plasticity were compared between C. odorata plants from five introduced and five native populations under three light intensities (low, medium and full light). Compared to native C. odorata, introduced conspecifics had higher height under medium and full light, but lower root to shoot biomass ratio across all light conditions, and lower leaf N under medium light. This indicates genetic differences between native and introduced C. odorata. Furthermore, plasticity was higher for introduced C. odorata plants than for native conspecifics under various light environments. Our results indicate that biomass reallocation (from belowground into aboveground) and stronger plasticity could contribute to successful invasion of introduced C. odorata in frequently disturbed environments.","[Liao, Zhi-Yong; Li, Wei-Tao; Zheng, Yu-Long] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liao, Zhi-Yong; Scheepens, J.

Although inoculation is a common practice in the country, there has been a progressive abandonment by farmers because they do not always see the benefits. The presence of efficient rhizobial populations may be one of the reasons why a response to inoculation is not always observed. We studied the identities and phylogenetic relationships among the clover rhizobia populating Uruguayan soils by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, ITS sequences and housekeeping (atpD, glnII, recA, rpoB) and symbiotic (nodA, nodC, nifH) genes. Strains like P3 and P33, isolated from the endemic Trifolium polymorphum, are inefficient in red and white clover. These strains clustered separately from the symbionts of these clovers. Bacteria which are efficient in red and white clovers clustered in either of two groups: one, represented by isolate 249, are likely naturalized rhizobia derived from the inoculant U204; and other included strains like U317 and N2, which share symbiotic genes with the inoculant. We hypothesize that these strains may be derived from native strains that acquired symbiotic gene from inoculant strains. These types of rhizobia are strong candidates for a second generation of clover inoculants for Uruguay.","[Tartaglia, C.; Azziz, G.; Monza, J.] Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Dept Biol Vegetal, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Lorite, M.

Puccinellia tenuiflora is considered the most promising grass species for salt-alkali grassland restoration. However, there is little information on the molecular mechanisms underlying how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhances P. tenuiflora stress responses in alkali-degraded soil. In this study, AMF colonization, growth, photosynthetic pigments, and inorganic ion contents were measured. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomic technology were employed to identify the differentially abundant proteins in P. tenuiflora seedlings with or without AMF under alkalinity stress. The results showed that AMF colonization increased seedling biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, and K+/Na+ ratio under alkalinity stress. Moreover, a total of 598 proteins were significantly differentially regulated in P. tenuiflora seedlings after AMF inoculation under alkalinity stress compared with under alkalinity stress alone. The results showed that AMF inoculation significantly improved protein synthesis, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and nitrogen metabolism to promote the biosynthesis of osmotic substances in response to alkalinity stress. In addition, P. tenuiflora seedlings produced more energy to compensate for the energy loss caused by alkalinity stress after AMF inoculation. In conclusion, these findings provide new insights into the physiological mechanisms of the response to alkali-degraded soil in P. tenuiflora seedlings with AMF and also clarify the role of AMF in the molecular regulation network of P. tenuiflora under alkalinity stress.","[Wang, Yingnan; Huang, Shouchen; Zhang, Liang; Zhao, Wenna; Yang, Chunxue] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingnan; Lin, Jixiang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Alkali Soil Nat Environm Sci Ctr, Key Lab Saline Alkali Vegetat Ecol Restorat, Minist Educ, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Yang, CX (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",50356162@qq.com,,"wang, yingnan/0000-0001-7138-7204",Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Scientific Research Developmental Fund [LBH-Q16005]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572018BK02]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31601986],"Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Scientific Research Developmental Fund, Grant/Award Number: LBH-Q16005; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2572018BK02; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31601986",,65,0,0,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Bioinoculants namely Azotobacter chroococcum, Azospirillum brasilense, Bacillus megaterium, Frateuria aurantia and Glomus aggregatum were applied individually, combindly and integrated with chemical fertilizers. Most convincing and highly significant results for growth parameters, phosphatases, dehydrogenase and trehalase activity were observed in potting mixture with application of bioinoculants + 25% recommended dose of chemical fertilizers (RDF). Extreme levels of esterase in potting mixture were noticed under the treatment with bioinoculants + 50% RDF followed by bioinoculants + 25% RDF. The highest population of Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bacillus and Frateuria in potting mixture was enumerated with consortium of bioinoculants + 25% RDF. Glomalin content and root infection recorded in Glomus aggregatum was ostensibly superior to rest of the treatments except consortium of bioinoculants + 25% RDF. Correlation analysis revealed significant and positive interaction between microbial population and enzyme activities. The study suggests that integrated use of bioinoculants along with 25% RDF play a significant role in enhancing oil palm seedling growth through increased microbial population and enzyme activity in rhizosphere.","[Veeramachaneni, Suneetha] Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Hyderabad 500085, Telangana, India; [Ramachandrudu, K.] ICAR Indian Inst Oil Palm Res, Dept Crop Prod, Pedavegi, India","Veeramachaneni, S (reprint author), Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Hyderabad 500085, Telangana, India.",suryadevarav@yahoo.co.in,,,"ICAR-Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research, Pedavegi, Andhra Pradesh, India","UThe author acknowledges and appreciates the support of ICAR-Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research, Pedavegi, Andhra Pradesh, India for providing facilities for carrying out my research work.",,36,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0365-0340,1476-3567,,ARCH AGRON SOIL SCI,Arch.

Knowledge of the effect of soil N and moisture availability on Rs and its components (heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra)) is important understand soil C responses to climate change. Therefore, an 8-year field manipulation experiment to investigate the responses of Rs and its components to a reduction in the growing season precipitation amount with or without N addition was conducted in northern China. The results show that the average annual Rs, Rh, and Ra rates increased on average by 47%, 94%, and 38%, respectively, under the N addition treatments; increased on average by 18%, 53%, and 24%, respectively, under the precipitation reduction treatments; and increased on average by 5%, 4%, and 6%, respectively, under their interaction. The Rs and Rh were positively correlated with fine root biomass and microbial biomass, whereas the Ra was only related to the fine root biomass. Nitrogen addition and precipitation reduction significantly increased the Rs, Rh and Ra, possibly due to increased root biomass and microbial biomass. The Rs and Rh were not significantly affected by the interaction of N addition and precipitation reduction, whereas their combined effects significantly decreased the Ra. The Rs and Ra were also negatively correlated with soil total P concentration. The N addition significantly decreased the contribution of Rh to Rs compared with that of the control and precipitation reduction treatments, and precipitation reduction only significantly decreased the contribution of Rh to Rs compared with that of the control treatment in 2017. The results suggest that the N addition played a more important role than precipitation reduction in changing the contribution of Rh and Ra to Rs. Moreover, the N addition and precipitation reduction significantly increased the Q(10) value of the Rs and Rh, suggesting that the N addition and precipitation reduction may alter the response of soil C emission to global climate warming to a certain degree. However, the study highlights the crucial importance of the impacts of N addition, precipitation reduction, and their interaction on Rs and its components and could improve predictions of the future states of the soil C cycle in response to global climate change.","[Chen, Fei; Yan, Guoyong; Wang, Qinggui; Liu, Tong] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yan, Guoyong; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui; Wang, Honglin; Huang, Binbin; Hong, Ziming] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Xing, Yajuan] Inst Forestry Sci Heilongjiang Prov, 134 Hoping Rd, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junhui; Dai, Guanhua; Zheng, Xingbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Wang, QG; Liu, T (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.; Wang, QG (reprint author), Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",qgwang1970@163.com; frauliu@126.com,,"Wang, Qinggui/0000-0003-2456-5770","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41773075, 41575137, 31370494, 31170421]","This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41773075, 41575137, 31370494, 31170421).",,61,0,0,53,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

Due to different substrate sources and biological processes, the heterotrophic (SRh) and autotrophic (SRa) components of soil respiration (SRtot) may respond to changing precipitation in different ways. Determining the differential responses of SRh and SRa to precipitation will facilitate our evaluation of soil C storage and stability under future precipitation change. Here, a 3-year precipitation manipulation experiment with 5 levels of precipitation (+/- 60%, +/- 30% and ambient growing season precipitation) was conducted in a semiarid steppe to determine the influence of precipitation on soil respiration. Results showed that SRtot, increased nonlinearly with increasing water supply, in which, SRh increased much more than SRa. Consequently, the ratio of SRh to SRtot, was enhanced significantly with increasing precipitation, i.e., from 41% to 62% as precipitation increased from 122 mm to 408 mm. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that changes in SR h and SR C were predominated by the soil water content (SWC) and plant growth, respectively. The stronger effects exerted by changes in precipitation on SWC compared with plant growth contributed to the greater change in SR h than in SRa. Additionally, SRa exhibited a higher temperature sensitivity than SRh. Thus, the increased soil temperature in the drought treatments had greater influence on SRa than SRh, and greatly offset the influence of drought stress on SRa, leading to the smaller change in SRa compared with SRh. Our study highlights the different responses of the two soil respiration components to changing precipitation. These results indicate that future increases in precipitation in semiarid regions will increase soil heterotrophic respiration which may accelerate the turnover of soil C, and further affect the stability of soil C stock.","[Zhang, Bingwei; Li, Weijing; Chen, Shiping; Tan, Xingru; Wang, Shanshan; Ren, Tingting; Huang, Jianhui; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bingwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Departrrzent Ecol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bingwei; Li, Weijing; Tan, Xingru; Wang, Shanshan; Huang, Jianhui; Han, Xingguo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Minling] Jinan Univ, Coll Chinese Language & Culture, Guangzhou 510610, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jianyang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Res Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Chen, SP (reprint author), 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",spchen@ibcas.ac.cn,"Xia, Jianyang/S-9499-2019",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604801, 2016YFC0500700]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41773084, 31700375]","This study is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604801 and 2016YFC0500700), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41773084 and 31700375).",,56,1,1,35,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

However, most of the mangrove wetlands structural and functional information useful to evaluate the quality, quantity and monetary value of its ESs has been obtained from studies at tropical latitudes usually dominated by large deltas and extensive coastal lagoon and estuaries. Thus, there is a major data gap for mangrove wetlands located in arid and semi-arid regions due to their limited land cover and location at the boundary of transitional climate gradients. Here we analyze the spatial distribution of mangrove wetlands carbon stocks and net primary productivity (i.e., litterfall and root productivity) in La Paz Bay, an arid coastal region in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where mangrove wetlands are spatially distributed in conspicuously extensive patches. We used this information to qualitatively rank ESs. Three peri-urban mangrove wetland sites (Balandra, Enfermeria, and Zacatecas) were characterized by different degrees of anthropogenic impact. Aboveground biomass (interval: 13.6 to 31.6 Mg C ha(-1)) was in the lower range when compared globally. The average C storage in mangrove soils (at 45 cm depth) in La Paz Bay is 175 Mg C ha(-1), which is higher than the values reported for other arid zones (>= 1 m soil depth: 43-156 Mg C ha(-1)). Belowground root biomass and productivity values (roots range: 0.22-0.31 Mg C ha(-1); fine roots NPP: 0.06-0.09 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were in the lower range. We found distinct differences in aboveground C storage values among sites where mangrove species formed monospecific stands across the landscape within each site. Areas dominated by the species Rhizophora mangle reflected the highest soil C density values (208.9 +/- 144.6 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by Laguncularia racemosa (181.4 +/- 118.2 Mg C ha(-1)) and Avicennia germinans (155.5 +/- 72.1 Mg C ha(-1)). We identified ESs provided by each of the sites, including both cultural (i.e., ecotourism; especially in Balandra), and provisioning (fisheries) services. Our study is a first step in the quantitative assessment of functional and structural properties as ESs of arid mangrove wetlands in La Paz Bay that could be readily translated into robust economic estimates for this arid coastal region.","[Ochoa-Gomez, Jonathan G.; Lluch-Cota, Salvador E.; Lluch-Cota, Daniel B.; Troyo-Dieguez, Enrique; Serviere-Zaragoza, Elisa] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico; [Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Oechel, Walter] San Diego State Univ, Global Change Res Grp, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Oechel, Walter] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England","Serviere-Zaragoza, E (reprint author), Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico.",serviere04@cibnor.mx,,,Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [388919]; Department of the Interior South-Central Climate Adaptation Science Center [G12AC00002]; Florida Coastal Everglades-LTER international collaboration initiative [DEB-1237517],"This research was funded by the Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) agency through a research grant to ESZ and SELlC and a doctoral scholarship to JGOG (grant #388919).

After eight months of treatment with simulated wind load (8.2 m s(-1)) during the day, the non-wind-stressed control seedlings developed taller height (118%), larger stem base diameter (110%), root biomass (100%), shoot biomass (228%), and longer taproot length (56%) than those of wind-stressed seedlings. Furthermore, the wind-stressed seedlings distributed more roots at the windward side than at the leeward side, whereas the control seedlings distributed their root systems in all directions. The average maximum pullout resistance (0.25 +/- 0.11 kN) of the control seedlings was significantly higher than that of the wind-stressed ones (0.08 +/- 0.04 kN). Additionally, the control seedlings had significantly higher root tensile strength than the wind-stressed ones in 0-1, 1-2 and 2-5 mm root diameter classes, respectively.

Here, we explore how stomatal control and drought tolerance traits influence the duration of drought stress leading to critical levels of hydraulic failure. We examined the growth and physiological responses of four woody plant species (three angiosperms and one conifer) representing a range of water-use and drought tolerance traits over the course of two controlled drought-recovery cycles followed by an extended dry-down. At the end of the final dry-down phase, we measured changes in biomass ratios and leaf carbohydrates. During the first and second drought phases, plants of all species closed their stomata in response to decreasing water potential, but only the conifer species avoided water potentials associated with xylem embolism as a result of early stomatal closure relative to thresholds of hydraulic dysfunction. The time it took plants to reach critical levels of water stress during the final dry-down was similar among the angiosperms (ranging from 39 to 57 days to stemP(88)) and longer in the conifer (156 days to stemP(50)). Plant dry-down time was influenced by a number of factors including species stomatal-hydraulic safety margin (g(s)P(90) - stemP(50)), as well as leaf succulence and minimum stomatal conductance. Leaf carbohydrate reserves (starch) were not depleted at the end of the final dry-down in any species, irrespective of the duration of drought. These findings highlight the need to consider multiple structural and functional traits when predicting the timing of hydraulic failure in plants.","[Blackman, Chris J.; Creek, Danielle; Maier, Chelsea; Aspinwall, Michael J.; Drake, John E.; Pfautsch, Sebastian; Medlyn, Belinda E.; Tissue, David T.; Choat, Brendan] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Aspinwall, Michael J.] Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Drake, John E.] SUNY Syracuse, Forest & Nat Resources Management, ESF, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Pfautsch, Sebastian] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Social Sci & Psychol Urban Studies, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [O'Grady, Anthony] CSIRO Land & Water, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, BIOGECO, F-33615 Pessac, France","Blackman, CJ (reprint author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",c.blackman@westernsydney.edu.au,"Tissue, David/H-6596-2015; Aspinwall, Michael/M-2083-2014","Tissue, David/0000-0002-8497-2047; Aspinwall, Michael/0000-0003-0199-2972",Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment; Western Sydney University;  [ANR-10-EQPX-16],"This experiment was supported by the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment and Western Sydney University and the ANR-10-EQPX-16, XYLOFOREST.

How climate change-induced tree mortality could affect the ecology and carbon (C) sink capacity of soils remains unknown. This study investigated regional-scale drought-induced tree mortality, based on events that occurred after a very dry year (2012) in the Carpathians mountain range (Romania), which caused mortality in three common conifer species: Scots pine, Black pine, and Silver fir. This resulted in hot-spots of biogenic soil CO2 emissions (soil respiration; Rs). Four to five years after the main mortality event, Rs-related soil CO2 emissions under dead trees were, on average, 21% (ranging from 18 to 35%) higher than CO2 emissions under living trees. Total (Rs) and heterotrophic (R-H)-related soil CO2 emissions were strongly related to alterations in the soil environment following tree mortality (e.g. changes in quantity and quality of soil organic matter, microclimate, pH or fine root demography). Moreover, the massive mortality event of 2012 resulted in greater presence of successional vegetation (broadleaf seedlings, shrubland and grasses), which may control the environmental factors that either directly or indirectly affected biotic soil fluxes (Rs and R-H). Besides the well-known direct effects of climate change on soil CO2 emissions, the cascading effects triggered by climate change-induced tree mortality could also exert a strong indirect impact on soil CO2 emissions. Overall, climate change-induced tree mortality alters the magnitude of environmental controls on Rs and hence determines how the ecosystem C budget responds to climate change.","[Curiel Yuste, J.; Garcia-Angulo, D.; Heres, A-M] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Curiel Yuste, J.] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Maria Diaz de Haro 3,6 Solairua, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain; [Flores-Renteria, D.] CONACYT CINVESTAV Unidad Saltillo, Grp Sustainabil Nat Resources & Energy, Av Ind Met 1062,Parque Ind Ramos Arizpe, Ramos Arizpe 25900, Coahuila, Mexico; [Heres, A-M; Petritan, I.

Climate change and anthropogenic forcing have altered the dominant characteristics of some forested ecosystems through changes to their disturbance regimes, particularly fire. Ecosystems that historically burned frequently, like pinelands in the southeastern United States, risk changes in their structure and function when the fire regime they require is altered. Although the carbon storage potential in an unburned southeastern U. S. forest would be larger, this scenario is unrealistic due to the likelihood of wildfire. Additionally, fire exclusion can have negative consequences on these forests health, biodiversity, and species endemism. There is a need, specifically for the southeast, to estimate carbon and species dynamics based on the differences between various fire regimes, and particularly the differences between prescribed fire and wildfire. These are important factors to consider given that prescribed fire is a common tool used in the southeast, and wildfires are ever more present. Field data from an experimental Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) forest of southwest Georgia were used to parametrize the forest landscape model LANDIS-II. The model simulated how carbon and species dynamics differ under a fire exclusion, a prescribed fire, and multiple wildfire scenarios. All scenarios except fire exclusion resulted in net emissions to the atmosphere, but prescribed fire produced the least carbon emissions from fire and maintained the most stable aboveground biomass compared to wildfire scenarios. Removing fire for approximately a century was necessary to obtain an average stand-level biomass greater than that of prescribed fire and net emissions less than that of prescribed fire. The prescribed fire scenario produced a longleaf pine-dominated forest, the exclusion scenario converted to predominantly oak species Quercus virginiana (live oak), Q. stellata (post oak), and Q. margaretta (sand post oak), while scenarios with intermediate wildfire regimes supported a mix of other fire-facilitator hardwoods and pine species, such as Q. incana (bluejack oak) and Pinus elliotti (slash pine). Overall, this study supports prescribed fire regimes in southeastern U. S. pinelands to both minimize carbon emissions and preserve native biodiversity.","[Flanagan, Steven A.; Hiers, J.

Interspecific conflict and partner-maladaptation are frameworks to explain this variation, with different implications for mutualism stability. We investigated the mutualist service of nitrogen fixation in a metapopulation of root-nodule forming Bradyrhizobium symbionts in Acmispon hosts. We uncovered Bradyrhizobium genotypes that provide negligible mutualist services to hosts and had superior in planta fitness during clonal infections, consistent with cheater strains that destabilise mutualisms. Interspecific conflict was also confirmed at the metapopulation level - by a significant negative association between the fitness benefits provided by Bradyrhizobium genotypes and their local genotype frequencies - indicating that selection favours cheating rhizobia. Legumes have mechanisms to defend against rhizobia that fail to fix sufficient nitrogen, but these data support predictions that rhizobia can subvert plant defenses and evolve to exploit hosts.","[Gano-Cohen, Kelsey A.; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Microbiol & Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gano-Cohen, Kelsey A.; Wendlandt, Camille E.; Stokes, Peter J.; Blanton, Mia A.; Quides, Kenjiro W.; Zomorrodian, Avissa; Adinata, Eunice S.; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Wendlandt, Camille E.; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Microbiol & Plant Pathol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",joel.sachs@ucr.edu,"Sachs, Joel/AAB-9348-2019","Sachs, Joel/0000-0002-0221-9247","University of California RiversideUniversity of California System; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1150278, 1738028]","KGC received funding from the University of California Riverside in the form of a Dissertation Year Fellowship.

Here, a two-year pot experiment was conducted with two ectomycorrhizal (Pinus elliottii and Pinus massoniana) and four arbuscular mycorrhizal (Cinnamomum camphora, Cunninghamia lanceolata, Michelia maudiae and Schima superba) subtropical tree species to evaluate the relative effects of living roots and mycorrhizal fungal hyphae on their own root litter decomposition and to test whether these effects differed between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. To achieve these objectives, litterbags with 50-mu m and 1-mm mesh sizes filled with root litter of a given tree species were simultaneously installed in pots planted with the same species and unplanted pots filled with composite soil for all species. Effects of living roots alone were calculated as differences in root litter decomposition between 50-mu m and 1-mm mesh litterbags installed in planted pots. Mycorrhizal hyphal effects were calculated as differences in root litter decomposition between 50-mu m litterbags installed in planted and unplanted pots. The presence of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae significantly reduced root litter mass loss and inhibited the activities of beta -glucosidase and phenol oxidase, while effects of living roots alone were non-significant when all tree species were pooled and inconsistent at the tree species level. Mycorrhizal fungal hyphae induced decreases in root litter mass loss that were markedly related to their inhibitory effects on beta -glucosidase and phenol oxidase activities. When tree species were grouped by their mycorrhizal types, non-significant differences were observed between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees in their living root or mycorrhizal fungal effects on root litter decomposition. These findings highlight the important roles of mycorrhizal fungi in mediating litter decomposition via interacting with saprotrophic microbes and suggest that changes in tree carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi owing to global change may affect soil carbon storage.","[Lin, Guigang; Zeng, De-Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhengxia] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Zeng, DH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",linguigang@126.com; chen_zhengxia@163.com; zengdh@iae.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31700538, 31830015]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC002]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2019200]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31700538 and 31830015), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC002) and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (No. 2019200).",,57,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JUN,2019,10,6,,,,,,,,10.3390/f10060502,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,II6LI,WOS:000475305000042,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Olchowik, J; Hilszczanska, D; Bzdyk, RM; Studnicki, M; Malewski, T; Borowski, Z",,,,"Olchowik, Jacek; Hilszczanska, Dorota; Bzdyk, Roman Mariusz; Studnicki, Marcin; Malewski, Tadeusz; Borowski, Zbigniew",,,Effect of Deadwood on Ectomycorrhizal Colonisation of Old-Growth Oak Forests,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biaowiea; coarse woody debris; Quercus robur; ectomycorrhizae; exploration type,SPRUCE PICEA-ABIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; EXPLORATION TYPES; WOODY DEBRIS; NITROGEN; SOIL; LOGS; DIFFERENTIATION; SEEDLINGS,"Although the importance of coarse woody debris (CWD) for species diversity is recognized, the effects of coarse woody debris decay class on species composition have received little attention.

The highest degree of mycorrhizal colonization was found in CWDadvanced (27.2%) and CWDearly (27.1%). Based on exploration types, ectomycorrhizae were classified with respect to ecologically relevant soil features. The short distance type was significantly correlated with soil P2O5, while the contact type was correlated with soil C/N. The lowest mean content of soil C-org was found in the CWDabsent site. The difference in total soil N between sites decreased with increasing CWD decomposition, whereas total C/N increased correspondingly.

However, the contribution of microbial residue to SOC storage remains largely unknown in land use change processes. To this end, we adopted a space for time approach to examine the dynamics of SOC and amino sugars, which was a biomarker of microbial residue C, in different natural forest conversions. Three typical converted forests were selected: an assisted natural regeneration (ANR) and two coniferous plantations of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Chinese fir) and Pinus massoniana Lamb. (pine) each. All of these were developed at the same time after the harvest of an old natural forest and they were used to evaluate the effects of forest conversions with contrasting anthropogenic disturbance on SOC and microbial residue C, along with the natural forest. Natural forest conversion led to an approximately 42% decrease in SOC for ANR with low anthropogenic disturbance, 60% for the Chinese fir plantation, and 64% for the pine plantation. In contrast, the natural forest conversion led to a 32% decrease in the total amino sugars (TAS) for ANR, 43% for the Chinese fir plantation, and 54% for the pine plantation at a soil depth of 0-10 cm. The ratios of TAS to SOC were significantly increased following natural forest conversion, with the highest ratio being observed in the Chinese fir plantation, whereas the ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid (GluN/MurA) were significantly decreased in the two plantations, but not in ANR. The contents of SOC, individual amino sugar, or TAS, and GluN/MurA ratios were consistently higher at a soil depth of 0-10 cm than at 10-20 cm for all of the experimental forests. Redundancy analysis showed that microbial residue C was significantly correlated with SOC, and both were positively correlated with fine root biomass, annual litterfall, and soil available phosphorus. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that microbial residue C accumulation varied with SOC and litter input, and played a more important role in SOC storage following forest conversion to plantations with higher anthropogenic disturbance.","[Yang, Liuming; Chen, Silu; Li, Yan; Wang, Quancheng; Zhong, Xiaojian; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liuming; Chen, Silu; Li, Yan; Wang, Quancheng; Zhong, Xiaojian; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China","Lin, CF (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Lin, CF (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.",yanglm2007@aliyun.com; pgydesj@163.com; 15705956185@163.com; wangquancheng0304@126.com; xj.zhong@fjnu.edu.cn; zhijieyang@fjnu.edu.cn; tonylcf99@fjnu.edu.cn; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31770663, 31300523, 31130013, 31600433, 31700545]","The research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31770663, 31300523, 31130013, 31600433, and 31700545).",,78,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JUN,2019,10,6,,,,,,,,10.3390/f10060468,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,II6LI,WOS:000475305000008,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Zhu, MX; Xue, WL; Xu, H; Gao, Y; Chen, SN; Li, B; Zhang, ZQ",,,,"Zhu, Mengxun; Xue, Wanlai; Xu, Hang; Gao, Yuan; Chen, Shengnan; Li, Bin; Zhang, Zhiqiang",,,Diurnal and Seasonal Variations in Soil Respiration of Four Plantation Forests in an Urban Park,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil respiration; soil temperature; soil moisture; temporal variation; urban plantation forest,SEMIARID LOESS PLATEAU; GREENHOUSE-GAS FLUXES; ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; CO2 EFFLUX; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; DIEL HYSTERESIS; LAND-USE; TEMPERATURE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; VEGETATION,"Understanding the carbon dynamics of urban trees and forests is one of the key components for developing mitigation strategies for climate change in a fast-paced urbanized world.

The diurnal and seasonal changes in soil respiration (Rs) and biophysical factors were measured from April 2015 to March 2016. At the diurnal scale, Rs varied out of phase with soil temperature (Ts) and the time-lag occurred in May and July when Ts was relatively high and soil moisture (Ms) was low. Strong seasonal variations in Rs were mainly determined by Ts, while the growing-season mean Rs positively correlated with the fine root biomass (FRB), soil organic carbon content (SOC), and total nitrogen content (TN) for all the forests. FRB alone could explain 75% of the among-stand variability.

Although dioecious plants are widespread, little is known about rhizosphere microenvironmental differences in response to dioecious plants.Materials and methodsThis study characterized microbial species by next-generation sequencing and evaluation of soil properties in the rhizosphere of male and female Populus cathayana plants located in non-saline area (control site), salt lakeside (low salt), salt mountain (middle salt), and salt factory (high salt) areas.Results and discussionA total of 5 phyla, 18 classes, 57 orders, 108 families, and 211 genera of fungi were observed in the rhizosphere of P. cathayana, while 18 phyla, 35 classes, 69 orders, 149 families, and 329 genera of bacteria were observed in the rhizosphere of P. cathayana. With increasing salinization, the microbial community diversity in the rhizosphere of P. cathayana first increased and then decreased, especially in the fungal community. Site and sex had significant effects on microbial communities and caused adjustments in microbial community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that available K, ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) as well as Na+ and Cl- contents and the electrical conductivity (EC) were the main factors affecting the microbial community in the rhizosphere of P. cathayana in the Chaka Salt Lake ecosystem.ConclusionsThis is the first study focusing on microbial communities and soil properties in the rhizosphere of male and female P. cathayana plants with different degrees of salinity.

We aim to understand how two co-occurring tree species with distinct rooting and physiological characteristics respond to those two variables during two climatically distinct growing seasons.MethodsGrowing season (May to September) sap and transpiration fluxes were monitored using heat ratio method sap flow sensors on Populus tremuloides and Picea glauca in 2014 and 2015 growing along a hillslope with two different soil cover depths providing different rooting spaces.ResultsAcross the two growing seasons, a shallow rooting space was the main factor limiting aspen's leaf area and cumulative sap flux, whereas responses of white spruce were more limited by topographical position. Generally, sap and transpiration fluxes decreased with the season; however, a large precipitation event during the 2015 summer triggered a significant recovery in sap and transpiration fluxes in white spruce, while in aspen this response was more muted.ConclusionsThe two species distinct rooting and physiological characteristics produced contrasting water uptake and water use dynamics in response to rooting space, soil water availability and climate, inviting a more detailed exploration of sap flux and its interactions with climatic and edaphic variables.","[Merlin, Morgane; Landhausser, Simon M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 4-42 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Merlin, M (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 4-42 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",morgane@ualberta.ca,,,"National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA); Syncrude Canada Ltd.; Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.; Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil Ltd.","We would like to acknowledge the funding support provided by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA, Syncrude Canada Ltd., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil Ltd.).",,82,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2019,439,2-Jan,,,SI,,487,504,,10.1007/s11104-019-04029-6,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,IH3YP,WOS:000474429100032,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gilani, MM; Ahmad, I; Farooq, TH; Wu, PF; Yousaf, MS; Khan, MW; bin Yousaf, T; Ma, XQ",,,,"Gilani, Matoor Mohsin; Ahmad, Irfan; Farooq, Taimoor Hassan; Wu, Pengfei; Yousaf, Muhammad Sohail; Khan, Muhammad Waqqas; bin Yousaf, Talha; Ma, Xiangqing",,,Effects of pre-sowing treatments on seed germination and Morphological growth of Acacia nilotica and Faidherbia albida,SCIENTIA FORESTALIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dormancy; Germination; Survival percentage; Root-shoot Ratio; Plant growth; Acacia nilotica; Faidherbia albida,SMOKE; BUTENOLIDE; HEAT,"Forests are generated by natural and artificial means. In case of artificial regeneration seedlings are raised in nurseries and transplanted to the field. Sexual and asexual propagation methods are commonly used for growing trees. Most of the trees are propagated by sexual means. Sometimes healthy seeds do not germinate even after the availability of proper temperature, light and sufficient moisture. Seed dormancy is the failure of the developed seed to germinate in the appropriate situation. Objective of our study was to discover the best suitable technique for breaking seed dormancy of Acacia nilotica and Faidherbia albida. To increase the germination, different dormancy breaking techniques were used including, hot water, cold water, mechanical and sulphuric acid treatment. This research was conducted in (RCBD) Randomized complete block design and data concerning germination and other factors were collected weekly. Numerous morphological parameters were studied. The maximum survival percentage was observed in hot water treatment followed by cold water treatment and mechanical treatment. Maximum germination percentage was 76.2 (%) and it was observed in A. nilotica whereas minimum 12.6 (%) was observed in F. albida. Highest survival percentage was 62.8% and minimum 8.8%, maximum plant height 9.99 cm while minimum height was 2.39 cm, maximum root length was 8.09 cm and minimum 2.12 cm was recorded in A. nilotica and F. albida in all treatments.

In the context of recalcitrant litter decomposition, specifically coarse wood debris, it is uncertain as to what is the relative importance of soil communities associated with living roots when compared to those without roots. Here, it is hypothesized that the presence of live roots and active photosynthates will enhance wood decomposition. To test this hypothesis, the presence or absence of temperate tree roots was used in this study. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and white oak (Quercus alba) roots were manipulated at three sites of either limestone or shale parent rock residuum. At each site, wood substrate was placed in soils beneath the canopy of either A. saccharum or Q. alba, while in the presence of roots (root(+)). At the same time, wood substrate was placed in the same soil community, but live root exposure was eliminated by trenching (root(-)). This eliminated active photosynthate supply to the soil microbial community. Results determined that live root exposure promoted faster decomposition and greater mycelial colonization of wood substrate. Also, sites of shale parent rock residuum had higher rates of decomposition in comparison with limestone parent rock residuum. Although additional work is needed to determine the extent in which roots and lithology can facilitate wood decomposition, these findings suggest that living roots impact decomposers and provide a pathway towards humus and soil organic matter formation.","[Malik, Rondy J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Malik, Rondy J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Environm Microbiol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Malik, RJ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rjm472@psu.edu,,,Alfred P.

Despite predicted changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change, little is known as to how the strength and direction of feedbacks change under differing soil moisture regimes. We performed a fully reciprocal greenhouse experiment where seedlings of two co-occurring Asclepias spp. (milkweed) were grown either with their own or the other species' microbial communities under high or low watering treatments. We found that seedlings of each species were smaller when exposed to conspecific relative to heterospecific soil biota, perhaps due to a build-up of specific soil pathogens. Importantly, this negative feedback diminished under reduced water-availability, and also in the absence of live soil organisms.

Traits associated with rapid resource capture may come at the expense of those related to stress resistance. In annual plants, such a tradeoff may be reflected through plant size (biomass) vs. biomass partitioning patterns, as the former represents resource capture rate while the latter represents reorganization to cope with resource stress. In a water-limited annual plant community we investigated: 1) the effects of water and nitrogen availability on plant size and biomass partitioning, i.e., biomass partitioning between organs (root to shoot ratio, R/S, and reproductive effort, Rep/Veg), and biomass partitioning in space (specific leaf area, SLA), 2) the relationship between plant size and biomass partitioning at both the interspecific and intraspecific level, and 3) the relationships between plant size and biomass partitioning strategy and stress resistance. Eight key species varying in their natural size range were grown under variable water and nitrogen availability and their size and biomass partitioning were monitored throughout their growth and at fixed phenological phases. In all species, reduced water and/or nitrogen availability was associated with smaller size, increased R/S, and decreased SLA while Rep/Veg remained constant. At the intraspecific level, plant size was negatively related to R/S and positively related to SLA. At the interspecific level, no relationship was found between size or stress resistance and any of the biomass-partitioning traits or their plasticity. However, species size was negatively related to stress resistance. This tradeoff between species size and stress resistance emerges as a consistent property of fundamental importance in shaping annual plant communities along resource gradients.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Phys Dept, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Agr Res Org, Volcani Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel","Dovrat, G (reprint author), Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [861/09],"Thanks to Sivan Golan, Itzhak Kamara and all Israel Plant Gene Bank staff for help with seed storage and germination.

However, threshold observations of N status change from N limit to N saturation by far are not conclusive in these ecosystems. Research on the natural abundance of N-15 (N-15) could greatly help provide integrated information about ecosystem N status. The goal of this study was to investigate the suitability of measurements of N-15 of major ecosystem N pools and several key species, plant N-15 fractionation, together with key vegetation and soil indicators in response to N fertilization as a tool to identify the N status in a temperate steppe in Inner Mongolia. We carried out a N addition experiment during 201114 on a Stipa krylovii steppe in Inner Mongolia, Northern China. We investigated the response of several key N transformation processes, vegetation and soil properties to N addition. Aboveground biomass and belowground biomass (BGB) N-15, root and foliar N-15 of three dominant species (Artemisia frigida, S. krylovii and Leymus chinensis), N-15 of soil total N and soil KCl-extractable NO3-N were determined. The responses of isotope fractionation during plant N uptake and reallocation to N addition were also determined. Our results suggest that the N addition rate of 5g N m(2) yr(1) could be regarded as threshold of early N saturation in this S. krylovii steppe as indicated by an increase in plant fractionation and a decrease in plant N-15. When N input rate is > 10 g N m(2) yr(1), increased N deposition can lead to an apparent reduction in species richness and BGB as well as an increase in NO3 in extractable soil pools < 30-cm soil profile. With N addition, S. krylovii and A. frigida undergo earlier N status shift from N limitation toward N excess compared with L. chinensis, contributing to L. chinensis out-competing other species. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of N status change in temperate steppe based on isotope evidence and several other functional variables and contributes to predicting the responses of temperate steppe to future global N deposition scenario.","[Sheng, Zhilu; Huang, Yongmei; Borjigin, Narigele; Chen, Huiying; Li, Engui; Xu, Xia] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Resource Ecol, 19,XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [He, Kejian] Yunnan Univ, Key Lab Atmospher Environm & Proc Boundary Low La, Coll Resource & Environm, 2,Cuihu North Rd, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hanyue; Duan, Lei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Control, 30,Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Huang, YM (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Resource Ecol, 19,XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",ymhuang@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371069],Thanks are given to anonymous reviewers for their excellent suggestions.

Even though the majority of ecosystems have more than 50% of the plant biomass belowground, most studies investigating the effects of invasive species on plant diversity focus on the aboveground vegetation. DNA-based methods allow the determination of belowground plant structures. Using these techniques, we examined potential effects of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on both the above- and belowground plant species richness and composition in mixed deciduous forests in Northwestern Switzerland. We established 24 plots in three forest areas invaded by I. glandulifera and in three adjacent forest areas, which were not yet invaded. In each plot, we determined plant species richness and abundance in the aboveground vegetation, and collected soil samples at depths of 0-10 cm and 11-20 cm to determine belowground plant species richness. We extracted DNA from fine roots in the soil samples and applied the FAFLP technique (fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism) for two different regions of the chloroplast DNA (trnl-trnF intergenic spacer and P6 loop). We established a reference library for all plant species occurring in the study areas to identify the species present in mixed-root samples. Our results showed that I. glandulifera caused shifts in both the above- and belowground plant species composition. Plant species richness was reduced by 30% aboveground in invaded plots, but not belowground in the same plots. Many geophytes and woody species were found belowground but not aboveground in invaded plots. Root biomass was reduced by 35-55% in invaded plots, most probably due to allelopathic compounds released by the invasive plant into the soil. Our field survey shows that above- and belowground plant communities respond differently to the invasion of an annual plant species, and that the invasive species can negatively affect forest ecosystem functions, by reducing root biomass and altering plant species richness and composition.","[Gaggini, Luca; Rusterholz, Hans-Peter; Baur, Bruno] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Gaggini, L (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",lucagaggini@bluewin.ch; hans-peter.rusterholz@unibas.ch; bruno.baur@unibas.ch,,,,,,73,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1433-8319,,,PERSPECT PLANT ECOL,Perspect.

The experiment was performed under controlled conditions and was based on a randomized factorial design with two factors. Coffee plants were inoculated with a consortium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (CAMF), two strains of P-solubilizing fungi (PSF) (Aspergillus niger [An] and Penicillium brevicompactum [Pb]), the possible combinations of the latter fungi, and an uninoculated control. After 8months, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of mycorrhizal and P-solubilizing fungal inoculations in increasing available soil phosphorous. The greatest concentration of available soil phosphorous was detected in the consortium of P-solubilizing fungi (CPSF) treatment at 3.8mg/kg. The total foliar phosphorous concentration of plants was higher in the CAMF, An+CAMF, CPSF+CAMF, Pb+CAMF, and CPSF treatments in comparison to the control treatment. The growth of coffee plants was also favored by the consortium treatments (P-solubilizing fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). The acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere significantly increased under the CPSF treatment and also increased in the roots of coffee plants under the An, An+CAMF, and CPSF+CAMF treatments. Given the importance of fungal groups for processes of phosphorous transformation and absorption in coffee plants, it is imperative to continue the search for native fungal strains with high potential for use as biofertilizers.","[Perea Rojas, Yamel del Carmen; Medel Ortiz, Rosario] Univ Veracruzana, Inst Invest Forestales, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Maria Arias, Rosa; Heredia, Gabriela] Inst Ecol AC, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Trejo Aguilar, Dora] Univ Veracruzana, Fac Ciencias Agr, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Rodriguez Yon, Yakelin] INCA, San Jose De Las Lajas 32700, Mayabeque, Cuba","Arias, RM (reprint author), Inst Ecol AC, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",rosy.arias@inecol.mx,"Heredia, Gabriela/I-9194-2014","Heredia, Gabriela/0000-0001-7047-412X","CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [C01-0194, 2011/169124]","This study was part of the CONACyT (C01-0194) project, ""Aplicacion de las interacciones fungicas en la restauracion y fertilizacion del suelo'' (2011/169124) carried out at the Instituto de Ecologia, A.

Warming increased soil exploration by increasing specific root length (SRL) and the relative proportion of 0.2-0.3 mm roots in fine root systems, while N addition and herbivory without warming both caused an increase in the relative proportions of thicker roots in the fine root systems. Warming decreased total phenolic concentrations in the roots without N addition, while some flavonoid compounds showed complex responses to warming, N addition, and herbivory. Nitrogen addition in combination with warming reduced the total emissions of other BVOCs from the rhizosphere area at the end of the experiment. Herbivory increased mycorrhizal colonisation rates and had a tendency to reduce total emissions of other BVOCs from the rhizosphere area four weeks after the weevil damage. Based on the above results, all of the factors studied have the potential to affect the fine root morphology and chemical defence in young Scots pine seedlings.","[Tiiva, Paivi; Haikio, Elina; Kasurinen, Anne] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Julkunen-Tiitto, Riitta] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Kasurinen, A (reprint author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",Anne.Kasurinen@uef.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [272939, 303785]","We thank Mr. Timo Oksanen for chamber exposure data and Mr. Juhani Tarhanen for help with GC-MS analysis of BVOCs.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash application on ECM fungal mycelial production, capacity to retain N, diversity and community composition. In-growth mesh bags were installed in control and treated plots. After 6 months, N-15 labeled ammonium and nitrate were applied into the mesh bags, and 24 h later extra-matrical mycelium (EMM) was extracted and analyzed. Wood ash had no effects on EMM in-growth, N retention capacity, diversity or community composition. In contrast, there were significant seasonal differences in the amount of EMM produced. These results demonstrate that applying up to 6 t ha(-1) of wood ash in this type of plantation forest is a safe management practice that does not increase N leaching or negatively affect ECM fungi.

A basic ecological question is whether interactions are specialized (one to one) or generalized (many to many). Specialization of interactions should ideally be assessed across several populations because species could be specialists at a particular site but generalists when several sites are considered. Mycorrhizal interactions are fundamental for orchid life and distribution, but their level of specialization is still under debate. To understand the extent to which epiphytic orchids are specialists in their mycorrhizal interactions, we studied the richness and phylogenetic structure of mycobionts across different sites, and the similarity in the mycobiont composition between coexisting orchid species. We sequenced the nrDNA ITS2 region and explored the mycobiont communities associated with two epiphytic orchids, Epidendrum marsupiale and Cyrtochilum pardinum, at two elevations within two sites in Ecuador. We found 108 OTUs belonging to Serendipitaceae (66), Ceratobasidiaceae (22), Atractiellales (11) and Tulasnellaceae (9). Orchids at the highest elevations hosted the highest OTU richness. The two orchid species shared a high percentage of mycobionts between all sites. No phylogenetic structure within orchid mycorrhizal communities was found at any sites or elevations. Our results indicate that the studied orchids are generalists and share a broad group of mycobionts (16 OTUs) with no apparent niche segregation within or between sites.

The effect of aspect on vegetation has been well studied, but virtually nothing is known about how fungal communities are shaped by aspect-driven environmental conditions. I carried out DNA metabarcoding of fungi from soil samples taken in a selected study area of Pannonian forests in northern Hungary to compare richness and community composition of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi between slopes of predominantly southerly vs. northerly aspect. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 980 766 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that both niche (environmental filtering) and neutral (stochastic) processes shape fungal community composition at landscape level. Fungal community composition correlated strongly with aspect, with many fungi showing preference for either south-facing or north-facing slopes. Several taxonomic and functional groups showed significant differences in richness between north- and south-facing slopes and strong compositional differences were observed in all functional groups. The effect of aspect on fungal communities likely is mediated through contrasting mesoclimatic conditions, that in turn influence edaphic processes as well as vegetation. The compositional differences observed in fungi are largely consistent with the coenologically described forest types, which indicates the usefulness of these habitat types as a framework to better understand environmental differences that influence fungal community composition at landscape level. Finally, the data presented here provide unprecedented insights into the diversity and landscape-level community dynamics of fungi in the Pannonian forests.

According to the model, a continuous ring of favourable conditions around the Baltic Sea, together with a well-established bridgehead in Poland and Baltic states, make the expansion in this region virtually unstoppable.

However, since they are restricted to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from 64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic, decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total beetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p <= 0.05) with beetle community composition and decomposers were marginally correlated (p <= 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and ecosystem processes like wood decomposition.

Sporocarp C/N and soil C/N decreased with fertilization, implying that N uptake per unit fungal growth increased. The S horizon was more responsive than the F and H horizons to changes in N addition, with N turnover for these horizons of 24, 57, and 57 y, respectively. Fungal and soil delta N-15 patterns identified fungal N sources, with N acquisition primarily from the S, F, or H horizon for two, five, and two taxa, respectively. With increasing N availability, sporocarp N-15 enrichment increased in five taxa, in agreement with our model of fungal-plant N partitioning. However, it decreased in Lactarius rufus and Russula aeruginea, perhaps indicating shifts towards greater inorganic N uptake in these two taxa. This may relate to the generally lower sensitivity of these taxa to N deposition compared to the Cortinarius and Suillus taxa that fit our model of N-15 partitioning.

We investigated whether fungal associations occur in the seeds and seedling roots of two epiphytic Aechmea species, and we explored whether substrate and fungal associations contribute to seed germination, and seedling survival and performance after the first month of growth. We found a total of 21 genera and 77 species of endophytic fungi in the seeds and seedlings for both Aechmea species by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The fungal associations in seeds were found in the majority of corresponding seedlings, suggesting that fungi are transmitted vertically. Substrate quality modulated the germination and growth of seedlings, and beneficial endophytic fungi were not particularly crucial for germination but contributed positively to survival and growth. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of an endophytic fungal community in both the seeds and seedlings of two epiphytic bromeliads species that subsequently benefit plant growth.

Here, we investigated the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) harboured by 31 plant species occurring on the trunks of Phoenix dactylifera. We wanted to ascertain if host identity and plant functional traits shape mycorrhizal communities. Specifically, we tested the plant life-cycle (perennial versus annual), the plant life-form (herbaceous versus woody), the plant origin (exotic versus native) and the plant species. The plant affiliation to species strongly influenced the AMF community composition. Plant life-form and plant life-cycle also shaped indicator taxa. The AMF structure differed between annual and perennial species and higher AMF richness was detected in perennial plants.

In this study, we explored biogeographic distribution and composition of soil fungal communities associated with 62 tussock grasslands across different regions of Australia. Climatic parameters had only a limited correlation with fungal community structure, while edaphic variables and spatial distance were significantly associated with changes in fungal community composition. We also observed high variations in composition among fungal assemblages from different ecological regions, suggesting some regional endemism in these communities. The discrete distribution of fungi in soil was further confirmed by indicator analysis, which identified distinct indicator operational taxonomic units associated with grasslands from different climatic regions. Finally, fungi with flexible trophic interactions had a central role in the network architecture of both arid and temperate communities. Taken together, the results from our study confirm the prominent role of soil physico-chemical status and geographic location in determining fungal biogeographic patterns over large scales in Australia.

We hypothesized that exotic and native plant species differ, on average, in their percentage mycorrhizal colonization, and that mycorrhizal colonization is positively related to plant performance in the field. We compared colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) fungi in perennial native and exotic species that were paired phylogenetically and by functional groups and grown under a common environment in field plots in Central Texas, USA. Roots were collected from plants in monoculture plots, stained, and percent colonization was assessed with a microscope. Aboveground biomass and dominance in mixture were used as measures of plant performance. Exotic species had significantly higher colonization of AM than native species, and this result was consistent across functional groups. Percent colonization was positively correlated with biomass and dominance in mixture across native species, but not across exotic species. Our results indicate that mycorrhizal dependence is a more important predictor of competitive balance among native than exotic plant species in the subhumid grasslands of the USA.","[Sielaff, Aleksandra Checinska; Fuentes-Ramirez, Andres; Hofmockel, Kirsten; Wilsey, Brian J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 251 Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Polley, H.

The invasive autogamous orchid, Spathoglottis plicata, acquires some biotic resistance in Puerto Rico from a native orchid weevil specialist, Stethobaris polita. The distribution of S. polita along an urbanization gradient may affect the distribution of S. plicata and its future spread. To determine the effect of land cover on both species and the impact of S. polita on the spread of S. plicata, we modeled the distribution of the interaction between the two species and additionally assessed weevil abundance and the damage they do in different land cover types and localities. Land cover was the most important predictor of distribution for both species. S. plicata occurs in forests, pastures, and urban areas; however, S. polita is largely absent from urban areas, including urban forests, and along rivers within wet forests. This distribution likely reflects the dispersal ability of S. plicata, in addition to potential human intervention, and the inability of S. polita to penetrate or become established within the urban matrix. Thus, within the invasive range of S. plicata in Puerto Rico, geographical heterogeneity in acquired interactions is expected to result in higher seed production within areas of enemy release. The orchid is likely to spread more rapidly in urban forests, as well as along forest rivers, where S. polita is sparse.","[Soifer, Lydia G.] Davidson Coll, Dept Biol, POB 7118, Davidson, NC 28035 USA; [Ackerman, James D.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, 17 Ave Univ Suite 1701, San Juan, PR 00925 USA","Soifer, LG (reprint author), Davidson Coll, Dept Biol, POB 7118, Davidson, NC 28035 USA.",lysoifer@davidson.edu,,,National Science Foundation-Research Experience for Undergraduates programNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1559679],"We thank Wilfredo Falcon for assistance with Maxent and data collection; Raymond Tremblay for assistance with the GLM; Kai Griebenow for localities of urban populations; and Christine Folks for assistance in the field.

For evaluating possibility of grassland species conservation in vegetation of river embankments, we aimed to clarify how does the previous maintenances (i.e. disturbance history) influence current species composition and diversity in grassland vegetation by changing soil properties. We conducted vegetation and soil surveys at 64 plots along the slope of embankments of the Tone River, Chiba and Ibaraki Prefectures, Japan, separated into 36 and 28 plots at disturbed and undisturbed embankments, respectively. We tested environmental factors (i.e., maintenance history, location of the river embankment, slope aspect, and interaction effects of the maintenance history and location) affecting species richness and soil properties of river embankments by using generalized linear models (GLMs) and linear models, respectively. We also evaluated species recovery through time by testing the significance of relationships between elapsed time (since last maintenance) and the richness values of all and grassland species. We found that disturbance history influenced current grassland species richness and soil properties (e.g. bioavailable soil P and percentage of fine sand) and grassland species have recovered gradually in the disturbed river embankments located on the outer periphery of the reservoir. For achieving synergy between flood mitigation and grassland conservation goals, grassland vegetation maintained on disturbed river embankments located on the outer periphery of the reservoir can be targets for restoration of grassland species.","[Koyanagi, Tomoyo F.] Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Field Studies Inst Environm Educ, 4-1-1 Nukuikitamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 1848501, Japan; [Yamada, Susumu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Sustainable Agroecosyst Serv, 1-1-1 Midoricho, Tokyo 1880002, Japan; [Matsuzaki, Hirotoshi] Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Fac Educ, 4-1-1 Nukuikitamachi, Tokyo 1848501, Japan; [Kato, Yuichi] Nat Conservat & Sci Commun, Bunkyo Ku, 6-16-12-404 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yamada, Susumu] Tokyo Univ Agr, Fac Agr, 1737 Funako, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan","Koyanagi, TF (reprint author), Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Field Studies Inst Environm Educ, 4-1-1 Nukuikitamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 1848501, Japan.",koya23jp@u-gakugei.ac.jp; sy206447@nodai.ac.jp; f127018n@st.u-gakugei.ac.jp; v_raddeana@yahoo.co.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26450492, 17H03958]","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 26450492 and 17H03958.

Evaluating the effects of soil respiration on N addition is of great significance for understanding soil carbon (C) budgets along N gradients in forest ecosystems. In this study, four levels of N (0, 50, 100, 150kgN ha(-1)a(-1)) were added to soil in a Picea baifouriana and an Abies georgei natural forest on the Tibetan Plateau to investigate the effect of the N inputs on soil respiration. N addition stimulated total soil respiration (Rt) and its components including heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra); however, the promoted effects declined with an increase in N application in two coniferous forests. Soil respiration rate was a little greater in the spruce forest (1.05mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)) than that in the fir forest (0.97mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)). A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that N fertilization had significant effects on Rt and its components in the spruce forest and Rt in the fir forest, but had no obvious effect on Rh or Ra in the fir forest. Rt and its components had significant exponential relationships with soil temperature in both forests. N addition also increased temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of Rt and its components in the two coniferous forests, but the promotion declined as N in put increased. Important, soil moisture had great effects on Rt and its components in the spruce forest (P<0.05), but no obvious impacts were observed in the fir forest (P>0.05). Following N fertilization, Ra was significantly and positively related to fine root biomass, while Rh was related to soil enzymatic activities in both forests. The mechanisms underlying the effect of simulated N deposition on soil respiration and its components in this study may help in forecasting C cycling in alpine forests under future levels of reactive N deposition.","[Wang, Jian] China West Normal Univ, Land & Resource Coll, Nanchong 637002, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Genxu; Chen, Xiaopeng; Song, Xiaoyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, 9,Block 4,Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yu] China West Normal Univ, Dept Polit & Adm, Nanchong 637002, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaopeng; Song, Xiaoyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Wang, G (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, 9,Block 4,Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",wanggx@imde.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Research Project for Frontier Science [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC006]; ""Strategic Priority Research Program'' of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA01020304]","This research was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Research Project for Frontier Science (QYZDJ-SSW-DQC006) and by the ""Strategic Priority Research Program'' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA01020304).",,54,0,0,36,36,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

In this study we explored how the decomposability of residues in soil interacts with seed or root exudate compounds to influence microbial respiration, mechanical behaviour and hydrological properties. Sandy loam and clay loam soils were amended at a rate of 40 t ha(-1) with ground green barley (7.13 mg C g(-1)), barley straw (7.26 mg C g(-1)) or poultry manure (5.22 mg C g(-1)), and either chia seed exudate at 1.84 mg C g(-1) soil or root exudate compounds at 14.4 mg C g(-1) soil. On cores packed to 1.3 g cm(-3), uniaxial compression, penetration resistance, water sorptivity, water retention and porosity were measured at time 0, after 14 days of incubation at 20 degrees C, and then after subjecting incubated soils to three cycles of wetting and drying to simulate weathering. These time increments and weathering were intended to simulate a newly germinated seed or tip of a root, through to a more mature system. Application of seed and root exudate increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from 0.31 +/- 0.01 to 15.11 +/- 0.71 mu g C-CO2 g soil(-1) h(-1) for the sandy loam soil and from 0.171 +/- 0.01 to 10.56 +/- 0.78 C-CO2 g soil(-1) h(-1) for the clay loam soil. There were large changes in soil physical properties caused by seed or root exudate amendment coupled with residues, their decomposition and weathering. After incubation and weathering, soils with added seed or root exudates and their interactions with organic residues were more mechanically stable, as measured by penetration resistance (22 to 58% increase) and compression index (25 to 43% decrease) compared to soils amended only with organic residue.

Neither are understood the effects of livestock grazing on the interactions among members of the microbial communities. Here, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing and co-occurrence network analyses to study changes in microbial community composition and networks in soil from plant-patches and inter-patches under sheep grazed and non-grazed conditions within an arid region of Patagonia. In addition, we analyzed soil and vegetation properties that could be influencing the observed microbial patterns. We detected over 2,000 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in soils from plant-patches and a similar number in inter-patches, which abundance shifted between the non-grazed and the grazed sites. Among them, members of the Actinomycetales, Solirubrobacterales, Pedosphaerales and Rhizobiales were present. We further found that connections among them in the network analysis were significantly affected by soil texture. Moreover, soil particle size explained between 24.7% and 31.9% of the variance in microbial community composition. Positive network connections increased from 57.8% in the non-grazed site to 88.6% in the grazed site. This may suggest either an increase in cooperative associations within the community, as a strategy to survive under the stressful conditions imposed by grazing, or a selection of microorganisms with similar niche requirements. We further concluded that members of the Actinomycetales and Rhizobiales seem to have a keystone role in the soil communities from this arid ecosystem.","[Marcos, Magali S.; Olivera, Nelda L.] CCT CONICET CENPAT, CONICET, IPEEC, Lab Microbiol & Biotecnol, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Bertiller, Monica B.] CCT CONICET CENPAT, CONICET, IPEEC, Lab Ecol Pastissales, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Bertiller, Monica B.] UNPSJB, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Marcos, MS (reprint author), CCT CONICET CENPAT, CONICET, IPEEC, Lab Microbiol & Biotecnol, Blvd Brown 2915,U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Argentina.",magali@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,,,"Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y TecnologicaANPCyT [PICT 2013-1505, 20151689]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [22920160100044]",This work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [grant numbers PICT 2013-1505 and 20151689] and the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas [PUE IPEEC No. 22920160100044].,,76,0,0,34,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Therefore, bulk soil samples under four land uses (farmland and three vegetated soils converted from farmland 42 years ago: Robinia pseudoacacia [RP42yr], Caragana korshinskii [CK42yr], and abandoned land [AL42yr]) in the Loess Plateau, China, was collected, separated into seven aggregate size fractions, and examined for OC content. Farmland conversion into AL42yr, CK42yr, and RP42yr increased macroaggregate (>2 mm) and mesoaggregate (2-0.25 mm) proportions, mean weight diameter, and geometric mean diameter but decreased microaggregates (0.25-0.053 mm) amount. Bulk soil and aggregates OC content and stock varied with soil depth and land use types but were usually highest in RP42yr. Mesoaggregates contained higher OC content and stock than other aggregates at 0- to 20-cm depth under all land uses. Increases in the OC stocks of mesoaggregates accounted for 46% and 85% of the increase in bulk soil OC stocks at 0- to 20- and 20- to 40-cm depth, respectively. Thus, soil OC accumulation after LUCC is mainly due to increased OC stock within mesoaggregates, which is further attributed to increased mesoaggregate proportions. Overall, vegetation restoration promotes the physical protection of OC by increasing soil aggregation, being a management option to enhance the C sequestration potential in ecological fragile regions.","[Zhong, Zekun; Han, Xinhui; Xu, Yadong; Zhang, Wei; Fu, Shuyue; Liu, Weichao; Ren, Chengjie; Yang, Gaihe; Ren, Guangxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Zekun; Han, Xinhui; Xu, Yadong; Zhang, Wei; Fu, Shuyue; Liu, Weichao; Ren, Chengjie; Yang, Gaihe; Ren, Guangxin] Res Ctr Recycle Agr Engn & Technol Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Ren, CJ; Yang, GH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",rencj1991@nwafu.edu.cn; ygh@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571501]; Key Project of the National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504601],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41571501; Key Project of the National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFC0504601",,61,1,1,28,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Differential drought impact on conspecific individuals within a population has been reported, but no clear mechanistic explanation for this pattern has emerged. Following a severe drought (summer 2012), we monitored over a 3-year period healthy (H) and declining (D) Pinus nigra trees co-occurring in a karstic woodland to highlight eventual individual-specific physiological differences underlying differential canopy dieback. We investigated differences in water and carbon metabolism, and xylem anatomy as a function of crown health status, as well as eventual genotypic basis of contrasting drought responses. H and D trees exploited the same water pools and relied on similar hydraulic strategies to cope with drought stress. Genetic analyses did not highlight differences between groups in terms of geographical provenance. Hydraulic and anatomical analyses showed conflicting results. The hydraulic tracheid diameter and theoretical hydraulic conductivity were similar, but D trees were characterized by lower water transport efficiency, greater vulnerability to xylem conduit implosion and reduced carbohydrate stores. Our results suggest that extreme drought events can have different impacts on conspecific individuals, with differential vulnerability to xylem embolism likely playing a major role in setting the fate of trees under climate change.","[Savi, Tadeja; Dal Borgo, Anna; Torboli, Valentina; Bertoncin, Paolo; Martellos, Stefano; Pallavicini, Alberto; Nardini, Andrea] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via L Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Savi, Tadeja] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Div Viticulture & Pomol, Dept Crop Sci, Konrad Lorenz Str 24, A-3430 Tulln, Austria; [Casolo, Valentino] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Agroalimentari Ambientali & Anim, Via Sci 91, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Rosner, Sabine] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Bot, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Stenni, Barbara] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dipartimento Sci Ambientali Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30170 Venice, Italy","Nardini, A (reprint author), Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via L Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",nardini@units.it,,,Fondazione Beneficentia Stiftung,The study was funded by the Fondazione Beneficentia Stiftung (Project title: Cambiamenti climatici e mortalita degli alberi: basi genotipiche della resistenza e resilienza a eventi estremi di aridita).,,72,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1434,,,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

Yasso07 is considered to be one of the most promising models for such a purpose. We examine the accuracy of its prediction of soil carbon dynamics over the whole French metropolitan territory at a decennial timescale. We used data from 101 sites in the RENECOFOR network, which encompasses most of the French temperate forests. These data include (i) the quantity of above-ground litterfall from 1994 to 2008, measured yearly, and (ii) the soil CSs measured twice at an interval of approximately 15 years (once in the early 1990s and around 2010). We used Yasso07 to simulate the annual changes in carbon stocks (ACCs; in tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) for each site and then compared the estimates with actual recorded data. We carried out meta-analyses to reveal the variability in litter biochemistry in different tree organs for conifers and broadleaves. We also performed sensitivity analyses to explore Yasso07's sensitivity to annual litter inputs and model initialization settings. At the national level, the simulated ACCs (+0.00 +/- 0.07 tC ha(-1) yr(-1), mean +/- SE) were of the same order of magnitude as the observed ones (+0.34 +/- 0.06 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, the correlation between predicted and measured ACCs remained weak (R-2 < 0.1). There was significant overestimation for broadleaved stands and underestimation for coniferous sites. Sensitivity analyses showed that the final estimated CS was strongly affected by settings in the model initialization, including litter and soil carbon quantity and quality and also by simulation length. Carbon quality set with the partial steady-state assumption gave a better fit than the model with the complete steady-state assumption. With Yasso07 as the support model, we showed that there is currently a bottleneck in soil carbon modeling and prediction due to a lack of knowledge or data on soil carbon quality and fine-root quantity in the litter.","[Mao, Zhun; Derrien, Delphine; Saint-Andre, Laurent] INRA, UR BEF Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Didion, Markus] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Liski, Jari] Finnish Environm Inst, Ecosyst Change Unit, Nat Environm Ctr, Mechelininkatu 34a,POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Eglin, Thomas] ADEME DPED Serv Agr & Forets, F-49004 Angers, France; [Nicolas, Manuel] Off Natl Forets, Direct Forets & Risques Nat, Dept Rech Dev Innovat, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Jonard, Mathieu] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2,L7-05-09, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Saint-Andre, Laurent] CIRAD, UMR ECO & Sols, Pl Viala, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Mao, Zhun] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, IRD, Amap,INRA,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Liski, Jari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, Helsinki 00101, Finland","Mao, Z (reprint author), INRA, UR BEF Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France.; Mao, Z (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, IRD, Amap,INRA,CNRS, Montpellier, France.",maozhun04@126.com,,"Didion, Markus/0000-0003-0346-0646; Jonard, Mathieu/0000-0002-9680-792X","French Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME) [14-60-C0082]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the ""Investissements d'Avenir"" program (Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE) - QLSPIMS project [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre","This study was funded by the French Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME; contract reference: 14-60-C0082).

However, the relative role of root traits and environmental factors in controlling sediment stability, and how intraspecific variability of root traits vary within and among marshes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated which root trait(s) drive sediment stability (resistance to lateral erosion) in two marsh species with an important role in coastal protection (Spartina anglica and Atriplex portulacoides) and how the environment affects the expression of these traits. We sampled three marshes along salinity gradients in each of two estuaries in Wales (UK), establishing replicate plots in the respective dominant zones of each species. In all plots we sampled abiotic variables (sand, redox potential, pH, salinity) and root traits (root density, specific root density, root volume, root length density); in a subset of these plots (three per species in each marsh) we extracted soil-plant cores and assessed their erosion resistance in a flume. Sediment stability was enhanced by increases in root density and reductions in sand content. Abiotic variables affected root density in different ways depending on species: in S. anglica, redox was the only significant factor, with a positive, linear effect on root density; in A. portulacoides, redox had a non-linear (U-shaped) effect on root density, while sand had a negative effect. Collectively, these results show that (i) intraspecific variability in root density can influence sediment stability in salt marshes, and (ii) sediment properties not only influence sediment stability directly, but also indirectly via root density. These results shed light on spatial variability in the stability of salt marshes to lateral erosion and suggest that root density should be incorporated into coastal vegetation monitoring programs as an easy-to-measure root trait that links the environment to sediment stability and hence to the function and services provided by marshes.","[De Battisti, Davide; Fowler, Mike S.; Neyland, Penelope J.; Griffin, John N.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Jenkins, Stuart R.; Skov, Martin W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Rossi, Marta] Univ Sussex, Dept Neurosci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Bouma, Tjeerd J.] Univ Utrecht, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Yerseke, Netherlands","De Battisti, D (reprint author), Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",d.de-battisti.844312@swansea.ac.uk,,,"Welsh Government; HEFCW through the 384 Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment RESILCOAST project; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N013573/1]","This work was provided by Welsh Government and HEFCW through the 384 Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment RESILCOAST project.

In this study, we combined an Aerodyne quantum cascade laser spectrometer for CO2 isotopes with a LI-COR LI-8100A/8150 automated chamber system to measure the delta C-13 of CO2 during automated closed-chamber measurements. The isotopic composition of the CO2 flux was determined for each chamber measurement by applying the Keeling plot method. We found that the delta C-13 measured by the laser spectrometer was influenced by water vapour and CO2 concentration of the sample air and we developed a method to correct for these effects to yield accurate measurements of delta C-13. Overall, correcting for the CO2 concentration increased the delta C-13 determined from the Keeling plots by 3.4 parts per thousand compared to 2.1 parts per thousand for the water vapour correction. We used the combined system to measure delta C-13 of the CO2 fluxes automatically every two hours from intact soil, trenched soil, tree stems and coarse roots during a two-month campaign in a Danish beech forest. The mean delta C-13 was -29.8 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand for the intact soil plots, which was similar to the mean delta C-13 of -29.8 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand for the trenched soil plots. The lowest delta C-13 was found for the root plots with a mean of -32.6 +/- 0.78 parts per thousand. The mean delta C-13 of the stems was -30.2 +/- 0.74 parts per thousand, similar to the mean delta C-13 of the soil plots. In conclusion, the study showed the potential of using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer to measure delta C-13 of CO2 during automated closed-chamber measurements, thereby allowing for measurements of isotopic ecosystem CO2 fluxes at a high temporal resolution. It also highlighted the importance of proper correction for cross-sensitivity with water vapour and CO2 concentration of the sample air to get accurate measurements of delta C-13.","[Braendholt, Andreas; Ibrom, Andreas; Larsen, Klaus Steenberg; Pilegaard, Kim] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Environm, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Braendholt, Andreas] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Ambus, Per; Larsen, Klaus Steenberg] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Braendholt, A (reprint author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Environm, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.; Braendholt, A (reprint author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",braendholt@email.arizona.edu; anib@env.dtu.dk; peam@ign.ku.dk; ksl@ign.ku.dk; kipi@env.dtu.dk,"Pilegaard, Kim/I-7137-2013; Ambus, Per/B-2514-2015","Pilegaard, Kim/0000-0002-5169-5717; Braendholt, Andreas/0000-0002-5900-8053; Ambus, Per/0000-0001-7580-524X","Danish Ministry for Research, Innovation and Higher Education; Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF-1323-00182]","This research was funded by the Danish Ministry for Research, Innovation and Higher Education, the Danish Council for Independent Research, grant number DFF-1323-00182.",,60,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,MAY,2019,10,5,,,,,,,432,10.3390/f10050432,,,19,Forestry,Forestry,IN6TS,WOS:000478814700071,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Wang, H; Shen, W; Guo, JJ; Wang, CS; Zhao, ZG",,,,"Wang, Huan; Shen, Wei; Guo, Junjie; Wang, Chunsheng; Zhao, Zhigang",,,Regulating Growth of Betula alnoides Buch.

This usually makes seedling preparation more difficult to match transplanting. Here applications of plant growth regulators, paclobutrazol (PBZ) and gibberellins (GA(3)) were studied with two trials to regulate growth of Betula alnoides Buch. Ham. ex D. Don container seedlings for the purpose of improving their quality when transplanting delayed. In the first trial five treatments (coded as P1 to P5) were laid out with total dosages of 0 mg (control), 2 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg PBZ per seedling to assess inhibitory effects of PBZ on growth of B. alnoides seedlings. After four and a half months, the second trial was carried out on the seedlings from the optimized PBZ treatments to detect growth recover of the seedlings by GA(3), in which four treatments were arranged with GA(3) dosages being 0, 1/10, 1/5 and 1/3 of the optimized paclobutrazol amounts applied. PBZ applications resulted in a significant decrease of height and root collar diameter growth since approximately one and two months after being treated, respectively. Among these treatments, P5 was the best one in controlling seedling growth, and its inhibitory effects lasted more than four and half months. PBZ treatments differed obviously in total seedling biomass from the control at 96 and 132 days after treatment (dat), and allocated more ratio of biomass into roots. Their root/shoot ratios increased and leaf areas decreased considerably with increasing PBZ dosage, while only P5-treated seedlings showed remarkable difference from the control in chlorophyll contents. The GA(3) recovery showed that 15-day height increments of seedlings treated with GA(3) were twice more than that without GA(3) treatment, and did not differ significantly from the control without PBZ and GA(3) treatment. It is concluded that the combined application of PBZ and GA(3) can be recommended as a potential tool for regulating growth of B. alnoides seedlings, making it flexible to growing seedlings in the nursery.","[Wang, Huan; Guo, Junjie; Wang, Chunsheng; Zhao, Zhigang] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Wei] Zhaoqing Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software, Zhaoqing 526061, Peoples R China","Shen, W (reprint author), Zhaoqing Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software, Zhaoqing 526061, Peoples R China.",whuan1819@163.com; shenwei@zqu.edu.cn; guojunjiech@126.com; wang7760612@163.com; zhaozhigang1979@126.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600604],This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0600604).,,29,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,MAY,2019,10,5,,,,,,,378,10.3390/f10050378,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,IN6TS,WOS:000478814700017,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Wang, JP; Wang, GG; Zhang, B; Yuan, ZM; Fu, ZY; Yuan, YD; Zhu, LJ; Ma, SL; Zhang, JC",,,,"Wang, Jinping; Wang, G.

Most previous studies about AMF have been conducted in natural forests, and little attention has been paid to trees in planted forests. This study investigated AMF associated with tree species and the relationships between edaphic factors and AMF communities in a planted forest of eastern China. We found high total AMF colonization rates in the roots of Carya illinoensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch, Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makinoz, Taxodium zhongshansha', Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., and Elaeagnus pungens Thunb., ranging from 62.07% to 100%, indicating that AMF can establish effective symbiotic relationships with these tree species. The AMF colonization rate was significantly and negatively correlated with soil phosphorus, while AMF colonization intensity was significantly and negatively correlated with soil moisture content, total carbon, and organic matter content. Spore density was in the range of 4.38 to 76.38 spores per g soil. In total, 35 AMF species from 10 genera were identified. Glomus and Acaulospora were the dominant genera. Acaulospora foveata and Septoglomus constrictum were the dominant species. AMF communities differed among the tree species and were closely related to edaphic factors, and AMF diversity was significantly related to soil carbon and pH. Our results revealed the colonization, community, and diversity of AMF associated with tree species, as well as their relationships with edaphic factors, in planted forests. Our findings can be used to provide insight on the utilization and management of AMF to maintain sustainable management of planted forests.","[Wang, Jinping; Yuan, Zhongming; Fu, Zhiyuan; Yuan, Yingdan; Zhu, Lingjun; Ma, Shilin; Zhang, Jinchi] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, 159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinping; Wang, G.

Image analysis software such as WinRhizo and IJ_Rhizo facilitate root trait analyses. Delory etal. () presented a comparison between the accuracy of WinRhizo and IJ_Rhizo for measuring root length. We complement their analyses with a comparison of diameter and volume estimates and a comparison of different image resolutions with manual and automatic threshold. We analysed 100 images of fibrous and taproot systems, which were obtained using the root model ArchiSimple. As a result, for each image, diameter, length and volume were known. The images were analysed with WinRhizo and IJ_Rhizo and we compared the estimates of diameter, length and volume to ground-truth values. We further computed relative errors and their magnitude and analysed their dependency on image characteristics and root system properties. At 1,200 and 800 dpi, diameter and length estimates pro vided by WinRhizo and IJ_Rhizo were of comparable accuracy. Diameter errors were balanced. Volume estimates were subjected to a systematic error caused by the assumption of constant diameter. WinRhizo, however, provides the opportunity to calculate correctly computed volumes from diameter classes. At 1,200 dpi, IJ_Rhizo failed to automatically find an appropriate threshold for pixel classification, which fundamentally decreased accuracy. The magnitude of diameter errors increased with root overlap for IJ_Rhizo. The length errors increased with increasing root length, overlap and root length density for WinRhizo. The magnitude of underestimation of the volume (WinRhizo) decreased with volume. It was higher for taproot than for fibrous root systems. All errors increased with lower resolution. Our results confirm the results of Delory etal. () regarding the accuracy for length. They further confirm that estimates derived from different software packages or at different resolution should not be compared directly. The characteristics of root systems should be standardized for image analysis. The dependency of errors on the response variable of interest can influence the effect size and increase the probability of errors. Validation of methods should be conducted for each analysed dataset. New image analysis tools should be validated against a real ground-truth. Foreign Language Abstract Abstrakt Funktionelle Wurzelmerkmale finden verstarkte Beachtung als Aquivalente zu oberirdischen Merkmalen. Bildanalysesoftware, wie WinRhizo und IJ_Rhizo, vereinfachen die Analyse. Delory etal. () vergleichen die Genauigkeit dieser beiden Programme bezuglich der Messung von Wurzellangen. Wir erganzen diese Analyse mit einem Vergleich der Prazision der Durchmesser- und Volumenmessungen bei unterschiedlichen Bildauflosungen sowohl mit manuellem als auch automatisch gesetztem Schwellenwert zur Unterscheidung von Wurzel und Hintergrund. Wir haben 100 Bilddateien mit WinRhizo und IJ_Rhizo analysiert, welche mit dem Wurzelmodel ArchiSimple erstellt wurden. Fur jedes Bild waren Durchmesser, Lange und Volumen des Wurzelsystems bekannt und konnten mit den Messwerten der Programme verglichen werden. In einem zweiten Schritt haben wir die Abhangigkeit der relativen Fehler aller Parameter von Bildeigenschaften und Wurzelsystemeigenschaften uberpruft. Bei einer Bildauflosung von 1,200 und 800 dpi war die Genauigkeit der beiden Programme vergleichbar. Die Fehler der Durchmessermessungen waren balanciert. Die Volumenmessungen waren durch einen systematischen Fehler beeinflusst, der durch die Annahme von konstanten Durchmessern verursacht wird. In Falle von WinRhizo kann dieser Fehler vermieden werden. Bei einer Auflosung von 1,200 dpi war IJ_Rhizo nicht in der Lage automatisch einen angemessenen Schwellenwert zu finden, was zu erheblichen Fehlern fuhrte. Bei der Analyse mit IJ_Rhizo nahmen die Fehler der Durchmesser mit zunehmender uberlappung der Wurzeln zu. Im Falle von WinRhizo, stiegen die Fehler der Wurzellange mit der Gesamtwurzellange, der uberlappung und der Wurzellangendichte in den Bildern an, wahrend die relativen Fehler der Volumina mit steigendem Gesamtvolumen abnahmen. Alle Fehler nahmen bei verringerter Bildauflosung zu. Unsere Ergebnisse bestatigen die Ergebnisse von Delory etal. () bezuglich der Genauigkeit der Wurzellangenmessungen. Sie bestarken au ss erdem die Schlussfolgerung, dass Messungen, die mit verschiedenen Programmen oder bei verschiedenen Auflosungen gemacht wurden, nicht direkt vergleichbar sind. Die Eigenschaften von Bildern sollten moglichst weitgehend standardisiert werden. Die Abhangigkeit der Fehler von der Antwortvariable kann sowohl die Effektgro ss e als auch die Fehlerwahrscheinlichkeit beeinflussen. Dementsprechend sollte jede Validierung der Methoden datensatzspezifisch erfolgen. Neue Analysemethoden sollten anhand direkter Referenzwerte, nicht nur anderer Programme, getestet werden.","[Rose, Laura] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Rose, Laura] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Lobet, Guillaume] Forschungszentrum Julich, IBG3, Agrosphere, Julich, Germany","Rose, L (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany.; Rose, L (reprint author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany.",laura.rose.ecology@gmail.com,,"Rose, Laura/0000-0003-4523-4145",,,,21,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

While this pattern has been observed for many different organisms, it is unclear whether the distributions of ecologically important belowground mutualists, such as orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF), also vary according to latitude. Location: Europe. Taxon: Spiranthes spiralis (L. Chevall) Orchidaceae. Methods: We sampled 37 populations over a >3,000 km latitudinal gradient of the European orchid Spiranthes spiralis to test whether the diversity and community composition of OMF are influenced by latitude. For this, we sequenced the broad spectrum ITS3/4OF region to identify OMF and quantified environmental variables that may influence their occurrence. To assess whether seed germination was affected by suitable OMF in different regions, we performed a reciprocal translocation germination experiment at the northern, central and southern part of its range. Results: In total, 75 OMF taxa were associated with S. spiralis, the majority belonging to the Ceratobasidiaceae and Thelephoraceae. Both taxonomic and phylogenetic OMF diversity decreased with increasing latitude. Three Ceratobasidiaceae taxa were widespread, but the number of sequences of two of these taxa decreased with increasing latitude. Reciprocal translocation germination experiments revealed that S. spiralis seeds germinated in each region regardless of seed provenance, but germination rates were highest in the southern part of its range where mycorrhizal diversity was highest. Main conclusions: OMF diversity decreased with increasing latitude, indicating that communities of OMF may be shaped by latitudinal gradients. These results highlight the need to understand the factors that determine the distribution of belowground mutualists, which are essential to predict how plant distributions will shift under -future environmental change.","[Duffy, Karl J.; Waud, Michael; Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Leuven, Belgium; [Duffy, Karl J.] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Naples, Italy; [Waud, Michael] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Schatz, Bertrand] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, CEFE, UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Petanidou, Theodora] Univ Aegean, Dept Geog, Lab Biogeog & Ecol, Mitilini, Greece","Duffy, KJ (reprint author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Naples, Italy.",karljoseph.duffy@unina.it,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019; Petanidou, Theodora/C-9399-2011","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Petanidou, Theodora/0000-0003-1883-0945",Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship from the European Commission [655889],"We thank Salvatore Cozzolino, Giovanni Scopece, Aphrodite Kantsa and Thomas Tscheulin for invaluable help with locating populations and fieldwork.

So far, it has been unknown to which degree root exudate composition is species-specific and is affected by land use, the local impact and local neighborhood under field conditions. In this study, root exudates of 10 common grassland species were analyzed, each five of forbs and grasses, in the German Biodiversity Exploratories using a combined phytometer and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Redundancy analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed a large set of semi-polar metabolites common to all species in addition to species-specific metabolites. Chemical richness and exudate composition revealed that forbs, such as Plantago lanceolata and Galium species, exuded more species-specific metabolites than grasses. Grasses instead were primarily affected by environmental conditions. In both forbs and grasses, plant functional traits had only a minor impact on plant root exudation patterns. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining and untargeted profiling of semi-polar metabolites under field condition and allow a deeper view in the exudation of plants in a natural grassland community.","[Dietz, Sophie; Doell, Stefanie; Scheel, Dierk] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Dept Stress & Dev Biol, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Herz, Katharina; Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Bruelheide, Helge; Scheel, Dierk] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany","Dietz, S (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Dept Stress & Dev Biol, Halle, Saale, Germany.",sophie.nahrstedt@ipb-halle.de,"Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Scheel, Dierk/0000-0002-2105-6711; Jandt, Ute/0000-0002-3177-3669; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Doll, Stefanie/0000-0002-0001-8302","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHE 235/16-3, BR 1698/11-3]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: SCHE 235/16-3, BR 1698/11-3",,62,1,1,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We quantified seed dispersal by animals for 1 year and characterized the AMF of 26 common plant species. Sixteen plant species were dispersed by 15 animals and colonized by 48 AMF virtual taxa (VT), while the remaining 10 plant species were not dispersed by animals and associated with 34 AMF VT. We found no evidence for a correlation between the number of plant partners above-and belowground or on plant specialization on both types of partners. We also found no evidence for differentiation of AMF communities between biotically and abiotically dispersed plants.

With anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions, CO2 availability is and has been increasing since the last glacial maximum. Simultaneously water availability is expected to decrease and the frequency and severity of drought episodes to increase in large parts of the world. How plants respond to these two changes will help in understanding plants' responses to climate of the future. Here we sought to understand how drought affects plant traits responses to CO2 and whether there are trade-offs in responsiveness to low and elevated CO2 and drought. We grew seedlings of seven C-3 annuals at past low (160 mu l l(-1)), ambient (450 mu l l(-1)) and elevated (750 mu l l(-1)) CO2. At each concentration plants were subjected to well-watered conditions (100% soil water availability, SWA), 40% SWA or 20% SWA. We measured biomass allocation, relative growth rate, tissue N concentration, and gas exchange. Compared to well-watered conditions plant size was an important element in the absolute response to SWA decrease, i.e. the smaller, slow growing species were unaffected by drought at low CO2. Plants allocated less mass to root tissue at low CO2 contrasting with increased root mass fraction at lower SWA at ambient CO2. Across all traits measured, we found mostly additive effects of CO2 and water. As due to climate change regions become more drought prone these results suggest CO2 fertilization will not counteract the effects of reduced water availability.","[Temme, Andries A.; Liu, Jin Chun; Cornwell, Will K.; Aerts, Rien; Cornelissen, Johannes H.

However, the distinct effect of each pathway on ecosystem function is difficult to determine as they are complementary and shaped by environmental heterogeneity. We examined the distinct effects of functional diversity (FD) and identity (FI) on water consumption and use efficiency (WUE), vegetative and reproductive biomass production and reorganization capacity under variable water availability. Methods Eight semiarid annual plant species, varying in natural size range, were grown in different assemblages representing various levels of FD and FI. Assemblages were based on species potential growth rate (PGR) and grown under two water availability levels. We measured total biomass, seed biomass, root to shoot ratio and water consumption. Results FD had a distinct positive effect on water consumption, total biomass and seed production but not on WUE. Mean PGR (FI) had a distinct positive effect on water consumption and total biomass production, but a negative effect on WUE and seed production. FD and FI had no clear effects on reorganization capacity or stability in total biomass production in response to decreased water availability. Conclusions We present the discrete contributions of FD and FI to ecosystem function. The positive effect of FD on biomass production reflects better exploitation of the growing space and reduced competition through greater size diversity, emphasizing the importance of interplant interactions and differentiation for enhancing ecosystem function. The positive effect of FI on biomass production reflects the higher performance of high PGR species, albeit at the expense of WUE and seed production resulting from higher competition.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Dovrat, Guy] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Volcani Ctr, Bet Dagan, Israel","Dovrat, G (reprint author), Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [861/09],"Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 861/09",,40,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

These alternate end-points of succession provide an opportunity to test assumptions concerning alternate successional trajectories dominated by distinct plant functional groups. Disturbance effects on functional diversity (FD) have been studied largely in single post-disturbance communities, but rarely applied to alternate successional pathways. Do post-fire Kalmia heaths have lower FD than forest communities, and does heath formation select for a narrow range of traits leading to biotic homogenization? Location Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada. Methods Based on five functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, seed mass, height, specific root length), we measured functional trait dispersion within (alpha FD) and between sites (beta FD). We calculated overall FD metrics in nine heath and four forest sites as well as metrics for three functional groups (trees, shrubs, and herbs) in each site. We also performed a complementary taxonomic diversity (TD) analysis to establish links between FD and TD. Results We could not detect a difference in overall alpha TD between the two successional communities but found significant loss of alpha and beta FD in heaths and within tree and herb groups. Overall beta FD was lower in heaths than forests. It was also lower for trees and herbs, indicating an increase in functional similarity (functional homogenization) of the majority of life forms. Conclusions Between the two successional pathways, trait space occupancy was lower in heaths than forests. Heath formation in post-fire communities consistently restricts functional dispersion (low alpha FD) of tree and herb traits leading to functional homogenization (low beta FD). When a successional trajectory leads to heath formation, it is accompanied by a loss of functional diversity.","[St Martin, Philippe; Mallik, Azim U.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada","Mallik, AU (reprint author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.",amallik@lakeheadu.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-06239],"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: RGPIN-2014-06239",,50,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Location Atlantic coastal habitats in Huelva (Spain). Methods We identified species diversity and composition in 220 paired (invaded and non-invaded) plots along the coast (440 plots in total). We measured nine functional traits for every native and invader species, namely, specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL), leaf and root dry mass content (LDMC and RDMC) and carbon isotope fraction (delta C-13). We calculated, at the plot scale, community means (CMs) for each trait, functional richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity and functional and phylogenetic mean pairwise dissimilarities. Results Three out the four species showed rather extreme trait values compared to the native flora with greater impact on invaded communities. In plots invaded by A. calendula the values of the native communities of SLA and SRL increased, while LDMC, RDMC and delta C-13 decreased showing CMs more similar to its functional profile. Besides, these plots showed lower functional and phylogenetic diversity in the native component of the community. In plots invaded by Carpobrotus spp. and O. dillenii the CMs values for LDMC and delta C-13 increased, but have little effect on the functional and phylogenetic structure of the native communities, while no differences were observed for the communities invaded by C. bonariensis (the most functionally similar to the native species). Conclusions Our study highlights that inferring community assembly rules from the exploration of functional and phylogenetic differences between invaded and non-invaded plots is not straightforward. By considering invaders with different functional profiles, we have shown that species with different mechanisms of invasion have contrasting impacts on the community. Consequently, the effect of plant invaders differs depending on their functional distinction from the recipient community, rather than their phylogenetic origin.","[de la Riva, Enrique G.; Vila, Montserrat] CSIC, EBD, Seville, Spain; [de la Riva, Enrique G.] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Ecol, Cottbus, Germany; [Godoy, Oscar] Univ Cadiz, Dept Biol, Inst Univ Invest Marina INMAR, Puerto Real, Spain; [Castro-Diez, Pilar] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Gutierrez-Canovas, Cayetano] Univ Barcelona, Freshwater Ecol Hydrol & Management Grp FEHM Lab, Dept Biol Evolut Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio,Fac Biol, Barcelona, Spain","de la Riva, EG (reprint author), Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Dept Ecol, Cottbus, Germany.",enga70@gmail.com,"Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011; de la Riva, Enrique Garcia/R-5805-2016; Gutierrez Canovas, Cayetano/P-1227-2017","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; de la Riva, Enrique Garcia/0000-0002-3393-8375; Gutierrez Canovas, Cayetano/0000-0002-6785-4049","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) [CGL2015-65346-R, FJCI-2015-25785]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO), Grant/Award Number: CGL2015-65346-R and FJCI-2015-25785",,71,0,0,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

We used a mesocosm system with buried heating cables (5 degrees C warming) to investigate the responses of R-s, R-h and R-a to warming in a subtropical forest in southern China. Soil CO2 effluxes were measured with a portable automatic soil CO2 flux system from March 2014 to July 2015. We found that warming increased mean R-s and R-h from 788 to 1036 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+31%) and from 512 to 707 g C m(-2) year(-1) (+38%), respectively. There was no difference in R-a between the warming treatment and the control. The lack of response of R-a to warming was probably because the fine root biomass did not change with warming treatment. Soil warming also increased available dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, actinomycetal biomass and arbuscular mycorrhizal biomass. Our results suggest that R-h might be more sensitive to climate warming than R-a, and future climate warming could increase soil C loss from increased R-h in subtropical forest ecosystems. Highlights A field warming experiment with partitioning of soil respiration in a humid subtropical forest. Warming increased R-s and R-h without significantly altering soil microbial substrate availability. Heterotrophic respiration appeared more sensitive to warming than autotrophic respiration. Warming increased Actinomycetes bacteria and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","[Liu, Xiaofei; Chen, Shidong; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Xiong, Decheng; Lin, Weisheng; Xu, Chao; Chen, Guangshui; Xie, Jinsheng; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaofei; Chen, Shidong; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Xiong, Decheng; Lin, Weisheng; Xu, Chao; Chen, Guangshui; Xie, Jinsheng; Li, Yiqing; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Yiqing] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Li, YQ; Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Cangshan Campus,8 Shangsan Rd, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.",yiqing@hawaii.edu; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,,,"Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research [2014CB954003]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31870601, 31500407]","This research was supported jointly by the Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research (2014CB954003) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No 31870601, 31500407).

In terms of skull shape, H. naledi has its closest affinities with Homo erectus, while mandibular shape places it closer to early Homo. From a tooth crown perspective, the smaller molars of H. naledi make it distinct from early Homo and H. erectus. Here, we compare the mandibular molar root morphology of six H. naledi individuals from the Dinaledi Chamber to those of African and Eurasian Plio-Pleistocene fossil hominins (totalling 183 mandibular first, second and third molars). The analysis of five root metric variables (cervical plane area, root length, root cervix volume, root branch volume, and root surface area) derived from microCT reconstructions reveals that the molar roots of H. naledi are smaller than those of Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and H. erectus, but that they resemble those of three Homo sp. specimens from Swartkrans and Koobi Fora in size and overall appearance. Moreover, though H. naledi molar roots are similar in absolute size to Pleistocene Homo sapiens, they differ from H. sapiens in having a larger root volume for a given cervical plane area and less taurodont roots; the root cervix-to-branch proportions of H. naledi are comparable to those of Australopithecus africanus and species of Paranthropus. H. naledi also shares a metameric root volume pattern (M-2 > M-3 > M-1) with Australopithecus and Paranthropus but not with any of the other Homo species (M-2 > M-1 > M-3). Our findings therefore concur with previous studies that found that H. naledi shares plesiomorphic features with early Homo, Australopithecus, and Paranthropus. While absolute molar root size aligns H. naledi with Homo from North and South Africa, it is distinguishable from these in terms of root volumetric proportions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unclear how nitrogen (N) deposition changes the decomposition process by affecting initial substrate chemical characteristics with different fine root diameter sizes.MethodsWe compared the root decomposition processes across three diameter sizes (very fine roots, < 0.5mm; intermediate fine roots, 0.5-1.0mm; largest fine roots, 1.0-2.0mm) of Pinus tabulaeformis treated with N addition (control, low, medium, high N are 0, 3, 6, and 9gNm(-2) y(-1) respectively) for two years.Results(1) The root decomposition rates, which were mainly determined by initial N, phosphorus (P), cellulose and lignin concentrations, and carbon (C)/N and lignin/N ratios, increased with the root diameters. (2) The effect of N addition on fine root decomposition rate was not significant (P>0.05), but low N addition enhanced the correlation coefficients between initial chemical indexes and decomposition rates. (3) Low N addition increased the release rates of C and cellulose in the very fine roots but not intermediate fine and largest fine roots, while the medium and high N addition decreased the release rates of N, P, cellulose and lignin in the very fine and intermediate fine roots by affecting the initial C, N, P, starch, cellulose and lignin concentrations. (4) Release of compounds from large diameter fine roots is less responsive to N addition than that from the small ones.ConclusionsThe initial substrate chemistry plays an important role during the N addition affecting fine root decomposition and release of chemical compounds. Our results suggest that N deposition may change the biogeochemical processes of forest ecosystems by affecting the release of compounds from fine roots.","[Jing, Hang; Zhang, Peng; Li, Jingjing; Yao, Xu; Liu, Guobin; Wang, Guoliang] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guobin; Wang, Guoliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guobin; Wang, Guoliang] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wang, GL (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",h8170166069@163.com; glwang@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41671513, 41371508]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504601]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41671513, 41371508), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0504601).",,65,0,0,17,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2019,438,2-Jan,,,,,281,296,,10.1007/s11104-019-04017-w,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HZ0OO,WOS:000468540800018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Alvarez-Lopeztello, J; del Castillo, RF; Robles, C; Hernandez-Cuevas, LV",,,,"Alvarez-Lopeztello, Jonas; del Castillo, Rafael F.; Robles, Celerino; Hernandez-Cuevas, Laura V.",,,Spore diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in human-modified neotropical ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,community structure; management practices; Pinus caribaea; savanna; tropical rainforest,COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; TROPICAL FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; SOIL; SAVANNA; ROOTS; ABUNDANCE; NITROGEN; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY,"Neotropical landscapes are diverse mosaics of ecosystems commonly resulting from different degrees of human intervention. Although easily recognized by their vegetation, the associated soil microbiota including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is little known. In Mexico, native tropical rainforest and native savannas are rapidly vanishing, remaining in few spots surrounded by human-made ecosystems. It is unknown, however, how such vegetation types differ in their AMF communities. We compared the spore diversity, spore density and root colonization by AMF in contiguous mosaics of tropical rainforest, savanna and two pine plantations, one managed and the other unmanaged. We detected indicator species associated with tropical rainforest. The savanna displayed the highest values of root colonization of AMF and the lowest spore density. Conversely, the highest spore density and the lowest root colonization rates were found in the tropical rainforest. The two pine plantations showed intermediate values of spore density and colonization between tropical rainforest and the savanna. We did not detect significant seasonal differences (between dry and rainy seasons) in AMF species richness, spore density and root colonization within the vegetation types (except for root colonization in the savanna). Soil cation exchange capacity, phosphorus and nitrogen were negatively associated with AMF spore density and species richness. Our findings suggest that contiguous vegetation types in neotropical landscapes may display significant differences in AMF species composition, spore density and root colonization, and that such differences can be explained in part by soil properties and levels of human intervention.","[Alvarez-Lopeztello, Jonas; del Castillo, Rafael F.; Robles, Celerino] Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIDIR Oaxaca, Hornos 1003, Xoxocotlan 71230, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Hernandez-Cuevas, Laura V.] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CIGyA, Texmelucan Ixtacuixtla, Mexico","del Castillo, RF (reprint author), Inst Politecn Nacl, CIIDIR Oaxaca, Hornos 1003, Xoxocotlan 71230, Oaxaca, Mexico.",fsanchez@ipn.mx,,,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [266682]; Instituto Politecnico Nacional [SIP-20161449],"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: 266682; Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Grant/Award Number: SIP-20161449",,67,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

To resolve this apparent contradiction, we need further insights into the relative importance of dispersal limitation, host genotype and the biotic environment on the colonization process. We focused on the important root symbionts, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We studied AM fungal colonization ability in a controlled mesocosm setting, where we placed Plantago lanceolata plants belonging to four different genotypes in sterile soil at 10, 30 and 70 cm from a central AM fungal inoculated P. lanceolata plant. In part of the mesocosms, we also inoculated the source plants with nematodes. AM fungi colonized receiver plants < 1 m away over the course of ten weeks, with a strong effect of distance from source plant on AM fungal colonization. Plant genotype influenced AM fungal colonization during the early stages of colonization, while nematode inoculation had no effect on AM fungal colonization. Overall, the effect of both dispersal limitation and plant genetic variation may underlie the small-scale heterogeneity found in natural AM fungal communities.","[Rasmussen, Pil U.; Tack, Ayco J.

We quantified the contribution of intra-specific genetic variability in cassava (Manihot esculenta) and Rhizophagus irregularis to gene reprogramming in symbioses using dual RNA-sequencing. A large number of cassava genes exhibited altered transcriptional responses to the fungus but transcription of most of these plant genes (72%) responded in a different direction or magnitude depending on the plant genotype. Two AMF isolates displayed large differences in their transcription, but the direction and magnitude of the transcriptional responses for a large number of these genes was also strongly influenced by the genotype of the plant host. This indicates that unlike the highly conserved plant genes necessary for the symbiosis establishment, most of the plant and fungal gene transcriptional responses are not conserved and are greatly influenced by plant and fungal genetic differences, even at the within-species level. The transcriptional variability detected allowed us to identify an extensive gene network showing the interplay in plant-fungal reprogramming in the symbiosis. Key genes illustrated that the two organisms jointly program their cytoskeleton organization during growth of the fungus inside roots. Our study reveals that plant and fungal genetic variation has a strong role in shaping the genetic reprograming in response to symbiosis, indicating considerable genotype x genotype interactions in the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Such variation needs to be considered in order to understand the molecular mechanisms between AMF and their plant hosts in natural communities.","[Mateus, Ivan D.; Masclaux, Frederic G.; Aletti, Consolee; Rojas, Edward C.; Savary, Romain; Dupuis, Cindy; Sanders, Ian R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Masclaux, Frederic G.] SIB Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Vital IT, Lausanne, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ian.sanders@unil.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_162549]; NCBI SRA database (BioProject) [PRJNA400637],"We thank Jeremy Bonvin for help culturing R. irregularis and cassava in vitro plants, Tania Wyss for help in fungal culturing and plant harvesting and Nicolas Ruch for help in the greenhouse.

However, the relative influence and identity of relationships to abiotic and biotic factors may differ across environmental and ecological contexts, and fungal functional groups. Thus, understanding which aspects of rootassociated fungal community ecology generalise across contexts is the first step towards a more predictive framework. We investigated how the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors scale across environmental and ecological contexts using high-throughput sequencing (ca. 55 M Illumina metabarcoding sequences) of >260 plant-root-associated fungal communities from six UK salt marshes across two geographic regions (South-East and North-West England) in winter and summer. Levels of root-associated fungal diversity were comparable with forests and temperate grasslands, quadrupling previous estimates of salt-marsh fungal diversity. Whilst abiotic variables were generally most important, a range of site- and spatial scale-specific abiotic and biotic drivers of diversity and community composition were observed. Consequently, predictive models of diversity trained on one site, extrapolated poorly to others. Fungal taxa from the same functional groups responded similarly to the specific drivers of diversity and composition. Thus site, spatial scale and functional group are key factors that, if accounted for, may lead to a more predictive understanding of fungal community ecology.","[Alzarhani, A.

However, information on GRSP and its contribution to the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the process of urbanization is limited. Materials and methods In this study, easily extracted GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total GRSP (T-GRSP) were analyzed in an urban-rural gradient, and a detailed survey of greenspace characteristics (soil properties: pH, electric conductivity [EC], bulk density, temperature, and SOC; forest characteristics: tree density, tree size, tree species, and arbor and shrub richness; land use: road, building, greenspace, and wetland and water) in 306 plots was undertaken. Results and discussion EE-GRSP/SOC and T-GRSP/SOC decreased significantly by 10% in urban plots when compared with the rural plots. From the rural to urban plots, decrease in pH and increases in SOC, EC, tree height, and under branch height (p<0.01) were found in this study. These changes in greenspace characteristics were responsible for variation in GRSP, while their relative explanatory power differed (soil properties: 43.8%, forest characteristics: 25.7%, and land use: 18.6%). Forward selection analysis identified that EC, greenspace proportion, pH, shrub richness, diameter at breast height, wetland and water proportion, bulk density, and under branch height had significant explanatory power for the variation in GRSP (all: p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings indicate that urbanization greatly affects the contribution of GRSP to the SOC pool. The changes in greenspace characteristics played key roles in regulating the pattern of GRSP, especially soil properties. The results of this study may be used as a reference for the exploration of GRSP in urban environments and implementation of soil improvement practices by regulating GRSP.","[Wang, Qiong; Wang, Wenjie; He, Xingyuan; Zhai, Chang; Wang, Peijiang; Tang, Ze; Wei, Chenhui; Xiao, Lu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiong; He, Xingyuan; Zhai, Chang; Wang, Peijiang; Tang, Ze; Wei, Chenhui; Xiao, Lu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenjie; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Hongyuan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Wang, WJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Wang, WJ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",wjwang225@hotmail.com,,,"National Science and Technology Ministry [2016YFA0602304-2]; China's National Foundation of Natural Sciences [31670699, 41730641]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017DG04]","This study was supported financially by the National Science and Technology Ministry (2016YFA0602304-2), China's National Foundation of Natural Sciences (31670699 and 41730641), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017DG04).",,62,2,2,28,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

The protein is characterized by abundant production and hydrophobic properties. Although glomalin has been identified in Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 as a putative homolog of heat shock protein 60, the use of expressed fungal genes encoding glomalin as a marker for functional AMF diversity was never exploited. The present work describes the first attempt to identify the glomalin gene in several AMF species, verify its reliability as gene marker for the identification and discrimination of AMF, and test the possibility to detect its expression in soil. We designed a specific PCR primers set able to amplify many known lineages of AMF glomalin gene.

However, to date, < 1% of global herbal species have been studied in terms of their interactions with soil-borne fungi; this figure includes arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which have been found to enhance the performance of medicinal plants. The aims of the present investigation were to examine overall mycorrhizal status, morphology of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), degree of root colonisation by AMF, and richness and composition of AMF species in relation to 40 plant species collected from the Garden of Medicinal Plants affiliated with the Institute of Pharmacology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Krakow. In addition, the presence of root endophytes that frequently co-occur with AMF, such as dark septate endophytes (DSEs) and Olpidium spp., was examined. We also tested correlations between fungal parameters and soil chemical properties. The survey showed the occurrence of AMF in 35 plant species. In 32 of these species, AMF were of the Arum morphotype. In the case of two plant species, the Paris type was found, while one plant represented the intermediate morphotype. DSEs were recorded within the roots of 11 species, Olpidium spp. in 10 species. Twenty-two common species of AMF were identified from spores isolated from soils from beneath the plant species. The most frequently occurring species were Funneliformis constrictum, F. mosseae, and Claroideoglomus claroideum. No significant correlation was found between fungal parameters and soil chemical properties. The results of this study expand our knowledge about the ecology of the plants under study. They may be also useful in further studies on the use of AMF inoculation to enhance production of secondary metabolites in these plants.","[Piszczek, Piotr; Zubek, Szymon] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Bot, Gronostajowa St 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Kuszewska, Karolina] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Environm Sci, Gronostajowa St 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Blaszkowski, Janusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Dept Ecol Protect & Shaping Environm, Slowackiego St 17, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland; [Sochacka-Obrusnik, Anna; Stojakowska, Anna] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Pharmacol, Smetna St 12, PL-31343 Krakow, Poland","Zubek, S (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Bot, Gronostajowa St 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",szymon.zubek@uj.edu.pl,"Piszczek, Piotr/S-3751-2019","Piszczek, Piotr/0000-0002-2773-8991; kuszewska, Karolina/0000-0001-8104-8740; Zubek, Szymon/0000-0003-1338-9572; Stojakowska, Anna/0000-0001-9242-2072","Institute of Botany at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow [K/ZDS/006305, K/ZDS/006300, K/ZDS/007340, K/ZDS/008054]; Institute of Pharmacology PAS","The research received financial support from the Institute of Botany at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow (K/ZDS/006305, K/ZDS/006300, K/ZDS/007340, K/ZDS/008054) and from the Institute of Pharmacology PAS (plant cultivation).

Remediation efforts are occurring in Central and South America, attempting to recuperate the soils, often using indigenous nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species. Tree species-generated soil microbial heterogeneity might be important in facilitating regeneration of forest vegetation growth and, although some work has identified these efforts may enhance the soil carbon (C), there have been few studies conducted on how these trees are affecting the below-ground soil biological dynamics in these regions. Here, we explored how and to what extent individual plant effects of a native N-fixing and non-N-fixing plant has affected the below-ground soil C and N metrics and soil bacterial and fungal community composition. To begin to address this, we examined if there were differences in various soil abiotic factors (ToC, TN, C:N ratio, C-mic , NH4+, NO3-, pH, and % moisture) and in the soil bacterial and fungal community composition associated with soil of a native non-N-fixer, Dipteryx panamensis and a native N-fixer, Pentaclethra macroloba, and in comparison to the primary forest bulk-soil in which these tree species occur. We found that primary forest-soils had the greatest amounts of soil NH4+ and C-mic, followed by Pentaclethra-soils. Dipteryx-soils had the least amount of soil C-mic and NH4+, but the greatest amounts of soil NO3-. The PERMANOVA results indicated that the Bray-Curtis soil bacterial and fungal community compositions were significantly different between N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree-soils, and also to that of the primary forest-soils. Our results also demonstrated that soil NH4+ best explained the variation observed in the soil C-mic patterns (39.2%), and, both the soil bacterial (22.8%) and fungal community composition (18.1%). Furthermore, we provide evidence that the N-fixer Pentaclethra-soils stimulates the production of more soil C-mic than the non-N-fixer Dipteryx-soils. It is clear that these tree species are important in creating changes in the soil microbial community composition, and that NH4+ may be associated with a shift in a functional response that may have implications for CUE and remediation in this region.","[McGee, Katie M.; Porter, Teresita M.; Shokralla, Shadi; Hajibabaei, Mehrdad] Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Biodivers Inst Ontario, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [McGee, Katie M.; Porter, Teresita M.; Shokralla, Shadi; Hajibabaei, Mehrdad] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Eaton, William D.] Pace Univ, Dept Biol, 1 Pace Plaza, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Porter, Teresita M.] Nat Resources Canada, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada","McGee, KM (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Biodivers Inst Ontario, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.; McGee, KM (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",kmcgee@uogueph.ca,,"McGee, Katie/0000-0003-4548-5411",Government of Canada through Environment and Climate Change Canada; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1262907]; Canadian government through the Genomics Research and Development Initiative (GRDI) interdepartmental EcoBiomics project,"We would like to thank Vinzenz and Kurt Schmack, the staff members at the Laguna del Lagarto Lodge, and undergraduate student Olivia Karas for her assistance in the project and processing soil samples.

However, why species richness varies amongst the Earth's major TRF regions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the evolutionary processes shaping continental species richness disparities of the pantropical, epiphytic and mostly TRF-dwelling orchid mega-genus Bulbophyllum (c. 1948 spp. in total) using diversification analyses based on a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny (including c. 45-50% spp. each from Madagascar, Africa, Neotropics, and 8.4% from the Asia-Pacific region), coupled with ecological niche modelling (ENM) of geographic distributions under present and past (Last Glacial Maximum; LGM) conditions.ResultsOur results suggest an early-to-late Miocene scenario of out-of-Asia-Pacific' origin and progressive, dispersal-mediated diversification in Madagascar, Africa and the Neotropics, respectively. Species richness disparities amongst these four TRF lineages are best explained by a time-for-speciation (i.e. clade age) effect rather than differences in net diversification or diversity-dependent diversification due to present or past spatial-bioclimatic limits. For each well-sampled lineage (Madagascar, Africa, Neotropics), we inferred high rates of speciation and extinction over time (i.e. high species turnover), yet with the origin of most extant species falling into the Quaternary. In contrast to predictions of classical glacial refuge' theories, all four lineages experienced dramatic range expansions during the LGM.ConclusionsAs the Madagascan, African and Neotropical lineages display constant-rate evolution since their origin (early-to-mid-Miocene), Quaternary environmental change might be a less important cause of their high species turnover than intrinsic features generally conferring rapid population turnover in tropical orchids (e.g., epiphytism, specialization on pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi, wind dispersal). Nonetheless, climate-induced range fluctuations during the Quaternary could still have played an influential role in the origination and extinction of Bulbophyllum species in those three, if not in all four TRF regions.","[Gamisch, Alexander; Comes, Hans Peter] Univ Salzburg, Dept Biosci, Hellbrunnerstr 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria","Gamisch, A (reprint author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Biosci, Hellbrunnerstr 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",alexandergamisch@gmx.at,,,FWF (Austrian Science Fund)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P29371],"This study was funded by the FWF (Austrian Science Fund) grant P29371 to Hans Peter Comes.

However, we know little about how soil nitrogen processes respond to drought stress under climate change. Methods: A continuous 5-year experiment of throughfall reduction treatment (TRT) was conducted in a Castanopsis hystrix plantation in subtropical China to assess how soil nitrogen processes responded to a change in precipitation. Net nitrogen transformation, soil properties, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), and microbial community phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs as bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)) were investigated in the wet and dry seasons over the period of the manipulation experiment. Results: TRT had no significant effects on net ammonification rate (NAR) and nitrogen mineralization rate (NMR), and the unchanged NAR and NMR were mainly caused by the no change of soil nitrogen availability (i.e. NH4+-N, NO3--N and dissolved organic nitrogen). However, TRT significantly increased net nitrification rate (NNR) in the wet season primarily due to the increase in NO3- concentration, and might be further caused by reduced NO3 leaching, denitrification or NO3--N uptake in the TRT. Differently, TRT significantly decreased the NNR in the dry season, which might be linked to the limited SWC that resulted in greater microbial nitrate immobilization than gross nitrate mineralization. In addition, TRT significantly influenced the soil microbial community composition in 010 cm soil layer in the wet season, primarily due to the variations in NO3--N, DOC and DON. Conclusions: Precipitation reduction affected the NNR rather than NAR and NMR, and consequently, further affected soil N availability and N uptake by Castanopsis hystrix.","[Chen, Lin; Wen, Yuanguang; Liu, Shirong] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lin; Zeng, Ji] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lin] Youyiguan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Wen, Yuanguang] Guangxi Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui; Dell, Bernard; Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingxin] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Dell, Bernard] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia","Liu, SR (reprint author), Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.; Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",Liusr@caf.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31290223, 31800533]; Central Research Institute of Basic Research and Public Service Special Operations, Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2017QA026]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2015DFA31440, 2018YFC0507300]","This research was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31290223, 31800533) and Central Research Institute of Basic Research and Public Service Special Operations, Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAFYBB2017QA026), playing the role in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2015DFA31440, 2018YFC0507300) in writing the manuscript.",,48,0,0,4,4,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-6355,2197-5620,,FOR ECOSYST,For.

It remains unclear how the changes in plant and microbial processes could regulate C dynamics of different soil fractions, thereby affecting soil C sequestration. Based on a field fertilization experiment in a subalpine spruce plantation, we examined the effects of N, P and combined N and P addition (NP) treatments on plant C inputs, soil C contents and enzyme activities of bulk soil and different aggregate fractions. We aimed to explore the mechanisms by which N and P addition affected soil C sequestration. After 4-year fertilization, the N treatment increased soil C content by 21%, accompanied by suppressed polyphenol oxidase activity ( - 43%). However, the P and NP treatments decreased soil C content by 14% and 7%, respectively, accompanied by reduction in fine root biomass ( - 51% and - 50%, respectively). Fertilization also affected soil aggregate C pools, with decreased C content in the macroaggregates (5000-250 mu m; MaA) under the P and NP treatments, and increased C content in the silt and clay fraction ( < 53 mu m; S&C) under all fertilization treatments. The step-AIC analysis showed that the effects of fertilization on bulk soil C content were best explained by changes in soil polyphenol oxidase activity and fine root biomass. Overall, our results indicate that N-induced soil C accrual, mainly accumulating in the S&C, could be largely driven by the suppressed oxidase activity, and that decreases in soil C content under the P and NP treatments, mostly occurring in the MaA, was likely associated with the reduced C inputs by fine roots.","[Huang, Junsheng; Qi, Kaibin; Yang, Tinghui; Yang, Bing; Bao, Weikai; Pang, Xueyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Key Lab Sichuan Prov, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Junsheng; Liu, Lingli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qi, Kaibin; Yang, Tinghui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Pang, XY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",pangxy@cib.ac.cn,"Liu, Lingli/Q-2867-2019","Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31770658]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0505002]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20020401]; Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2018SZDZX0030, 18ZDYF0307]","We thank Wenjing Chen, Fengxian Zhong and Yaping Zhu for assistance in the field and laboratory.

The experiment was arranged factorially based on a completely randomized design. The first factor was irrigation regime in three levels of 80, 60 and 40% available water content and the second factor was potting media in five levels of 20% vermicompost, 30% vermicompost, 20% manure compost, 30% manure compost and control (sand and soil in equal proportions). Morpho-physiological traits (plant height, stem diameter, number of flowering stem, root diameter, root length, root dry weight, aerial dry weight, total dry weight, relative water content, ionic stability and water use efficiency) and biochemical traits (malondialdehyde content, catalase and peroxidase activity, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents) were measured. Morpho-physiological parameters, chlorophyll and carotenoid decreased under water deficit, while increased with application of vermicompost and manure compost. Also, lipid peroxidation, catalase and peroxidase activity enhanced under water deficit, while decreased with application of vermicompost and manure compost. In other words, the application of vermicompost and manure compost in potting media reduced the harmful effects of water deficit. Total dry mass and water use efficiency were about 3-fold higher in plants grown in 30% vermicompost or 30% manure compost substrate compared to those in control plants. The results suggest that the application of 30% manure compost could be recommended as suitable potting media due to reducing the negative effects of water shortages, helping to nourish the plant, cheapness and accessibility compared with 30% vermicompost.","[Shakib, Ali Khosravi; Jari, Sepideh Kalate] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Nejad, Abdolhossein Rezaei] Lorestan Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Fac Agr, POB 465, Khorramabad, Iran; [Mirkohi, Azizollah Khandan] Univ Tehran, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Karaj, Iran","Nejad, AR (reprint author), Lorestan Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Fac Agr, POB 465, Khorramabad, Iran.",rezaeinejad.h@lu.ac.ir,,"Khandan-Mirkohi, Azizollah/0000-0002-9891-2571",,,,27,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1065-657X,2326-2397,,COMPOST SCI UTIL,Compost Sci.

Seeking results to proof the effectivity, an agroforestry system established in 2005, at Seropedica, RJ state, with the objective of connecting two forest fragments, went through a series of evaluations realized on the ecological effectiveness on the connection of these fragments. The results indicated that the quantity and quality of soil fauna and mycorrhizal fungi obtained benefits by the agroforestry system in comparison to the pasture matrix, but are still at lower levels than the forest fragments. Pasture near the agroforestry system has benefited from the environmental improvement there, originated from a ""positive edge effect"", a situation quite different from the pasture that was farther from the area of influence of the agroforestry corridor.

A new method to estimate coarse root production is described and applied in an evergreen broadleaf forest, Vietnam. Four 1-m(3) soil blocks were sampled to collect coarse roots, and measured for diameter (empty set), length (L) and dry mass (M) in 2014. Another new five 0.125-m(3) soil blocks were used to measure the coarse root diameter in March 2014 and again in April 2016 to measure the diameter increment. In March 2014, the soil was carefully removed from each 0.125-m(3) block using a shovel and trowel. The exposed coarse roots were carefully marked and measured, and the soil was filled in to cover all the roots so they could continue their natural growth. In April 2016, the soil was removed again, and coarse root diameters were measured at the marked points. Five relationships were established between M and empty set(2)-L for five diameter classes of coarse roots. These five relationships overestimated total biomass by 3.4 percent. Coarse root production at the present study site was 0.99 g m(-2) d(-1). It is concluded that in suitable soils, the new method to estimate coarse root production using the allometric relationship between M and empty set(2).L would be easy and applicable to forest without destructive sampling of standard trees.","[Tran Van Do; Yamamoto, Mamoru] Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Uji, Kyoto, Japan; [Tran Van Do; Nguyen Toan Thang; Tran Hoang Quy; Phung Dinh Trung; Dang Van Thuyet] Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Silviculture Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Sato, Tamotsu] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Vegetat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kozan, Osamu] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Vo Dai Hai] Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Hanoi, Vietnam","Do, TV (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Humanosphere, Uji, Kyoto, Japan.; Do, TV (reprint author), Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Silviculture Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam.",dotranvan@hotmail.com; satoo@affrc.go.jp; yamamoto@rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp; kozan@cseas.kyoto-u.ac.jp; thang.nguyensri@vafs.gov.vn; haivodai@gmail.com; tranhoangquysri@gmail.com; phungdinhtrung@gmail.com; dangvanthuyetln@gmail.com,Van Tran/H-8431-2013,"Tran Van, Do/0000-0001-9059-5842; Toan Thang, Nguyen/0000-0002-6197-9385; Trung, Phung Dinh/0000-0003-2882-0521",Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [106-NN.06-2016.10]; International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science [J-1-D-4602-3],"This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 106-NN.06-2016.10 and International Foundation for Science under grant number J-1-D-4602-3.

Existing studies mainly focus on diversity-productivity relationships. However, studies which determine the effects of soil moisture on the plant community properties in restored meadows are lacking. In this study, we conducted a chronosequence analysis of the interactions between soil water content variation and plant community properties in meadows following passive restoration (3-, 5-, 9-, 14-, 17-, 21-year restoration) of abandoned farmlands on the Sanjiang Plain, China. Results showed that the plant community was characterized by ruderal plants in the initial year of succession, and then by perennial plants such as Calamagrostis angustifolia and Carex spp. in older restored meadows. Similarity of restored community to target site increased across succession time whereas species diversity gradually decreased. Plant height, coverage and biomass increased with restoration time, with plant density being the exception. The community height, coverage and root/shoot ratio were positively related to the water content in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm). Conversely, plant density was significantly and negatively related with soil moisture at 0-10 cm soil depth. Plant diversity (Shannon index, Richness index and evenness) was closely correlated to soil water content at the soil depth of 0-10 cm. Our findings indicate that vegetation of cultivated meadows could be effectively restored by passive restoration. Change of plant species diversity is an especially important response to hydrological recovery in restored meadows on the Sanjiang Plain.","[An, Y.; Liu, X. H.; Tong, S.

The study showed that removal of post-harvest woody debris and no ground preparation is potentially beneficial for the health of young coniferous trees.","[Kwasna, Hanna; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta; Lakomy, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Pathol, Poznan, Poland; [Gornowicz, Roman] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Forest Technol, Poznan, Poland","Kwasna, H (reprint author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Pathol, Poznan, Poland.",kwasna@up.poznan.pl,,"Lakomy, Piotr/0000-0002-1510-6217",General Forest Directorate Poland [N N309 430438]; National Science Centre Poland [DEC-2011/01/N/NZ8/00065]; Genomic Laboratory of the DNA Research Center,"General Forest Directorate Poland, Grant/Award Number: N N309 430438; National Science Centre Poland, Grant/Award Number: DEC-2011/01/N/NZ8/00065; Genomic Laboratory of the DNA Research Center",,81,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1437-4781,1439-0329,,FOREST PATHOL,Forest Pathol.,APR,2019,49,2,,,,,,,e12494,10.1111/efp.12494,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,IJ1ZX,WOS:000475699100010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cheng, RF; Ran, JZ; Huang, H; Dong, LW; Sun, Y; Ji, MF; Hu, WG; Yao, SR; Lu, JL; Gong, HY; Xie, SB; Du, QJ; Hou, QQ; Niklas, KJ; Deng, J",,,,"Cheng, Renfei; Ran, Jinzhi; Huang, Heng; Dong, Longwei; Sun, Yuan; Ji, Mingfei; Hu, Weigang; Yao, Shuran; Lu, Jingli; Gong, Haiyang; Xie, Shubin; Du, Qiajun; Hou, Qingqing; Niklas, Karl J.; Deng, Jianming",,,Life history strategies drive size-dependent biomass allocation patterns of dryland ephemerals and shrubs,ECOSPHERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass allocation; climate factors; desert shrubs; ephemeral plants; surviving strategies,FINE-ROOT BIOMASS; ALLOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; PLANTS; DENSITY; CHINA; TEMPERATURE; COMPETITION; RESPONSES; DROUGHT,"Plant biomass allocation patterns are important to understanding and predicting ecosystem carbon cycles and other important ecological processes. Consequently, many attempts have been made to study these patterns. However, most studies focus on data from species in temperate forests to the neglect of data from desert species adapted to arid conditions. We hypothesize that different life history strategies drive or at least participate in different plant biomass allocation patterns, as, for example, the life history differences between desert ephemeral and shrub species. We tested this hypothesis using field data gathered directly from the entire desert vegetation in Northwestern China. When the data from each of the two species groups are pooled, ephemeral and shrub species manifest different scaling relationships between above- and belowground biomass, unlike the isometric scaling relationships typically reported for forest tree species. The observed scaling relationships are sensitive to water stress and temperature gradients. The scaling exponents numerically decrease with increasing drought stress, and relatively more biomass is allocated to shoot growth in ephemeral species (presumably to rapidly complete their life history). In the case of shrubs, the numerical value of the scaling exponent is insensitive to rainfall, presumably because these species allocate more biomass to root growth to access belowground water. However, the scaling exponent is significantly sensitive to temperature, which also regulates root growth. Moreover, for the two species groups, root-shoot ratios are jointly regulated by precipitation and temperature. The different biomass allocation patterns appear to result from different life histories that maximize either competition among neighboring plants, or escaping damage from drought and low temperatures. These findings show how overall body size and life histories jointly regulate biomass allocation patterns under different extreme conditions and provide insights into estimating the dry carbon content in dryland ecosystems.","[Cheng, Renfei; Ran, Jinzhi; Dong, Longwei; Sun, Yuan; Ji, Mingfei; Hu, Weigang; Yao, Shuran; Lu, Jingli; Gong, Haiyang; Xie, Shubin; Du, Qiajun; Hou, Qingqing; Deng, Jianming] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Heng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Niklas, Karl J.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Biol Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Deng, J (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",dengjm@lzu.edu.cn,,"Huang, Heng/0000-0001-5552-3333","Chinese National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954203]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31322010, 31270753, 31770430]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program; Fundamental Research Funds for Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2016-k03, lzujbky-2015-84, lzujbky-2016-218]","We give great appreciation to professor Bernhard Schmid for his constructive advice on the previous version of the paper.

We reconstructed post-fire regeneration and radial growth rates of Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii at 33 sites that burned between 1992 and 2007, by aging seedlings at the root-shoot boundary. We also measured radial growth in adult trees from 12 additional sites that burned between 1900 and 1990. To quantify the relationship between climate and regeneration, we characterized seasonal climate before, during, and after recruitment pulses using superposed epoch analysis. To quantify growth sensitivity to climate, we performed moving regression analysis for each species and for juvenile and adult life stages. Climatic conditions favoring regeneration and tree growth differed between species. Water deficit and temperature were significantly lower than average during recruitment pulses of ponderosa pine, suggesting that germination-year climate limits regeneration. Growing degree days were significantly higher than average during years with Douglas-fir recruitment pulses, but water deficit was significantly lower one year following pulses, suggesting moisture sensitivity in two-year-old seedlings. Growth was also sensitive to water deficit, but effects varied between life stages, species, and through time, with juvenile ponderosa pine growth more sensitive to climate than adult growth and juvenile Douglas-fir growth. Increasing water deficit corresponded with reduced adult growth of both species. Increases in maximum temperature and water deficit corresponded with increases in juvenile growth of both species in the early 20th century but strong reductions in growth for juvenile ponderosa pine in recent decades. Changing sensitivity of growth to climate suggests that increased temperature and water deficit may be pushing these species toward the edge of their climatic tolerances. Our study demonstrates increased vulnerability of dry mixed-conifer forests to post-fire regeneration failures and decreased growth as temperatures and drought increase. Shifts toward unfavorable conditions for regeneration and juvenile growth may alter the composition and resilience of low-elevation forests to future climate and fire activity.","[Hankin, Lacey E.; Higuera, Philip E.; Davis, Kimberley T.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Dobrowski, Solomon Z.] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hankin, Lacey E.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Hankin, LE (reprint author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Hankin, LE (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",lhankin@nevada.unr.edu,"Higuera, Philip/B-1330-2010; Davis, Kimberley/A-4797-2017","Higuera, Philip/0000-0001-5396-9956; Davis, Kimberley/0000-0001-9727-374X",Joint Fire Science Program [16-1-01-15]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1461576],"We thank S.

They modify soil physical properties and support soil biological activities. Therefore, trees are hypothesized to control soil biodiversity in forested areas. We predicted that (1) experimental forest plantations with higher tree alpha-diversity have greater soil microbial alpha-diversity and (2) that plantations with more divergent tree community composition would have more divergent soil microbial assemblages (Whitaker's beta-diversity). We tested these predictions by measuring soil bacteria and fungi in a 7-yr-old tree biodiversity experiment. The experimental plantation contained 37 different tree assemblages, which were composed of one to four native species from temperate mixed deciduous forests. Further, there was a gradient of functional diversity nested within each level of species diversity. Soil samples were assessed for bacteria and fungi by amplicon sequencing. Tree alpha-diversity weakly, but significantly, affected bacterial alpha-diversity, without affecting fungal alpha-diversity. Tree community composition was weakly, but significantly, linked to soil bacterial and fungal assemblages. In these 7-yr-old experimental plantations, tree diversity was not the most influential driver of soil microbial diversity.","[Rivest, Maxime] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada; [Rivest, Maxime; Rivest, David] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Sci Nat, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1VO, Canada; [Rivest, Maxime; Rivest, David] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFt, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1VO, Canada; [Whalen, Joann K.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Macdonald Campus 21,111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Rivest, David] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Rivest, M (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada.; Rivest, M (reprint author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Sci Nat, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1VO, Canada.; Rivest, M (reprint author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFt, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1VO, Canada.",maxime.rivest2@mail.mcgill.ca,,,NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-05606]; CREATE (Collaborative Research and Training Experience) Program,"This research was supported by a NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2014-05606) and the CREATE (Collaborative Research and Training Experience) Program.

For example, in diverse coevolving mutualisms, such as the interaction of host plants with a suite of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, a key question is whether host plants can coevolve independently with multiple species of symbionts, which depends on whether those interactions are governed independently by separate genes or pleiotropically by shared genes. To provide insight into this question, we employed an association mapping approach in a clonally replicated field experiment of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to identify genetic components of host traits governing ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbioses (mycorrhizal traits). The relative abundances of different EM fungi as well as the total number of root tips per cm root colonized by EM fungi were analyzed as separate mycorrhizal traits of loblolly pine. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes of loblolly pine were associated with loblolly pine mycorrhizal traits, mapped to the loblolly pine genome, and their putative protein function obtained when available. The results support the hypothesis that ectomycorrhiza formation is governed by host genes of large effect that apparently have independent influences on host interactions with different symbiont species.","[Piculell, Bridget J.; Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Piculell, Bridget J.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Martinez-Garcia, Pedro Jose] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Nelson, C.

However, whether similar effects occur belowground through root investment, and whether such effects are related to evergreenness of tree communities, is less clear. Here we studied vertical distribution of standing fine root biomass of twelve North American temperate tree species planted in a common garden tree diversity experiment of varying species richness and evergreenness to test whether belowground niche complementarity of trees could explain positive diversity effects reported aboveground. We tested two alternative hypotheses: trees in mixtures increase uptake of soil resources (1) by increasing vertical root stratification and/or producing a greater fine root density (mgcm(-3)) or (2) by producing similar or fewer fine roots that are potentially more efficient. Additionally, we hypothesized that proportional allocation to belowground biomass increases with evergreenness of tree communities. Fine roots were sampled in six layers of 5-10cm, from 0 to 40cm depth in single-, two- and four-species mixtures. We did not observe an effect of species richness on rooting depth or root density, refuting the hypothesis that aboveground overyielding in tree mixtures is linked to fine root overyielding. Rather, we observed a significant negative diversity effect (- 7.6%) on total fine root density, suggesting overall less investment to fine roots with increasing diversity. The strong positive effect of evergreeness on proportional allocation to fine roots over aboveground parts suggests that deciduous tree roots may be generally more efficient at absorbing soil resources, at least in the early years after tree establishment.","[Archambault, Chelsea; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian; Khlifa, Rim; Handa, I.

Litter inputs shift from herbaceous to tree-derived, which affects the litter quantity and quality and may in turn alter soil carbon dynamics and ecosystem-level carbon sequestration. This study determined changes in the quantity of organic matter inputs following encroachment by two native tree species (Quercus marilandica Muenchh. and Juniperus virginiana L.) into a tallgrass prairie in northcentral Oklahoma, and related it to spatial heterogeneity in soil carbon by measuring variables near the stem, under the tree canopy, at the outer edge of the tree canopy, and beyond the tree canopy. Presence of trees increased aboveground litter inputs (dominated by foliage for J. virginiana and acorns for Q. marilandica) and increased the duff and litter layer. Regardless of leaf litter source, decomposition of foliage was slower under the tree canopy than beyond the tree canopy (7% slower) and this change was associated with cooler and potentially drier conditions. However, the foliage of trees decomposed more quickly than grass foliage when measured both beneath and beyond the tree canopy (25% faster). Coarse root biomass was greater under tree canopies than beyond, which increased total root biomass in the deeper soil layer (10-30 cm). The net effect was an approximately 15% increase in soil carbon stock under the trees as compared to areas beyond the tree canopy. Therefore, in addition to greater carbon storage in the aboveground biomass, tree encroachment increases carbon sequestration by increasing soil carbon.","[Biral, Vanessa C.

The purpose of this study is to fill the gap of knowledge on root biomechanical properties of relevant Mediterranean trees and shrubs in relation to slope stability. Root specimens of typical montane Mediterranean tree and shrub species were sampled in Southern Italy. Root characteristics, such as tensile strength (T-r) and root area ratio (RAR), were assessed from live roots sampled in trenches, while root cohesion was calculated. Power law functions yielded the best fit for the relationship of T-r versus root diameter; however, no significant relationship was found between root strength and root moisture content.

Roots of Quercus cerris L. were the most resistant to breaking under tension, while roots of Ilex aquifolium L. had the highest tensile strength among all shrub species. Results provide quantitative information on the role of root systems of montane Mediterranean forest species in stabilizing soils and will improve modeling of landslide susceptibility to the prevention and mitigation of natural hazards in mountain environments.","[Moresi, Federico Valerio] CURSA Univ Consortium Environm Res, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Maesano, Mauro; Matteucci, Giorgio; Mugnozza, Giuseppe Scarascia] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Agr & Forest Syst Mediterranean, I-80056 Naples, Italy; [Maesano, Mauro; Romagnoli, Manuela; Mugnozza, Giuseppe Scarascia] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Matteucci, Giorgio] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Agr & Forest Syst Mediterranean, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Sidle, Roy C.] Univ Cent Asia, Mt Soc Res Inst, Khorog 736000, Tajikistan","Mugnozza, GS (reprint author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Agr & Forest Syst Mediterranean, I-80056 Naples, Italy.; Mugnozza, GS (reprint author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",f.v.moresi@gmail.com; mauromaesano@gmail.com; giorgio.matteucci@isafom.cnr.it; mroma@unitus.it; roy.sidle@ucentralasia.org; gscaras@unitus.it,,"Maesano, Mauro/0000-0002-4325-951X; MORESI, Federico Valerio/0000-0003-4648-4373; Sidle, Roy/0000-0002-5004-4154","research project ""ALForLab-Chain Value Forest-Wood-Products"" - (Italian) National Operational Programme for Research and Competitiveness (PON R&C) 2007-2013 through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); National financial resources (Revolving Fund-Cohesion Action Plan (CAP) MIUR); MIURMinistero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR) [2015YW8JWA]","The study was supported by the research project ""ALForLab-Chain Value Forest-Wood-Products""-(PON03PE_00024_1) co-funded by the (Italian) National Operational Programme for Research and Competitiveness (PON R&C) 2007-2013, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and National financial resources (Revolving Fund-Cohesion Action Plan (CAP) MIUR), and by the MIUR Research Project of National Relevance (PRIN) ""Wood biomass sector: supply, ecolabelling and carbon sequestration"" Prot. 2015YW8JWA.",,70,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2019,10,4,,,,,,,341,10.3390/f10040341,,,17,Forestry,Forestry,HX3PH,WOS:000467303600049,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Seidel, F; Lopez, ML; Celi, L; Bonifacio, E; Oikawa, A; Yamanaka, T",,,,"Seidel, Felix; Lopez C, M.

However, there is a lack of information on seasonal intra-plant nitrogen partitioning in this representative tree species typical of heavy snowfall regions in Japan. Therefore, the objective of this study was to elucidate Fagus crenata intra-plant nitrogen movement by means of nitrogen content, nitrogen isotope analysis, and amino acids temporal variability. Materials and Methods: Nitrogen content, isotope ratio, and free amino acids content were measured in coarse roots, sapwood, leaves, and litter in four phenological stages in nine adult Fagus crenata trees and upscaled to the whole-tree level. Results: Nitrogen was reabsorbed to and stored in coarse roots during the pre-abscission stage, as was revealed by the depletion of the N-15 ratio of coarse roots, which coincided with an enrichment of N-15 found in leaves. During the post-abscission stage, N was stored in the sapwood, where an enrichment in N-15 was found coinciding with the depletion of the N-15 ratio in leaves. It seemed that N-15-enriched nitrogen was initially reabsorbed from leaves to coarse roots during the pre-abscission period, followed by the reabsorption of N-15-enriched nitrogen from leaves to sapwood shortly before leaf abscission. Free amino acids content and their dynamics could mostly explain seasonal N-15 fractionation in leaves, coarse roots, and partially in sapwood. At the whole-tree level, N content stored in coarse roots and sapwood was similar. Furthermore, reabsorbed leaf N accounted for 32% of all nitrogen stored during leaf senescence. Conclusion: We found three phases of nitrogen storage revealed by N-15 fractionation during leaf senescence: (1) reabsorption of leaf N-15-depleted nitrogen to coarse roots, followed by (2) reabsorption of leaf N-15-enriched nitrogen to sapwood and (3) soil N-15-depleted nitrogen uptake to coarse roots. Further, changes in free amino acids, which are the result of enzyme activities involved in amino acids synthesis, partially explained N-15 fractionation in plant tissues.","[Seidel, Felix; Lopez C, M.

Forest thinning is likely to change the soil properties and feedbacks on the structure and function of microbial communities, consequently affecting microbial regulation on the soil carbon process. However, few studies have focused on the mechanism of how thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil carbon. To reveal the influence of thinning on soil carbon and to explore the regulated key factors, this study was conducted in a pure Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr plantation with different thinning intensity (light, medium, and high) in Shanxi province, China. Soil properties (soil pH, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and soil microbial biomass carbon) were measured. Meanwhile, soil microbial communities were examined with the method of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil enzyme activities were measured as indicators of soil microbial functions. The results showed that medium and high thinning has positive effects on soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial abundance, and soil enzyme activities. Actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria were the major factors to affect soil microbial community function relating to carbon decomposition. Soil pH contributed to actinomycetes and gram-negative bacteria through direct influences on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, there were strong correlations between soil pH and microbial community to control soil carbon turnover. The increasing of soil microbial abundance and the microbial regulation on soil carbon in forest thinning need to be considered for sustainable forest management practices in northern China.","[Wu, Ran; Cheng, Xiaoqin; Han, Hairong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Han, HR (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wuranbjfu@163.com; cxq_200074@163.com; hanhr6015@bjfu.edu.cn,,"wu, ran/0000-0002-8617-9368",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600205]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31700372],This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0600205) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700372).,,61,1,1,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2019,10,4,,,,,,,352,10.3390/f10040352,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,HX3PH,WOS:000467303600060,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Yang, B; Zhang, WH; Lu, YL; Zhang, WW; Wang, YA",,,,"Yang, Bin; Zhang, Wenhui; Lu, Yanlei; Zhang, Weiwei; Wang, Yanan",,,Carbon Storage Dynamics of Secondary Forest Succession in the Central Loess Plateau of China,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon stocks; secondary succession; Loess Plateau; Quercus forests,BROAD-LEAVED FORESTS; FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; SOIL CARBON; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; ZHEJIANG PROVINCE; WOODY DEBRIS; STOCKS; BIOMASS; VEGETATION; SEQUESTRATION,"Research Highlights: This study comprehensively revealed the carbon sequestration characteristics of secondary forests in the central Loess Plateau during vegetation succession. Background and Objectives: The secondary succession of Loess Plateau forests is of great significance in global climate change, but their carbon storage dynamics are poorly understood. The study objectives were to clarify the pattern of changes and contribution level of carbon stocks in various components of ecosystem during succession. Materials and Methods: We selected 18 plots for Pinus tabuliformis Carr. forest at the early stage of succession, 19 for pine-broadleaved mixed forest at the middle stage, and 12 for Quercus-broadleaved mixed forest at the climax stage to determine the tree, shrub, herb, fine root, litter, coarse wood debris (CWD), and soil carbon stocks. Results: Ecosystem carbon stocks increased from 160.73 to 231.14 Mgha(-1) with the succession stages. Vegetation (including tree, shrub and herb) and soil were the two largest carbon pools, and carbon was mainly sequestrated in tree biomass and shallow soil (0-50 cm). In the early stage, soil contributed more carbon stocks to the ecosystem than vegetation, but with succession, the soil contribution decreased while vegetation contribution increased, finally reaching a balance (46.78% each) at the climax stage. Fine root, litter, and CWD contributed little (average 6.59%) to ecosystem carbon stocks and were mainly involved in the turnover of vegetation biomass to soil carbon. Conclusions: Our results provide direct evidence for carbon sequestration of secondary forests on the Loess Plateau. The dynamic results of carbon storage provide an important basis for forest restoration management under climate change.","[Yang, Bin; Zhang, Wenhui] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Comprehens Lab Forestry Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenhui] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yanlei; Zhang, Weiwei; Wang, Yanan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, WH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Key Comprehens Lab Forestry Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Zhang, WH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yangbin23@nwafu.edu.cn; zhangwenhui@nwafu.edu.cn; makerlu1994@126.com; weiweixnyx@yahu.com; wangyanan02@126.com,,,THE BASIC RESEARCH PROJECT OF NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT FROM THE STATE FORESTRY BUREAU IN CHINA [1692016-03],"This research was funded by THE BASIC RESEARCH PROJECT OF NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT FROM THE STATE FORESTRY BUREAU IN CHINA, grant number 1692016-03.",,61,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,APR,2019,10,4,,,,,,,342,10.3390/f10040342,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,HX3PH,WOS:000467303600050,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Liu, YJ; van Kleunen, M",,,,"Liu, Yanjie; van Kleunen, Mark",,,Nitrogen acquisition of Central European herbaceous plants that differ in their global naturalization success,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biological invasion; exotic plant; invasiveness; non-indigenous; plant-environment interactions; species distribution,ALIEN PLANTS; CELL-WALLS; ALLOCATION; PLASTICITY; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; INVASIONS; COMMON; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ADAPTATION,"1 It is frequently assumed that species capable of fast nitrogen (N) acquisition under different N-availability conditions should have a higher establishment success after their introduction into new regions. However, few experimental studies have explicitly tested this. Our multispecies experiment tested whether global naturalization success of plant species native to Central Europe is related to a high N-acquisition ability. 2 We selected 41 common herbaceous species native to Germany that have all become naturalized, and thus been introduced, elsewhere. Twenty-two of these species are widely naturalized and 19 are less widely naturalized. We grew the 41 grassland species, sampled in Germany, under low and high N-conditions in a greenhouse experiment, and assessed their N-acquisition abilities. 3 Although the widely naturalized species grew faster on average, they had a significantly lower N-uptake rate than the less widely naturalized ones. The widely naturalized species, however, had a marginally significantly higher root-mass fraction. Despite these differences, the total plant N-content did on average not differ between the two groups of species. However, N-addition tended to increase the total plant N-content more for the widely naturalized species than for the less widely naturalized species. Nitroge addition also increased biomass production and N-uptake rate, and decreased the root-mass fraction of plants, but these responses did not differ between widely and less widely naturalized species. 4 We conclude that although fast-growing species tend to have a higher global naturalization success than slow-growing species, the naturalization success of plants is not necessarily related to a high N-acquisition ability.","[Liu, Yanjie; van Kleunen, Mark] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanjie; van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Constance, Germany; [Liu, Yanjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Liu, YJ (reprint author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou, Peoples R China.; Liu, YJ (reprint author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Constance, Germany.; Liu, YJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",liuyanjie@iga.ac.cn,,"Liu, Yanjie/0000-0003-3948-1246",,,,64,1,1,18,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We analyzed community-weighted means (CWM) of nine functional traits along a hydrological gradient inside and outside of grazing exclosures in an ephemeral wetland in New Zealand. Root traits exhibited the strongest relationships with the flooding gradient. Root aerenchyma increased linearly as flooding increased but plateaued in the ungrazed treatment. Root dry matter content and root tissue density decreased non-linearly as flooding increased. Grazing reduced the strength of the trait-flooding relationships for all traits except root tissue density, specific root length, and aboveground dry matter content. Specific leaf area decreased non-linearly and height increased linearly with flooding in the ungrazed treatment. Our results indicate that fine root traits can provide more information about the functional adaptation of plants to variation in flooding duration than aboveground traits, but traits such as height and specific leaf area responded to the exclusion of herbivores. Altered hydrological dynamics driven by changes in precipitation regimes will induce shifts in species ranges. Fine root traits, especially aerenchyma, can be used to predict how wetland species will respond to changes in soil hydrology.","[Purcell, Adam S.

Conifers form mutu-alistic partnerships with ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) to obtain greater access to soil resources, and these partnerships may be especially important in degraded areas. However, timber harvest can impact mycorrhizal fungi by removing or compacting topsoil, removing host plants, and warming and drying the soil. We used a field experiment to evaluate the role of EMF in Douglas-fir reforestation in clearcuts invaded by Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) where traditional reforestation approaches have repeatedly failed. We tested how planting distance from intact Douglas-fir forest edges influenced reforestation success and whether inoculation with forest soils can be used to restore EMF relationships. We used an Illumina DNA sequencing approach to measure the abundance, richness and composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi on Douglas-fir roots, and assessed differences in Douglas-fir seedling survival and growth near to and far from forest edges with and without forest soil inoculum. Planting Douglas-fir seedlings near forest edges increased seedling survival, growth, and EMF root colonization. Edge proximity had no effect on EMF richness but did change fungal community composition. Inoculations with forest soil did not increase EMF abundance or richness or change community composition, nor did it improve seedling establishment. With Illumina sequencing, we identified two to three times greater species richness than described in previous edge effects studies. Of the 95 EMF species we identified, 40% of the species occurred on less than 5% of the seedlings. The ability to detect fungi at low abundance may explain why we did not detect differences in EMF richness with distance to hosts as previous studies. Our findings suggest that forest edges are suitable for reforestation, even when the interiors of deforested areas are not. We advocate for timber harvest designs that maximize edge habitat where ecto-mycorrhizal fungi contribute to tree establishment. However, this study does not support the use of inoculation with forest soil as a simple method to enhance EMF and seedling survival.","[Grove, Sara; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Grove, Sara; Haubensak, Karen A.] No Arizona Univ, Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Grove, Sara; Haubensak, Karen A.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Saarman, Norah P.] Yale Univ, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Gilbert, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Faircloth, Brant] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Faircloth, Brant] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Grove, S (reprint author), Univ Calif, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Grove, S (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Grove, S (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",sgrove@ucsc.edu,"Saarman, Norah P/H-4542-2019; Faircloth, Brant C/Y-3978-2019","Saarman, Norah P/0000-0001-8974-0301; ","NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1210661]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1354985, DEB-1136626]; Jean Langenheim Fellowship in Plant Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","This work was supported by a NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1210661 to S.

We tested whether C-14 imaging (analogue of previous autoradiography) can be used to quantitatively estimate the spatial distribution of root exudates in the rhizosphere.MethodsFirst, the attenuation coefficient of C-14 (-) rays in soil and in water was measured and expected gradients of C-14 in the rhizosphere were modelled. Secondly, barley plants were pulse labelled in (CO2)-C-14 atmosphere and the origin (roots or root exudation) and locations of C-14 signal in soil were detected with imaging.ResultsThe attenuation coefficient of C-14 was 148cm(-1) for soil and 67cm(-1) for water, corresponding to a maximum distance that C-14 (-) rays pass through a dry soil of 0.37mm. Based on the measured coefficients we calculated the effect of exudation intensity, root radius and root position on the imaged C-14 signal. The distribution of the imaged signal was strongly affected by: a) C-14 activity in the root, b) root radius, c) distance from the root surface to the imaging screen, d) amount of root exudates in the soil, and e) presence of an air gap (or a region with high porosity) between the soil and the imaging screen.ConclusionsNeglecting the effects of these factors (a-e) may cause biases in the estimation of root exudates using C-14 imaging of the rhizosphere. The C-14 imaging approach should therefore be accompanied by accurate measurement of these factors and calculation of the (-) ray transmission through the soil.","[Holz, Maire] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Grp Isotope Biogeochem & Gas Fluxes, Muencheberg, Germany; [Zarebanadkouki, Mohsen; Carminati, Andrea] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Goettingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Dept Agr Soil Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Kazan Fed Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Kazan 420049, Russia","Holz, M (reprint author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Grp Isotope Biogeochem & Gas Fluxes, Muencheberg, Germany.",maire.holz@zalf.de,"Carminati, Andrea/V-2336-2018; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Zarebanadkouki, Mohsen/L-8854-2015","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Zarebanadkouki, Mohsen/0000-0001-6342-5792","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CA 921/3-1, KU 1184/33-1]; ev.

Here, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) in hair to infer summer dietary differences of Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (nonmigratory reindeer) in Nordenskioldland, Svalbard and used regression models to predict how reindeer dietary intake depend on climatic variables. In linear regression models, current-year and last-year July temperatures positively correlated with both the C-13 and N-15 of reindeer hair, and were stronger predictors of isotopic signatures than July precipitation. C-13 and N-15 analysis indicated robust dietary differences between populations separated by less than 50km and within these valley systems in the proportions of nonmycorrhizal vascular plants and mosses. Remote sensing (NDVI) and isotopic data together suggested an early-season switch from moss to vascular plant dependence in valleys closer to the sea, suggesting both high site fidelity and localized differences in forage availability related to the onset of the growing season. C-13 photosynthetic discrimination increased with the rising atmospheric pCO(2), indicating that Svalbard plants are already responding physiologically to rising CO2 concentrations. Calves were higher in C-13 and N-15 than adults, consistent with a weak trophic effect. We also determined how hair C:N correlated with C-13 and N-15 patterns. Overall, these data provide evidence that C-13 and N-15 measurements can detect dietary shifts over short time periods and fine spatial scales, indicating that isotopic studies can help monitor herbivory in the changing Arctic.","[Zhao, Lily Z.; Colman, Albert S.; Olack, Gerard] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhao, Lily Z.; Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03833 USA; [Zhao, Lily Z.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Irvine, R.

We consider this a missed opportunity in microbial ecology and provide what we believe is the first formal study of offspring-size variation in microbes using reproductive models developed for macro-organisms. We mapped the entire distribution of fungal spore size in the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (subphylum Glomeromycotina) and tested allometric expectations of this trait to offspring (spore) output and body size. Our results reveal a potential paradox in the reproductive ecology of AM fungi: while large spore-size variation is maintained through evolutionary time (independent of body size), increases in spore size trade off with spore output. That is, parental mycelia of large-spored species produce fewer spores and thus may have a fitness disadvantage compared to small-spored species. The persistence of the large-spore strategy, despite this apparent fitness disadvantage, suggests the existence of advantages to large-spored species that could manifest later in fungal life history. Thus, we consider that solving this paradox opens the door to fruitful future research establishing the relationship between offspring size and other AM life history traits.","[Aguilar-Trigueros, Carlos A.; Hempel, Stefan; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Aguilar-Trigueros, Carlos A.; Hempel, Stefan; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Powell, Jeff R.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Cornwell, William K.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Aguilar-Trigueros, CA (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Aguilar-Trigueros, CA (reprint author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",calgit@gmail.com,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1501A-H]; Alexander von Humboldt Research Alumni Program of the Freie Universitat Berlin,"CAA-T was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF within the Collaborative Project ""Bridging in Biodiversity Science - BIBS"" (funding number 01LC1501A-H) and the Alexander von Humboldt Research Alumni Program of the Freie Universitat Berlin.",,71,0,0,3,18,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,APR,2019,13,4,,,,,873,884,,10.1038/s41396-018-0314-7,,,12,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,HP5LW,WOS:000461719600003,30504896,,,,10/31/19J,"Yang, T; Li, DD; Clothier, B; Wang, Y; Duan, J; Di, N; Li, GD; Li, X; Jia, LM; Xi, BY; Hu, W",,,,"Yang, Tian; Li, Doudou; Clothier, Brent; Wang, Ye; Duan, Jie; Di, Nan; Li, Guangde; Li, Xin; Jia, Liming; Xi, Benye; Hu, Wei",,,Where to monitor the soil-water potential for scheduling drip irrigation in Populus tomentosa plantations located on the North China Plain?,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Irrigation management; Temporal-stability analysis; HYDRUS; Fine roots; Transpiration; Poplars,USE EFFICIENCY; HYBRID POPLAR; ROOT-SYSTEM; GROWTH; AVAILABILITY; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; DYNAMICS,"Determining the optimal tensiometer placement is crucial for scheduling irrigation based on soil water potential (SWP) in poplar plantations. However, such work has never been done. The stand-age effect on the tensiometer placement is still unknown, hindering the development of a dynamic irrigation regime. In a surface drip irrigated Populus tomentosa, short-rotation plantation on sandy loam soil, the variation of SWP at different positions [hereafter expressed in spatial coordinates (distance from dripper in cm, depth in cm)] within the soil wetting volume (WV), and the daily tree growth rates were continuously monitored in one growing season. Whereas, the transpiration and fine root distribution were measured in two growing seasons. The HYDRUS model was calibrated using soil water and transpiration data from one growing season and validated using data in another growing season. Then the model was applied to simulate sixty scenarios, which were combinations of different SWP measurement positions (ten scenarios), root distribution patterns (three scenarios; mainly using rooting depth as a proxy for trees at different ages), and irrigation thresholds (two scenarios). Based on the simulation results, we estimated the ratio of actual to potential transpiration (Ta/Tp) and irrigation efficiency (IE; calculated as (T-a/T-p)/irrigation amount) for each scenario. The absolute value of the mean relative difference of SWP was smaller at (15, 10) than at any other positions within the WV. The proportion of variation in growth (R-2 = 0.294) and transpiration rates (R-2 = 0.247) explained by root water-uptake was also highest at (15, 10). Fine roots concentrated on both sides of dripper as the trees grew bigger, with the maximal root density finally occurring at about (15, 10) and (-15, 10). Under the (-15, 10), (0, 10), (15, 10) and (0, 30) position scenarios, the T-a/T-p was at a high level relative to other scenarios, while the IE were at a middle level. As rooting depth increased, the ranks of different tensiometer positions in T-a/T-p and IE changed only a little, and Ta/Tp decreased slightly, implying the optimal placement should not vary with stand age. Therefore, tensiometer was recommended to place at 10 cm depth and about 15 cm distance from the dripper to schedule drip irrigation in different-aged P. tomentosa plantations on sandy loam soil. This will bring benefits to minimizing the use of irrigation water and maximizing production. Besides, the comprehensive approach used in this study can be adopted, when determining the optimal soil water measurement positions for scheduling irrigation for other plant species growing on other soil types.","[Yang, Tian; Li, Doudou; Duan, Jie; Di, Nan; Jia, Liming; Xi, Benye] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Clothier, Brent] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Fitzherbert Sci Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Wang, Ye] Beijing Acad Forestry & Pomol, Inst Agr & Forestry Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Guangde] Open Univ China, Fac Agr Forestry & Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] Sinton Technol Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wei] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Xi, BY; Hu, W (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",benyexi@bjfu.edu.cn; wei.hu@plantandfood.co.nz,"Clothier, Brent E/H-3124-2013","Clothier, Brent E/0000-0003-1901-0324; xi, benye/0000-0003-4730-6384","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31872702, 31670625, 31800531]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600403]; Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAD09B02]","This research was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872702, 31670625, 31800531), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0600403), and the Key Technologies R&D Program of China (2015BAD09B02).",,58,0,0,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

One of the ways to achieve this goal is by increased planting of admixture tree species, such as birch, hornbeam or lime, after clearcutting or in older, otherwise homogenous forest stands. However, because admixture forest tree species present less economical value than trees such as pine or oak, they are object of fewer studies, and in this context their mycorrhizal relations are not fully known. Describing them would further aid the use of such trees in forest management. This study focused on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities of two-years-old silver birch (B. pendula L.), European hornbeam (C. betulus L.) and small-leaved lime (T. cordata Mill.) seedlings under bare-root forest nursery conditions. The ECM fungal partners of the studied trees were identified based on the molecular approach, and the uncovered community structure was analyzed in context of the local soil chemical parameters. We found that the ECM fungal communities of admixture tree species in bare-root nurseries are of high diversity, and contain a wide array of fungal species. Our study identified the highest taxa richness (23 taxa) associated with the roots of hornbeams and limes, followed closely (21 taxa) by birch. Surprisingly, ECM fungal communities of lime (family Malvaceae) were more similar to hornbeam and birch (family Betulaceae) than the two were to each other. The lime ECM fungal communities were also the least divergent across the five tested nurseries, showing little response to differences in the soil chemistry. The most abundant and frequent fungi found in the study were Tuber (average relative abundance: 18.9%) and Hebeloma (average relative abundance: 18.4%) species. Some of the fungal taxa we recorded have never before been identified under nursery conditions (e.g., Lactarius pubescens, Leccinum holopus, Pachyphloeus melanoxantha, Russula grata). Pachyphloeus melanoxantha is a rare species in Europe, and this study recorded one of its first records in Poland. Our results present not only a description of ECM associations of tested trees (providing the first ever description of young hornbeam ECM communities), but also may have practical implications both for producing planting stock of these admixture trees, and for the later replanting of those into forest stands.","[Rudawska, Maria; Kujawska, Marta; Leski, Tomasz; Janowski, Daniel; Karlinski, Leszek; Wilgan, Robin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, 5 Parkowa St, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland","Rudawska, M (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, 5 Parkowa St, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",mariarud@man.poznan.pl,,"Kujawska, Marta Brygida/0000-0001-5999-7026; Rudawska, Maria/0000-0002-8103-5269; Leski, Tomasz/0000-0003-4167-5015; Wilgan, Robin/0000-0002-3628-5226",Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry Polish Academy of Sciences [34/GM/2017],"Research was partly financed by the grant (34/GM/2017) assigned by the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry Polish Academy of Sciences to the second author (MK).

However, it is thought that root competition may be less important than shoot competition due to greater size symmetry belowground. Because direct experimental tests on the importance of root competition are scarce, we aim at elucidating whether root competition may have direct or indirect effects on community structure. Indirect effects may occur by altering the overall size asymmetry of competition through root-shoot competitive interactions. Methods We used a phytometer approach to examine the effects of root, shoot and total competition intensity and importance on evenness of experimental plant communities. Thereby two different phytometer species, Festuca brevipila and Dianthus carthusianorum, were grown in small communities of six grassland species over three levels of light and water availability, interacting with neighbouring shoots, roots, both or not at all. Important Findings We found variation in community evenness to be best explained if root and shoot (but not total) competition were considered. However, the effects were species specific: in Dianthus communities increasing root competition increased plant community evenness, while in Festuca communities shoot competition was the driving force of this evenness response. Competition intensities were influenced by environmental conditions in Dianthus, but not in Festuca phytometer plants. While we found no evidence for root-shoot interactions for neither phytometer species root competition in Dianthus communities led to increased allocation to shoots, thereby increasing the potential ability to perform in size-asymmetric competition for light. Our experiment demonstrates the potential role of root competition in structuring plant communities.","[Weiss, Lina; Schalow, Linda; Jeltsch, Florian; Geissler, Katja] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Weiss, Lina; Jeltsch, Florian] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany","Weiss, L (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",weissl@uni-potsdam.de,,,Leibniz Centre of Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF e.V.); BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LC1501B],This study was supported by the Leibniz Centre of Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF e.V.) and by the BMBF in the framework of the BIBS project (01LC1501B).,,59,0,0,7,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Changes in soil geochemistry and mineralogy due to eucalyptus have not been clearly established to date. The objective of this study was to identify evidences of the effects of eucalyptus root system on geochemistry and clay mineralogy of a Ferralsol. Soil samples were collected in different positions of an old eucalyptus site (R1: rhizosphere of small roots; R2: coarse roots, and R3: bulk soil). The soil pH was very acid (3.8) and Al3+ (4.7 cmol(c) kg(-1)) and H+ Al3+ (40.2 cmol(c) kg(-1)) were higher in R1 compared to R3. Additionally, reduction of clay fraction content and an increase in the proportion of Al-interlayered clay minerals were also observed in the eucalyptus rhizosphere. This suggests the occlusion of Al3+ in the interlayer space of 2:1 clay minerals and explains the tendency of a low cation exchange capacity of the day fraction. Then, the acidification due to eucalyptus did not alter the composition of the mineral assemblage (mineral species) but the trend was a decrease of the proportion of the fine clay fraction (< 0.1 mu m) as well as an increase of the proportion of 2:1 Al-interlayered clay mineral in the clay fraction. The results suggest that when alien tree species are introduced into natural lands worldwide, a comprehensive geochemical-mineralogical approach must be applied in order to provide the extension of constituent changes.","[Korchagin, Jackson; Bortoluzzi, Edson Campanhola; Petry, Claudia] Univ Passo Fundo, Lab Land Use & Nat Resources, Campus 1,BR 285,Km 29, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Moterle, Diovane Freire] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Rio Grande do Sul, Osvaldo Aranha 540, BR-99570000 Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil; [Caner, Laurent] Univ Poitiers, HydrASA UMR IC2MP 7285, 7 Rue Albert Turpain,B35 TSA 51106, F-86073 Poitiers, France","Bortoluzzi, EC (reprint author), Univ Passo Fundo, Lab Land Use & Nat Resources, Campus 1,BR 285,Km 29, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.",jackson.korchagin@gmail.com; edson.bortoluzzi@pq.cnpq.br; diovane.moterle@bento.ifrs.edu.br; petry@upf.br; laurent.caner@univ-poitiers.fr,"Bortoluzzi, Edson/I-6383-2012","Bortoluzzi, Edson/0000-0002-0967-0057; Korchagin, Jackson/0000-0001-6493-1873",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001]; CAPES-COFECUB programCAPES [3504-11-5]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [458553/2014-0];  [CNPq 458553/2014-0];  [140617/2014-0],"This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, CAPES-COFECUB program [3504-11-5] and National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq [458553/2014-0].

This paper describes changes in AMF (glomerospore abundances, species composition and diversity and glomalin contents) along secondary forest succession, and we explore the impacts of seasonally and of soil texture and chemistry. Research was conducted in a shifting cultivation region at the eastern periphery of Amazonia, in 'young' (3-4 yrs old - SEC1) and 'mid-aged' (6-8yrs old -SEC2) degraded secondary forest regrowth, and in mature ( > 120yrs old - SEC3) rainforest, both in dry (November 2015) and in rainy (May 2016) seasons. We identify a total of 36 AMF species, corresponding to 24.1% of Brazils and 12.5% of the worldwide known AMF species richness. The genera Glomus and Acaulospora predominated in both seasons and over all successional stages, in terms of species richness and of relative abundances and frequencies. Though AMF species diversity did differ significantly between young / mid-aged degraded secondary forests and > 120 yrs-old mature rainforests, differences were altogether small and - contrary to vegetation species diversity - higher in stages SEC2 + 3 than in SEC1. Neither easily-extractable nor total glomalin contents differed significantly between seasons or successional stages, though they did contribute substantially (overall 2.5% average) to total soil organic carbon. BCA suggests that AMF species composition was driven mainly by seasonally (15.9%) and only marginally (though likewise significantly) by succession (8.0%). A subset of soil variables (pH, OM, Al, CEC, Ca) related strongly (r(2) = 0.46) with glomerospore abundance and AMF species composition. Our results support the view of a remarkably resilient limited set of AMF species with only subtle differences between young (degraded) secondary regrowth and mature rainforests. Thus, the successional trajectories of vegetation recovery after repeated shifting cultivation cycles are likely not limited by AMF species availability.","[Reyes, Henry Alexander; Alves Ferreira, Paula Fernanda; Silva, Luana Correa; Nobre, Camila Pinheiro; Gehring, Christoph] Maranhao State Univ UEMA, Postgrad Program Agroecol, Sao Luis, Brazil; [da Costa, Marlon Gomes] Fed Inst Maranhao IFMA, Campus Sao Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Sao Raimundo Das Mangabe, Brazil","Gehring, C (reprint author), Campus Univ Paulo VI S-N, BR-65054970 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.",christophgehring@yahoo.com.br,"Nobre, Camila/L-4252-2014","Nobre, Camila/0000-0001-8137-7456","Maranhao State Research Foundation (FAPEMA) [00731/15, sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia)]; Brazilian Council for Higher Education (CAPES)","We thank the Maranhao State Research Foundation (FAPEMA) for funding via the project no 00731/15 'Influencia de capoeiras enriquecidas com sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) na comunidade de fungos micorrizicos arbusculares (FMA)', and the Brazilian Council for Higher Education (CAPES) for the masters' scholarship of the first author.",,88,0,0,12,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Accordingly, AMF diversity, community composition and glomalin were investigated in the northern desert of China. Soil samples from 0 to 30 cm in depth over seven plots were collected under the canopy of Hedysarum scoparium in July of 2015 and 2016. A total of 51 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by MiSeq sequencing based on small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA genes, and Diversispora celata and Diversispora trimurales were discovered for the first time in a desert ecosystem in China. The abundant genera included Glomus (56.4%), Diversispora (25.1%), Claroideoglomus (6.0%), Funneliforrnis (6.1%) and Paraglomus (5.5%). Archaeospora and Scutellospora sequences represented < 1.0% of total sequences. AMF community composition and diversity and two Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP) assays were significantly different among the seven studied plots and sampling times. Moreover, AMF diversity and richness tended to increase first and then decrease as the precipitation decreased in the barren sandy grey desert and aeolian sandy soil. Correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that the Shannon-Wiener index was significantly and positively correlated with acid phosphatase (P < 0.05) and precipitation (P < 0.01) and was significantly and negatively correlated with soil pH (P < 0.01). The richness of AMF was significantly and positively correlated with precipitation (P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) (P < 0.05) and soil pH (P < 0.01). The BRSP fractions were also significantly and positively correlated with edaphic factors (e.g., soil moisture, soil organic carbon) and soil enzymes (e.g., soil acid and alkaline phosphatase). The means of total BRSP and easily extractable BRSP were 5.86 mg.g(-1) and 1.90 mg.g(-1), respectively. The levels of BRSP in the desert soil were slightly lower than those in native and arable soils, but the ratios of BRSP to SOC were much higher than in farmland soils. Our findings provide insights into important factors affecting the native AMF community and glomalin in the northern desert of China and suggest that AMF diversity and glomalin might be useful for monitoring desertification and soil degradation.","[Qiang, Wei; He, Xueli; Wang, Jiaojiao; Zhao, Lili] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, 180 Wusidong Rd, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China","He, XL (reprint author), Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, 180 Wusidong Rd, Baoding 071002, Hebei, Peoples R China.",xlh3615@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270460, 31470533]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 31270460, 31470533).",,56,1,1,15,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

One side of the skid trail was bordered by an eight-year-old alder plantation, on the other side, there were no trees. Soil physical properties (relative apparent gas diffusion coefficient (Ds/D0), bulk density and the coarse porosity) were measured in order to detect the effects on soil structure as well as on fine root densities, taken as a biological target variable. Values of soil physical parameters linked to the soil aeration status did not show significant differences between planted and unplanted wheel track; however, low values of bulk density measured on the laterally planted wheel track indicated significant improvements in the topsoil compared to the unplanted one. Also, values for fine root density were higher in these plots. Strong relationships between Ds/D0, bulk density and the coarse porosity with fine root densities were also found, which give evidence of their mutual effects, either amplifying each other or reciprocal. In the top soil, root density positively affects soil gas permeability, while in the deeper horizons fewer macropores are found, which are partially blocked by fine roots for gas exchange. In summary, the wheel track which is laterally planted with alder trees showed signs of an initial regeneration of soil structure as well as a reinforcement against further soil damage caused by annual wheeling.","[Fernandez, J.

The seeds were sown in pots with different depth of sand, and their germination and seedling growth during the first month were investigated. Results showed that large seeds possessed the highest 1000-seed weight and soluble sugar concentration. Large and medium seeds had a higher germination rate, germination index, vigor index, and seedling biomass than small seeds. With the increase in seed size, root mass ratio, root/shoot ratio, specific root length, and specific root area decreased, whereas leaf mass ratio increased. Sand burial depth significantly influenced seed germination and seedling growth, and the highest germination rate and seedling biomass were achieved with 2-3 cm sand burial. We also found that seedling biomass was positively related to germination rate, germination index, and vigor index, but was negatively related to mean germination time. Moreover, seedling biomass was negatively correlated with root mass ratio and root/shoot ratio, but positively correlated with leaf mass ratio, specific root length, and specific root area.

In this study, TiO2/Al-based RMFs with two different modulation periods were integrated into multilayer flyer plates using magnetron sputtering technology, which produced nano-energetic multilayer films with optimised performance for laser-driven flyer plate systems. The effects of the TiO2/Al RMFs on the laser-driven properties of the RMF flyer were then systematically investigated in terms of the electron temperature and density using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Measurements of the RMF flyer velocity were performed using a photonic Doppler velocimetry system. Electron temperatures of 6331.2-10563.0 K, electron densities of 4.03-12.69x10(15) cm(-3), and flyer velocities of 3854.7-6417.7 m/s were produced in the RMFs merely by changing the modulation period of the TiO2/Al RMF.

Given the high nitrogen (N) requirements of AMF and their role in plant N uptake, they may reduce the availability of mineral N that could be subject to N2O emissions and leaching losses. We investigated the impact of AMF on the growth of tropical grass Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. and on N2O released after fertilization with urea in a mesocosm study. To evaluate the role of nitrification in N2O emissions, we used nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD). The study included a full-factorial design (n = 6) with two AMF treatments (with and without AMF inoculation) and three fertilization treatments (control, urea and urea + DCD), applied after 92 days of growth. Plant growth, soil properties and N2O emissions were measured during the following 2 weeks and the abundance of nitrifiers was quantified one and two weeks after fertilization. The production of N2O increased after urea application but only without DCD, indicating the importance of nitrification in N2O emissions. The emissions of N2O after urea application were reduced by 46% due to the presence of AMP. Nevertheless, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was increased by urea and AMF, while plant growth was reduced by the AMF. The increased root:shoot ratio of the biomass in AMF pots suggests competition between AMP and plants. This study demonstrated that immobilization of N by AMF can reduce N2O emissions after fertilization, even when plant growth is reduced. The inverse relationship between (higher) AOB abundance and (lower) nitrification rates suggests that changes in the activity of AOB, rather than abundance, may be indicative of the impact of the AMF-Brachiaria symbiosis on N cycling in tropical grasslands. Alternatively, the difference between N2O emissions from AMF and non-AMF pots may be explained by increased reduction of N2O in the presence of AMP. Longer-term studies are needed to verify whether the effects of AMF on N2O emissions and/or plant growth persist over time or are limited to initial immobilization of N by AMF in N-limited systems.","[Teutscherova, Nikola] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Trop AgriSci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teutscherova, Nikola; Vazquez, Eduardo; Benito, Marta] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Prod, Madrid, Spain; [Teutscherova, Nikola; Vazquez, Eduardo; Arango, Jacobo; Arevalo, Ashly; Pulleman, Mirjam] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Palmira, Colombia; [Pulleman, Mirjam] Wageningen Univ & Res, Soil Biol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands","Teutscherova, N (reprint author), Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Prod, Madrid, Spain.",nikola.teutscherova@upm.es,"Pulleman, Mirjam/C-1207-2014; BENITO, MARTA/F-8775-2016","Pulleman, Mirjam/0000-0001-9950-0176; BENITO, MARTA/0000-0001-6664-1642","CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); Catedra Rafael Dal-Re/TRAGSA; Spanish Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education and Science, Spain","This study was undertaken as part of the LivestockPlus project funded by CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is a strategic partnership of CGIAR and Future Earth.

The increasing frequency of N addition significantly promoted the root-to-shoot ratio and decreased N2O emission under high N addition quantity. (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, N addition alters the reproductive strategy of H. vulgaris and enhances its invasiveness, promoting N2O emission but not the CO2 equivalent of the H. vulgaris-soil system.","[Li, Qian-Wei; Zhang, Xiao-Ya; Gao, Jun-Qin; Liang, Jin-Feng; Yue, Yi] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Song, Ming-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Gao, JQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",liqianwei@bjfu.edu.cn; zhangxiaoya@bjfu.edu.cn; gaojq@bjfu.edu.cn; songmh@igsnrr.ac.cn; liang1091568419@126.com; yaoyao_0919@bjfu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571084, 41871077]",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571084 and 41871077).,,50,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Mar,2019,11,6,,,,,,,1520,10.3390/su11061520,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU9KJ,WOS:000465613000015,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Jing, X; Cai, CJ; Fan, SH; Wang, LJ; Zeng, XL",,,,"Jing, Xiong; Cai, Chunju; Fan, Shaohui; Wang, Lujun; Zeng, Xianli",,,Spatial and Temporal Calcium Signaling and Its Physiological Effects in Moso Bamboo under Drought Stress,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ca2+ signal; drought stress; living cell; Moso Bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis); plasma membrane Ca2+ channels; signal network,CHANNELS; CA2+; TRANSDUCTION; ACTIVATION,"Elevations in cytosolic free calcium concentration constitute a fundamental signal transduction mechanism in plants; however, the particular characteristics of calcium ion (Ca2+) signal occurrence in plants is still under debate. Little is known about how stimulus-specific Ca2+ signal fluctuations are generated. Therefore, we investigated the identity of the Ca2+ signal generation pathways, influencing factors, and the effects of the signaling network under drought stress on Phyllostachys edulis (Carriere) J. Houz. Non-invasive micro testing and laser confocal microscopy technology were used as platforms to detect and record Ca2+ signaling in live root tip and leaf cells of P. edulis under drought stress. We found that Ca2+ signal intensity (absorption capacity) positively correlated with degree of drought stress in the P. edulis shoots, and that Ca2+ signals in different parts of the root tip of P. edulis were different when emitted in response to drought stress. This difference was reflected in the Ca2+ flux and in regional distribution of Ca2+. Extracellular Ca2+ transport requires the involvement of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, while abscisic acid (ABA) can activate the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Additionally, Ca2+ acted as the upstream signal of H2O2 in the signaling network of P. edulis under drought stress. Ca2+ was also involved in the signal transduction process of ABA, and ABA can promote the production of Ca2+ signals in P. edulis leaves. Our findings revealed the physiological role of Ca2+ in drought resistance of P. edulis. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for research on the response to Ca2+ signaling in P. edulis.","[Jing, Xiong; Cai, Chunju; Fan, Shaohui; Wang, Lujun; Zeng, Xianli] State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Int Ctr Bamboo & Rattan, Key Lab Bamboo & Rattan, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China","Cai, CJ (reprint author), State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Int Ctr Bamboo & Rattan, Key Lab Bamboo & Rattan, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China.",jxicbr@163.com; caicj@icbr.ac.cn; fansh@icbr.ac.cn; wuatang@icbr.ac.cn; zengxl723@163.com,,,International Centre for Bamboo and Rattan Center [1632018008],This research was funded by the International Centre for Bamboo and Rattan Center.

However, the extent of plant phylogenetic constraints on the free-living soil mycobiome remains unknown, especially at broad geographic scales. Here, 343 soil samples were collected adjacent to individual tree trunks, representing 58 woody plant species located in five mountain forests of eastern China. Integrating plant species identity and phylogenetic information, we aimed to unravel the relative contributions of phylogenetic relationships among tree species, abiotic environmental filtering, and geographic isolation to the geographic distribution of soil mycobiome. We found that the community dissimilarities of total fungi and each dominant guild (viz. saprotrophs, plant pathogens, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) significantly increased with increasing plant phylogenetic distance. Plant phylogenetic eigenvectors explained 11.4% of the variation in community composition, whereas environmental and spatial factors explained 24.1% and 7.2% of the variation, respectively. The communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens were relatively more strongly affected by plant phylogeny than those of saprotrophs (13.7% and 10.4% vs. 8.5%). Overall, our results demonstrate how plant phylogeny, environment, and geographic space contribute to forest soil fungal distributions and suggest that the influence of plant phylogeny on fungal association may differ by guilds.","[Yang, Teng; Shi, Yu; Wang, Hongfei; Li, Yuntao; Chu, Haiyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, East Beijing Rd 71, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Teng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tedersoo, Leho] Univ Tartu, Nat Hist Museum, 14a Ravila, EE-50411 Tartu, Estonia; [Soltis, Pamela S.; Soltis, Douglas E.; Sun, Miao] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 940 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Surg, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhang, Jian; Chen, Zhiduan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Lin, Hanyang; Zhao, Yunpeng; Fu, Chengxin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Conservat Biol Endangered Wildlife, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chu, HY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, East Beijing Rd 71, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hychu@issas.ac.cn,", yshi@issas.ac.cn/P-3378-2015; Sun, Miao/A-6128-2018",", yshi@issas.ac.cn/0000-0001-9612-8321; Sun, Miao/0000-0001-5701-0478; Gilbert, Jack/0000-0001-7920-7001",NSFC-NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [31461123001]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 15010101]; National Program on Key Basic Research ProjectNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954002]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1442280]; China Biodiversity Observation Networks (Sino BON),"We are grateful to Yuying Ma, Yingying Ni, Liang Chen for assistance in soil sampling and laboratory assays, and Jianfei Ye, Bing Liu, Luxian Liu, Xiaoming Zheng, Ji Ye, Zhanqing Hao for assistance with vegetation survey.

However, establishment on islands could also be limited by biotic drivers, such as the absence of symbionts. Most plants, for example, form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi, whose limited dispersal to islands could act as a colonization filter for plants. We tested this hypothesis using global-scale analyses of similar to 1.4 million plant occurrences, including similar to 200,000 plant species across similar to 1,100 regions. We find evidence for a mycorrhizal filter (that is, the filtering out of mycorrhizal plants on islands), with mycorrhizal associations less common among native island plants than native mainland plants. Furthermore, the proportion of native mycorrhizal plants in island floras decreased with isolation, possibly as a consequence of a decline in symbiont establishment. We also show that mycorrhizal plants contribute disproportionately to the classic latitudinal gradient of plant species diversity, with the proportion of mycorrhizal plants being highest near the equator and decreasing towards the poles. Anthropogenic pressure and land use alter these plant biogeographical patterns. Naturalized floras show a greater proportion of mycorrhizal plant species on islands than in mainland regions, as expected from the anthropogenic co-introduction of plants with their symbionts to islands and anthropogenic disturbance of symbionts in mainland regions. We identify the mycorrhizal association as an overlooked driver of global plant biogeographical patterns with implications for contemporary island biogeography and our understanding of plant invasions.","[Delavaux, Camille S.; Schultz, Peggy; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Delavaux, Camille S.; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Weigelt, Patrick; Koenig, Christian; Kreft, Holger] Univ Goettingen, Dept Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Dawson, Wayne] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England; [Duchicela, Jessica] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Ciencias Vida, Sangolqui, Ecuador; [Essl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [van Kleunen, Mark; Stein, Anke] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [van Kleunen, Mark] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Pergl, Jan; Pysek, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Invas Ecol, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Pysek, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pysek, Petr; Winter, Marten] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Kreft, Holger] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, Gottingen, Germany","Delavaux, CS (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Delavaux, CS (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",camille.delavaux@ku.edu,"Pysek, Petr/B-1957-2012; Weigelt, Patrick/E-2122-2014; Kreft, Holger/A-4736-2008","Weigelt, Patrick/0000-0002-2485-3708; Kreft, Holger/0000-0003-4471-8236; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Duchicela, Jessica/0000-0001-5245-8273","US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1556664]; National Geographical Society [WW-036ER-17]; German DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [264740629, FZT 118]; Czech Centre of Excellence Plant Diversity Analysis and Synthesis Centre [14-36079G]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Austrian Science FoundationAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2086B16]","We acknowledge W.

While AMF hold potential for sustainable MTE management and conservation, they have been under investigated on this ecosystem and little is known about AMF spore bank dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the effect of physico-chemical soil factors, phytobiont species, and seasonality on the AMF spore soil density in two sclerophyllous forests (Malloa and San Vicente). We sampled soil once per season during 1 year and beneath four representative tree species for each site. The results show a strong season effect at both sites, while physical-chemical parameters differed between sites. At Malloa, clay content and electrical conductivity were positively correlated with spore density, while available phosphorous showed a negative correlation. At San Vicente, clay content and total nitrogen were positively correlated with spore density, while soil organic matter showed a negative effect. Overall, spore number reached a minimum value in winter and higher values during the growing season at both sites. These results indicate a strong regulation of AMF spore density by seasonal climate, while physico-chemical soil properties exert a host-independent but site-specific effect in both forests.","[Silva-Flores, Patricia; Neira, Jose] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Fruticultura, Sect Choapinos, Camino Parcelas 882, Rengo, Chile; [Silva-Flores, Patricia; Palfner, Gotz] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Bueno, C.

Comparisons of niches and effects of closely related native and invasive species enable the investigation of this topic. Does Spartina anglica invade European salt marshes through competitive exclusion of the native Spartina maritima or due to the occurrence of an empty ecological niche in highly anoxic conditions? Study Site The Arcachon Bay (France). Methods At three intertidal levels, we quantified competitive response and effect abilities of the two species through a cross-transplantation removal experiment. We also compared the biomass, root/shoot ratio, productivity and environmental conditions (elevation, salinity, redox potential and soil moisture) of salt marsh communities dominated by the exotic Spartina anglica or the native Spartina maritima at three intertidal levels. Results Both established species showed similar biotic resistance to the invasion of the other species, but the exotic showed important intraspecific facilitation for growth. Species had similar niches and total biomass along a gradient of anoxic conditions, but the exotic had a much higher root/shoot ratio and productivity than the native. Owing to its rhizome density, the exotic showed high ability to increase sediment oxygenation, likely to explain its important intraspecific facilitation. Conclusions Our results showed that the invasion success of S. anglica cannot be explained by the competitive exclusion of the native or by its ability to fill an empty niche along a gradient of anoxia. Its behaviour as a self-facilitator invasive engineer very likely explains its rapid spread in the Bay and biotic resistance to the colonization of other congeneric species when established in dense patches. Additionally, we suggest that physical disturbance in marsh communities dominated by the native S. maritima may disrupt its biotic resistance against the invasion of S. anglica.","[Proenca, Barbara; Poli, Armand; Ciutat, Aurelie; Devaux, Ludovic; Sottolichio, Aldo; de Montaudouin, Xavier; Michalet, Richard] Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, UMR 5805, Talence, France; [Nez, Tanya] No Arizona Univ, SESES, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Michalet, R (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux, EPOC, UMR 5805, Talence, France.",richard.michalet@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Proenca, Barbara/0000-0003-2928-8725","UMR EPOC [""innovative project""]; French National Agency (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-45]; University of Bordeaux","This work was supported by the UMR EPOC [""innovative project""] and from the French National Agency (ANR) in the frame of the Investments for the future Program, within the Cluster of Excellence COTE [ANR-10-LABX-45].

The morphological identification of the ectomycorrhizae often proves to be misleading. For this reason, in order to study the ectomycorrhizal fungi communities, a number of molecular methods that require the isolation of nucleic acids are being used. However, ectomycorrhizal root tips, low mass heterogenic material rich in inhibitors, are a recalcitrant substrate in DNA isolation. It is common for published studies to include some number of unidentified root tips in their results, in spite of diverse isolation protocols being available to researchers. This study aims to analyze the relationship between the collected fungal material and later isolation results, and to propose a DNA isolation protocol specifically optimized for ectomycorrhizal root tips. It was found that the taxonomic position can be used to predict the potential isolation efficiency, with Ascomycota being generally more difficult from which to isolate DNA. After a number of cell lysis and lysate purification methods were evaluated, the joined approach of mechanical and chemical lysis, followed by silica column purification, was found to provide the best results, even with recalcitrant material.","[Janowski, Daniel; Wilgan, Robin; Leski, Tomasz; Karlinski, Leszek; Rudawska, Maria] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland","Janowski, D (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",daniel.janowski@icloud.com; robinwilgan@interia.pl; tleski@man.poznan.pl; leszekk@man.poznan.pl; mariarud@man.poznan.pl,,"Leski, Tomasz/0000-0003-4167-5015; Janowski, Daniel/0000-0002-9929-6969; Karlinski, Leszek/0000-0002-5565-9596; Rudawska, Maria/0000-0002-8103-5269; Wilgan, Robin/0000-0002-3628-5226","Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland; General Directorate of State Forests, Warsaw, Poland [OR. 271.3.17.2017]; National Science Center, Poland [2014/13/B/NZ9/01992]","This study was partially supported by the Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland, by the General Directorate of State Forests, Warsaw, Poland (grant number OR. 271.3.17.2017) and the National Science Center, Poland (grant number 2014/13/B/NZ9/01992).",,27,0,0,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,1-Mar,2019,10,3,,,,,,,218,10.3390/f10030218,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,HT3IU,WOS:000464458300001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Henning, JA; Read, QD; Sanders, NJ; Classen, AT",,,,"Henning, Jeremiah A.; Read, Quentin D.; Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.",,,Fungal colonization of plant roots is resistant to nitrogen addition and resilient to dominant species losses,ECOSPHERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; dark septate endophytes; Festuca thurberi; fungal colonization; Helianthella quinquenervis; plant-plant interactions; plant-soil interaction,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; GRASSLAND; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; REMOVALS; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; METAANALYSIS; PHOSPHORUS,"Global change drivers, such as nitrogen (N) deposition and non-random species extinctions, may shift interactions among aboveground and belowground communities. However, tightly coupled interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms may buffer ecosystems to global change. Here, we test how four years of organic and inorganic N addition and removal of a dominant plant species, Festuca thurberi, independently and interactively influences fungal colonization patterns and performance in a co-dominant plant species, Helianthella quinquenervis. Surprisingly, we found N addition and Festuca removal had no measurable effects on the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) or the performance of Helianthella seedlings grown with field-collected inoculum in a companion greenhouse experiment. However, the proximity of Helianthella to Festuca predicted fungal colonization: DSE colonization decreased by 1% for each cm of distance I lelianthella was from Festuca, although the differences in fungal inoculum potential had no effect on Helianthella seedling survival or biomass. Our results suggest that plant-fungal interactions can be resistant to N addition and resilient to the loss of dominant plant species. Additionally, our results suggest that soil legacies, mediated through surviving symbiont communities or changes in soil properties, can shape ecosystem resistance and resilience to disturbance and perturbations.","[Henning, Jeremiah A.; Read, Quentin D.] Univ Tennessee, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Henning, Jeremiah A.; Read, Quentin D.; Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Henning, Jeremiah A.] Univ Minnesota, Ecol Evolut & Behav, Gortner Lab 140, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Read, Quentin D.] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Environm Program, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Henning, JA (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.; Henning, JA (reprint author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.; Henning, JA (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Ecol Evolut & Behav, Gortner Lab 140, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",jhenning@umn.edu,"Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Henning, Jeremiah/Y-7466-2018","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Henning, Jeremiah/0000-0002-2214-4895","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Tennessee; RMBL Dr Jean Langenheim Fellowship; RMBL Dr Lee R.

The feedbacks and underlying mechanisms of a changed AMF community on sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate ssp. wyomingensis) remain unclear. We assessed how own' versus foreign' AMF impact plant biomass, C transfer to AMF, and decomposition rates.MethodsTo evaluate the impact of different AMF communities on plant biomass and C transfer, sagebrush and cheatgrass were grown in sterilized soil amended with own' or foreign' AMF. Sagebrush plants were labeled with C-13-CO2 to assess changes in allocation of C belowground (C-13-PLFA & NLFA) and decomposition (soil respired C-13-CO2). Community structure and alpha-diversity of AMF were examined in native and cheatgrass-invaded communities.ResultsCheatgrass invasion changed AMF community structure and decreased AMF taxon richness. Sagebrush C transfer and decomposition were not altered, but sagebrush root and cheatgrass shoot production was reduced with foreign' AMF and no AMF, respectively.ConclusionOur results from the greenhouse experiment suggest that sagebrush performance declines with cheatgrass invasion. This may be caused by a disadvantageous AMF community shift, where foreign' AMF received the same amount of C but provided fewer benefits to sagebrush, as shown by decreased root biomass. These findings provide insight into the feedback mechanism that may contribute to decreasing native plant performance upon invasion.","[Dierks, Janina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Grp Sustainable Agroecosyst, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Denef, Karolien] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Cent Instrument Facil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [van Diepen, Linda T.

However, our knowledge of belowground growth and trait responses and associated root foraging strategies, under competition remains limited.MethodsUsing an understory species-addition experiment, we investigated the responses of function-based root (absorptive fine roots [AFRs] vs. transport fine roots [TFRs]) growth, mycorrhizal association, and order-based root traits (morphological, architectural, and chemical traits) of Pinus massoniana (native species) and Pinus elliottii (exotic species), which are the dominant coniferous tree species in subtropical China.ResultsHigher understory-species diversity increased the biomass of AFRs, but not TFRs and total fine roots (AFRs plus TFRs) of both species. Higher diversity increased the biomass ratio of the AFRs and TFRs of P. elliottii, indicating a tradeoff in plant carbon investment between the two functional root modules for P. elliottii. Higher diversity increased the total root length of P. massoniana, but did not affect that of P. elliottii. Increased species diversity decreased the ectomycorrhizal colonization rate of P. massoniana, but increased that of P. elliottii. Increased species diversity altered the branching-related traits (increased branching ratio and intensity), but did not affect the morphological (diameter, specific root length, and root tissue density) or chemical traits across the root orders of either species.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that P. elliottii employed dual root foraging strategies (growth and mycorrhizal strategies) and had a cost-benefit tradeoff between AFR and TFR construction. In comparison, P. massoniana only accelerated root growth under competition. These results facilitate a better understanding of the root foraging strategies of plants and the rapid adaptation of exotic species in novel environments.","[Yan, Han; Kou, Liang; Wang, Huimin; Fu, Xiaoli; Dai, Xiaoqin; Li, Shenggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Qianyanzhou Ecol Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yan, Han; Wang, Huimin; Li, Shenggong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huimin] Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Ecosyst Proc & Informat, Taihe 343725, Peoples R China","Kou, L (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Qianyanzhou Ecol Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",koul@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Li, Sheng-Gong/H-5101-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31730014, 31670635, 31700379]",This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31730014; 31670635; 31700379).

In this study, we aimed to (1) characterise the effect of soil depth, root diameter and soil organisms on root litter decomposition and (2) estimate the contribution of root decomposition to soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux in a tropical rainforest in Malaysian Borneo.MethodsWe incubated soil chambers with fine and coarse root litterbags at varying soil depths. Soil chambers were covered with nets of different mesh sizes, and CO2 efflux was monitored from the top of each soil chamber during the incubation.ResultsOur results showed that coarse roots decomposed faster than fine roots. There was no impact of soil depth, but soil animals and fungi had a significant impact on coarse root decomposition from 398days after the start of the experiment. Soil CO2 efflux increased linearly with C loss from root decomposition, indicating that 40% of the CO2 efflux originates from root litter.ConclusionsThe variation in root decomposition rates suggests the possible role of root litter in soil C storage and emission in a tropical rainforest.","[Ohashi, Mizue; Endo, Izuki] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Katayama, Ayumi; Kume, Tomonori] Kyushu Univ, Kasuya Res Forest, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8112415, Japan; [Matsumoto, Kazuho] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Agr, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Kumagai, Tomo'omi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Kumagai, Tomo'omi] Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Kho, Lip Khoon] Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Trop Peat Res Inst, Biol Res Div, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia","Ohashi, M (reprint author), Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan.",ohashi@shse.u-hyogo.ac.jp,"Kumagai, Tomo'omi/A-4791-2011",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [25304027, 16H02762]","This study was financed in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (Nos. 25304027, 16H02762).",,52,0,0,8,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2019,436,2-Jan,,,,,439,448,,10.1007/s11104-018-03929-3,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HP9RQ,WOS:000462031100028,,,,,10/31/19J,"Reid, ML; Howes, AS; Emery, SM",,,,"Reid, Matthew L.; Howes, Andrea S.; Emery, Sarah M.",,,"Dune soil communities primarily associated with climate factors, not exotic plant presence",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ammophila breviligulata; Climate; Exotic plant invasion; Leymus arenarius; Sand dunes,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; NEMATODE COMMUNITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LEYMUS-ARENARIUS; INVASIVE PLANTS; MATURITY INDEX; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; VEGETATION,"AimsSoil communities are shaped by multiple biotic and environmental components. We assessed the role of multiple factors in shaping soil bacterial and nematode communities in an ongoing plant invasion in western Michigan sand dunes. We aimed to determine which factors were important for structuring soil communities.MethodsWe surveyed seven sites containing the exotic plant, Leymus arenarius, in western Michigan, USA sand dunes. We sampled the plant community and collected soil cores to assess bacterial and nematode communities. We assessed bacterial functional diversity using Biolog Ecoplates. Nematode communities were assessed based on morphological identification.ResultsTemperature was a strong determinant of bacterial functional diversity and community composition. Precipitation and Ammophila density were also correlated with bacterial function composition. Nematode communities were shaped by a combination of temperature, precipitation, Ammophila density, and to a lesser degree soil organic matter and Leymus density. Soil bacteria and bacterivorous nematode assemblages were not significantly associated in their responses to the environment.ConclusionsSoil communities of bacteria and nematodes in this early successional dune system are affected strongly by changes in climatic factors, rather than exotic plant presence.","[Reid, Matthew L.; Howes, Andrea S.; Emery, Sarah M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, 139 Life Sci Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Reid, Matthew L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, Plant & Soil Sci Bldg,1066 Bogue St,Room A286, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Reid, ML (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, Plant & Soil Sci Bldg,1066 Bogue St,Room A286, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",reidmat1@msu.edu,,,Garden Club of America Fellowship in Ecological Restoration; Graduate Student Council; Biology Graduate Student Association; College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Louisville,"Funding for this project was provided by the Garden Club of America Fellowship in Ecological Restoration.

Hydroponic assays showed that plants inoculated with V15bnifA(+) and PMI6nodD(+) started developing nodules earlier than those inoculated with the corresponding control strains. In addition, the number of nodules was always higher in plants inoculated with the strains overexpressing the symbiotic genes. Analysis of histological sections of nodules formed by V15bnifA(+) showed a more developed fixation zone when compared with control. On the other hand, nodules induced by PMI6nodD(+) did not show a senescent zone, which was observed in nodules from plants inoculated with the control strain. Plants inoculated with PMI6nodD(+) and ST2nodD(+) showed a higher number of infection threads than the corresponding control inoculations.ConclusionThese results indicate that overexpressing nifA and nodD may be an important tool to achieve the improvement of the symbiotic performance of mesorhizobia.","[da-Silva, Jose Rodrigo; Menendez, Esther; Eliziario, Fernando; Alexandre, Ana; Oliveira, Solange] Univ Evora, IIFA, ICAAM, Lab Microbiol Solo, Apartado 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal; [Mateos, Pedro F.] Univ Salamanca, Ctr Hispano Luso Invest Agr, Unidad Asociada, CSIC,USAL,Dept Microbiol & Genet, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Alexandre, A (reprint author), Univ Evora, IIFA, ICAAM, Lab Microbiol Solo, Apartado 94, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",anaalex@uevora.pt,,"da Silva, Jose Rodrigo/0000-0002-3166-4454","FEDER Funds through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [UID/AGR/00115/2013, FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-028316 (PTDC/BIA-EVF/4158/2012), POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016810 (PTDC/AGR-PRO/2978/2014)]; InAlentejo [ALENT-07-0262-FEDER-001871]; CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)CAPES [1254-13-8]","This work was financed by FEDER Funds through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE and National Funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), under the Strategic Project UID/AGR/00115/2013, Project no FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-028316 (PTDC/BIA-EVF/4158/2012), Project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016810 (PTDC/AGR-PRO/2978/2014) and InAlentejo ALENT-07-0262-FEDER-001871.

However, its measurement in the field remains a challenge, especially non-invasively and repeatedly. Here, we developed a new method that uses ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to quantify root zone soil moisture.MethodsCoarse roots were chosen as reflectors to collect GPR radargrams. An automatic hyperbola detection algorithm identified coarse root reflections in GPR radargrams and determined the velocity of GPR wave, which then was used to calculate the average soil water content of a soil profile (ASWC) and soil water content in a depth interval (ISWC). In total, GPR reflection data of 55 root samples from three computer simulation scenarios and two field experiments in sandy shrubland, one burying roots at known depths and the other under the undisturbed condition, were used to evaluate the proposed method.ResultsBoth the simulated and the field collected data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for measuring root zone soil moisture with high accuracy. Even in the two field experiments, the root-mean-square errors of the estimated ASWC and ISWC relative to measurements from soil cores were as low as 0.003 and 0.012m(3)m(-3), respectively.ConclusionThe proposed method offers a new way of quantifying root zone soil moisture non-invasively that allows repeated measurements. This study expands the application of GPR in root and soil study and enhances our ability to monitor plant-soil-water interactions.","[Liu, Xinbo; Cui, Xihong; Chen, Jin; Li, Wentao; Cao, Xin; Chen, Xuehong; Liu, Qixin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinbo; Cui, Xihong; Chen, Jin; Li, Wentao; Cao, Xin; Chen, Xuehong; Liu, Qixin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Global Land Remote Sensing P, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Guo, Li; Lin, Henry] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Yang, Dedi] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Cui, XH (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Global Land Remote Sensing P, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cuixihong@bnu.edu.cn,"Guo, Li/B-7820-2016; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; Cao, Xin/P-3814-2014","Guo, Li/0000-0003-3821-4058; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571404]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41571404) on project of State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology.,,53,2,2,14,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2019,436,2-Jan,,,,,623,639,,10.1007/s11104-018-03919-5,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HP9RQ,WOS:000462031100040,,,,,10/31/19J,"Forstner, SJ; Wechselberger, V; Muller, S; Keibinger, KM; Diaz-Pines, E; Wanek, W; Scheppi, P; Hagedorn, F; Gundersen, P; Tatzber, M; Gerzabek, MH; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, S",,,,"Forstner, Stefan J.; Wechselberger, Viktoria; Mueller, Stefanie; Keibinger, Katharina M.; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio; Wanek, Wolfgang; Scheppi, Patrick; Hagedorn, Frank; Gundersen, Per; Tatzber, Michael; Gerzabek, Martin H.; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie",,,Vertical Redistribution of Soil Organic Carbon Pools After Twenty Years of Nitrogen Addition in Two Temperate Coniferous Forests,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon sequestration; carbon mineralization; nitrogen deposition; nitrogen saturation; fine roots; exchangeable cations; soil carbon; soil pH; Norway spruce,LONG-TERM; N-DEPOSITION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; DECOMPOSING LITTER; GLOBAL PATTERNS; HARVARD FOREST; ROOT DYNAMICS; SPRUCE FOREST; BASE CATIONS; FINE ROOTS,"Nitrogen (N) inputs from atmospheric deposition can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in temperate and boreal forests, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on global climate. However, direct evidence of N-induced SOC sequestration from low-dose, long-term N addition experiments (that is, addition of<50kgNha(-1)y(-1) for>10years) is scarce worldwide and virtually absent for European temperate forests. Here, we examine how tree growth, fine roots, physicochemical soil properties as well as pools of SOC and soil total N responded to 20years of regular, low-dose N addition in two European coniferous forests in Switzerland and Denmark. At the Swiss site, the addition of 22kgNha(-1)y(-1) (or 1.3 times throughfall deposition) stimulated tree growth, but decreased soil pH and exchangeable calcium. At the Danish site, the addition of 35kgNha(-1)y(-1) (1.5 times throughfall deposition) impaired tree growth, increased fine root biomass and led to an accumulation of N in several belowground pools. At both sites, elevated N inputs increased SOC pools in the moderately decomposed organic horizons, but decreased them in the mineral topsoil. Hence, long-term N addition led to a vertical redistribution of SOC pools, whereas overall SOC storage within 30cm depth was unaffected. Our results imply that an N-induced shift of SOC from older, mineral-associated pools to younger, unprotected pools might foster the vulnerability of SOC in temperate coniferous forest soils.","[Forstner, Stefan J.; Wechselberger, Viktoria; Mueller, Stefanie; Keibinger, Katharina M.; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio; Tatzber, Michael; Gerzabek, Martin H.; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Soil Res, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Wanek, Wolfgang] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Scheppi, Patrick; Hagedorn, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Gundersen, Per] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Tatzber, Michael] Austrian Agcy Hlth & Food Safety AGES, Dept Radiat Protect & Radiochem, Div Radiat Protect, A-1220 Vienna, Austria","Forstner, SJ (reprint author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Soil Res, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",stefan.forstner@boku.ac.at,"Schleppi, Patrick/E-6751-2011; Gerzabek, Martin/AAA-8806-2019; Wanek, Wolfgang/E-7001-2012; Gundersen, Per/B-2192-2008; Keiblinger, Katharina M./J-1930-2016","Schleppi, Patrick/0000-0002-3578-6563; Wanek, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2178-8258; Gundersen, Per/0000-0002-9199-4033; Gerzabek, Martin/0000-0002-3307-8416; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio/0000-0001-9935-106X; Keiblinger, Katharina M./0000-0003-4668-3866",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 25438],This study was funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF; Project Number P 25438).,,127,1,1,7,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,MAR,2019,22,2,,,,,379,400,,10.1007/s10021-018-0275-8,,,22,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HP3DK,WOS:000461556000011,30956544,"Green Published, Other Gold",,,10/31/19J,"Scott, TW; Kiers, ET; Cooper, GA; dos Santos, M; West, SA",,,,"Scott, Thomas W.; Kiers, E.

In striking contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi appear to maintain genomic variation within an individual fungal network. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dwell in the soil, form mutualistic networks with plants, and bear multiple, potentially genetically diverse nuclei within a network. We explore, from a theoretical perspective, why such genetic diversity might be maintained within individuals. We consider selection acting within and between individual fungal networks. We show that genetic diversity could provide a benefit at the level of the individual, by improving growth in variable environments, and that this can stabilize genetic diversity even in the presence of nuclear conflict. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi complicate our understanding of organismality, but our findings offer a way of understanding such biological anomalies.","[Scott, Thomas W.; Cooper, Guy A.; dos Santos, Miguel; West, Stuart A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Kiers, E.

In addition, we evaluated the effects of plant life form, soil depth, and experiment duration on the responses of fine roots to precipitation changes. Our results confirmed that decreased precipitation limited fine root diameter and accelerated turnover. Increased precipitation stimulated fine root elongation and enhanced the fine root accumulation. The responses of fine roots to precipitation changes varied among plants of different life forms. Tree fine root production and decomposition and non-tree fine root diameter varied most strongly under decreased precipitation. Specific root length of non-tree fine roots was much higher than that of tree fine roots under increased precipitation. Decreased precipitation limited the growth of fine roots in 20-40 cm deep soil, whereas increased precipitation promoted the growth of fine roots in both shallow and deep soil layers. The responses of fine roots to decreased precipitation were affected by experiment duration. Results filled the gap of evaluation data on the effect of precipitation change on fine root morphology and dynamics, which are useful for better predicting the C cycle under precipitation change.","[Zhang, Xin; Xing, Yajuan; Yan, Guoyong; Wang, Qinggui] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Han, Shijie] Henan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China","Wang, QG (reprint author), Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",qgwang1970@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41330530, 41773075, 41575137, 31370494, 31170421]","This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41330530, 41773075, 41575137, 31370494, and 31170421).",,60,3,3,29,50,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",Aug-71,1918-1841,,CAN J SOIL SCI,Can.

However, the effect of acid rain on soil respiration rarely received attention, especially in ecosystems with different buffering capacities to acid rain. Thus, we explored how the response of soil respiration to simulated acid rain (SAR) in Cunninghamia lanceolata and Michelia macclurei plantations, which had great difference in the buffering capacities of their litter layers to acid rain.Materials and methodsThe field experiment was subjected to a split-block experiment, with four main blocks in each plantation. Each block was split into A1 (SAR treatment, pH=3) and A0 (deionized water, pH=6.6) plots. Each plot was separated into subplots with (L0) and without (L1) litter treatments. SAR and deionized water were applied twice a month to A1 and A0 plots, respectively. From June 2016 to June 2017, soil respiration was measured twice per month using Li-8100 infrared gas analyzer. Soil temperature and moisture at a 5-cm depth were monitored using temperature and moisture sensors connected to Li-8100 during the measurement of soil respiration.Results and discussionThe result showed that SAR did not significantly influence soil respiration neither in C. lanceolate nor in M. macclurei plantations. However, the reasons for this result were probably different in the two plantations. The unchanged soil respiration in C. lanceolata plantation was mainly attributed to the negligible effect of SAR on fine root biomass and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in C. lanceolata plantation because of the acclimation of fine root and microorganism to acid soil environment. In addition, the increase in fine root biomass and decrease in MBC may have resulted in the absence of the influence of SAR on soil respiration in M. macclurei plantation, because the variation of soil respiration derived from fine root under SAR may have offset that derived from microorganism.ConclusionsAlthough C. lanceolata and M. macclurei plantations had different buffering capacities to SAR, SAR did not significantly affect soil respiration in both plantations after 1year of SAR treatment. Therefore, the long-term effect of SAR on soil respiration should be considered, particularly in forest types with different buffering capacities to acid rain.","[Zheng, Wenhui; Li, Renshan; Yang, Qingpeng; Zhang, Weidong; Wang, Silong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Wenhui; Li, Renshan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qingpeng; Zhang, Weidong; Huang, Ke; Guan, Xin; Wang, Silong] Huitong Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China","Yang, QP; Wang, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Yang, QP; Wang, SL (reprint author), Huitong Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China.",yqp226@gmail.com; slwang@iae.ac.cn,"Yang, qingpeng/B-3632-2014","Yang, qingpeng/0000-0003-2471-6233","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41630755, 31570402]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600204]; Hunan Province Science and Technology Program [2017TP1040]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41630755 and 31570402), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 2016YFD0600204), and Hunan Province Science and Technology Program (Grant No. 2017TP1040).",,62,0,0,7,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

A better understanding of the effect of vegetation types on the soil infiltration capacity is important for the sustainable development of vegetation restoration. The aim of this study was to establish a soil infiltration capacity index (SIC) and to analyze the mechanism influencing variations in the soil infiltration capacity after vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau.Materials and methodsEight vegetation types (community dominated by Artemisia scoparia, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii + S. bungeana, A. gmelinii + Stipa grandis, A. gmelinii + Artemisia giraldii, Sophora viciifolia, Caragana korshinskii, and Robinia pseudoacacia) and bare land as the control were selected for this study. The SIC was established by a steady infiltration rate (SR, 50-60min) and stage I average infiltration rate (ARSI, 0-5min) according to principal component analysis (PCA). Path analysis was used to investigate how the soil properties and plant fine root affected the soil infiltration capacity.Results and discussionThe SIC values of the eight vegetation types were all higher than that of the bare land. The R. pseudoacacia community had the highest SIC value (0.43), followed by the A. scoparia community (0.30) while the bare land (-0.56) had the lowest value. Path analysis showed that the increase in the fractal dimension and non-capillary porosity of soil particles enhanced the SIC directly. Increases in the clay content increased the SIC by affecting the fractal dimension of soil particles, while increases in the fine root density reduced the SIC by affecting the non-capillary porosity. Plant functional groups (grasses and legumes) affected SIC indirectly via non-capillary porosity and plant root.ConclusionsA comprehensive index, the SIC, was established to describe the soil infiltration capacity by the PCA method. Based on a comparison with bare land, vegetation restoration enhanced the soil infiltration capacity. The R. pseudoacacia community was the most effective at improving the soil infiltration capacity. The improvement in infiltration was closely related to direct increases in the soil non-capillary porosity and soil particle fractal dimension.","[Tang, Bingzhe; Jiao, Juying; Yan, Fangchen; Li, Hang] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dry Land Farming Loess, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Juying] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Jiao, JY (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dry Land Farming Loess, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Jiao, JY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jyjiao@ms.iswc.ac.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0501604]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41771319, 41371280]",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0501604) and the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41771319 and 41371280).,,51,3,3,14,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

Understanding the responses of belowground communities to fire is key to predicting changes in the ecosystem processes they regulate. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 1634 observations from 131 empirical studies to investigate the effect of fire on soil microorganisms and mesofauna. Fire had a strong negative effect on soil biota biomass, abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity. Fire reduced microorganism biomass and abundance by up to 96%. Bacteria were more resistant to fire than fungi. Fire reduced nematode abundance by 88% but had no significant effect on soil arthropods. Fire reduced richness, evenness and diversity of soil microorganisms and mesofauna by up to 99%. We found little evidence of temporal trends towards recovery within 10 years post-disturbance suggesting little resilience of the soil community to fire. Interactions between biome, fire type, and depth explained few of these negative trends. Future research at the intersection of fire ecology and soil biology should aim to integrate soil community structure with the ecosystem processes they mediate under changing global fire regimes.","[Pressler, Yamina; Moore, John C.; Cotrufo, M.

Here, we focus on nitrogen and ask whether plant community nitrogen uptake rate is determined (a) by nitrogen availability alone or (b) by the product of nitrogen availability and fine-root mass. Surprisingly, this is not empirically resolved. We performed controlled microcosm experiments and reanalyzed published pot experiments and field data to determine the relationship between community-level nitrogen uptake rate, nitrogen availability, and fine-root mass for 46 unique combinations of species, nitrogen levels, and growing conditions. We found that plant community nitrogen uptake rate was unaffected by fine-root mass in 63% of cases and saturated with fine-root mass in 29% of cases (92% in total). In contrast, plant community nitrogen uptake rate was clearly affected by nitrogen availability. The results support the idea that although plants may over-proliferate fine roots for individual-level competition, it comes without an increase in community-level nitrogen uptake. The results have implications for the mechanisms included in coupled carbon-nitrogen terrestrial biosphere models (CN-TBMs) and are consistent with CN-TBMs that operate above the individual scale and omit fine-root mass in equations of nitrogen uptake rate but inconsistent with the majority of CN-TBMs, which operate above the individual scale and include fine-root mass in equations of nitrogen uptake rate. For the much smaller number of CN-TBMs that explicitly model individual-based belowground competition for nitrogen, the results suggest that the relative (not absolute) fine-root mass of competing individuals should be included in the equations that determine individual-level nitrogen uptake rates. By providing empirical data to support the assumptions used in CN-TBMs, we put their global climate change predictions on firmer ground.","[Dybzinski, Ray; Kelvakis, Angelo; McCabe, John; Panock, Samantha; Anuchitlertchon, Kanyarak; Vasarhelyi, Leah] Loyola Univ, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [McCormack, M.

So how do seagrasses persist in this environment? Here, we propose that radial oxygen loss (ROL) from actively growing root tips protects seagrasses from sulphide intrusion not only by abiotically oxidising sulphides in the rhizosphere of young roots, but also by influencing the abundance and spatial distribution of sulphate-reducing and sulphide-oxidising bacteria. We used a novel multifaceted approach combining imaging techniques (confocal fluorescence in situ hybridisation, oxygen planar optodes, and sulphide diffusive gradients in thin films) with microbial community profiling to build a complete picture of the microenvironment of growing roots of the seagrasses Halophila ovalis and Zostera muelleri. ROL was restricted to young root tips, indicating that seagrasses will have limited ability to influence sulphide oxidation in bulk sediments. On the microscale, however, ROL corresponded with decreased abundance of potential sulphate-reducing bacteria and decreased sulphide concentrations in the rhizosphere surrounding young roots. Furthermore, roots leaking oxygen had a higher abundance of sulphide-oxidising cable bacteria; which is the first direct observation of these bacteria on seagrass roots. Thus, ROL may enhance both abiotic and bacterial sulphide oxidation and restrict bacterial sulphide production around vulnerable roots, thereby helping seagrasses to colonise sulphide-rich anoxic sediments.","[Martin, Belinda C.; Olsen, Ylva S.; Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Martin, Belinda C.; Olsen, Ylva S.; Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bougoure, Jeremy; Colmer, Timothy D.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Ryan, Megan H.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bennett, William W.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia; [Martin, Belinda C.; Joyce, Natalie K.] Ooid Sci Graph & Editing, White Gum Valley, WA 6163, Australia","Martin, BC (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Martin, BC (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Martin, BC (reprint author), Ooid Sci Graph & Editing, White Gum Valley, WA 6163, Australia.",belinda.martin@research.uwa.edu.au,"Olsen, Ylva S/B-7445-2013; Kendrick, Gary Andrew/B-3460-2011; Ryan, Megan/A-4009-2010; Bennett, William/D-1250-2011; Colmer, Timothy/A-9994-2011; Martin, Belinda/D-2031-2015","Olsen, Ylva S/0000-0003-4498-7057; Kendrick, Gary Andrew/0000-0002-0276-6064; Ryan, Megan/0000-0003-0749-0199; Bennett, William/0000-0002-8126-4555; Colmer, Timothy/0000-0002-3383-9596; Martin, Belinda/0000-0002-0354-2628","Graduate Women WA; ARCFondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le CancerAustralian Research Council [FT140100103, LP130100918, LP130100155, DE140100056]","Thanks to Morten Larsen and Adam Kessler for their advice in building and optimising the oxygen-optode system and Hannes Schmidt for advice in FISH protocols, as well as PWIS and the PP for many fruitful discussions.

Late successional plants have been shown to be more responsive to AM fungi and more sensitive to AM fungal species identity, which could generate positive feedback and potentially accelerate succession. We test the effect of AM fungi on plant diversity and on frequency dependence predicted by positive plant-AM fungi feedback across a successional gradient. We created prairie mesocosms comprised of a majority of early successional, equal abundance, and a majority of late successional plant species. We inoculated these mesocosms and a field restoration experiment with 14 different communities of AM fungi from late successional prairies that varied in levels of species richness. Overall, we found that AM fungi increased plant diversity and this was driven by the response of late successional plant species to mycorrhizae. Our results indicate that AM fungal composition is more important than AM fungal diversity per se. We found that the effect of inoculation with a single species or groups of AM fungi depended on whether those fungi benefited late successional plant species. Early successional plants consistently exhibited negative frequency-dependent growth regardless of fungal composition, while late successional plants demonstrated positive frequency-dependent growth in our mesocosms-but only in the presence of beneficial AM fungal species. These results are consistent with positive plant-mycorrhizal feedbacks accelerating plant community successional trajectories once late successional plants establish. Mesocosm results were mirrored with field inoculation assays where we found that beneficial AM fungi facilitated late successional plant establishment. Synthesis. Our results provide support for beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi being a primary mechanism for positive plant-soil feedback driving plant community succession, as late successional seedlings grew faster and larger when their neighbours were also late successional plant species when they were associated with beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We found that this positive feedback thereby accelerated succession in mesocosms and in the field.","[Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Koziol, L (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",lizkoziol@ku.edu,,,"Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0919434, 1050237, 1556664]; U.S. Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [RC-2330]; National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-67011-25166]; Indiana University Bloomington; The Land Institute","Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 0919434, 1050237 and 1556664; The Land Institute; U.S. Department of Defense, Grant/Award Number: RC-2330; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 2016-67011-25166; Indiana University Bloomington",,56,5,5,8,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

But while the term ""shrub expansion"" often implicitly refers to an increase in tall, deciduous species such as birch and willow, several studies have also found a strong increase in evergreen dwarf shrubs in response to warming, a fact which has received far less attention. The effects of an evergreen dwarf shrub expansion are markedly different from the effects of an increase in taller, deciduous species. While deciduous shrubs may increase carbon (C) cycling through changes in albedo, litter input, and snow depth, the low stature of evergreen dwarf shrubs means that they are unlikely to influence snow cover. They also produce more recalcitrant litter, which reduces microbial activity. Furthermore, recent research suggests that ericoid mycorrhiza associated with evergreen shrubs may help to decelerate litter and soil organic matter turnover rates through the production of melanized hyphae that resist decomposition. Through selective browsing, herbivores may promote evergreen shrubs and facilitate C storage. Synthesis. In this mini review, we argue that basing predictions of how shrub expansion will affect tundra ecosystems on characteristics only applicable to tall deciduous shrubs hampers our understanding of the complex feedbacks related to Arctic vegetation shifts.","[Vowles, Tage; Bjork, Robert G.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bjork, Robert G.] Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Gothenburg, Sweden","Bjork, RG (reprint author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Bjork, RG (reprint author), Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Gothenburg, Sweden.",robert.bjork@gu.se,"Bjork, Robert G./I-9772-2019","Bjork, Robert G./0000-0001-7346-666X","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas [214-2010-1411, 621-2014-5315]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, Grant/Award Number: 214-2010-1411 and 621-2014-5315; Swedish Research Council; the Strategic Research Area BECC (Biodiversity And Ecosystems In A Changing Climate)",,48,1,1,13,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Vegetation type, spatial distance, and environmental variability represent the three main factors shaping the structure of Glomeromycotinan communities. We present here one of the most comprehensive reports on Glomeromycotinan community structure in forest ecosystems, covering five ecosystem types. We explored the extent to which the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity is confounded by the respective latitudinal gradient of host plants and how Glomeromycotinan communities diverge with spatial distance and environmental variability. We show that latitudinal differences in Glomeromycotinan alpha- and beta-diversity are largely shaped by the zonation patterns of ecosystem types and that differences among Glomeromycotinan communities occurring in different ecosystems are considerably larger than those occurring within the same ecosystem type. In contrast, we could observe little to no differences in phylogenetic community structure across samples, irrespective of their origin. In conclusion, several community assembly rules for Glomeromycotina in the woody systems, such as phylogenetic relationships, differed from those in grassland systems. Synthesis. We provide strong evidence that the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity in woody systems is mainly driven by latitudinal differences in forest habitat types. Further exploring the causes of these differences across habitat types would probably reveal underexplored facets of the ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","[Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Liu, Lei; Xu, Tianle; Wang, Meie; Wang, Juntao; Chen, Yongliang; Hu, Yajun; Hao, Zhipeng; Chen, Baodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Baodong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yongliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha, Peoples R China","Chen, BD (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Chen, BD (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bdchen@rcees.ac.cn,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Chen, Baodong/A-7707-2009; Lei, Liu/J-7929-2017; Veresoglou, Stavros D/D-5087-2011","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Chen, Baodong/0000-0002-1790-7800; Lei, Liu/0000-0002-8063-610X; Veresoglou, Stavros D/0000-0001-6387-4109","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Ministry of Science and Technology, P.R.

Below-ground plant traits may mediate ecosystem response to permafrost thaw and associated feedbacks to the atmosphere by differentially conferring access to deep, newly thawed permafrost N. Yet, identifying roots and quantifying root N uptake from deep, cold soils in complex plant communities has proved challenging to date. We investigated plant acquisition of experimentally added N-15 isotope tracer applied at the permafrost boundary in graminoid- and shrub-dominated tundra at Eight Mile Lake, Alaska, when the thaw front was close to its maximum depth, simulating the release of newly thawed permafrost N. We used molecular tools to verify species and estimate biomass, nitrogen, and isotope pools. Root biomass depth distributions follow an asymptotic relationship with depth, typical of other ecosystems. Few species had roots occurring close to the thaw front. Rubus chamaemorus, a short-statured non-mycorrhizal forb, and Carex bigelowii, a sedge, consistently had the deepest roots. Twenty-four hours after isotope addition, we observed that deep-rooted, non-mycorrhizal species had the highest N-15 enrichment values in their fine root tissue indicating that they access deep N late in the growing season when the thaw front is deepest. Deep-rooted plants are therefore able to immediately take up newly thawed permafrost-derived N. During the following growing season, herbaceous, non-mycorrhizal plants allocated tracer above-ground before woody, mycorrhizal plants. Ectomycorrhizal deciduous and ericoid mycorrhizal evergreen shrubs, by contrast, did not have immediate access to the deep N tracer and assimilated it into new foliar tissue gradually over the following growing season. Synthesis. Graminoids and forbs that have immediate access to deep N represent a modest C sink compared to C emissions from thawing permafrost. However, the effects of deep N fertilization on shrubs over longer time-scales may stimulate productivity and account for a more considerable N and C sink, thus constraining the permafrost C-climate feedback.","[Hewitt, Rebecca E.; Mack, Michelle C.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Taylor, D.

For microbes that are plant symbionts, community assembly processes can lead to either a positive or negative relationship between plant size or age and soil microbe diversity. Here, we evaluated the extent to which such relationships exist within a single legume species (Acacia acuminata) and their naturally occurring symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata trees of variable size spanning a large environmental gradient in southwest Australia (72 trees in 24 sites spread across similar to 300,000 km(2)), using metabarcoding. We modelled rhizobia diversity using 16S exact genetic variants, in a binomial multivariate statistical framework that controlled for climate and local soil characteristics. We identified two major phylogenetic clades of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata. Soil sampled at the base of larger Acacia trees contained a higher richness of rhizobia genetic variants. Each major clade responds differently to environmental factors (climate and soil characteristics), but the positive association between tree size and rhizobia genetic diversity was mainly driven by responses from one of the two clades. Overall tree size explained more variation than any other factor, resulting in a similar to 3-fold increase in total richness and clade diversity from the smallest to the largest trees. Synthesis. Previous studies have shown that plant host species is important in structuring microbial soil communities in the rhizosphere. Our results show that host size or age within a single plant species can also structure diversity of at least one group of soil microbes. A positive relationship between plant host size and rhizobia diversity suggests that hosts may modify the niche space of their surrounding soil (niche construction hypothesis) enabling a higher richness of microbial taxa. That different rhizobial groups responded differently to host size and other ecological factors suggests that rhizobia is not an ecologically uniform group, and that entirely neutral explanations for our results are unlikely. Host plants may be analogous to ""islands,"" where larger plant hosts may accumulate diversity over time, through migration opportunities.","[Dinnage, Russell; Cardillo, Marcel] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Macroevolut & Macroecol Grp, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Simonsen, Anna K.] CSIRO, Land & Water, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Simonsen, Anna K.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO, Agr & Food, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Raisbeck-Brown, Nat; Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO, Land & Water, Wembley, WA, Australia","Simonsen, AK (reprint author), CSIRO, Land & Water, Acton, ACT, Australia.; Simonsen, AK (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",anna.simonsen@anu.edu.au,"Dinnage, Russell/L-9892-2013; Cardillo, Marcel/C-9396-2009","Dinnage, Russell/0000-0003-0846-2819; Cardillo, Marcel/0000-0001-9855-0817",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110103168]; Office of the Chief Executive Postdoctoral Fellowship; Centre for Biodiversity Analysis Ignition Grant,"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP110103168; Office of the Chief Executive Postdoctoral Fellowship; Centre for Biodiversity Analysis Ignition Grant",,59,4,4,16,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, which abiotic factors predominantly contribute to soil P transformations and how plant roots affect soil P variations after N addition in these ecosystems are unclear. To address these issues, we studied a natural Castanopsis carlesii forest in Fujian, China subjected to 3 years of N addition. Soil P fractions, soil properties, iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides, root biomass (RB), and root length density (RLD) were investigated. The results showed that N application remarkably increased the concentrations of soil available P but significantly decreased content of soil moderately labile P. The quantities of free Fe and Al (Fe-d and Al-d) and organic-bound Fe and Al (Fe-p and Al-p) decreased after N addition. These changes indicated an important relationship between Fe and Al oxides and P fractions, especially Fe-p and moderately labile P, suggesting that Fe and Al oxides predominantly influenced soil P fractions in N-enriched plots. Meanwhile, RB and RLD were higher after N addition treatments than control treatment. Positive correlations between RB and RLD and P fractions (available P, labile P, and moderately labile P) indicated that plant roots exert an essential influence on changes in soil P fractions. In conclusion, N addition in subtropical forests significantly influenced soil P fractions, primarily by decreasing Fe and Al oxides and increasing plant root biomass and density.","[Fan, Yuexin; Zhong, Xiaojian; Lin, Fang; Yang, Liuming; Wang, Minhuang; Chen, Guangshui; Chen, Yuehmin; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yuexin; Zhong, Xiaojian; Lin, Fang; Yang, Liuming; Wang, Minhuang; Chen, Guangshui; Chen, Yuehmin; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Funded Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov, State Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chenchung] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Ilan 260, Taiwan; [Chen, Yuehmin; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Inst Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China","Chen, Y; Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.",ymchen@fjnu.edu.cn; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [U1505233, 31670620, 31700545, 41401555]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954003]","The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no.

The upscaling of single root fluxes to whole root systems is commonly based on the assumption of regularly distributed and parallel aligned roots. To provide more accurate solutions for randomly distributed roots, the point to root distance probability density function (PDF) is transformed to an equivalent cylinder size PDF (f(C)), which is used for upscaling steady-state and steady-rate cylindrical root models while simple analytical solutions are derived. The regular root distribution assumption leads to large overestimations (similar to 50%) of root water uptake for randomly distributed roots. Several numerical comparisons with simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Richards equation for five different soil textures and five root densities show the good performance of the derived solutions under both limiting and non-limiting soil hydraulic conditions. Moreover, an explicit analytical solution is given for negative-binomial clustered roots. Under this specific assumption, the solution can be transformed to an equivalent random solution with a modified root length density. Simulation of root water uptake of different 2D root maps generated by a Poisson cluster process shows the effectiveness of the derived approximation for clustered roots.","[Graefe, Jan; Bitterlich, Michael] Leibniz Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Theodor Echtermeyer Weg 1, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany; [Pruefert, Uwe] Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg, Akad Str 6, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany","Graefe, J (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Theodor Echtermeyer Weg 1, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany.",graefe@igzev.de,,"Prufert, Uwe/0000-0001-5150-9008",,,,32,0,0,0,0,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1539-1663,,,VADOSE ZONE J,Vadose Zone J.,28-Feb,2019,18,1,,,,,,,180127,10.2136/vzj2018.06.0127,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Soil Science; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,HN2MG,WOS:000460018700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Uri, V; Kukumagi, M; Aosaar, J; Varik, M; Becker, H; Aun, K; Krasnova, A; Morozov, G; Ostonen, I; Mander, U; Lohmus, K; Rosenvald, K; Kriiska, K; Soosaar, K",,,,"Uri, Veiko; Kukumagi, Mai; Aosaar, Jurgen; Varik, Mats; Becker, Hardo; Aun, Kristiina; Krasnova, Alisa; Morozov, Gunnar; Ostonen, Ivika; Mander, Ulo; Lohmus, Krista; Rosenvald, Katrin; Kriiska, Kaie; Soosaar, Kaido",,,The carbon balance of a six-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) ecosystem estimated by different methods,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon balance; Scots pine; Eddy covariance; Net ecosystem exchange; Net ecosystem productivity; Soil respiration,FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; SOIL CO2 EFFLUX; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; FOREST SOILS; NITROGEN ACCUMULATION; TEMPERATE FOREST; MANAGED FORESTS; TRACE GASES; RESPIRATION; EXCHANGE,"Clear-cutting is a conventional method of forest management which significantly changes carbon (C) cycling at the ecosystem level for a long time. Estimation of the interim period during which the ecosystem turns from a C source to a C sink is crucial for clarifying the environmental effects of management on forest C cycling. The current study provided new knowledge of C cycling in young pine stand and demonstrated the recovery of C sequestration of the forest ecosystem during the post harvesting period. We estimated the C balance in a 6-year-old Scots pine stand by using two different methods: carbon budgeting, for estimating annual net ecosystem production (NEP), and eddy covariance (EC), for estimating net ecosystem exchange (NEE). For C budgeting, the above- and belowground biomass production of the ecosystem, as well as the soil heterotrophic respiration efflux at the studied site was estimated. Annual NEE at the studied young forest ecosystem was 1.19 +/- 0.36 t C ha(-1), gross primary ecosystem production was 9.87 and total ecosystem respiration was 11.06 t C ha(-1). Estimated NEE was in good accordance with the results of NEP (1.37 t C ha(-1)), which confirms the relevance of the C budgeting method. Increased annual woody biomass production is the main factor which induced the young Scots pine ecosystem to act as a C sink: annual C accumulation in tree biomass in a 6-year-old stand was 1.0 t C ha but reached already 2.4 t C ha(-1) in the following year. Assuming that the annual Rh flux is of the same magnitude in the subsequent years, the ecosystem will become a C sink already during a short period after clear-cut. Annual soil respiration (R-h) and heterotrophic soil respiration (R-h) were 6.0 and 4.2 t C ha(-1), respectively and the R-h/R-s ratio was 0.70. However, at this stage also the understorey vegetation contributed essentially to NEP, making up 56% of the annual C uptake accumulated in the plants. The methane flux and the leached C flux were negligible, 0.004 and 0.015 t C ha(-1)yr(-1), respectively. Our results demonstrate that well regenerated young Scots pine stand on a former clear-cut area will be able to turn into a C sequestering ecosystem already before ten years after cutting.","[Uri, Veiko; Aosaar, Jurgen; Varik, Mats; Becker, Hardo; Aun, Kristiina; Krasnova, Alisa; Morozov, Gunnar] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Kukumagi, Mai; Krasnova, Alisa; Ostonen, Ivika; Mander, Ulo; Lohmus, Krista; Rosenvald, Katrin; Kriiska, Kaie; Soosaar, Kaido] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Vanemuise 46, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Uri, V (reprint author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",veiko.uri@emu.ee,"Kukumagi, Mai/F-1121-2017; Rosenvald, Katrin/F-7501-2017; Morozov, Gunnar/Y-8660-2019; Aosaar, Jurgen/E-7948-2017; Ostonen, Ivika/G-9874-2015","Kukumagi, Mai/0000-0002-2313-148X; Rosenvald, Katrin/0000-0001-7392-3867; Morozov, Gunnar/0000-0002-9442-9929; Aosaar, Jurgen/0000-0002-7711-2014; Uri, Veiko/0000-0002-1774-4079; Ostonen, Ivika/0000-0001-9043-6083","project of the Estonian Forest Management Centre [1-18/271]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT21-04, IUT34-9, IUT2-16]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange, Estonia); project of Environmental Investment Centre [11660]","This study was supported by the project of the Estonian Forest Management Centre 1-18/271 ""Effect of clearcut and thinning on forest carbon cycling"" and by the Institutional Research Funding IUT21-04, IUT34-9 and IUT2-16 of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research, as well as by the project of Environmental Investment Centre No. 11660 and European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange, Estonia).",,77,3,3,11,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Therefore, they could represent an important habitat remnant to support the survival of species. We measured the impact of forest plantations on biodiversity with a focus on eight groups of biota including saproxylic and ground mycorrhizal fungi, lichens, herbs together with shrubs, tree seedlings, aculeate hymenopterans, beetles and birds, in patches with formerly continuous vegetation dominated by native oak and in patches in spruce plantations (reflecting spatiotemporal discontinuity) in the East-Bohemian woodlands of the Czech Republic. We found that species richness and numbers of obligate species were higher in native than in normative forests, but there was no significant difference in red-listed species. Nevertheless, the species of three of the eight studied groups profited from increasing proportion of spruce in the tree composition; only beetles and birds were negatively affected. The results revealed more highly contrasting and often complex responses among the groups than what might be expected theoretically. The first key issue in the management of plantation forests in terms of biodiversity is the partial retention and restoration of islands of native vegetation. The second issue is that the impact of a normative tree species is not always negative.","[Horak, Jakub; Brestovanska, Tereza; Mladenovic, Strahinja] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 1176, CZ-16500 Prague, Czech Republic; [Kout, Jiri] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Educ, Dept Biol Geosci & Environm Educ, Klatovska 51, CZ-30619 Plzen, Czech Republic; [Bogusch, Petr; Halda, Josef P.] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rokitanskeho 62, CZ-50003 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Zasadil, Petr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kamycka 1176, CZ-16500 Prague, Czech Republic","Horak, J (reprint author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Entomol, Kamycka 1176, CZ-16500 Prague, Czech Republic.",jakub.sruby@gmail.com,"Bogusch, Petr/Q-6111-2016; Horak, Jakub/C-1050-2011; Brestovanska, Tereza/F-2540-2017","Horak, Jakub/0000-0003-2049-0599; Halda, Josef/0000-0002-0264-8535; Brestovanska, Tereza/0000-0003-4907-2542",ENvironmental REsistance of stable FOrest stands fulfilling non-wood producing roles [NAZV KUS QJ1520197]; Managed forests in lowlands and their potential from the perspective of two distinct taxa-beetles and birds [CIGA CZU 20144302]; Bark beetles and their antagonists in natural and commercial spruce stands [IGA FLD B_02_18],This study was supported by grant no.

The objective of the study was to analyse the variation in the most dynamic soil C input (tree and understory above- and belowground litter production) and output (soil respiration) fluxes, in addition to the forest floor, understory and fine root biomass stocks, in eight different Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst) sites growing on mineral soils in Estonia. Further, the impact of soil C input and output fluxes on the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool was examined, and the net ecosystem production (NEP) of the stands was estimated. Fine root production (FRP) of the trees constituted 53% and 28% and needle litter constituted 25% and 28% of the total annual C input to the soil in the Norway spruce and Scots pine stands, respectively. The total FRP of the trees and the understory roots and rhizomes ranged from 211 to 1040 g m(-2) yr(-1), of which the understory comprised up to 28%. The mean annual soil respiration (Rs) rate was 5.7 +/- 0.3 and 6.5 +/- 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the pine and spruce stands, respectively, and did not differ significantly between the two groups of stands. The SOC pool of the studied stands depended significantly on both the above- and belowground C input fluxes. Tree-derived litter had the strongest effect on the SOC pool, while the Rh as the main soil C output flux showed no significant impact. The NEP ranged from 4.2 to - 1.8 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and demonstrated a strong negative correlation with stand age. The results affirm the importance of belowground as well as aboveground litter production on carbon accumulation in forest soils.","[Kriiska, Kale; Frey, Jane; Kabral, Naima; Napa, Ulle; Ostonen, Ivika] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Vanemuise 46, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia; [Asi, Endla; Apuhtin, Vladislav; Timmusk, Tiiu] Estonian Environm Agcy, Roomu Tee 2, EE-51013 Tartu, Estonia; [Kabral, Naima] Estonian Environm Res Ctr, Marja 4d, EE-10617 Tartu, Estonia; [Uri, Veiko; Aosaar, Jurgen; Varik, Mats] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Kriiska, K (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Vanemuise 46, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia.",kaie.kriiska@ut.ee,"Aosaar, Jurgen/E-7948-2017; Kriiska, Kaie/M-8326-2018","Aosaar, Jurgen/0000-0002-7711-2014; Uri, Veiko/0000-0002-1774-4079; Kriiska, Kaie/0000-0002-4464-3433","Environmental Investment Centre [3797, 6250]; Ministry of Education and Research of EstoniaMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT2-16, IUT21-4]; ESFEuropean Science Foundation (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF) [7452]; CAR-ES Nordic Network; EU via the European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence ENVIRON); EU via the European Regional Development Fund (EcolChange); Biolink COST Action [FP1305]","This study was funded by the Environmental Investment Centre projects No. 3797 and 6250; the Ministry of Education and Research of Estonia Projects IUT2-16 and IUT21-4; ESF grant 7452; the CAR-ES Nordic Network, the EU via the European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence ENVIRON and EcolChange) and the Biolink COST Action (FP1305).",,78,1,1,9,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

However, how Rs and its components (autotrophic, Ra and heterotrophic respiration, Rh) vary with thinning intensity and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study we monitored Rs, Ra and Rh over five growing seasons using a trenching method in a Pinus tabuliformis plantation subjected to four thinning treatments (no thinning, CK; light thinning, LT; moderate thinning, MT and heavy thinning, HT). On average, LT and MT significantly increased Rs by 13% and 17%, respectively, compared with the CK. These increments of Rs were ascribed to the enhanced Ra in LT and MT plots, because light and moderate thinning promoted root growth and productivity (higher fine root biomass). However, HT did not result in a further increase in Ra, suggesting that increases in the activity of remaining trees and understory plants did not compensate for the reduced photosynthesis and the amount of respiring tree roots by extensive tree-cut. In contrast to Ra, variation in Rh was unrelated to thinning, partly due to the stable forest floor mass (non-living organic materials such as litter and fine woody debris) and microbial biomass carbon content (MBC) between thinned and control plots. The temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of Ra and Rh ranged from 1.40 to 3.07 and 2.34-3.42, respectively. The highest Q(10) of Ra was observed in MT while that of Rh occurred in LT. Soil moisture was significantly correlated with Rh but a poor predictor for Ra. Our findings demonstrated that Ra and Rh responded to thinning intensity independently of each other. The intensity of management and plant-mediated biological processes are of particular importance in evaluating the impacts of forest management on C sequestration potential in plantation forests.]","[Zhao, Bo; Cao, Jing; Geng, Yan; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [von Gadow, Klaus] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Burckhardt Inst, Gottingen, Germany","Geng, Y; Zhao, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",gengyan@bjfu.edu.cn; zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC050400103],"The authors are grateful to Guanyi Jin, Huashan Li, Xing Liu, Na Wang, Zichao Yan, Ping Chen and Lu Yang for assistance with field and laboratory work.

In this work, dual stable isotopes were used to detect the water sources of mixed forest of coniferous and broad-leaved tree species and their response of leaf water potential under differently sized precipitation events (no rain: 0.0 mm; light rain: 9.8 mm; moderate rain: 21.8 mm; large rain: 31.6 mm and rainstorm: 51.2 mm). The results showed that Platycladus orientalis and Quercus variabilis had different water use strategies and opposite responses to precipitation. On dry (no rain) days, P. orientalis and Q. variabilis predominantly obtained water from natural springs (43.3% and 36.2%, respectively) and deep soil layer (32.8% and 31.3%, respectively), while Q. variabilis also used water from shallow soil layer (23.4%). Following the rainfall events, the P. orientalis with dense and shallow fine root system absorbed more water from the soil surface layers (23.1-33.5%) and precipitation (15.2-30.7%). The pre-dawn water potential (psi(pd)) and the midday water potential (psi(md)) of P. orientalis increased with the amount of rainfall, revealing a sensitive response to precipitation. On the other hand, Q. variabilis mostly took up water from natural springs (32.3-36.7%) and deep soil layer (33.8-37.1 %) after the rainfall events through its well-developed taproot system. The psi(pd) and psi(md) of Q. variabilis had no significant variation between no rain and light rain events, though they increased significantly for large rainfall and rainstorm events with > 60 cm of soil water recharge provided by the precipitation.

We assessed the effects of artificially applied R. pseudostellariae root exudates on R. pseudostellariae seedling growth, rhizosphere soil microbial communities, and soil physicochemical properties. We found that phenolic acids and organic acids acted as a driver of changes in the microbial community. High-throughput sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that treatment with phenolic acids significantly decreased the relative abundance of Trichoderma, Penicillium, Pseudomonadales, Xanthomonadales, and Streptomycetales. Organic acids had a significant negative effect on the relative abundance of Pseudomonadales and Streptomycetales and significantly increased the abundance of Fusarium, Xanthomonadales, Micrococcales, and Gemmatimonadales. Analysis based on the noninvasive microtest technique indicated that root exudates increased H+ efflux and plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity in the pathogenic fungi and decreased them in the beneficial fungi. These phenomena created an acidic environment for the inhibition of beneficial bacteria and accumulation of specialized plant pathogens. This study explains the mechanisms underlying the shift in microflora and structural disorder caused by root exudates in continuously monocultured R. pseudostellariae rhizosphere soil through responses to environmental conditions.","[Wu, Hongmiao; Qin, Xianjin; Wang, Juanying; Wu, Linkun; Chen, Jun; Fan, Jingkai; Zheng, Lin; Arafat, Yasir; Lin, Weiwei; Luo, Xiaomian; Lin, Sheng; Lin, Wenxiong] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Life Sci, Fujian Prov Key Lab Agroecol Proc & Safety Monito, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hongmiao; Qin, Xianjin; Wang, Juanying; Wu, Linkun; Chen, Jun; Fan, Jingkai; Zheng, Lin; Tangtai, Haipeng; Arafat, Yasir; Luo, Xiaomian; Lin, Sheng; Lin, Wenxiong] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Key Lab Crop Ecol & Mol Physiol, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Qin, Xianjin; Tangtai, Haipeng; Lin, Wenxiong] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Crop Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Genet Breeding & Multiple Utilizat Crops, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China","Lin, S; Lin, WX (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Life Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lsjk1958@163.com; lwx@fafu.edu.cn,"Arafat, Yasir/Y-4632-2019; Wu, Hongmiao/J-5958-2014","Arafat, Yasir/0000-0001-7452-1093; ","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [81573530, 31401950]; Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University [324-1122YB031]; Major agricultural extension services of Fujian Province [KNJ-153015]; Fujian-Taiwan Joint Innovative Center for Germplasm Resources and Cultivation of Crop (China) [2015-75]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2017J01803]; Weng Hongwu Academic Innovation Research Fund of Peking University; Original Research Fund of Peking University","We thank the National Science Foundation of China (81573530, 31401950), Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (324-1122YB031), Major agricultural extension services of Fujian Province (KNJ-153015), Fujian-Taiwan Joint Innovative Center for Germplasm Resources and Cultivation of Crop (Fujian 2011 Program, No.2015-75, China) and Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2017J01803) for providing the funds used in this work.

These microbes may be pathogenic, mutualistic, or commensal. Hence, the health and survival of plants is heavily reliant on their ability to perceive different microbial lifestyles and respond appropriately. Emerging research suggests that there is a pivotal role for plant root secondary metabolites in responding to microbial colonization. However, it is largely unknown if plants are able to differentiate between microbes of different lifestyles and respond differently during the earliest stages of pre-symbiosis (i.e., prior to physical contact). In studying plant responses to a range of microbial isolates, we questioned: (1) if individual microbes of different lifestyles and species caused alterations to the plant root metabolome during pre-symbiosis, and (2) if these early metabolite responses correlate with the outcome of the symbiotic interaction in later phases of colonization. We compared the changes of the root tip metabolite profile of the model tree Eucalyptus grandis during pre-symbiosis with two isolates of a pathogenic fungus (Armillaria luteobubalina), one isolate of a pathogenic oomycete (Phytophthora cinnamomi), two isolates of an incompatible mutualistic fungus (Suillus granulatus), and six isolates of a compatible mutualistic fungus (Pisolithus microcarpus). Untargeted metabolite profiling revealed predominantly positive root metabolite responses at the pre-symbiosis stage, prior to any observable phenotypical changes of the root tips. Metabolite responses in the host tissue that were specific to each microbial species were identified. A deeper analysis of the root metabolomic profiles during pre-symbiotic contact with six strains of P. microcarpus showed a connection between these early metabolite responses in the root with later colonization success. Further investigation using isotopic tracing revealed a portion of metabolites found in root tips originated from the fungus. RNA-sequencing also showed that the plant roots undergo complementary transcriptomic reprogramming in response to the fungal stimuli. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the early metabolite responses of plant roots are partially selective toward the lifestyle of the interacting microbe, and that these responses can be crucial in determining the outcome of the interaction.","[Wong, Johanna W.

Such a complex topography complicates the accurate quantification of forest C dynamics at larger scales.ObjectivesWe determined the effects of altitude and aspect on forest C cycling in a typical, mountainous catchment in the Northern Limestone Alps.MethodsForest C pools and fluxes were measured along two altitudinal gradients (650-900m a.s.l.) at south-west (SW) and north-east (NE) facing slopes. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was estimated using a biometric approach combining field measurements of aboveground biomass and soil CO2 efflux (SR) with allometric functions, root:shoot ratios and empirical SR modeling.ResultsNEP was higher at the SW facing slope (6.603.01tCha(-1)year(-1)), when compared to the NE facing slope (4.36 +/- 2.61 tCha(-1)year(-1)). SR was higher at the SW facing slope too, balancing out any difference in NEP between aspects (NE: 1.30 +/- 3.23tCha(-1)year(-1), SW: 1.65 +/- 3.34tCha(-1)year(-1)). Soil organic C stocks significantly decreased with altitude. Forest NPP and NEP did not show clear altitudinal trends within the catchment.Conclusions Under current climate conditions, altitude and aspect adversely affect C sequestering and releasing processes, resulting in a relatively uniform forest NEP in the catchment. Hence, including detailed climatic and soil conditions, which are driven by altitude and aspect, will unlikely improve forest NEP estimates at the scale of the studied catchment. In a future climate, however, shifts in temperature and precipitation may disproportionally affect forest C cycling at the southward slopes through increased water limitation.","[Kobler, Johannes; Zehetgruber, Bernhard; Dirnboeck, Thomas; Mirtl, Michael] Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Ecosyst Res & Environm Informat Management, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Jandl, Robert; Schindlbacher, Andreas] Fed Res & Training Ctr Forests Nat Hazards & Land, Dept Forest Ecol & Soils, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria","Kobler, J (reprint author), Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Ecosyst Res & Environm Informat Management, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",johannes.kobler@umweltbundesamt.at,,"Kobler, Johannes/0000-0003-0052-4245",Austrian Climate Research Program; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Austrian Academy of Sciences Research Program (Earth System Sciences),"This study was funded by the Austrian Climate Research Program, the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and the Austrian Academy of Sciences Research Program (Earth System Sciences).",,68,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

The model was calibrated and validated with WT on four poorly to moderately drained soils (Lenoir, Rains, Lynchburg, and Goldsboro) on a forested wetland. Calibration results were in good agreement with the measured WT for all soils, except the Goldsboro with deeper WT. r(2) (coefficient of determination) and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) statistics both ranged from 0.81 for the Lenoir to 0.89 and 0.87, respectively, for the Lynchburg. Average absolute daily deviation (AADD) varied from 10.8cm for Lenoir to 16.7cm for Rains. The performance was somewhat poorer, during relatively dry periods with deeper WT, yielding r(2) and NSE as low as 0.55 and 0.29, respectively, for Lenoir, and large AADD for Lynchburg. Discrepancies were associated with WT overprediction for deeper depths. The new model is capable of describing the WT for poorly drained high water table soils, with a potential for assessing effects of land management, wetland hydrology, and climate changes.","[Amatya, Devendra M.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Ctr Forested Wetlands Res, 3734 Highway 402, Cordesville, SC 29434 USA; [Fialkowski, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem, Kasprzaka 44-52, PL-01224 Warsaw, Poland; [Bitner, Agnieszka] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Agr Land Surveying Cadaster & Photogrammetry, Ul Balicka 253a, PL-30198 Krakow, Poland","Amatya, DM (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Ctr Forested Wetlands Res, 3734 Highway 402, Cordesville, SC 29434 USA.",damatya@fs.fed.us,,"Amatya, devendra/0000-0003-2641-9267",US-Poland Fulbright Fellowship,"This work is a result of a cooperation, with scientists from Agricultural University of Krakow (AUK) and Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, both in Poland, initiated while the first author was in AUK on a sabbatical supported by US-Poland Fulbright Fellowship in 2010-11.

While the species with low tolerance had higher growth and allocation plasticity than the highly tolerant species, the highly tolerant species only adjusted their growth traits and maintained higher fitness (e.g., plant height and total biomass) in response to increased soil salinity-sodicity, with low biomass allocation plasticity. Most plasticity is apparent plasticity (ontogenetic change), and only a few traits, for example, plant height:stem diameter ratio and root:shoot biomass ratio, represent real plasticity (real change in response to the environment).

One hypothesized mechanism by which many exotic plants can become invasive is through the disruption of key plant-mycorrhizal mutualisms, yet few studies have investigated how these disruptions can lead to invader success. We present an individual-based model to examine how mutualism strengths between a native plant (Impatiens capensis) and mycorrhizal fungus can influence invasion success for a widespread plant invader, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard). Two questions were investigated as follows: (a) How does the strength of the mutualism between the native I.capensis and a mycorrhizal fungus affect resistance (i.e., native plant maintaining >60% of final equilibrium plant density) to garlic mustard invasion? (b) Is there a non-linear relationship between initial garlic mustard density and invasiveness (i.e., garlic mustard representing >60% of final equilibrium plant density)? Our findings indicate that either low (i.e., facultative) or high (i.e., obligate) mutualism strengths between the native plant and mycorrhizal fungus were more likely to lead to garlic mustard invasiveness than intermediate levels, which resulted in higher resistance to garlic mustard invasion. Intermediate mutualism strengths allowed I.capensis to take advantage of increased fitness when the fungus was present but remained competitive enough to sustain high numbers without the fungus. Though strong mutualisms had the highest fitness without the invader, they proved most susceptible to invasion because the loss of the mycorrhizal fungus resulted in a reproductive output too low to compete with garlic mustard. Weak mutualisms were more competitive than strong mutualisms but still led to garlic mustard invasion. Furthermore, we found that under intermediate mutualism strengths, the initial density of garlic mustard (as a proxy for different levels of plant invasion) did not influence its invasion success, as high initial densities of garlic mustard did not lead to it becoming dominant. Our results indicate that plants that form weak or strong mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi are most vulnerable to invasion, whereas intermediate mutualisms provide the highest resistance to an allelopathic invader.","[McCary, Matthew A.; Wise, David H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [McCary, Matthew A.; Zellner, Moira; Wise, David H.] Univ Illinois, Inst Environm Sci & Policy, Chicago, IL USA; [Zellner, Moira] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, Chicago, IL USA; [McCary, Matthew A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","McCary, MA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.; McCary, MA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",matt.mccary@gmail.com,,"Zellner, Moira/0000-0002-4111-3357",University of Illinois at Chicago Institute for Environmental Science and Policy; University of Illinois at Chicago Graduate College,"University of Illinois at Chicago Institute for Environmental Science and Policy, Predoctoral Fellowship; University of Illinois at Chicago Graduate College, Abraham Lincoln Graduate Fellowship and a Dean's Scholar Award",,65,1,1,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In this study, we simulated N deposition (0, 50, 100, 150, and 300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) to explore the effects of N addition on the total and the phytophagous soil fauna along the soil profile (0-10, 10-25, and 25-40 cm) in poplar plantations (Populus deltoids) on the east coast of China. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was dissolved in water and sprayed evenly under the canopy with a backpack sprayer to simulate N deposition. Our results showed that N addition either significantly increased or decreased the density (D) of both the total and the phytophagous soil fauna (D-total and D-p) at low or high N addition rates, respectively, indicating the existence of threshold effects over the range of N addition. However, N addition had no significant impacts on the number of groups (G) and diversity (H) of either the total or the phytophagous soil fauna (G(total), G(p) and H-total, H-p). With increasing soil depth, D-total, D-p, G(total), and G(p) largely decreased, showing that the soil fauna have a propensity to aggregate at the soil surface. H-total and H-p did not significantly vary along the soil profile. Importantly, the threshold effects of N addition on D-total and D-p increased from 50 and 100 to 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) along the soil profile. Fine root biomass was the dominant factor mediating variations in D-total and D-p. Our results suggested that N addition may drive changes in soil-faunal community composition by altering belowground food resources in poplar plantations.","[Bian, Haixue; Geng, Qinghong; Xiao, Hanran; Ruan, Honghua; Xu, Xia] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bian, Haixue; Geng, Qinghong; Xiao, Hanran; Ruan, Honghua; Xu, Xia] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shen, Caiqin] Dongtai Forest Farm, Yancheng 224200, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Qian] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Adv Anal & Testing Ctr, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiaoli] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yiqi] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Xu, X (reprint author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Xu, X (reprint author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",haixue_bian@163.com; gengqh0127@163.com; xiaobaisky123@163.com; shencaiqin123@163.com; liqian.1987@outlook.com; chengxiaoli@wbgcas.cn; yiqi.luo@nau.edu; hhruan@njfu.edu.cn; xuxia.1982@njfu.edu.cn,,"XU, XIA/0000-0002-7806-291X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0600204]; Recruitment Program for Young Professionals; Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professors Program; Natural Science Key Fund for Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province of China [17KJA180006]; Six Talent Peaks Program of Jiangsu Province [JY-041, TD-XYDXX-006]; Nanjing Forestry University Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (the ""5151"" Talent Program); Jiangsu Collegiate Science and Technology Fund for the Excellent Innovative Research Teams; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)","This study is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0600204), the Recruitment Program for Young Professionals, the Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professors Program, the Natural Science Key Fund for Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province of China (17KJA180006), the Six Talent Peaks Program of Jiangsu Province (JY-041 & TD-XYDXX-006), the Nanjing Forestry University Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (the ""5151"" Talent Program), the Jiangsu Collegiate Science and Technology Fund for the Excellent Innovative Research Teams, and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,82,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2019,10,2,,,,,,,122,10.3390/f10020122,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,HO2KP,WOS:000460744000046,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Liu, YC; Shang, Q; Wang, L; Liu, SR",,,,"Liu, Yanchun; Shang, Qing; Wang, Lei; Liu, Shirong",,,Effects of Understory Shrub Biomass on Variation of Soil Respiration in a Temperate-Subtropical Transitional Oak Forest,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil CO2 emission; understory plant; shrub biomass; spatial variation; structural equation modeling,EXPERIMENTAL THROUGHFALL REDUCTION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; CO2 EFFLUX; SPATIAL VARIATIONS; VARIABILITY; CARBON; DECOMPOSITION; RESPONSES; HETEROGENEITY; PLANTATION,"Quantification of the temporal and spatial variations of soil respiration is an essential step in modeling soil carbon (C) emission associated with the spatial distribution of plants.

Understory shrub biomass and belowground fine root biomass positively regulated the spatial variation of soil respiration. Soil respiration displayed strong spatial autocorrelation, with an average spatial correlation length of 20.1 m. The findings highlight the importance of understory shrub and belowground biomass in regulating the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration in forest ecosystems, and the need to carefully address it to robustly estimate the contribution of soil C emission in terrestrial C cycling.","[Liu, Yanchun; Wang, Lei] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Shang, Qing] Yellow River Conservancy Tech Inst, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Wang, L (reprint author), Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",yanchunliu@henu.edu.cn; qingshangsq@163.com; wl_mail@henu.edu.cn; Liusr@caf.ac.cn,"Liu, Yanchun/C-7803-2019","Liu, Yanchun/0000-0002-3386-664X",China National Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31600379]; China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation [2018T110722]; Key Research Project of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province [17A180001],"This study was financially supported by the China National Science Foundation (No. 31600379), the China Postdoctoral Science Special Foundation (2018T110722), Key Research Project of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province (No. 17A180001).",,45,3,3,7,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2019,10,2,,,,,,,88,10.3390/f10020088,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,HO2KP,WOS:000460744000012,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Sakoda, S; Aisu, K; Imagami, H; Matsuda, Y",,,,"Sakoda, Shoyo; Aisu, Kana; Imagami, Hiroki; Matsuda, Yosuke",,,Comparison of Actinomycete Community Composition on the Surface and Inside of Japanese Black Pine (Pinus thunbergii) Tree Roots Colonized by the Ectomycorrhizal Fungus Cenococcum geophilum,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Actinomycetes; Ectomycorrhizae; Actinoallomurus; Bacterial community,16S RIBOSOMAL DNA; HELPER BACTERIUM; SELECTIVE ISOLATION; SOIL NEMATODES; SP NOV.; SYMBIOSIS; EVOLUTION; GROWTH,"Various bacteria are associated with ectomycorrhizal roots, which are symbiotic complexes formed between plant roots and fungi. Among these associated bacteria, actinomycetes have received attention for their ubiquity and diverse roles in forest ecosystems. Here, to examine the association of actinomycetes with ectomycorrhizal root tips, we compared the bacterial and actinomycete communities on the surface and inside of root tips of coastal Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) colonized by the fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Next-generation sequences of 16S rDNA of bacteria communities using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine showed that the number of bacterial classes in the surface of C. geophilum ECM roots was significantly higher than that in non-ECM roots. The bacterial community structure of surface, inside, and non-ECM roots was significantly discriminated each other. For an isolation method, a total of 762 and 335 actinomycete isolates were obtained from the surface and inside of the roots, respectively. In addition, the isolation ratio of actinomycetes in these root tips varied depending on the age of the tree and the season. Identification of the isolates based on partial 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the isolates belonged to nine genera of the order Actinomycetales. On the surface of the roots, most of the isolates belonged to genus Streptomyces (90.4%); inside of the roots, most of the isolates belonged to genus Actinoallomurus (40.0%), which is a relatively new taxon. Our results suggest that actinomycetes as well as bacteria are ubiquitously associated with C. geophilum ectomycorrhizal roots of P. thunbergii, although their communities can vary either surface or inside of individual root tips.","[Sakoda, Shoyo; Matsuda, Yosuke] Mie Univ, Grad Sch Bioresources, Lab Forest Mycol, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan; [Aisu, Kana; Imagami, Hiroki] Mie Univ, Fac Bioresources, Lab Forest Pathol & Mycol, Tsu, Mie, Japan","Sakoda, S; Matsuda, Y (reprint author), Mie Univ, Grad Sch Bioresources, Lab Forest Mycol, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.",s.shoyo35@gmail.com; m-yosuke@bio.mie-u.ac.jp,,,,,,60,0,0,9,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Love), a perennial Triticeae bunchgrass native to the Intermountain West. Traits examined included onset of germination, seedling biomass traits, and seedling surface-area traits. We grew seeds of nine BBWG populations that varied for seed size and were produced in a common environment under 2 contrasting d/n temperature regimes (201 5 degrees C; 10/5 degrees C). Lighter-seeded populations germinated and initiated shoots earlier. Heavier-seeded populations displayed high levels of biomass-related traits (e.g., shoot and root biomass and shoot length), while lighter-seeded populations displayed high levels of surface area - related traits (e.g., specific leaf area and specific root length [SRL]). Correlations between seed size and young-seedling traits were mostly similar under the two temperature regimes. However, root length - related traits showed more positive correlations with seed size under the low-temperature regime, which is more similar to actual field-emergence conditions during early spring. P-24, a light-seeded population, originated from the most arid site and exhibited the highest SRL at low temperature, while T-171, a heavy-seeded population, originated from the most mesic site and exhibited moderate SRL. Three populations used for rangeland revegetation, ""Whitmar,"" ""Goldar,"" and Anatone Germplasm, all exhibited low seed mass and high SRL. However, only Anatone displayed high root-to-shoot length ratio under both temperature regimes, perhaps explaining its wide and successful use in rangeland seedings.

A wide array of green infrastructure including urban trees is getting attention to mitigate those problems; however, magnitude, patterns and processes of hydrological functional capacity of different tree species at micro-scales are largely unknown. We measured morphology, above and below ground growth of two ecologically contrasting street tree species at two streets in Munich, Germany: Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Tilia cordata Mill. during 2016-17. Additionally, tree transpiration, meteorological and edaphic variables including soil hydraulic conductivity was measured on two streets. Overall the soil physical properties including bulk density, particle size distribution and meteorological variables were not significantly different at the two sites. A higher soil infiltration rate (0.42 cm/min) under the canopies of R. pseudoacacia compared to the T. cordata (0.29 cm/min) was mainly attributed to the higher annual growth rate of R. pseudoacacia and showed a significant correlation (r = 0.62) with infiltration rate. Subsequently, R. pseudoacacia showed increased fine root biomass compared to T. cordata (121 g/m(2 )and 27 g/m(2) respectively). However, T. cordata trees transpired three times more compared to R. pseudoacacia which indicated that they might have a deeper roofing system. The study showed that fast growing species such as R. pseudoacacia can enhance infiltration through its intense fine roofing system creating channels in the upper soil. Moreover, grass cover also plays a role both in infiltration and ground evapotranspiration compared to the built surfaces and can enhance the processes if planted in combination with less water using species. Secondly, higher root biomass and infiltration further away from the tree trunk suggest a need for larger tree planting pits whereas species such as T. cordata are better suited in paved cutout pits inducing vertical roofing depth.","[Rahman, Mohammad A.; Anderson, Marshal; Pauleit, Stephan] Weihenstephan Tech Univ Munchen, Sch Life Sci, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Moser, Astrid; Zhang, Chi; Rotzer, Thomas] Weihenstephan Tech Univ Munchen, Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Sch Life Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Rahman, MA (reprint author), Weihenstephan Tech Univ Munchen, Sch Life Sci, Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",ma.rahman@tum.de; astrid.moser@lrz.tu-muenchen.de; johnm.andersonii@gmail.com; casiuechizhang@gmail.com; thomas.roetzer@lrz.tu-muenchen.de; pauleit@tum.de,,"Rahman, Mohammad Asrafur/0000-0001-9872-010X; Rotzer, Thomas/0000-0003-3780-7206",Alexander von Humboldt FellowshipAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; TREE Fund [15-JK-01],This work was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship and grant from TREE Fund (#: 15-JK-01).,,66,6,6,12,19,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

In this study, we evaluated the above and belowground carbon storage potential of a silvopastoral system and compared to a conventional open pasture system in two sites of Chiapas, Mexico. We established a total of 20 carbon monitoring plots, 10 plots for each system. All the trees of2.5cm DBH were measured within the plots of 1000m(2). Allometric equations were used to calculate biomass carbon stocks. Grass biomass, ground litter, and soil samples were collected from four random locations within the plot. We also calculated tree diversity and other ecological indices of the silvopastoral systems. The aboveground biomass carbon stocks in dispersed tree silvopastoral systems varied between 11.53 +/- 1.80 to 14.63 +/- 5.50Mg C ha(-1). Soil organic carbon concentrations were higher in silvopastoral systems while soil bulk density was higher in open pasture systems, both affecting the soil organic carbon storage. A total of 29 tree species were registered in the dispersed tree silvopastoral systems. The Sorenson's similarity index showed that the two study sites significantly differed in terms of their tree community compositions. Such differences were also observed in soil properties and carbon storage. We showed that there was a positive correlation between aboveground biomass and soil organic carbon concentrations. Further research is required to better understand the contributions of fine root and litter turnover on soil organic carbon storage in these systems.","[Aryal, Deb R.] Univ Autonoma Chiapas, Fac Ciencias Agron, CONACYT UNACH, Villaflores 30470, Mexico; [Gomez-Gonzalez, Rogelio R.; Hernandez-Nuriasmu, Rodrigo; Morales-Ruiz, Danilo E.] Univ Autonoma Chiapas, Fac Ciencias Agron, Campus 5, Villaflores, Mexico","Aryal, DR (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Chiapas, Fac Ciencias Agron, CONACYT UNACH, Villaflores 30470, Mexico.",debraj.aryal@hotmail.com,"Aryal, Deb Raj/E-6589-2019","Aryal, Deb Raj/0000-0003-4188-3084",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [381-2015],"The authors thank Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) for financing the project 381-2015 ""Estrategias de mitigacion de impactos ambientales del sector agropecuario en Chiapas"".

However, knowledge on the soil fungal assemblages in revegetated shrubs still remains veiled. This study aimed to evaluate how soil fungal diversity and composition respond to shrub species.MethodsWe characterized soil fungal communities in three different shrublands (Artemisia ordosica, Salix psammophila, and Caragana microphylla), which had been planted on bare sandland for about 20years, in the Mu Us Desert in northern China, using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing. The relationships of fungal community diversity and composition with environmental variables were explored by regression analysis and Mantel test, respectively.ResultsThe dominant phyla across the studied samples were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Compared to bare sandland, fungal diversity was significantly greater in A. ordosica and C. microphylla but not in S. psammophila. There was a positive linear relationship between soil fungal and understory plant diversity. A. ordosica and C. microphylla shrublands showed the greatest relative abundance of Ascomycota; S. psammophila shrubland showed the greatest relative abundance of Basidiomycota. In terms of functional groups, the highest relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the lowest relative abundance of pathogenic fungi were found in S. psammophila shrubland. Soil collected from A. ordosica shrubland showed the highest relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.ConclusionsVariations in fungal diversity and assemblages were directly affected by the revegetated shrub species. The strong correlation of the fungal community and shrubs provides a better understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration and plant-soil interaction in different revegetated shrublands.","[Sun, Yanfei; Zhang, Yuqing; Feng, Wei; Qin, Shugao; Liu, Zhen] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuqing; Feng, Wei; Qin, Shugao] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Forestry Ecol Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Zhang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangyqbjfu@gmail.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500905]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470711]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-SB-02],"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2016YFC0500905), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31470711), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (no. 2015ZCQ-SB-02).

The aim of this study was to compare patterns of root growth in contrasting forage legumes and to analyse their dependency to shoot development.MethodsThe parameters of a dynamic simulation model were identified for seven contrasting species in a series of greenhouse experiments in order to characterize root elongation, root branching and taproot growth. The model allowed us to explore the interactions between root development and whole plant growth.ResultsMost of the root morphogenetic parameters studied displayed significant inter-specific variability. Several traits appeared to be correlated, indicating a close association between extreme root tip diameters, the branching ability of roots and their maximal elongation rate. The species differed along two PCA axes which accounted respectively for the branching ability of fine roots and taproot development. Quite remarkably, the group of species identified for root development did not coincide with those previously identified for shoots, suggesting a degree of independence between the morphogenetic traits that control shoot and root architecture. However, both plant parts remained tightly linked through the trophic relationship represented by root biomass allocation.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the concomitant analysis of root and shoot development is necessary to properly decipher rooting strategies in forage legumes.","[Faverjon, Lucas; Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham; Migault, Vincent; Louarn, Gaetan] INRA, UR4 URP3F, BP6, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Pages, Loic] INRA, UR PSH 1115, Site Agroparc, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Migault, Vincent] Itk, CAPALPHA, Ave Europe, F-34830 Clapiers, France","Louarn, G (reprint author), INRA, UR4 URP3F, BP6, F-86600 Lusignan, France.",gaetan.louarn@inra.fr,"Gaetan, Louarn/C-4454-2013; Pages, Loic/F-9893-2011","Gaetan, Louarn/0000-0003-3701-7036; ",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PRAISE project)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-BIOADAPT-0015]; Poitou Charentes Regional CouncilRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine; Environment and Agronomy Division of INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique),"This study was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PRAISE project, ANR-13-BIOADAPT-0015), the Poitou Charentes Regional Council (PhD fellowship for L.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is important signaling molecule that links the growth and developmental signals and environment stimuli to cellular responses. In the current study we explored the relationship between H2S and MAPK in drought stress resistance in Arabidopsis.MethodsThe quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR, root tip bending experiment and stomatal aperture assay were used in this paper.ResultsDrought stress activated both H2S biosynthesis and gene expression of MAPKs. The increase in MAPK expression was depressed in lcd/des1, a double mutant of H2S synthesis. Then we selected MPK4 as our target and used mpk4 mutants for further studies. H2S was able to alleviate the drought stress in wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis but not in mpk4 mutants. Meanwhile, H2S-induced stomatal movement was impaired in mpk4 mutants. We then examined the role of H2S and MPK4 in stomatal movements in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ABA- and H2O2- mediated stomatal movements were impaired in lcd/des1 and mpk4 mutants, and H2S-induced stomatal closure was impaired in slac1-3 mutants.ConclusionsOur results suggested that MPK4 is important downstream of H2S in the drought stress response and in stomatal movement, and that the H2S-MPK4 cascade is involved in ABA-mediated stomatal movement to regulate the drought stress.","[Du, Xinzhe; Jin, Zhuping; Zhang, Liping; Yang, Guangdong; Pei, Yanxi] Shanxi Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xin] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guangdong] Laurentian Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Sudbury, ON, Canada","Pei, YX (reprint author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",peiyanxi@sxu.edu.cn,"Pei, Yanxi/H-1501-2016","Pei, Yanxi/0000-0002-8428-3399","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31672140, 31671605]","This work was funded by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 31672140 to Jin Z., 31671605 to Pei Y.)

Ndfa in gliricidia and cocoa leaves (from all sites) and in shoot axes (in one site only) was assessed by the N-15 natural abundance technique. Cocoa trees distant (>10m) from the closest gliricidia were used as reference plants.ResultsWith few exceptions, leaves of gliricidia and cocoa trees growing in proximity had similar N-15, whereas the foliar N-15 value of gliricidia was lower than that of distant cocoa trees. The Ndfa in gliricidia leaves ranged from 22 to 50% of total leaf N and was 48% in the shoot axis. Root nodules, found only after the wet season, always showed the inner red color indicating effective N-2 fixation and the occurrence of Rhizobium tropici and Rhizobium etli. The annually produced shoots of gliricidia, theoretically suitable to become green manure after pruning, contained 31.4 to 38.0kgNha(-1) derived from the atmosphere.ConclusionsGliricidia sepium trees are able to take advantage of the association with rhizobial symbionts to fulfill, at least in part, the N needs of their rapidly growing shoots. In mixed-stand agroforestry systems, with intercropped gliricidia and cocoa trees, the amount of N derived from the atmosphere that could enter the soil if the pruned shoots of gliricidia trees are used as green manure could diminish the need for N fertilizers for cocoa trees.","[Kaba, James Seutra; Zerbe, Stefan; Scandellari, Francesca; Tagliavini, Massimo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Bolzano, Italy; [Agnolucci, Monica; Giovannetti, Manuela] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Pisa, Italy; [Abunyewa, Akwasi A.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Nat Resource, Kumasi, Ghana","Tagliavini, M (reprint author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Bolzano, Italy.",massimo.tagliavini@unibz.it,,"KABA, JAMES SEUTRA/0000-0001-6432-3464",UNIBZ; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"The authors like to thank Prof. Paul Vlek for revising the text and for his suggestions.

Whether these groups respond similarly to drying and wetting is not clear, however, making it difficult to predict the net effect of drought on soil carbon processes.MethodsWe imposed a drought-rewetting event on mesocosms planted with maple (Acer saccharum Marshall; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi host) or oak (Quercus alba L.; ectomycorrhizal fungi host) saplings. In each mesocosm, we used mesh to create chambers separating roots, mycorrhizal fungi hyphae, and free-living microbes. We compared respiration and carbon degrading enzyme activity across chambers throughout the dry-rewetting cycle.ResultsRespiration from all chambers declined during drought, and chambers differed in their drought-sensitivity. In maple mesocosms, respiration from the Hyphae+Microbes chamber was the most drought-resistant; in oak mesocosms respiration from the Microbes chamber was the most drought-sensitive. Respiration did not recover after rewatering, indicating a persistent drought legacy. In contrast, enzyme activity returned to control functioning after 2weeks of well-watered conditions.ConclusionsOur results suggest that belowground biota differ in their sensitivity to and recovery from drought, which affects the carbon processes differently. An improved ability to partition carbon fluxes into biotic sources can help to constrain predicted carbon fluxes under future climate scenarios.","[Ficken, Cari D.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Warren, Jeffrey M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Warren, Jeffrey M.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA","Ficken, CD (reprint author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",cficken@uwaterloo.ca,"Warren, Jeff/B-9375-2012","Warren, Jeff/0000-0002-0680-4697; Ficken, Cari/0000-0003-4132-4354","Biological and Environmental Research Program in the Office of Science, United States Department of Energy; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DEAC05-00OR22725]; Graduate Opportunities (GO!)

Interactions with shared mutualists, which can differentially affect host fitness and change in magnitude with host frequency, can satisfy these conditions for coexistence, yet empirical tests of mutualist effects on relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences are largely lacking within the framework of coexistence theory. Here, we show that N-fixing rhizobial mutualists mediate coexistence in four naturally co-occurring congeneric legume (Trifolium) species. Using experimental greenhouse communities, we quantified relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences for each species in the presence of rhizobia originating from conspecific or congeneric hosts. Rhizobia stabilized coexistence by increasing the self-limitation of Trifolium species grown with rhizobia isolated from conspecifics, thus allowing congeners to increase when rare. Greenhouse-measured invasion growth rates predicted natural, unmanipulated coexistence dynamics of Trifolium species over 2 years at our field sites. Our results demonstrate that interactions with shared mutualists can stabilize the coexistence of closely related species.","[Siefert, Andrew; Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Zillig, Kenneth W.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Siefert, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",asiefert@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1342841]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1342793]; Agricultural Experiment Station, University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources","We thank the editor and reviewers, whose comments greatly improved the quality and clarity of this article.

Soil aggregate stability (SAS) is widely used to infer rangeland health, partly because high SAS is thought to reduce run-off by increasing infiltration. We studied the sensitivity of SAS to grazing and other disturbances, the effects of SAS on infiltration, and the utility of alternative indicators of infiltration in the Northern Great Plains. To test grazing effects on SAS, we compared SAS between paired areas that were lightly to moderately grazed or excluded from grazing for 6 years. Additionally, we compared SAS between grazed and not-grazed plots of a 2-year controlled grazing experiment with moderate and severe grazing. We also applied herbicide, mowing, and fungicide treatments to test SAS responses to disturbances more generally, as well as effects of SAS and other factors on infiltration. To more generally test for a SAS-infiltration relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of our data combined with other data from the region. Grazing often reduced stability of small macroaggregates (0.25-1 mm) in the controlled grazing experiment but not the paired grazing area experiment. Grazing had no detectible effect on SAS of larger macroaggregates (1-2 mm). Herbicide tended to reduce SAS, and mowing sometimes increased SAS. Infiltration exhibited high plot-to-plot variation and was not significantly affected by treatments. Variation in infiltration was best explained by plant community composition variables and was not explained by either SAS or other soil properties. Our meta-analysis revealed no general SAS-infiltration relationship. Synthesis and applications. Our findings counter prevailing expectations that soil aggregate stability (SAS) is consistently sensitive to rangeland disturbance(s) and a leading indicator of soil water transport. Plant community composition properties were better predictors of infiltration. Our findings support the theory that excessive grazing increases the prevalence of a grazing tolerant species, which was associated with low levels of infiltration irrespective of SAS.","[Reinhart, Kurt O.; Rinella, Matthew J.; Waterman, Richard C.; Petersen, Mark K.; Vermeire, Lance T.] USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA","Reinhart, KO (reprint author), USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA.",kurt.reinhart@ars.usda.gov,,"Vermeire, Lance/0000-0001-9147-0099; Reinhart, Kurt/0000-0002-7985-6738",USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [5434-21630-003-00D],"USDA, Grant/Award Number: 5434-21630-003-00D",,64,0,0,12,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The leaf sheath has an upper epidermis of conical papillate shaped cells, homogenous mesophyll, water storage cells, raphides and sclerenchymatous fibers. The process of stem thickening through cortical proliferation was observed for the first time in Luisia species. The uniseriate epidermis is dimorphic in L. pulniana stem. The stem cortex is parenchymatous comprising of fibrous idioblasts. The ground tissue is parenchymatous (L. pulniana) or sclerenchymatous (L. tenuifolia, L. tristis) containing scattered collateral vascular bundles. Xylem and phloem capped by sclerenchymatous patches. The root hairs are restricted to root regions attached to the substratum. Velamen 2-4 layered, exodermal cells with greatly thickened outer tangential walls, cover cells present. Endodermis O-thickened, vascular cylinders 15-23 arched. Mycorrhizal fungi entered roots through the root hairs and formed pelotons in the root cortex. The anatomical characteristics varied significantly among the Luisia species.

Rhizobia can improve the performance of legumes by providing them with nitrogen (N) and defense compounds, thereby reducing negative impacts of parasitism. These biotic interactions can also be modified by abiotic factors such as N. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we used soybean (Glycine max) as the host legume plant to test how N addition (with or without), rhizobia (with or without inoculation of Bradyrhizobium sp.), and parasitism (infection by Cuscuta australis or not) interact to affect host plant growth and then cascade to influence the performance of rhizobia and C. australis. Total biomass and shoot biomass of soybean were significantly increased by rhizobium inoculation, reduced by the infection of C. australis, but unaffected by N addition. Root biomass was dramatically increased by rhizobium inoculation and N addition, but not affected by C. australis. There were no any three-way or two-way interactions among N addition, infection by C. australis, and rhizobium inoculation on soybean biomass. Interestingly, both rhizobium inoculation and N addition significantly increased biomass of C. australis, and both parasitism by C. australis and N addition significantly reduced biomass of rhizobia. Therefore, parasitic plants can benefit from rhizobia and N addition via improved host plant growth. Rhizobia suffer from parasitic plants likely by competing with them for photosynthetic carbon from the host, and from high N supply likely because high N reduces their affinity for symbiotic partnerships with the host. Our results highlight the complex cascading effects of biotic and abiotic interactions via host plants.","[Gao, Fang-Lei; Yu, Fei-Hai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Gao, Fang-Lei; Yu, Fei-Hai] Taizhou Univ, Inst Wetland Ecol & Clone Ecol, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Fang-Lei; Che, Xiu-Xia; Yu, Fei-Hai; Li, Jun-Min] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Che, Xiu-Xia] Guangxi Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China","Yu, FH; Li, JM (reprint author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.",feihaiyu@126.com; lijm@126.com,,"Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1201100]; Inter-governmental S&T Cooperation Proposal between Bulgaria and China [15-2]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30800133]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015ZCQ-BH-01],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on an early version of the manuscript.

Root structure strongly varies across biomes partly as a result of phylogeny. However, whether the spatial distribution of phylogenetically close plant species is linked to differences in root properties remains unclear. We examined whether root properties mediate the strong correlation between summer drought intensity and the spatial segregation of pine species native to southern Europe. For this, we compared the seedling root growth and structure of five ecologically distinct pine species grown in 360L rhizotrons for 19months under typical hot and dry Mediterranean conditions. We studied the mountain and boreo-alpine pines Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra, and the Mediterranean pines Pinus pinaster, Pinus pinea, and Pinus halepensis. Mediterranean pines formed deep roots faster than mountain pines, their shoots and roots grew faster and had higher root growth, especially P. halepensis, at low air temperature. By the end of the study, Mediterranean pines had larger root systems than mountain pines. Neither distribution of root mass with depth nor root-to-shoot mass ratio varied significantly among species. Across species, minimal annual rainfall to which species are exposed in their range related negatively to root growth but positively to specific root length and the time needed for roots to reach a depth of 40cm. This study highlights the importance of root growth as a driver of pine distribution in southern Europe and suggests that rapidly producing a large, deep root system may be a key attribute for pines to colonize dry Mediterranean locations.","[Andivia, Enrique; Villar-Salvador, Pedro] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Apdo 20, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Zuccarini, Paolo; Grau, Beatriz; de Herralde, Felicidad; Save, Robert] IRTA, Plant Sci Area, C-59,Km 12-1, Barcelona 08140, Spain; [Zuccarini, Paolo] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF, Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Save, R (reprint author), IRTA, Plant Sci Area, C-59,Km 12-1, Barcelona 08140, Spain.",e.andivia@gmail.com; p.zuccarini@creaf.uab.cat; beatriz.grau.s@gmail.com; felicidad.deherralde@irta.cat; pedro.villar@uah.es; robert.save@irta.cat,"Andivia, Enrique/B-3088-2017; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/L-1380-2014; de Herralde, Felicidad/A-2817-2014","Andivia, Enrique/0000-0002-9096-3294; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/0000-0001-9338-4530; de Herralde, Felicidad/0000-0003-1274-1482","(SERAVI), Centres CERCA of Generalitat de Catalunya [AGL2011-24296, CGL2014-53308-P]; postdoctoral grant ""Ayudas para contratos para la formacion postdoctoral"" [REMEDINAL 3 (S2013/MAE-2719)]; Spanish GovernmentInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [FPDI-2013-15573]","Research was supported by the projects Life MEDACC, AGL2011-24296 ECOLPIN (MICIIN), CGL2014-53308-P (SERAVI), Centres CERCA of Generalitat de Catalunya and the network REMEDINAL 3 (S2013/MAE-2719) of the CAM.

Here, we expand the classic pipe model to fine roots and predict isometric scaling relationships between leaf and fine root biomass and among all major biomass production components of individual trees. We also predict that fine root production scales more slowly against increases in leaf production across global forest ecosystems at the stand level. Using meta-analysis, we show fine root biomass scales isometrically against leaf biomass both at the individual tree and stand level. However, despite isometric scaling between stem and coarse root production, fine root production scales against leaf production with a slope of about 0.8 at the stand level, which probably results from more rapid increase of turnover rate in leaves than in fine roots.

By contrast, little is known about tree growth response to projected declines in winter snowpack and increases in soil freezing in seasonally snow-covered forest ecosystems, despite extensive documentation of the importance of winter climate in mediating ecological processes. We conducted a 5-year snow-removal experiment whereby snow was removed for the first 4-5 weeks of winter in a northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. Our results indicate that adverse impacts of reduced snowpack and increased soil freezing on the physiology of Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a dominant species across northern temperate forests, are accompanied by a 40 +/- 3% reduction in aboveground woody biomass increment, averaged across the 6 years following the start of the experiment. Further, we find no indication of growth recovery 1 year after cessation of the experiment. Based on these findings, we integrate spatial modeling of snowpack depth with forest inventory data to develop a spatially explicit, regional-scale assessment of the vulnerability of forest aboveground growth to projected declines in snowpack depth and increased soil frost. These analyses indicate that nearly 65% of sugar maple basal area in the northeastern United States resides in areas that typically experience insulating snowpack. However, under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios, we project a 49%-95% reduction in forest area experiencing insulating snowpack by the year 2099 in the northeastern United States, leaving large areas of northern forest vulnerable to these changes in winter climate, particularly along the northern edge of the region. Our study demonstrates that research focusing on growing season climate alone overestimates the stimulatory effect of warming temperatures on tree and forest growth in seasonally snow-covered forests.","[Reinmann, Andrew B.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Adv Sci Res Ctr, Environm Sci Initiat, New York, NY 10007 USA; [Reinmann, Andrew B.] Hunter Coll, Dept Geog, New York, NY USA; [Reinmann, Andrew B.; Susser, Jessica R.; Templer, Pamela H.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Demaria, Eleonora M.

Gains and losses of the gene modules required for cooperation punctuate symbiont phylogenies and drive lifestyle transitions between cooperative symbionts and uncooperative free-living lineages over evolutionary time. Yet whether uncooperative symbionts commonly evolve from within cooperative symbiont populations or from within distantly related lineages with antagonistic or free-living lifestyles (i.e., third-party mutualism exploiters or parasites), remains controversial. We use genomic data to show that genotypes that differ in the presence or absence of large islands of symbiosis genes are common within a single wild recombining population of Mesorhizobium symbionts isolated from host tissues and are an important source of standing heritable variation in cooperation in this population. In a focal population of Mesorhizobium, uncooperative variants that lack a symbiosis island segregate at 16% frequency in nodules, and genome size and symbiosis gene number are positively correlated with cooperation. This finding contrasts with the genomic architecture of variation in cooperation in other symbiont populations isolated from host tissues in which the islands of genes underlying cooperation are ubiquitous and variation in cooperation is primarily driven by allelic substitution and individual gene gain and loss events. Our study demonstrates that uncooperative mutants within mutualist populations can comprise a significant component of genetic variation in nature, providing biological rationale for models and experiments that seek to explain the maintenance of mutualism in the face of non-cooperators.","[Porter, Stephanie S.; Faber-Hammond, Joshua; Montoya, Angeliqua P.; Sackos, Cynthia] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Friesen, Maren L.] Washington State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Porter, SS (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",stephanine.porter@wsu.edu,,"Porter, Stephanie/0000-0002-1193-9705","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354878, DEB-1355216]; Washington State University, Vancouver","We thank Z Lopez and D Ross for assistance in the greenhouse.

Active restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities is increasingly recognized as a relevant strategy to combat invasive plant colonization in disturbed areas, but results are often unsatisfying. Historical effects, referred as ""priority effects"" (i.e. the effects generated by the order in which species arrive at a local site), can have a major role in community assembly and invasion success because they involve early colonists altering the performance of later colonists. Taking these priority effects into account in restoration projects is emerging as a relevant way to improve native species restoration success and prevent invasion. The present review discusses two strategies considering priority effects that would help to achieve the classic restoration goal of ""more natives, less invasives"". The first strategy relies on tackling priority effects of invasive plants using different management options adapted to local environmental conditions, including removal, reduction of propagule sources, or mitigation of soil legacies. Indeed, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects providing themselves a substantial competitive advantage through early emergence and quick growth, but also self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed ""soil legacies"". In fertile and stable conditions, the reduction of invasive species priority effects must be coupled with the restoration of an invasion-resistant native plant cover to avoid reinvasion and secondary invasions. The second strategy is to bring about situations in which the restored native species are more likely to exert strong priority effects, decreasing invasion success. For this purpose, we sketch possible options open to restorationists based on resource or non-resource mechanisms. First, we discuss ways to maximize resource preemption by extending the time advance given to restored native species and manipulating restored species characteristics. Second, we consider the potential effect of increasing niche overlap between native and invasive species. Third, we introduce the potential manipulations of non-resource mechanisms, such as allelopathy, herbivory, disease, or the presence of mycorrhizae, to increase priority effects. This review incorporates recent research on priority effects to draw the outlines of priority effects-based restoration strategies and define future research questions that need to be addressed to test and improve these strategies.","[Hess, Manon C.

In this study, we characterized morphological responses to experimentally induced drought stress in sun exposed and shaded current-year Norway spruce needles. In the drought plot trees were suffering mild drought stress, with an average soil water potential at 50 cm depth of -0.4 MPa. In general, morphological needle traits had greater values in sun needles in the upper canopy than in shaded needles in the lower canopy. Needle morphology 15 months after the onset of drought was determined by canopy position, as only sun needle morphology was affected by drought. Thus, canopy position was a stronger morphogenic factor determining needle structure than was water availability. The largest influence of mild drought was observed for needle length, projected needle area and total needle area, which all were reduced by similar to 27% relative to control trees. Needle thickness and needle width showed contrasting sensitivity to drought, as drought only affected needle thickness (10% reduction). Needle dry mass, leaf mass per area and needle density were not affected 15 months after the onset of mild drought. Our results highlight the importance of considering canopy position as well as water availability when comparing needle structure or function between conifer species. More knowledge about how different canopy parts of Norway spruce adapt to drought is important to understand forest productivity under changing environmental conditions.","[Gebauer, Roman; Volarik, Daniel; Urban, Josef] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocoenol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Urban, Josef] Siberian Fed Univ, Krasnoyarsk, Russia; [Borja, Isabella; Nagy, Nina Elisabeth; Eldhuset, Toril Drablos; Krokene, Paal] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, POB 115, N-1431 As, Norway","Gebauer, R (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocoenol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",gebo@email.cz,"Urban, Josef/A-8754-2013; Krokene, Paal/A-1835-2008","Urban, Josef/0000-0003-1730-947X; Krokene, Paal/0000-0002-7205-0715","project ""Indicators of Tree Vitality"" [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0265]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); EEA Financial Mechanism [A/CZ0046/2/0009]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [INTER-TRANSFER LTT17033]; Mendel University in Brno [IGA 73/2013]; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FP1106]","This work was funded by the project ""Indicators of Tree Vitality"" (Reg.

The species is a regionally important timber species for the wood industry and a significant host for various ectomycorrhizal fungi, including edible species. We analysed ectomycorrhizal community and fine root parameters of high continental / subalpine Norway spruce stands at three sites (Stara planina, Kopaonik, Tara) located in protected areas in Serbia. In addition, we assessed the potential effects of altitude and growing season on the ectomycorrhizal diversity and fine root parameters. Using standardised sampling in combination with morpho-anatomical and molecular identification of ectomycorrhizae, we recorded 29 different anatomorphotypes. None of the identified fungi belonged to commercial edible fungal species. Compared to other Norway spruce ectomycorrhiza studies in central Europe, sites in Serbia exhibited lower species diversity and different dominant species composition, with Cenococcum spp. and Russula spp. as the dominant ectomycorrhizal fungi. A number of ectomycorrhizal types and the value of the species richness index differed between Stara planina and Tara in the autumn, but the influence of site and season on the studied diversity indices was not significant. The total number of fine roots increased in the spring, while percentage of vital ectomycorrhizal root tips increased in the autumn. This study was the first examination of Norway spruce ectomycorrhizal communities at the edge of the natural geographical range of the species.","[Katanic, Marina; Orlovic, Sasa; Pekec, Sasa; Drekic, Milan] Univ Novi Sad, Inst Lowland Forestry & Environm, Antona Cehova 13, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Grebenc, Tine; Bajc, Marko; Kraigher, Hojka] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Katanic, M (reprint author), Univ Novi Sad, Inst Lowland Forestry & Environm, Antona Cehova 13, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",katanicm@uns.ac.rs,"Grebenc, Tine/V-1571-2019","Grebenc, Tine/0000-0003-4035-8587",Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [III 43002]; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P4-0107]; STSM under COST Action [FP1305],"This work is a part of the project III 43002 ""Biosensing technologies and global systems for continuous research and integrated management of ecosystems"", financed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia, the Research programme P4-0107 of the Slovenian Research Agency and STSM under COST Action FP1305 for M.

Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, Serendipitaceae (Sebacinales), Atractiellales, and Auriculariales were reported as putative mycobionts of Pleione. In particular, the mycorrhizal associations between subtropical orchids and Atractiellales have not been observed before. For the dominant mycobionts in the roots of Pleione and its related genera, Bletilla and Coelogyne, we detected no fungal OTU that was shared. Within Pleione, species with a sympatric distribution showed preferences for different fungi. Epiphytic and lithophytic individuals of Pleione albiflora shared OTUs of Tulasnellaceae but harbored different OTUs of Sebacinales, indicating some degree of fungal specificity toward certain habitats.

However, there are still few studies on invasive tree species traits conducted along resource gradients that allow for a comparison of acquisitive and conservative strategies. We aimed to assess the differences in trait variation among native, alien conservative and alien acquisitive tree species along resource availability gradients (soil fertility and light availability) and to assess the traits variability of the species studied along resources availability gradients. Our study compared invasive tree species in Europe (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L.) with their native competitors (Ater pseudoplatanus L., A. platanoides L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Fagus sylvatica L). The study was conducted on 1329 seedlings and saplings collected in a system of 372 study plots in W Poland. For each individual we assessed leaf, stem and root mass ratios, total biomass, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and projected leaf area. Two invasive species (P. serotina and R. pseueloacacia) represented a more acquisitive strategy than native species - along litter pH and light availability gradients these species had higher leaf mass fraction, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio. In contrast, Q. rubra had the highest total biomass and root mass fraction. Alien species usually had higher coefficients of variation of studied traits. This suggests that relatively high projected leaf area, as a way of filling space and outcompeting native species, may be reached in two ways - biomass allocation to leaves and control of leaf morphology or by overall growth rate. High variability of invasive species traits also suggests randomness in seedling survival, which similarly to the neutral theory of invasion, highlights the necessity of including randomness in modelling biological invasions.","[Dyderski, Marcin K.; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Dyderski, Marcin K.; Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Forest Protect, Fac Forestry, Wojska Polskiego 71c, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Dyderski, MK (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.; Dyderski, MK (reprint author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Forest Protect, Fac Forestry, Wojska Polskiego 71c, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",Marcin.Dyderski@gmail.com,"Dyderski, Marcin K/J-9022-2019","Dyderski, Marcin K/0000-0003-4453-2781","National Science Centre, Poland [2018/28/T/NZ8/00290]","The study was financed by National Science Centre, Poland, under the project no. 2015/19/N/NZ8/03822 entitled: 'Ecophysiological and ecological determinants of invasiveness of trees and shrubs with the examples of Padus serotina, Quercus rubra and Robinia pseudoacacia'.

Afforested trees exhibit distinct growth and survival strategies on distinct habitats on the Northern Loess Plateau in China. The objective of this study was to quantify tree transpiration discrepancies of two tree species aged > 30 years on different soil and topography conditions, and to explore the interactions with the atmosphere, hydrology, soil and topography, through long-term (up to seven years) observations of sap flow, meteorological factors and soil water contents (SWC). Results showed that mean whole-tree transpiration (T) of Salix matsudana and Populus simonii in the growing season were 46.7 and 175.2 kg d(-1), respectively, in a dam field, and were 5.6-fold and 4.2-fold the magnitude of that on a sloping field, respectively. Daily T was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with meteorological factors (i.e., reference evapotranspiration, ETo; solar radiation, R n ; vapor- pressure deficit, VPD). Daytime ETo explained 37% of S. matsudana variation in T on the sloping field, up to 77% of the variation on a dam field, and 80% of the variation in T from P. simonii on both fields. The T of S. matsudana was significantly positively correlated with SWC from topsoil to 200 cm depth, and the correlation increased (partial R up to 0.55 at 200 cm depth) as depth increased on sloping field. However, no consistent correlations between T and shallow depth SWC existed on S. matsudana and P. simonii on dam fields and P. simonii on sloping field. Annual rainfall soil-water recharge depth reached up to 600 cm in wet years, but only 120 cm in dry years on sloping field with aeolian sandy soil, and was 200 cm even in wet years in dam field with loessial soil. Trees on the dam field absorbed water mainly from shallow groundwater. Tree fine roots gathered in the subsurface soil on the sloping field but not in the dam field indicated a root distribution adaption to precipitation patterns and water-use strategy.

We studied the effects of thinning in a marginal forest by quantifying functional responses relating to growth, carbon and water fluxes. Two experimental plots were established, one thinned in 2012 and the other one left as a control. The environmental conditions varied substantially during the 4-year study period, although dry years predominated. There were signs of dieback in the control with a decreasing inter-annual trend in LAI, as opposed to the treated plots, where LAI by the end of the study almost reached pre-thinning levels. Sap flow and transpiration were greatly enhanced by the treatment, with thinned trees transpiring 22.41 tree(-1) day(-1) in the growing season, about twice the control figures. The seasonal patterns of transpiration and soil moisture were uncoupled, indicating a contribution of deep groundwater to the former flux. In the control, limitations to water and carbon dynamics (canopy conductance) occurred at soil moisture values below 16%, whereas in the thinned trees these limitations appeared when soil moisture dropped below 10%. Overall, oaks' transpiration was enhanced with thinning to the point that stand-water use surpassed that of the control by the second half of the study period, averaging 24% of gross rainfall in both plots. Soil evaporation increased from 12 to 20% of gross rainfall after treatment in the overall period. The treatment had a profound watering effect in this marginal forest, led by fewer trees using the same amount of water as those in the untreated overstocked plot. This research may provide guidelines for ecohydrology-oriented silviculture in stands experiencing tree encroachment and transformation into shrublands that are more prone to global change-induced disturbances.","[del Campo, Antonio D.; Gonzalez-Sanchis, Maria; Garcia-Prats, Alberto; Lull, Cristina] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Res Grp Forest Sci & Technol Re ForeST, Camf Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Ceacero, Carlos J.] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Fisiol Anat & Biol Celular, E-41013 Seville, Spain","del Campo, AD (reprint author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Res Grp Forest Sci & Technol Re ForeST, Camf Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",ancamga@upv.es,"Noguera, Cristina Lull/I-4201-2015; Garcia-Prats, Alberto/S-5668-2019; del Campo, Antonio/F-7445-2014","Noguera, Cristina Lull/0000-0001-9270-2365; Garcia-Prats, Alberto/0000-0001-5605-8349; del Campo, Antonio/0000-0002-5279-4215","HYDROSIL [CGL2011-28776-C02-02]; SILWAMED [CGL2014-58127-C3-2]; CEHYRFO-MED [CGL2017-86839-C3-2-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain; FEDER fund of the EU","This study is a component of the research projects HYDROSIL (CGL2011-28776-C02-02), SILWAMED (CGL2014-58127-C3-2) and CEHYRFO-MED (CGL2017-86839-C3-2-R), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and the FEDER fund of the EU.

Few studies, however, have evaluated the response of aggregate-associated SOC and GRSP to freeze-thaw cycles (FTs) under different patterns of vegetation restoration. Soil samples were collected from three typical natural-succession grasslands (dominated by Artemisia capalaris, A. sacrorum, and Bothriochloa ischaemum) and a Chinese pine (Pains tabuliformis) forest before and after natural FTs during a winter-spring season on the Loess Plateau in China. The soil aggregate stability and concentrations of SOC, easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and total GRSP (T-GRSP) in different aggregate fractions were measured. The FTs decreased the proportion of > 5.0 mm wet-sieved fractions, increased the proportion of < 0.25 mm wet-sieved fractions, and decreased the mean weight diameters by 8.7, 9.5, 2.9, and 9.4% in the soils of A. capiilaris, A. sacrorum, B. ischaemum, and P. tabuliformis, respectively. The SOC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP concentrations in each aggregate fraction generally decreased after FTs in the four vegetation types. The SOC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP concentrations did not differ significantly in the larger aggregate fractions before the FTs in the soils for B. ischaemum and P. tabuliformis, but their concentrations were significantly higher for B. ischaemum than P. tabuliformis after FTs. The SOC and GRSP concentrations were significantly and linearly correlated in most aggregate fractions both before and after the FTs. These results indicated that the FTs decreased SOC by decreasing the GRSP concentration in each aggregate fraction and that SOC was more sensitive to FTs in forest than in natural-succession grassland.","[Xiao, Lie; Zhang, Yang; Li, Peng; Xu, Guoce; Shi, Peng; Zhang, Yi] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, 5 South Jinhua Rd, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Li, P (reprint author), Xian Univ Technol, 5 South Jinhua Rd, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lipeng74@163.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402404]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41701603, 41330858, 41471226, 41731289]; Consultation and Evaluation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2018-Z02-A-008]","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0402404), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41701603, 41330858, 41471226, and 41731289), and the Consultation and Evaluation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2018-Z02-A-008).",,60,6,6,59,192,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,15-Jan,2019,334,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.07.043,,,8,Soil Science,Agriculture,GW7AL,WOS:000447116100001,,,Y,N,10/31/19J,"Muneer, MA; Wang, M; Jing, Z; Zhou, X; Wang, P; Li, L; Ji, B",,,,"Muneer, M.

However, it remains unclear about the symbiotic relationship between AM fungal communities and the dominant grass species in the steppe ecosystem. We thus examined the species diversity and community composition of AM fungi colonizing three dominant plant species (Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis and Cleistogenes squarrosa), using field sampling and molecular analyses, in Xilinguole steppe, Inner Mongolia. Our results showed all three plants were well colonized by AM fungi, and 51 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to six genera with members of Glomus dominating in the roots of all the three plants species. By comparison, we found that L. chinensis had the most diverse AM fungi within the roots. OTU richness of AM fungi was higher in the roots of S. grandis than in the roots of C. squarrosa and L. chinensis. However, the community composition of AM fungi in three host plant species showed no significant difference. Based on these findings, we concluded that the dominant plant species held diverse AM fungal taxa in their roots, while the host preference did not significantly drive the differences in AM fungal community composition within their roots and resulted in low host specificity. Findings of this study would broaden the concept of host specificity and its implications on plant succession in the largest grassland ecosystem of China","[Muneer, M.

Between 2016 and 2018 a field experiment was conducted at the Gorzyn Experimental and Educational Station, Poznan University of Life Sciences in Poland. During the three years of the experiment the foliar fertilisers and biostimulants significantly stimulated the catalytic dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and alkaline phosphatase activity (PAL) in all the experimental variants, as compared to the control variant. The analysis of the results of acid phosphatase activity (PAC) during the entire soybean growing period showed that it decreased significantly compared to the control variant when Tytanit, Rooter and Bolero Mo preparations were applied. Additionally, the analysis of catalase activity (CAT) revealed that apart from Tytanit, all the preparations significantly stimulated this enzyme, as compared with the control variant. The field analyses of biological nitrogen fixation showed that the fertilisers and biostimulants significantly stimulated nitrogenase activity under the soybean plantation.","[Niewiadomska, A.; Wolna-Maruwka, A.; Waraczewska, Z.; Gluchowska, K.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Gen & Environm Microbiol, Ul Szydlowska 50, PL-60656 Poznan, Poland; [Sulewska, H.; Ratajczak, K.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Agron, Ul Dojazd 11, PL-60632 Poznan, Poland; [Budka, A.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Math & Stat Methods, Ul Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland","Niewiadomska, A (reprint author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Gen & Environm Microbiol, Ul Szydlowska 50, PL-60656 Poznan, Poland.",alicja.niewiadomska@up.poznan.pl,,,Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Republic of Poland,This research was financed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Republic of Poland in the framework of the Multi-annual Program 'Increasing the use of domestic feed protein for the production of high quality animal products in conditions of balanced development' implemented at the Department of Agronomy of the University of Life Sciences in Poznan.,,58,0,0,0,0,CORVINUS UNIV BUDAPEST,BUDAPEST,"VILLANYI UT 29/43, BUDAPEST, H-1118, HUNGARY",1589-1623,1785-0037,,APPL ECOL ENV RES,Appl.

Definitions of biological individuality are often indirectly dependent on genetic sampling -and vice versa. Genetic sampling typically focuses on a particular locus or set of loci, found in the the mitochondrial, chloroplast or nuclear genome. If ecological function or evolutionary individuality can be defined on the level of multiple divergent genomes, as I shall argue is the case in IGH, our current genetic sampling strategies and analytic approaches may miss out on relevant biodiversity. Now that more and more examples of IGH are available, it is becoming possible to investigate the positive and negative effects of IGH on the functioning and evolution of multicellular individuals more systematically. I consider some examples and argue that studying diversity through the lens of IGH facilitates thinking not in terms of units, but in terms of interactions between biological entities. This, in turn, enables a fresh take on the ecological and evolutionary significance of biological diversity.","[Boon, Eva] Eindhoven Tech Univ, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Boon, E (reprint author), Eindhoven Tech Univ, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",E.Boon@tue.nl,,,,,,74,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2211-1948,,978-3-030-10991-2;

In South Africa salt marsh covers 11,788.8 ha with the largest areas occurring in the Berg, Olifants, Orange and Langebaan Estuaries. The changing climate necessitates in-depth studies on the responses of these plants so that we can understand and predict future changes in their abundance and diversity. Responses of salt marsh plants to abiotic stressors are reviewed and it is shown that, on a local ecosystem scale, distribution of species is driven by moisture/inundation levels and salinity gradients. Ecophysiology studies have been completed on at least 15 salt marsh species in South Africa, focusing on the responses of salt marsh plants to various factorial combinations of abiotic stressors. Studies also exist on characterization and zonation of salt marsh habitats and have significantly affected salt marsh management policy. Salt marsh plants respond to osmotic and ionic stress through reduction in growth and increase in root: shoot ratio, ion sequestration and accumulation of ionic and compatible organic solutes for osmoregulation. These responses are similar, whether elicited by soil moisture deficit or salinity, but may vary in intensity. Submergence results in increased cytoplasmic acidosis, membrane lipid peroxidation and a rapid increase in reactive oxygen species. Physiologically, tolerant species respond to submergence by down-regulating metabolism, increased synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and up-regulating compatible osmolytes. This translates into increased species growth. These responses collectively determine salt marsh zonation and are important, especially in the context of climate change.","[Tabot, Pascal Tabi; Adams, Janine Barbara] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Tabot, Pascal Tabi] Univ Buea, Higher Tech Teachers Training Coll Kumba, Dept Agr, POB 63, Buea, Cameroon","Tabot, PT (reprint author), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa.; Tabot, PT (reprint author), Univ Buea, Higher Tech Teachers Training Coll Kumba, Dept Agr, POB 63, Buea, Cameroon.",ttabot@yahoo.com; Janine.Adams@nmmu.ac.za,,,,,,141,0,0,0,0,CABI PUBLISHING-C A B INT,WALLINGFORD,"CABI PUBLISHING, WALLINGFORD 0X10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78639-434-7; 978-1-78639-433-0,,,,2019,,,,,,,69,88,,,,,20,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BN5OH,WOS:000484034400006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Li, LY; Feng, CX; Zhang, YD",,,,"Li, L.

However, qualitative and quantitative methods for analysis of root exudates are poorly developed. In this study, Fraxinus mandshurica was used as research material for studying the influence of different collection times on the chemical composition of root exudate. The study employed qualitative and metabolomic analyses of root exudates with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitatively analyzed root exudates of F. mandshurica with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high performance ion chromatography (HPIC) methods. Root exudates were collected after harvest for 24 h at 6 h-intervals, and then analyzed. The types of sugars, amino acids, and organic acids in the root exudates were not significantly different among the four exudate samples. The results indicated that collection time strongly influenced the level of organic compounds in root exudates from F. mandshurica, with an optimal collection time of 12 h. In addition, quantitative analysis of root exudates using UPLC and HPIC had greater advantage, when compared with conventional analytical methods.","[Li, L. Y.; Feng, C. X.; Zhang, Y.

As in many orchid species, mycorrhizal symbiotic seed germination is recognized as a powerful tool for orchid seedling propagation, reintroduction, and species conservation. Obtaining efficient and specific fungi for enhancing seed germination, protocorm formation, and further seedling development is a prerequisite. In this study, eight purified fungal strains were isolated from host orchid protocorms via an ex situ baiting technique. Phylogenetic analysis using ITS-rDNA placed the eight fungal strains into the taxa Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, and Sebacinales, the typical orchid mycorrhizal symbionts. The fungi induced seed germination and also increased growth during protocorm formation, seedling formation, and seedling development. One strain in particular (SSCDO-5) exhibited significant benefits under 12/12 h light/dark conditions between 20 and 90 days after sowing. Our results suggest that inoculation with the fungus SSCDO-5 might assist in the propagation of D. catenatum and could be employed ex situ and in situ for conservation purposes.","[Shao, S-C; Xi, H-P; Mohandass, D.] Chinese Acad Sci, Gardening & Hort Dept, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Xishuangbanna 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Mohandass, D (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Gardening & Hort Dept, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Xishuangbanna 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",dmohandass997@yahoo.com,,,,,,37,0,0,9,9,CORVINUS UNIV BUDAPEST,BUDAPEST,"VILLANYI UT 29/43, BUDAPEST, H-1118, HUNGARY",1589-1623,1785-0037,,APPL ECOL ENV RES,Appl.

This research was conducted in the Hyrcanian forest in Iran, where shallow landslides are frequent due to road construction. The effect of the root biotechnical characteristics of Alnus subcordata, Paulownia fortunei and Populus deltoides each one in 2-, 10- and 15-year-old plantations was assessed. The profile trenching method was used in this study to obtain the root area ratio of individual species by counting the number of roots and measuring the root diameter. For each species, single root specimens were sampled and tested for tensile tests in the laboratory using the standard Instron apparatus. The natural moisture content (two weeks after rainfall), Atterberg limits, shear strength of the soil were determined for plantations, stable and unstable sites. Results of this study indicated that plastic index and internal friction angle decreased with increasing root diameter rate. Moreover, internal friction angle and cohesion increased with increasing root area ratio and root diameter and density index. Tensile strength of roots decreased with increasing stand age. The highest and the lowest tensile strengths among species were observed for Paulownia fortunei and Populus deltoides, respectively. The findings of this research contribute to expanding the knowledge of root biotechnical properties of some tree species and to the choice of the most appropriate species for improving plastic index and shear strength in landslide prone areas.","[Pourmalekshah, Ali Akbar Mohammad Ali; Moayeri, Mohamad Hadi; Parsakhoo, Aidin] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Forestry, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran","Pourmalekshah, AAMA (reprint author), Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Forestry, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.",Pourmalekshah@gmail.com,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-4834,1805-935X,,J FOR SCI-PRAGUE,J.

A randomized block design with four replications and treatments arranged in a split-plot scheme was installed. The plot consisted of two shading levels (50% and 75%) and subplots of four types of substrates: soil; soil + sand (1:1): soil + sand + sawdust (2:1:1); and soil + vermiculite (1:1). Each experimental plot consisted of five seedlings. The seedlings were evaluated for a set of shoot and root morphological and physiological traits. At the end of the experiment, the isolation and the phenotypic characterization of bacteria from nodules collected in the seedlings were also carried out. The characterization was performed by the morphological evaluation of the colonies. The shading of 50% is indicated for seedling productions, while in relation to the substrate, that one composed by soil + sand is what produces seedlings of better quality. Although the number of isolates was not influenced by the substrate type and the shading level, taxi-branco seedlings establish symbiosis with a great diversity of rhizobia. Most of the isolates have very fast growth rate and acid pH of the culture medium.","[de Souza, Juciane Casaes] Univ Estadual Roraima, Agroecol, Rua 7 Setembro,231, BR-69306530 Boa Vista, RR, Brazil; [Pedrozo, Cassia Angela] Embrapa Roraima, Rodovia BR 174,Km 174, BR-69301970 Boa Vista, RR, Brazil; [da Silva, Krisle] Embrapa Florestas, Estr Ribeira,Km 111,Parque Monte Castelo, BR-83411000 Colombo, PR, Brazil; [Aragao Oliveria, Vanubia Ximendes; da Silva Alencar, Andressa Maria] Fac Cathedral, Av Luis Canuto Chaves 293, BR-69307053 Boa Vista, RR, Brazil","de Souza, JC (reprint author), Univ Estadual Roraima, Agroecol, Rua 7 Setembro,231, BR-69306530 Boa Vista, RR, Brazil.",jucianecasaes@hotmail.com; cassia.pedrozo@embrapa.br; krisle.silva@embrapa.br; vanubia.ximendes@hotmail.com; andressa.silvaalencar@hotmail.com,,,,,,38,0,0,1,1,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

This is particularly important to the practice of restoration-friendly cultivation for conserving over-collected medicinal orchids, for example, many species of Dendrobium in China. In this study, we comparatively investigated the effects of fungi from roots and protocorms/seedlings on seed germination, protocorm formation and seedling development in Dendrobium exile. A total of 7 different fungal species were obtained, including three rhizoctonia fungi (Tulasnella sp. DerIV, Tulasnella sp. DerV and Tulasnella sp. DesI), three non-rhizoctonia fungi (Nodulisporium sp. DerI, Xylaria plebeja DerII, Colletotrichum sp. DerIII) and one unidentified fungus DesII. Among the three rhizoctonia fungi, DesI isolated from seedlings was more efficient at supporting seed germination up to seedlings than the two fungi (DerIV and DerV) isolated from adult roots. At 45 days of incubation, 70.93 +/- 6.92% of seeds developed into seedlings in DesI treatment, while no seedlings were developed in the DerIV and DerV treatments. Our results indicated that orchids may need different fungal partners for seed symbiotic germination vs. adult plant development. The diverse fungi residing in the roots could have potentially diverse functions. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Beneficial effects of the strain on host seedlings were then investigated by pouring 20% PEG6000 for 3 weeks to mimic drought stress. Among growth parameters, root biomass and root-shoot ratio were significantly enhanced by the combination of 20% PEG6000 with the strain inoculation while the individual trial had no effect. The combination trial also increased calycosin-7-O-glucoside and ononin accumulations in the roots, suggesting that the strain executed beneficial effects on A. mongholicus only when it grew under drought stress.

The invasive species had a lower root mass ratio, but the roots were more branched with a greater ratio of absorbing roots and a better development of the root hairs. As a result, H. sosnowskyi had a higher growth rate of absorbing roots (by 2 times) and a larger absorbing surface in relation to the total root surface. We concluded that the structural and functional traits of the leaves and roots provided a 2 times higher net assimilation rate (NAR) and 2.5 times larger RGR in the invasive species H. sosnowskyi.","[Betekhtina, A.

The potential of using growth rings as markers of plant growth response to more ecological phenomena such as periodic disturbance still remains mostly untapped. By monitoring the 2016 growth increment of 64 individuals of a common milkweed species (Asclepias viridis) from the US tallgrass prairie system we investigate plant response to factorial treatments of early season shoot removal and neighbor thinning. These treatments simulate bouts of herbivory, grazing, and dormant-season fire, each of which should have differential effects on plant growth. Neighbor thinning had the strongest effects of the study, moderately increasing ring widths. Conversely, ring widths were moderately decreased by shoot removal. Individual age had negative effects on ring width. These results are the first evidence of herbaceous annual ring sensitivity to sudden amelioration of resources as well as a significant loss of aboveground biomass. Herb-chronology could be useful in future studies monitoring the effects of disturbance on plant growth, increasing our understanding of these phenomena and their overall effect on grassland composition.","[Dee, Justin R.; Palmer, Michael W.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant Biol Ecol & Evolut, 301 Phys Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Dee, JR (reprint author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant Biol Ecol & Evolut, 301 Phys Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jrdee@okstate.edu,,,,,,55,0,0,3,3,TREE-RING SOC,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, TREE-RING LABORATORY, BLDG 58, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1536-1098,2162-4585,,TREE-RING RES,Tree-Ring Res.,JAN,2019,75,1,,,,,14,24,,10.3959/1536-1098-75.1.14,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,HX4TQ,WOS:000467393700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sun, XD; Wang, WN; Razaq, M; Sun, HL",,,,"Sun, Xudong; Wang, Wenna; Razaq, Muhammad; Sun, Hailong",,,Effects of stand density on soil organic carbon storage in the top and deep soil layers of Fraxinus mandshurica plantations,AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Manchurian Ash; Afforestation; Litter input; Carbon sequestration; Refractory; Respiration; Dissolved organic carbon; Fine root biomass,PINUS-DENSIFLORA FOREST; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; LITTER INPUT; NITROGEN; MATTER; DYNAMICS; SEQUESTRATION; RESPIRATION; MANAGEMENT,"Forests stand density has been reported to influence soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, yet this effect is often inconsistent. Especially for SOC in deep soil layers few studies examined its changes with stand density. In this study we investigated the effects of stand density on SOC storage by collecting soil samples from a Fraxinus manshurica plantation at three different stand densities. We took samples at two soil depths from 0-10 cm (top layer) and 40-60 cm (deep layer), fractionated the soil material with a 0.4 mm mesh to remove the labile fraction and then used the sieved material for laboratory incubation. Soil properties in different stand densities were examined before the incubation. After the incubation, soil respiration and the final carbon balance were determined. Our results indicate that the SOC storage increased with increasing stand density in both top and deep layers. The fractionation lowered the carbon concentration in both layers with the reduction in the top layer being highest at the low stand density site, while in deep layer it was highest at middle stand density. At the end of the incubation, total respiration in the top layer decreased with increasing stand density, whereas it remained invariable in the deep layer. The specific respiration decreased with increasing stand density in both layers. Addition of leaf litter after incubation resulted in an increase of the carbon content in top soil samples with the scale of accumulation increasing with increasing stand density. We concluded that the increasing SOC storage with stand density is due to its resistance versus microorganisms in top soil layer and not related to deep soil layer.","[Sun, Xudong; Sun, Hailong] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenna] Hainan Univ, Inst Trop Agr & Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Razaq, Muhammad] Univ Sargodha, Coll Agr, Dept Forestry, Sargodha 40100, Pakistan","Sun, HL (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",shlong12@126.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0600605],This research is funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFD0600605).,,50,0,0,3,3,OSTERREICHISCHER AGRARVERLAG,VIENNA 1,"BANKGASSE 13, 1014 VIENNA 1, AUSTRIA",0379-5292,0375-524X,,AUSTRIAN J FOR SCI,Austrian J.

In this study, we used plant presence, species richness, plant species-specificity, and harvesting activity information obtained by reviewing papers published from 1993 to 2018 to elucidate the key factors that drive CH4 emission from constructed wetlands. Although it was not statistically significant, plant presence increased the CH4 emissions compared to unvegetated conditions and relatively lower values were observed for constructed wetlands planted with Acorus calamus, Cyperus papyrus or Juncus effusus. The use of a single plant species not only changed the production and consumption of CH4 by affecting the functioning of roots but also influenced the process of CH4 entering the atmosphere under different transport capacities. The CH4 flux reached 1.0686 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1) from the Zizania latifolia system, which is eight times larger than that of the Phalaris arundinacea system. The mixed systems exhibited a positive increase in CH4 flux with plant species richness due to the complementary effects of the root exudates excreted from different plants. The minimum CH4 value (-0.0084 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was observed in the three-species system (Oenanthe javanica, Phalaris arundinacea and J. effusus). These results demonstrate that selecting several species with lower methane fluxes such as Typha latifolia and C. papyrus and suitably regulating harvesting in constructed wetlands can be more effective for mitigating the potential of CH4 emissions while maintaining the efficiency of sewage purification.","[Xu, Guangming; Li, Yue; Wang, Sen; Kong, Fanlong; Yu, Zhengda] Qingdao Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China","Kong, FL; Yu, ZD (reprint author), Qingdao Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China.",kongfanlong@qdu.edu.cn; yuzhengda@qdu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41771098],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41771098].,,90,0,0,5,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0270-5060,2156-6941,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

The influence of mycorrhizic fungi on the formation of water stable aggregates through glomalin and on soil carbon content has been studied. We sampled the rhizosphere of representative trees (Olneya tesota, Prosopis juliflora, and Parkinsonia microphylla), and shrubs (Jatropha cuneata and Larrea tridentata) of the Sonoran Desert for four seasons in order to evaluate the mycorrhizal status, carbon and glomalin accumulation, and their relationship with water stable aggregates. Results showed that mycorrhizic association is present all the year on studied plants, with values from 1.2 to 57% of mycorrhizal colonization, with variations depending on the season. The accumulation of carbon in the soil profile has significant differences between plants and ranged from 1.1 to 1.75% for Larrea and Prosopis, respectively. The water stable aggregates were significantly different between plants and ranged between 24% and 42%.

Despite their long-recognized role, little attention has been given to their development on waste rock slopes subject to rapid drainage. This study was conducted in an open-pit gold mine in a boreal forest. Its main objective was to establish a plantation design with a moderate level of competition for water resources on a waste rock slope. A hybrid poplar plantation was established in May 2013 on a soil-covered waste rock slope of 33%. The experimental design included three different poplar spacings: 1 x 1 m, 2 x 2 m without herbaceous seeding, 2 x 2 m with herbaceous seeding and 4 x 4 m. The poplars responded to increased competition resulting from closer spacing and herbaceous seeding by investing less energy in diameter and height growth. Poplar individuals that were subject to high levels of competition were able to acclimatize to water stress conditions by increasing root length density and specific root length and by reducing above-ground biomass. This study indicates that some clones of hybrid poplar showing phenotypic plasticity in the ratio of above- and belowground growth can be adapted for short-term revegetation of mine sites.","[Babi, Khadija; Guittonny, Marie; Bussiere, Bruno] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Res Inst Mines & Environm, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada; [Larocque, Guy R.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Stn St Foy, Ste Foy, PQ, Canada","Guittonny, M (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Res Inst Mines & Environm, 445 Boul Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada.",Marie.Guittonny@uqat.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RDCPJ 462610-13]; Canadian Malartic Partnership,This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; grant number RDCPJ 462610-13) and the Canadian Malartic Partnership,,92,0,0,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2019,26,2,,,,,149,163,,10.1080/11956860.2018.1538591,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HN1UO,WOS:000459972700005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ballian, D; Lizdo, E; Bogunic, F",,,,"Ballian, Dalibor; Lizdo, Emir; Bogunic, Faruk",,,ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES OF GROWTH AND PHENOLOGY OF PROVENANCES OF SCOTS PINE (Pinus sylvestris L.)

The experiment was established during the spring of 2012 with plants of two years old (2 + 0). A total of 1,800 seedlings of ordinary Scot pine were planted in the experimental design of a casual block system adapted to the terrain, 15 provenances in five repetitions (5 x 36 seedlings). The experiment is made up of ten European countries: Austria (Traisen, Rein, Sistrans), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bugojno), Ukraine (Ivano Frankivsk), Slovakia (I Ianusovce), Romania (Sacueini), Norway (Narvik, Ames), Germany (Teisendorf Trippstadt), Poland (Raciane - Nida) and Italy (Ca del Lupo, Fenestrelle, Piani - Valda). The results of morphological and physiological researches relate to differences in survival, height, root neck diameter, and spring phenomenon of bud opening. The total number of seedlings measured is 1830, with the percentage of survival in the year 2017 being 67.70%, and ranging from 35.50% (Italy I1) to 87.70% (Austria A1). Descriptive analysis of the diameter of the root neck was found to have the highest mean diameter of Austria A 1 (4.07 cm). The lowest value of the average diameter of the root neck has plants originating in Norway Ni (1.19 cm), root diameter values ranged from 0.30 cm to Norway N1, which is the minimum of 9.30 cm for Austria 1 which represents the maximum when it comes to the average diameter of the neck of the root. With an average height of 116.26 cm, the provenance of Poland P1 shows the highest average value for altitude, while the plants from Norway N1 have the lowest average value for a height of 40.52 cm. All studies have shown a variance analysis that statistically significant differences between investigated provenances are present, as confirmed by Duncan's test. On the basis of the analysis carried out, it can be concluded that on the basis of the height of the only N1 and Italy I1 provenances, they are separated into separate groups because they have noticeable and far least average values of the seedlings height. On the other hand, as far as diameter on the root of the root can be seen only the N1 Norway proves itself into a separate group with by far the smallest mean diameter. Based on phenological observations, there is variability between all provenances. Differences in movement, duration and end of individual phenomena have been established. As a start of ordinary Scot pine tree vegetation in the international experiment on Kupres can be taken on April 26 because in the three provenances this day the opening of the buds began. In the other 12 provenances the opening of the buds began on May 3, and on 21 June it was noted that the plants in all fifteen investigated the origins have come to the final stage, that is, they have completely formed needles of green color. The first results of the phenological observations show that these studies should continue to determine the overall genetic diversity of ordinary wrinkles, to determine the success and genetic variability of provenances, as well as the behavior and success of different provenances at a given locality. Ordinary pine is genetically differentiated into ecological and vegetation areas, and shows different morphological and physiological characteristics from different areas. This indicates the separation of northern provenances. The research results obtained at the early juvenile stage are incomplete, often burdened with various disadvantages, and very often different from those obtained at later stages, and such research has to be carried out in continuity.","[Ballian, Dalibor; Bogunic, Faruk] Univ Sarajevu, Sumarski Fak, Zagrebacka 20, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Ballian, Dalibor] Gozdarski Inst Slovenije, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Lizdo, Emir] Sumarstvo Prenj Konj, Konjic, Bosnia & Herceg","Ballian, D (reprint author), Univ Sarajevu, Sumarski Fak, Zagrebacka 20, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",balliandalibor9@gmail.com,,,,,,26,0,0,2,2,CROATIAN FORESTRY SOC,ZAGREB,"TRG MAZURANICA 11, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",0373-1332,1846-9140,,SUMAR LIST,Sumar.

The relationship between rooting depth and above-ground hydraulic traits can potentially define drought resistance strategies that are important in determining species distribution and coexistence in seasonal tropical forests, and understanding this is important for predicting the effects of future climate change in these ecosystems. 2. We assessed the rooting depth of 12 dominant tree species (representing c. 42% of the forest basal area) in a seasonal Amazon forest using the stable isotope ratios (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of water collected from tree xylem and soils from a range of depths. We took advantage of a major ENSO-related drought in 2015/2016 that caused substantial evaporative isotope enrichment in the soil and revealed water use strategies of each species under extreme conditions. We measured the minimum dry season leaf water potential both in a normal year (2014; Psi(non-ENSO)) and in an extreme drought year (2015; Psi(ENSO)). Furthermore, we measured xylem hydraulic traits that indicate water potential thresholds trees tolerate without risking hydraulic failure (P-50 and P-88). 3. We demonstrate that coexisting trees are largely segregated along a single hydrological niche axis defined by root depth differences, access to light and tolerance of low water potential. These differences in rooting depth were strongly related to tree size; diameter at breast height (DBH) explained 72% of the variation in the delta O-18(xylem). Additionally, delta O-18(xylem) explained 49% of the variation in P-50 and 70% of P-88, with shallow-rooted species more tolerant of low water potentials, while delta O-18 of xylem water explained 47% and 77% of the variation of minimum Psi(non-ENSO) and Psi(ENSO). 4. We propose a new formulation to estimate an effective functional rooting depth, i.e. the likely soil depth from which roots can sustain water uptake for physiological functions, using DBH as predictor of root depth at this site. Based on these estimates, we conclude that rooting depth varies systematically across the most abundant families, genera and species at the Tapajos forest, and that understorey species in particular are limited to shallow rooting depths. 5. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance, which also affect the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest. 6. Synthesis. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and demonstrate its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance (access to deep water vs. tolerance of very low water potentials). We found that the single hydrological axis defining water use traits was strongly related to tree size, and infer that periodic extreme droughts influence community composition and the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest.","[Brum, Mauro; Barros, Fernanda; Bittencourt, Paulo; Pereira, Luciano; Oliveira, Rafael S.] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.; Asbjornsen, Heidi] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ivanov, Valeriy] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Asbjornsen, Heidi] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Saleska, Scott] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Alves, Luciana F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Penha, Deliane] Fed Univ Western Para UFOPA, Soc Nat & Dev Dept, Santarem, PA, Brazil; [Dias, Jadson D.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Nucl Energy Agr CENA, Lab Isotop Ecol, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Aragao, Luiz E.

Understanding the forces that govern the assembly of RAMs is key to sustainable ecosystem management. Here, we dissected RAMs according to functional guilds and combined phylogenetic and multivariate analyses to distinguish and quantify the forces driving RAM assembly processes. Across large biogeographic scales (>1,000 km) in temperate forests (>100 plots), RAMs were taxonomically highly distinct but composed of a stable trophic structure encompassing symbiotrophic, ectomycorrhizal (55%), saprotrophic (7%), endotrophic (3%) and pathotrophic fungi (<1%). Taxonomic community composition of RAMs is explained by abiotic factors, forest management intensity, dominant tree family (Fagaceae, Pinaceae) and root resource traits. Local RAM assemblies are phylogenetically clustered, indicating stronger habitat filtering on roots in dry, acid soils and in conifer stands than in other forest types. The local assembly of ectomycorrhizal communities is driven by forest management intensity. At larger scales, root resource traits and soil pH shift the assembly process of ectomycorrhizal fungi from deterministic to neutral. Neutral or weak deterministic assembly processes are prevalent in saprotrophic and endophytic guilds. The remarkable consistency of the trophic composition of the RAMs suggests that temperate forests attract fungal assemblages that afford functional resilience under the current range of climatic and edaphic conditions. At local scales, the filtering processes that structure symbiotrophic assemblies can be influenced by forest management and tree selection, but at larger scales, environmental cues and host resource traits are the most prevalent forces.","[Schroeter, Kristina; Pena, Rodica; Polle, Andrea] Univ Goettingen, Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Wemheuer, Bernd; Daniel, Rolf] Univ Goettingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, Genom & Appl Microbiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Wemheuer, Bernd; Daniel, Rolf] Univ Goettingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, Gottingen Genom Lab, Gottingen, Germany; [Wemheuer, Bernd] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Schoening, Ingo] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Ehbrecht, Martin; Schall, Peter; Ammer, Christian] Univ Goettingen, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Gottingen, Germany","Polle, A (reprint author), Univ Goettingen, Forest Bot & Tree Physiol, Gottingen, Germany.",apolle@gwdg.de,"Schall, Peter/Q-5962-2019; Schoning, Ingo/D-3341-2009","Schall, Peter/0000-0003-4808-818X; Schoning, Ingo/0000-0002-9830-5026; Daniel, Rolf/0000-0002-8646-7925","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [PO362/18-2, PO362/18-3, PE2256/1-1, AM147/14-1]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: PO362/18-2, 18-3, PE2256/1-1 and AM147/14-1",,125,3,3,22,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

This is why conifer monocultures of Scots pine and Norway spruce, widely promoted in Central Europe since the 18th and 19th century, are currently converted into mixed stands with naturally dominant European beech. Biodiversity is expected to benefit from these mixtures compared to pure conifer stands due to increased abiotic and biotic resource heterogeneity. Evidence for this assumption is, however, largely lacking. Here, we investigated the diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens at the plot (alpha diversity) and at the landscape (gamma diversity) level in pure and mixed stands of European beech and conifer species (Scots pine, Norway spruce, Douglas fir) in four regions in Germany. We aimed to identify compositions of pure and mixed stands in a hypothetical forest landscape that can optimize gamma diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens within regions. Results show that gamma diversity of the investigated groups is highest when a landscape comprises different pure stands rather than tree species mixtures at the stand scale. Species mainly associated with conifers rely on light regimes that are only provided in pure conifer forests, whereas mixtures of beech and conifers are more similar to beech stands. Combining pure beech and pure conifer stands at the landscape scale can increase landscape level biodiversity and conserve species assemblages of both stand types, while landscapes solely composed of stand scale tree species mixtures could lead to a biodiversity reduction of a combination of investigated groups of 7 up to 20%.","[Heinrichs, Steffi; Ammer, Christian; Mund, Martina; Budde, Sabine; Schmidt, Wolfgang; Weckesser, Martin; Schall, Peter] Univ Goettingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Boch, Steffen] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Mueller, Joerg] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Mueller, Joerg] Heinz Sielmann Fdn, Nat Conservat Dept, Unter Kiefern 9, D-14641 Wustermark, Germany; [Schoening, Ingo; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Heinrichs, S (reprint author), Univ Goettingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",sheinri@gwdg.de; christian.ammer@forst.uni-goettingen.de; mmund@gwdg.de; steffen.boch@wsl.ch; sabine@budde-forst.de; Markus.Fischer@ips.unibe.ch; joerg.mueller@sielmann-stiftung.de; ingo.schoening@bgc-jena.mpg.de; dschulze@bgc-jena.mpg.de; wschmid1@gwdg.de; martinweckesser@web.de; peter.schall@forst.uni-goettingen.de,"Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Schoning, Ingo/D-3341-2009; Schall, Peter/Q-5962-2019; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014","Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Schoning, Ingo/0000-0002-9830-5026; Schall, Peter/0000-0003-4808-818X; Boch, Steffen/0000-0003-2814-5343","German Science Foundation (DFG) Priority Program 1374 ""Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories"" [Fi-1246/6-1, Am 149/17-1, Am 149/16-2]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Schm-319/13]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 0339474C/3]; Open Access Publication Funds of the Gottingen University","The work has been partly funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) Priority Program 1374 ""Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories"" (Fi-1246/6-1; Am 149/17-1; Am 149/16-2) and by other projects funded by the DFG (Schm-319/13) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; FKZ 0339474C/3).

Background and Objectives: The ingrowth core method is often used to estimate fine root production; however, decomposed roots are often overlooked in estimates of FRP. Uncertainty remains on how long ingrowth cores should be installed and how FRP should be calculated in tropical forests. Here, we aimed to estimate FRP by taking decomposed fine roots into consideration. Specifically, we compared FRP estimates at different sampling intervals and using different calculation methods in a tropical rainforest in Borneo. Materials and Methods: Ingrowth cores were installed with root litter bags and collected after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. FRP was estimated based on (1) the difference in biomass at different sampling times (differential method) and (2) sampled biomass at just one sampling time (simple method). Results: Using the differential method, FRP was estimated at 447.4 +/- 67.4 g m(-2) year(-1) after 12 months, with decomposed fine roots accounting for 25% of FRP. Using the simple method, FRP was slightly higher than that in the differential method after 12 months (516.3 +/- 45.0 g m(-2) year(-1)). FRP estimates for both calculation methods using data obtained in the first half of the year were much higher than those using data after 12-months of installation, because of the rapid increase in fine root biomass and necromass after installation. Conclusions: Therefore, FRP estimates vary with the timing of sampling, calculation method and presence of decomposed roots. Overall, the ratio of net primary production (NPP) of fine roots to total NPP in this study was higher than that previously reported in the Neotropics, indicating high belowground carbon allocation in this forest.","[Katayama, Ayumi; Kume, Tomonori] Kyushu Univ, Kyushu Univ Forest, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8112415, Japan; [Kho, Lip Khoon] Trop Peat Res Inst, Biol Res Div, Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Selangor 43000, Malaysia; [Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Kume, Tomonori] Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Matsumoto, Kazuho] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Agr, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030129, Japan; [Ohashi, Mizue] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan","Katayama, A (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Kyushu Univ Forest, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8112415, Japan.",ayumi@forest.kyushu-u.ac.jp; klipkhoon@gmail.com; macky@shinshu-u.ac.jp; kumett@gmail.com; kazuhom@agr.u-ryukyu.ac.jp; ohashi@shse.u-hyogo.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP25304027, JP16H02762, 15K07467]","This study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the JSPS KAKENHI (grant numbers JP25304027, JP16H02762 and 15K07467).",,43,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2019,10,1,,,,,,,36,10.3390/f10010036,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,HL7HP,WOS:000458910800036,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Bristiel, P; Roumet, C; Violle, C; Volaire, F",,,,"Bristiel, Pauline; Roumet, Catherine; Violle, Cyrille; Volaire, Florence",,,Coping with drought: root trait variability within the perennial grass Dactylis glomerata captures a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cocksfoot; Orchardgrass; drought; Functional trade-off; Intraspecific variability; Root traits; Plant strategies; Water acquisition,SUMMER DORMANCY; WATER-USE; FUNCTIONAL STRATEGIES; ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; VEGETATIVE GROWTH; TISSUE DENSITY; FORAGE GRASSES; PLANT TRAITS; LIFE-SPAN,"Background and aimsUnderstanding plant adaptation to drought is a crucial challenge under climate change. This study aimed to investigate root traits and water use of grass populations exhibiting a range of dehydration avoidance and tolerance strategies to cope with drought.MethodsSixteen populations of the perennial grass Dactylis glomerata originating from three biogeographical origins (Northern, Temperate and Mediterranean) were grown in long tubes. Plant biomass, rooting depth and morphological traits of deep roots were measured both under full irrigation and under severe drought. Water uptake under drought was used as a proxy for dehydration avoidance. Plant survival after severe drought wasused as a measure of dehydration tolerance.ResultsAll populations had similar maximum rooting depth and specific root length. Compared to Northern and Temperate populations, Mediterranean populations had half the total and deep root biomass, but thinner and denser deep roots. They were less affected by drought. These traits were associated with less water uptake (lower dehydration avoidance) but greater survival to severe drought (enhanced dehydration tolerance).ConclusionThe intraspecific variability in root traits revealed a trade-off between dehydration avoidance and dehydration tolerance which illustrates contrasting adaptive plant and root strategies associated with the biogeographical origins of populations.","[Bristiel, Pauline; Volaire, Florence] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CEFE, INRA,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Roumet, Catherine; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CEFE, CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France","Volaire, F (reprint author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CEFE, INRA,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.",catherine.roumet@cefe.cnrs.fr; cyrille.violle@cefe.cnrs.fr; florence.volaire@cefe.cnrs.fr,,,INRA (EA department); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project 'Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plants' [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS],"Thanks to Pascal Chapon for excellent technical assistance, and to the 'Terrain d'experience' platform and the Plateforme d'Analyses Chimiques en Ecologie both at CEFE-CNRS (Labex CEMEB).

SOC is formed from the decomposition of above- and below-ground plant inputs, yet their accurate quantification remains a major challenge. In the current study the in-growth soil core and C-13 methods were combined to quantify the net C input from single or combined above- and below-ground parts of a poplar (Populus) bioenergy plantation.MethodsThree different mesh sizes were used for the in-growth cores in four different treatments designed to estimate the relative contributions of above-ground litter fall, fine roots and mycorrhizae (C3 input from the poplar) to the new C formation in cores filled with a C4 soil, by applying a mass balance equation.ResultsSoil C formation was higher in the treatments with roots as compared to the treatments with above-ground C inputs only (29 vs 16g C m(-2)), despite the disproportionally lower root inputs as compared to above-ground C inputs (34 vs 175g C m(-2) y(-1)). Soil C formation from different sources (above- and below-ground) was additive; i.e. the observed soil C formation in the combined treatment was the sum of those in the single soil C input treatments. As a result, below-ground C-inputs had a high conversion efficiency to SOC of 76%. Above-ground plant inputs had a very low SOC formation efficiency of 9%, and were presumably mainly mineralized by microorganisms.ConclusionThe higher soil C accumulation rates from below-ground C inputs are particularly important in bioenergy plantations where the above-ground biomass is frequently removed for biomass and energy production.","[Berhongaray, Gonzalo] Univ Nacl Litoral, Fac Ciencias Agr, CONICET, Kredder 2805, RA-3080 Esperanza, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Berhongaray, Gonzalo; Janssens, Ivan A.; Ceulemans, Reinhart] Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Excellence Plants & Ecosyst, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Cotrufo, Francesca M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Cotrufo, Francesca M.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ceulemans, Reinhart] CzechGlobe, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic","Berhongaray, G (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Res Ctr Excellence Plants & Ecosyst, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",bgonzalo@agro.uba.ar,"Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014","Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787","European Research Council under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) as ERC Advanced Grant [233366]; Flemish Hercules Foundation as Infrastructure [ZW09-06]; Flemish Methusalem Programme; Research Council of the University of Antwerp; Erasmus-Mundus External Cooperation, Consortium EADIC - Window Lot 16 - European Union Mobility Programme [2009-1655/001-001]","This work was supported by the European Research Council under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) as ERC Advanced Grant agreement #233366 (POPFULL), as well as by the Flemish Hercules Foundation as Infrastructure contract #ZW09-06.

The use of heavy machinery to perform forestry activities such as logging has increased during the last few decades, which influences the soil ecosystem by inducing soil compaction. The main objective of this study was to observe the morphological growth response of Dalbergia sissoo at different compaction levels. Different morphological parameters were recorded including girth/diameter, shoot length, root length, shoot weight, root weight, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, root-shoot ratio, moisture content availability, and biomass production to analyze the effect of soil compaction. As the compaction level increased, the shoot length, root length, root weight to shoot weight ratio, and biomass production decreased. Simultaneously, the bulk density of soil increased as the compaction level increased. Soil compaction produced an overall negative effect on the growth of D. sissoo. Different levels of soil compaction significantly affected the physical growth parameters of the plant and reduced growth as soil compaction increased. Based on the results, the plantation of D. sissoo without compaction can be a viable option to obtain good quality timber.","[Rashid, M. H. U.; Farooq, T. H.; Gautam, N. P.; Gilani, M.

The study site included a full factorial design with two temperature and two precipitation levels, with three replicates. Litter bags containing fine root litter of 2-year-old P. koraiensis seedlings were retrieved after 3, 6, and 12 months of decomposition. After 12 months, the mass loss of fine roots was significantly increased in response to warming (control = 31.1%, warming = 35.9%, drought = 29.2%, and warming plus drought = 35.5%); no change was observed until 6 months. Mass loss was not influenced by drought or by the interaction between warming and drought. Warming increased the nitrogen concentration of fine root litter but decreased the carbon concentration and carbon/nitrogen ratio after 6 and 12 months. This may be because warming stimulated nitrogen immobilization, which reduced the carbon/nitrogen ratio. Therefore, the carbon/nitrogen ratio may be affected by warming prior to changes in the mass loss of fine roots because roots with a low carbon/nitrogen ratio are generally characterized by high available nitrogen for decomposers. These results suggest that climate change (especially warming) may cause rapid decomposition of organic matter.","[Han, Seung Hyun; Kim, Seongjun; Chang, Hanna; Son, Yowhan] Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Li, Guanlin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Inst Environm & Ecol, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China","Son, YH (reprint author), Korea Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",yson@korea.ac.kr,,"Kim, Seongjun/0000-0003-1938-4406",Korea Forest Service [2017058A00-1719-AB01],This study was supported by the Korea Forest Service (2017058A00-1719-AB01).,,32,1,1,3,12,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

The Enemy of my enemy' hypothesis (EEH) predicts that native plants are more negatively impacted by enemies (e.g. pathogens) that accumulate and spillover from the invader's rhizosphere than the invaders themselves, thereby facilitating the invasion. We tested EEH using Vincetoxicum rossicum, one of the most invasive plant species in Eastern North America, and a total of eight co-occuring native plant species. Specifically, we predicted that the native species would grow less in presence of soil biota associated with V. rossicum than that from uninvaded soils. Field soils were collected from four V. rossicum invaded and neighboring uninvaded areas for use in two experiments. In Experiment 1, V. rossicum and each of five native plant species were grown in a plant growth chamber for 3months, either in presence or absence of soil biota from the invaded and uninvaded soils. We found that only one species (Solidago canadensis) supported EEH. In contrast, the legume Desmodium canadense more than doubled its biomass in response to V. rossicum -associated soil biota. In Experiment 2, four native legume species, including D. canadense, were examined for EEH in the same manner as in Experiment 1. Only one species (Lespedeza hirta) supported EEH and, again, V. rossicum-associated soil biota was advantageous to D. canadense. In summary, we found inconsistent support for the EEH between V. rossicum and native co-occurring species in Eastern North America. We conclude that the accumulation of rhizosphere enemies in native plants may not be a major factor in the invasive success of V. rossicum.","[Dukes, Angela E.; Koyama, Akihiro; Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada; [Dunfield, Kari E.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Antunes, PM (reprint author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada.",pedro.antunes@algomau.ca,,,Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; University of Guelph; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs,This work was funded through an Ontario Graduate Scholarship and bursaries from the University of Guelph to A.

Morphogenesis, growth, water relations and gas exchange were examined in a factorial experiment. The results showed that wind reduced both shoot height and root growth but did not affect shoot diameter or root/shoot ratio, while light promoted both shoot and root growth, and the root/shoot ratio. However, light and wind consistently increased stem taper. Wind and light reduced leaf water potential and increased stem xylem cavitation at midday. Lateral shade decreased root and stem hydraulic conductance, while wind reduced stem hydraulic conductance without influencing root hydraulic conductance. Wind and light reduced the vulnerability of poplar saplings to xylem cavitation. Lateral shade strongly reduced the CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance. Wind reduced the assimilation rate at midday under full sunlight. In summary, both light and wind increased stem taper, although the two environmental factors had opposite effects on the growth of poplar saplings. Lateral shading reduced the growth of shoots and roots of poplar saplings by restricting assimilation, and light promoted greater allocation of carbon to roots than to shoots, and to a lower rather than upper portion of the stem, leading to increased root/shoot ratio and stem taper. At the sapling stage, wind reduced shoot height and root growth primarily by interrupting water balance, and also induced thigmomorphogenic responses, such as increased taper. Finally, lateral shading did not suppress the thigmomorphological responses to wind.","[Feng, Jinxia; Huang, Ping; Wan, Xianchong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst New Forestry Technol, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Wan, XC (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst New Forestry Technol, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",wxc@caf.ac.cn,,,"Institute of New Forestry Technology, Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2014QA025]","Institute of New Forestry Technology, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Grant/Award Number: CAFYBB2014QA025",,51,0,0,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Both biotic and abiotic factors also affect belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities, but there is scarce information available from tropical mountain ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine the diversity and distribution of AM fungi in different mountainous habitat types in the Chapada Diamantina mountain range in Bahia (NE Brazil). Soil samples were collected in five habitats types: high-altitude cerrado savannas (HAC), natural grasslands (GRA), gallery forests (GAF), in natural rocky rupestrian fields (shrublands; CAR) and in rocky, rupestrian field in the regeneration stage (CRR). A total of 49 AMF species were identified, of which Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae species were the most representative families. The AMF communities did not follow the shifts in plant communities. The composition of the AMF communities differed only between CAR and HAC and between CRR and GAF, while the other habitats had similar AMF communities. Our conclusion is that the AMF community assemblages in tropical mountains are related to the heterogeneity of habitats of these ecosystems. In our study, silt and coarse sand contents were the main factors related to the community composition of AMF in the different habitats.","[Vieira, Larissa C.; da Silva, Iolanda R.; Goncalves, Camila M.; de Assis, Daniele M.

The main objective of this study was to ascertain the influence of vegetation durations on soil infiltration rate and other related soil properties. Undisturbed soil columns in triplicate from the same plot, with different locations, were collected to estimate the accumulated soil infiltration over different vegetation periods (9, 15, and 25years) of grassland and forestland at different time intervals. The highest cumulative infiltration and wet front movement speed was recorded after 25years of grassland and increased with the vegetation restoration duration. Low root biomass density (gcm(-3)) and soil organic matter (gkg(-1)) were recorded in the 9-year plantation of forestland and grassland; however, maximum root biomass densities of 1.6140.95mgcm(-3) and 0.938 +/- 0.03mgcm(-3) were recorded after 25years of forestland and grassland. Furthermore, rootimagesscanner analysis showed that the 25years of grassland has higher root length density and root surface area density of 5.917 +/- 0.86cmcm(-3) and 2.058 +/- 0.95cm(2)cm(-3) at surface and subsurface soil layers. We therefore suggest that for revegetation periods of less than 25years, grassland would be better for soil infiltration and related soil properties particularly in areas of the Chinese Loess Plateau.","[Kalhoro, Shahmir Ali; Ding, Kang; Chen, Wenyuan; Hua, Rui; Shar, Akhtar Hussain; Xu, Xuexuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Kalhoro, Shahmir Ali] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Fac Agr, Uthal 90150, Pakistan; [Zhang, Beiying] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Geog Geomat & Planning, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Xu, XX (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xuxuexuan@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471439, 41701025]; Changwu state key agro-ecological experimental station, China","This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under project rectification nos. 41471439, 41701025.

Here, we combine metrics from BEF research that distinguish the contribution of dominant species (selection effects, SE) from those due to positive interactions such as resource partitioning (complementarity effects, CE) with a functional trait approach in an attempt to reveal the functional characteristics of species that drive community biomass in species mixtures. In a biodiversity experiment with 16 plant species in monocultures, 4-species and 16-species mixtures, we used aboveground biomass to determine the relative contributions of CE and SE to biomass production in mixtures in the second, dry year of the experiment. We also measured root traits (specific root length, root length density, root tissue density and the deep root fraction) of each species in monocultures and linked the calculated community weighted mean (CWM) trait values and trait diversity of mixtures to CE and SE. In the second year of the experiment, community biomass, CE and SE increased compared to the first year. The contribution of SE to this positive effect was greater than that of CE. The increased contribution of SE was associated with root traits: SE increased most in communities with high abundance of species with deep, thick and dense roots. In contrast, changes in CE were not related to trait diversity or CWM trait values. Together, these results suggest that increased positive effects of species richness on community biomass in a dry year were mainly driven by increased dominance of deep-rooting species, supporting the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity. Positive CE indicates that other positive interactions did occur, but we could not find evidence that belowground resource partitioning or facilitation via root trait diversity was important for community productivity in our biodiversity experiment.","[Bakker, Lisette M.; Mommer, Liesje; van Ruijven, Jasper] Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","van Ruijven, J (reprint author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",jasper.vanruijven@wur.nl,,,"Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the Netherlands; NWO VIDI grantNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.14.006]","This study was supported by the Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the Netherlands.

In addition, indirect plant defensessuch as those mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs)could be affected by plant root symbionts. However, it is not clear how the suppression of root symbionts might affect extrafloral nectar (EFN) production and plant reproductive output. We made an experimental study with a shrub species with EFNs. Firstly, we tested if root-associated fungi (i.e., comparing plants with and without fungicide) increased the production of pollen (male function) and EFN (volume, nectar concentration, and total sugar content) in Croton lachnostachyus. Subsequently, we implemented a second experiment on the same plants, adding different levels of simulated herbivory (none, low, high) to assess the combined effects of root-associated fungi and herbivory. While we found high levels of mycorrhizal colonization, we found no signs of pathogenic fungi and negligible values of dark septate endophytes in roots so we attributed our results mostly to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The first experiment showed that plants without the fungicide treatment increased pollen production and secreted a lower mean volume of EFN with higher concentration of dissolved soluble solids. In the second experiment, high levels of simulated herbivory showed a diminution on EFN variables; also, we detected a lower shoot dry mass on plants with low levels of herbivory and no interactions with AMF. Our results suggest complex ecological responses related to the root-associated fungal community and simulated herbivory.","[Pereyra, Mariana; Grilli, Gabriel; Galetto, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, FCEFyN, CONICET, Velez Sarsfield 1611, Cordoba, Argentina; [Galetto, Leonardo] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Dept Diversidad Biol & Ecol, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Cordoba, Argentina","Grilli, G (reprint author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, FCEFyN, CONICET, Velez Sarsfield 1611, Cordoba, Argentina.",ggrilli@imbiv.unc.edu.ar,,"Galetto, Leonardo/0000-0003-3828-657X",FONCYTFONCyT; National University of Cordoba (SECyT-UNC); CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"We thank two anonymous reviewers and Marina Omacini for useful comments and suggestions on a previous version of this manuscript.

However, PSFs have been mostly studied in isolation of abiotic and biotic drivers that could affect their strength and direction. This is problematic because it has led to limited predictive power of PSFs in ""the real world,"" leaving large knowledge gaps in our ability to predict how PSFs contribute to ecosystem processes and functions. Here, we present a synthetic framework to elucidate how abiotic and biotic drivers affect PSFs. We focus on two key abiotic drivers (temperature and soil moisture) and two key biotic drivers (above-ground plant consumers and below-ground top-down control of pathogens and mutualists). We focus on these factors because they are known drivers of plants and soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they control, and hence would be expected to strongly influence PSFs. Our framework describes the proposed mechanisms behind these drivers and explores their effects on PSFs. We demonstrate the impacts of these drivers using the fast- to slow-growing plant economics spectrum. We use this well-established paradigm because plants on opposite ends of this spectrum differ in their relationships with soil biota and have developed contrasting strategies to cope with abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Finally, we present suggestions for improved experimental designs and scientific inference that will capture and elucidate the influence of above- and belowground drivers on PSFs. By establishing the role of abiotic and biotic drivers of PSFs, we will be able to make more robust predictions of how PSFs impact on ecosystem function.","[De Long, Jonathan R.; Veen, G.

We found that the hyphal growth range of cotton can extend to 30 mm from the root surface (under zero P addition), meaning that the cotton root increased its P absorption range by 15-fold under the hyphal growth. Within this range, the hyphal density was controlled by soil P content change. On the one hand, the hyphal extent decreased gradually away from the cotton roots with the increase of the soil available P content. On the other hand, a negative correlation was observed between the hyphal density and the soil available P content in different soil locations of distance away from the cotton root surface.

Cool season exotic grasses are invading native plant communities across the northern Great Plains, potentially compromising streambank stability and increasing the risk of erosion within riparian ecosystems. To determine how the species composition of the greenline community impacts stream type and the risk of streambank erosion, thirty live reaches across five watersheds were sampled to determine the dominant greenline vegetation. At each reach. a cross-section was sampled to determine stream type, greenline vegetation, and risk of streambank erosion. Channel types were delineated using Rosgen's classification of natural rivers. Canopy cover and composition was assessed using the line point intercept method along a 30.5 m transect in the greenline community. Plants recorded were grouped by their wetland indicator status for the central Great Plains. The Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) was used to assess the streams risk of erosion by calculating the difference between the bank height and bank full height, average plant rooting depth and density, bank angle degree, and the dominant texture of the bank material. Bank height ratio (BHR) was assessed as a measure of streambank stability and floodplain connectivity. A Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination was performed to analyze plant community influences. Analysis of the data determined that the most stable stream types (E and C channels), lower Ball scores, and stable bank height ratios were associated with high amounts of litter and facultative wet species. In comparison, unstable F channels were associated with early successional species and bare ground. Sites with the higher BEHI scores were associated with greenlines comprised of upland and facultative upland and saline tolerant species. Late successional facultative wetland species were found to provide the most protection to intermittent streambanks. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We used structured equation models to investigate the relationship between small mammal species, functional and phylogenetic diversity with forest size, forest cover and the occurrence of medium and large mammals. The best-fit model showed that defaunation reduced functional diversity, and that species diversity of small mammals increased with forest patch size. Forest cover did not affect functional and phylogenetic diversity. Our results indicate that occurrence of medium and large sized mammals (probably acting as predators, or competitors of small mammals) and forest patch size help to retain species and functional diversity in small mammal communities. Further, the number of species in a small mammal community was critical to the maintenance of phylogenetic diversity, and may have a pronounced influence on the ecological functions played by small mammals. Identifying how phylogenetic and functional diversity change in function of human pressures allows us to better understand the contribution of extant lineages to ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.","[Bovendorp, Ricardo S.; Galetti, Mauro] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [McCleery, Robert A.; Baiser, Benjamin] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Brum, Fernanda T.; Loyola, Rafael; Cianciaruso, Marcus V.] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Brum, Fernanda T.] Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","Bovendorp, RS (reprint author), Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.",bovendorp@rc.unesp.br,"Bovendorp, Ricardo Siqueira/B-1114-2013; Loyola, Rafael/S-3978-2019; Loyola, Rafael/A-4425-2008; Galetti, Mauro/M-8751-2013; Brum, Fernanda Thiesen/F-6734-2012","Bovendorp, Ricardo Siqueira/0000-0002-0734-1866; Loyola, Rafael/0000-0001-5323-2735; Loyola, Rafael/0000-0001-5323-2735; Brum, Fernanda Thiesen/0000-0003-4415-6130; McCleery, Robert/0000-0001-7018-005X; Galetti, Mauro/0000-0002-8187-8696",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo -FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/01986-0]; FAPESP fellowshipFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/25441-0]; BEPE fellowship [2014/18800-6]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [308532/2014-7]; O Boticario Group Foundation for the Protection of Nature [PROG_0008_2013]; MCTIC/CNPq/FAPEG [465610/2014-5]; CNPq fellowship (Bolsa de Produtividade em Pesquisa),"We thank Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo -FAPESP (Proc. 2014/01986-0) for financial support.

By examining root architecture in relation to soil moisture and analysing the isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen of plant and soil water, we established whether welwitschia sources water from a stable supply of deep groundwater, or from shallow moisture originating from fog and dew, or from rainwater at infiltration depth. Isotopes suggested rainwater as principal water source. Most (55%) major roots and fine roots occurred in 10- to 66-cm-deep layers of gypsum containing 10% moisture. A further 25% of both root types grew in moist sand in petrocalcic horizons at 93- to 125-cm depths. A high density of fine roots (14% of total) grew upwards towards the ground surface in a 1.5-m radius around plants, an area occasionally wetted by run-off of fog and dew. We conclude that welwitschia mainly relies on rainwater obtained in perched horizons. Supplemental water is obtained from fog and dew from the surface and potentially from gypsum blocks. Multiple strategies enable this extremely long-lived evergreen to be resilient against dehydration in hyperarid conditions.","[Henschel, Joh R.; Wassenaar, Theo D.; Neef, Gotz; Shuuya, Titus] Gobabeb Res & Training Ctr, Namib Ecol Restorat & Monitoring Unit, Walvis Bay, Namibia; [Henschel, Joh R.] South African Environm Observat Network, Arid Lands Node, Kimberley, South Africa; [Henschel, Joh R.] Univ Free State, Ctr Environm Management, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Kanandjembo, Angie; Louw, Michele Kilbourn] Swakop Uranium, Safety Hlth & Environm Risks, Swakopmund, Namibia; [Soderberg, Keir] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Soderberg, Keir] SS Papadopulos & Associates Inc, Geochem, Bethesda, MD USA","Henschel, JR (reprint author), South African Environm Observat Network, POB 11040,Hadison Pk, ZA-8306 Kimberley, South Africa.",joh.henschel@saeon.ac.za,,"Henschel, Joh/0000-0001-7122-2768",Swakop Uranium; Namib Ecological Restoration and Monitoring Unit of the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre,"This project was conducted under Research Permit 1653/2011 granted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism.

Houz.), an invasive species, has spread into and replaced surrounding broadleaved and coniferous forests because of the inactive management of moso-bamboo forests. Some local governments in Japan have speculated about an increase in soil erosion caused by the replacement with moso-bamboo forests. To evaluate the impact of such replacement on soil erosion, the soil erosion rate in a moso-bamboo forest was compared with those in an evergreen broadleaved forest and a coniferous forest. We established three plots (width 1 m, length ca. 2 m) in each forest and measured overland flow and soil erosion in two continuous periods (Period I: July 26, 2012-April 26, 2013; Period II: April 26, 2013-July 17, 2014). In Period I, the soil erosion rate in the moso-bamboo forest (0.08-0.10 g m(-2) mm(-1)) was not significantly higher than that in the broadleaved forest (0.27-0.55 g m(-2) mm(-1)) and the coniferous forest (0.16-0.27 g m(-2) mm(-1)). In Period II, we removed understory vegetation and litter from two of the three plots in each forest. In Period II, the plots with such removal had higher soil erosion rates than the control plots. The soil erosion rate for the removal plots of the moso-bamboo forest was less than half of those of the broadleaved and coniferous forests. Although rock fragment cover on the soil surface and shear strength of the topsoil did not differ significantly among the three forests, root density in the moso-bamboo forest was much greater than those in the broadleaved and coniferous forests. These results suggest that a large amount of roots in moso-bamboo forests could reduce soil erosion there. The findings of this study show that moso-bamboo forests have strong resistance against soil erosion, so the replacement of broadleaved and coniferous forests by moso-bamboo forests would not seem to imply an increase in soil erosion.","[Shinohara, Yoshinori] Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, 1-1 Gakuen Kibanadai Nishi, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Shinohara, Yoshinori; Kubota, Tetsuya] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Misumi, Yuma] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Nanko, Kazuki] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Disaster Prevent Meteorol & Hydrol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan","Shinohara, Y (reprint author), Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, 1-1 Gakuen Kibanadai Nishi, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan.",shinohara@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,"Nanko, Kazuki/F-4833-2010","Nanko, Kazuki/0000-0002-1157-9287","Kyushu University; Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University","We thank members of the Laboratory of Forest Conservation and Erosion Control of Kyushu University for their help and support in the field.

Beech phenological and growth traits have been studied in large-scale international beech provenance trials, yet the growth and turnover of its fine roots (FR) has not been included among the observations. FR growth dynamics and FR architectural traits of three beech provenances in the international beech provenance trial Straza/Kamenski hrib, established in Slovenia in 1998, and from a natural beech regeneration site growing at its border, were studied from 2007 to 2010. We studied FR biomass using soil cores (SC), root production using ingrowth soil cores (IC), and root longevity using minirhizotrons (MR). Significant differences in FR biomass (live and dead) between the provenance P37 and other provenances were discovered in SC, FR biomass of P37 being significantly higher than FR biomass of latter, which could be connected with overall excellent growth performance of P37 due to favourable environmental conditions at trial. Values of specific root length (SRL) in IC varied significantly among P37 and P54. The turnover rates in IC were at the end of the experiment close to MR results. Median MR-based longevities of FR varied between 625 and 934 days. Survival curve of the slowest growing provenance (considering its aboveground characteristics) was significantly different from the other two, median longevities of the latter being higher. Death of FR, older than two years, occurred most likely in the winter. Our results suggest that there are significant differences in FR longevity among provenances, which might contribute to their adaptation to future environmental conditions. Furthermore, the calculated annual C investment into FR growth per ha differs up to twofold between provenances, contributing to different C dynamics of their future stands.","[Zeleznik, Peter; Westergren, Marjana; Bozic, Gregor; Bajc, Marko; Kraigher, Hojka] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Eler, Klemen] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Horvath, Aniko] Univ Sopron, Inst Environm & Earth Sci, POB 132, H-9400 Sopron, Hungary","Zeleznik, P (reprint author), Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",peter.zeleznik@gozdis.si,,"Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko/0000-0002-3056-7820","Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P4-0107, L4-2265, L4-4318]; Slovenian Ministry for agriculture, forestry and food; 7FW EU project EUFORINNO [315982];  [BI-FI/12-13-011]","The research was funded by the Young Researcher funding scheme of the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS), the research programme P4-0107, and projects L4-2265 and L4-4318, co-funded by the Slovenian Ministry for agriculture, forestry and food.

We monitored the recovery of soil structure in a compacted forest soil, which had been treated with a combination of regeneration techniques (mulching, liming, planting of alder trees or a combination of those). Soil physical properties (relative apparent gas diffusion coefficient (D-s/D-0), bulk density and the macropore volume) were measured in three successive campaigns, with two years between each, with fine root densities taken as a biological target variable. Distinct changes of soil physical properties were detected during the study period, mainly caused by the effects of the applied regeneration techniques. After four years, higher values of D-s/D-0 and macropores indicated significant improvements of soil aeration in the topsoil. The deeper soil showed no distinct evidence of regeneration, regardless of the regeneration technique applied. However, rather a negative impact of mulching on soil physical properties was detected. The measured physical parameters, D-s/D-0, bulk density and macropore volume correlate highly with observed fine root densities. In the topsoil, root density increases with increasing soil gas permeability, while in the deeper horizons only few macropores are occupied by fine roots for gas exchange.","[Fernandez, J. L.

If the seedlings are moved to freezer storage too early in the season, roots can be damaged and thereby the quality of seedlings declines. We aimed to develop a novel method to assess an appropriate time for moving the seedlings to freezer storage in the autumn and to detect possible root damage during overwintering. One-year-old containerized Scots pine seedlings were measured before, during and after freezer storage, and after a series of frost exposure tests. The electrical impedance spectra (from 4 kHz to 200 kHz) of roots changed during cold acclimatization. The impedance loss factor (delta) of roots at 50 kHz frequency decreased when the threshold of frost tolerance was exceeded in the freezing tests. Root hydraulic conductance (K-r) increased before and during the freezer storage. In the initial phase of cold acclimatization, K-r increased considerably after exposure to frost temperatures, indicating damage, but that effect disappeared with frost hardening. In regrowth tests, the largest number of new root tips was observed after exposure to -12 degrees C in the freezing tests just before and after freezer storage, and after exposure to -30 degrees C during the freezer storage. During the freezer storage, shoot growth declined at higher exposure temperatures than root tip formation, suggesting that roots and specifically root tips would not be the primary reason for declined shoot growth.

In the present study, we first investigated soil microbial communities in three plantations: Larix kaempferi monoculture, L. olgensis monoculture and their mixture. Then, a two-year growth experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of intra- and inter-specific interactions of L. kaempferi and L. olgensis on rhizosphere microbial communities at two different nitrogen levels. The results demonstrated clear differences in the beta-diversity and composition of bacteria and fungi among the three plantations, which implied the presence of different effects of plant-plant interactions on soil microbial communities. The results of the pot experiment showed that L. kaempferi suffered from greater neighbor effects from its conspecific neighbor regardless of N fertilization, although the effect declined when L. kaempferi was grown with L. olgensis under N fertilization. Changes in intra- and inter-specific plant interactions significantly impacted the chemical and biological properties of soil under N fertilization, with lower concentrations of NH4+, and lower soil microbial biomass (C-Mic) and soil carbon nitrogen biomass (N-Mic) under intra-specific plant interactions of L. kaempferi (KK) compared to inter-specific interactions of L. kaempferi and L. olgensis (KO). N fertilization increased bacterial and fungal alpha diversities in the rhizosphere soil of KO. For the beta diversity, the PERMANOVA results demonstrated that there was a significant impact of intra- and inter-specific plant interactions on soil microbial communities, with KK significantly differing from intra-specific plant interactions of L. olgensis (OO) and KO. The two plant species and N fertilization showed specific effects on the soil microbial composition, particularly on the fungal community. Both L. olgensis and N fertilization increased the abundance of Ascomycota but reduced that of Basidiomycota, and even shifted the dominance from Basidiomycota to Ascomycota under KO combined with N fertilization.","[Guo, Qingxue; Li, Chunyang] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yan, Lijuan] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Aquat Geomicrobiol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Korpelainen, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Viikki Plant Sci Ctr, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51006 Tartu, Estonia; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Acad Sci, Kohtu 6, EE-10130 Tallinn, Estonia","Li, CY (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",licy@hznu.edu.cn,,"Yan, Lijuan/0000-0002-3594-7857; li, chun yang/0000-0003-2895-2786; Korpelainen, Helena/0000-0002-7046-6995","Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University [2016QDL020]; Qingyuan Experimental Station, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the Talent Program of the Hangzhou Normal University (2016QDL020).

A two-compartment system was employed to exclude the effects of plant roots, and ultrasonic dispersion technique was applied to evaluate the aggregate bond energy. The results showed that good symbiotic relationships were formed between AM fungi and sandstorm-tolerant species Astragalus adsurgens Pall even under drought stress conditions. Inoculation with AM fungi significantly improved plant growth, especially the root development. Hyphal length, spore density, glomalin-related soil protein content were significantly increased by AM fungal inoculation under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. Likewise, the proportion and dispersive energy of soil water-stable macroaggregates were also markedly increased by the inoculation. The hyphae of AM fungi directly contributed to the dispersive energy of soil water-stable macro-aggregates and significantly improved soil aggregate stability under both experimental conditions.

However, the underlying mechanism for metal and metalloid removal as well as water quality improvement and the ecological role played by GRSP are still not well documented. This study was initiated to investigate the interconnection of metal loading in GRSP between sediments and suspended solids, focusing on the mobilization mechanisms of GRSP in the coastal mangrove wetland. Combined indicators of nine heavy metals were significantly positively correlated with GRSP concentration by Principal Component Analysis, indicating that GRSP could act as an indicator of contamination level in the mangrove wetlands. Large distribution of GRSP in sediments and suspended solids elevated sequestration potential of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb) and metalloid arsenic in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem. GRSP mobilized and sequestered heavy metals in sediment profiles, which reduced the bioavailability of heavy metals. GRSP was also a significant contributor for suspended solids to adsorb heavy metals, enhancing suspended solids deposition and burial process in sediments. This new finding provided insights into the ecological functions of GRSP and the heavy metal cycling in wetland environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Root diameter and mechanical failure under tension before and after the moisture treatment were measured. Tensile strength and tensile force of both species decreased linearly while mean root diameter increased linearly with increasing root moisture content. Root moisture content has a large impact on the variability of root tensile strength. This emphasizes the need to avoid desiccation during testing. In field impacts of soil water potential on root strength requires further study.

Information on belowground responses to warming is especially limited for the tropics and subtropics because the majority of manipulative studies have been conducted in temperate and boreal regions. We examined how artificial warming affected CO2 gas production and exchange across soil profiles in a replicated mesocosms experiment relying on heavily weathered subtropical soils and planted with Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata). Half of 2 x 2 m mesocosms (5 replications) was heated with cables buried at a 10 cm depth, which increased temperature in the whole soil profile by 4.5, 3.6 and 2.5 degrees C at 15, 30 and 60 cm soil depths, respectively. Using a combination of chamber-based and concentration gradient method (CGM) approaches, we found that warming increased soil CO2 efflux across the whole profile by 40%. Changes were unevenly distributed across soil depth: mean CO2 production rate decreased from 0.74 to 0.67 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in topsoils (0-15 cm depth) whereas it increased from 0.26 to 0.73 mu mol CO2 m(-1) s(-1) in subsoils (15-60 cm depth). Warming reduced moisture more strongly in subsurface than surface soils and increased subsoil soluble N concentrations as well as fine root turnover, in line with previous temperate and boreal warming studies. This consistency indicates that overall responses of subtropical forests to warming may be similar to forests in higher latitudes.","[Lin, Weisheng; Li, Yiqing; Yang, Zhijie; Xie, Jinsheng; Chen, Shidong; Lin, Chengfang; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Yiqing] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Giardina, Christian P.] US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, USDA, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Dept Agr Soil Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Soil Sci Consulting, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Lin, CF; Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.",Tonylcf99@163.com; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,"Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Giardina, Christian P/C-3120-2011","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Giardina, Christian P/0000-0002-3431-5073","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31800517, 31270584, 31470501]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFD0600204]; Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [18-14-00362]","The research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31800517, No. 31270584 and No. 31470501) and National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFD0600204).

In this study, we used a common garden experiment that included five monocultures (two arbuscular mycorrhizal - (AM) and three ectomycorrhizal-associated (ECM) temperate tree species) to explore the effects of mycorrhizal associations on the R-S and the driving factors. Our specific objectives were to (1) compare the R-S between the AM and ECM stands, and (2) explore the driving factors of the R-S. We found that the R-S in the AM stands was significantly greater (34.3%) than that in the ECM stands. The R-S was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass C (C-mic), fine roots biomass (B-root), or soil water content (W-5), but negatively with forest floor mass (F-mass) or soil dissolved organic C content (C-dis). The best-fitted models of R-S explained 46.3%, 38.3%, and 45.4% of the variations in the R-S for the AM stands, the ECM stands, and the combined dataset, respectively. However, the factors contributing to the R-S varied with mycorrhizal groups. The R-S of the AM stands was mainly influenced by C-mic, B-root, root C/N ratio, F-mass, and C-dis, whereas the R-S of the ECM stands was mainly affected by litter C/N ratio, C-dis, soil dissolved nitrogen content, soil temperature and W-5. These findings highlight the significance of shifts in AM or ECM tree abundance due to forest management and global change in forest C cycling.","[Wang, Xinqi; Wang, Chuankuan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Wang, CK (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",wangck-cf@nefu.edu.cn,,"wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426",National Key Technology Research and Development Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2011BAD37B01]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitySichuan UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT_15R09],"This work was financially supported by the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2011BAD37B01) and the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT_15R09) to C.K.W.

Forest harvesting modifies soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities, which may lead to faster decomposition rates, but the effect of harvesting on fine-root decomposition is rarely investigated. Variable-retention harvesting, where some trees are left on site after harvest, often results in lower soil moisture and temperature, and increased ectomycorrhizal diversity relative to clearcut harvesting. As such, this harvesting practice may influence fine-root decomposition rates. In Douglas-fir forests in coastal British Columbia, we measured fine-root (< 2 mm diameter) decomposition rates in variable-retention (aggregate and dispersed arrangements), clearcut, and uncut treatments, and determined if any effects persisted as stands aged. Within the variable-retention treatments, we also examined if fine-root decomposition rates varied with distance from retention trees or retention patches. Further, we determined which soil physicochemical variables best explained variation in fine-root carbon loss after two years of decomposition. Increased tree coverage slowed fine root decomposition; fine roots decomposed as slowly under variable-retention treatments as in uncut stands, and 15-19% more carbon was retained in these treatments relative to the clearcut treatment. Fine roots also decomposed faster with increasing distance from retention patches or retention trees as decomposition was twofold slower in the aggregate centre relative to open areas, with similar patterns observed in the dispersed retention treatment. However, fine roots decomposed at similar rates in forests and stands with more advanced regeneration, suggesting the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates was not persistent. Across all sampling locations, 37% of the variation in fine-root carbon loss was explained by fine-root biomass, and nitrate, potassium and sulphate availability. Nitrate availability was also positively correlated with the proportional mass of carbon lost during the decomposition experiment, suggesting that fine-root decomposition is sensitive to harvesting-induced changes in soil physicochemistry, and that variable-retention harvesting moderates the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates. These findings indicate that shortly after harvest, retention of even single trees can prevent the increase in fine-root decomposition rates associated with clearcut harvesting in these coastal Douglas-fir forests. Accordingly, management practices such as variable-retention harvesting that retain some trees in a cutblock may reduce soil C losses following forest harvesting.","[Philpott, Timothy J.; Prescott, Cindy E.; Grayston, Sue J.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Barker, Jason S.] US Forest Serv, Forest Inventory & Anal, Washington, DC 20250 USA","Philpott, TJ (reprint author), Minist Forests Lands Nat Resource Operat & Rural, Williams Lake, BC, Canada.",tim.philpott@gov.bc.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank April Stainsby, Jesse John, David Fluharty, and Jasper Jia for assistance in the field and laboratory.

Results: Si supplementation increased soil water retention under ambient and elevated precipitation but not under drought, although this had little effect on Si uptake and growth (tiller numbers or root biomass) of M. stipoides. Changes in rainfall patterns and clipping had strong individual effects on plant growth and Si uptake and storage, whereby clipping increased Si uptake by M. stipoides under all rainfall treatments but to the greatest extent under elevated precipitation. Moreover, above-ground-below-ground Si distribution only changed following elevated precipitation by decreasing the ratio of root:shoot Si concentrations. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of soil water availability for Si uptake and suggest a role for both active and passive Si transport mechanisms. Such manipulative field studies may provide a more realistic insight into how grasses initially respond to herbivory in terms of Si-based defence under different environmental conditions.","[Ryalls, James M.

SA/GR/L-Cys has excellent mechanical properties, with a breaking stress of 3.5 MPa at 79.8%, an elastic modulus of 5.0 MPa, low swelling properties (average swelling ratio <300%), and good adsorption properties toward organic pollutants and heavy metal ions. A rotating magnetic field (RMF) was shown to have a better influence than a static magnetic field (SMF) on adsorption, with enhanced adsorption capacities 5-fold greater than those of the SMF. We investigated the different adsorption mechanisms of model contaminants through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zeta potential, and X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy. Formation of new hydrogen bonds, change in zeta potential, and acceleration in chemical reactions strongly influenced the adsorption process under the RMF. In fixed-bed column adsorption, the breakthrough time for column adsorption increased, and the adsorption capacity improved by 30.66%. The costs and practical applications of SA/GR/L-Cys under RMF were also analyzed. This work demonstrated that SA/GR/L-Cys could serve as a promising adsorbent for water pollutants under RMF exposure and could be used in practical applications.","[Ma, Jie; Ma, Yao; Dai, Xiaohu] Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fei] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Ecol & Environm, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jie; Ma, Yao; Dai, Xiaohu] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Dai, XH (reprint author), Tongji Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.; Yu, F (reprint author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Ecol & Environm, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.; Dai, XH (reprint author), Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",fyu@vip.163.com; daixiaohu@tongji.edu.cn,"Ma, Jie/F-3486-2010; ma, jie/D-3801-2011","Ma, Jie/0000-0002-4494-1844; ma, jie/0000-0002-4494-1844","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [21577099, 21777118]",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21577099 and 21777118).

However, consequences of this silvicultural practice are still not well known. We examined the influence of three thinning levels on long-term soil carbon storage, soil respiration (Rs), and soil properties. Our results showed that soil carbon stocks decreased significantly with increasing thinning intensity at a soil depth of 0-70 cm, whereas soil water storage increased, especially in the deep soil layers (30-70 cm). Mean Rs rates during the growing season increased significantly with increasing thinning intensity, and the dynamics of Rs coincided with that of soil temperature. Generally, 65% to 73% of the variation in Rs rates in three thinning levels was explained by the changes in soil temperature. WTH significantly increased soil bulk density at the 0-to 30-cm and soil pH at the 0-to 20-cm depths and significantly decreased soil nitrogen and C: N ratio in the 0-to 20-cm layers. As no significant effect of WTH was detected on fine root biomass, we attributed the elevated soil respiration to accelerated decomposition of organic matter as a result of elevated soil temperature and substrate quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for WTH to relieve water deficits in spruce plantations in semiarid regions but suggest that WTH has a negative impact on carbon sequestration.","[He, Zhi-Bin; Chen, Long-Fei; Du, Jun; Zhu, Xi; Lin, Peng-Fei; Li, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Linze Inland River Basin Res Stn, Chinese Ecosyst Res Network,Key Lab Ecohydrol Inl, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Yang-Zhou] Guizhou Inst Forest Inventory & Planning, Guiyang 550000, Guizhou, Peoples R China","He, ZB; Chen, LF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Linze Inland River Basin Res Stn, Chinese Ecosyst Res Network,Key Lab Ecohydrol Inl, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",hzbmail@lzb.ac.cn; chenlongfei_mail@163.com,,"Chen, Fei/0000-0003-1027-8172","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41701296, 41522102, 41601051]; CAS ""Light of West China"" Program [29Y829861]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41701296, 41522102 and 41601051; CAS ""Light of West China"" Program, Grant/Award Number: 29Y829861",,60,1,1,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Net primary productivity in the driest regions of Mexico (< 0.5 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) -3.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)) was similar to the mean of the deserts of the world, but in the less dry regions it was almost four times larger and similar to the drier TDF. Total litterfall (2.85 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) +/- 0.64 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), 12 sites) was higher than in the North American deserts and close to the lower end of values for TDF's. Litter decomposition rate (0.001 g C y(-1) -4 g C y(-1)) was lower than in non-desert regions. Microbial respiration of soil (28.4 mu g C g(-1) d(-1) +/- 5.44 mu g C g(-1) d(-1), 10 sites) depended mainly on precipitation and the concentration of carbon and nitrogen. Water availability is the main factor controlling biomass and productivity in the arid lands of Mexico.

We estimated the main properties of Portuguese sown biodiverse permanent pastures rich in legumes (SBP) starting from measured data for soil organic carbon (SOC) and using the Rothamsted Carbon Model. Starting from a dataset of SOC, aboveground production (AGP) and stocking rates (SR) in SBP, we used an inverse approach to estimate root to shoot (RS) ratios, livestock dung (LD), livestock intake (LI) and the ratio between easily decomposable and resistant plant material. Results for the best fit show that AGP and belowground productivity is approximately the same (RS is equal to 0.96). Animals consume 61% of the AGP, which is within the acceptable range of protein and energy intake. Carbon inputs from dung are also within the range found in the literature (1.53 t C/livestock unit). Inputs from litter are equally distributed between decomposable and resistant material. We applied these parameters in RothC for a dataset from different sites that only comprises SOC to calculate AGP and SR. AGP and SR were consistently lower in this case, because these pastures did not receive adequate technical support. These results highlight the mechanisms for carbon sequestration in SBP.","[Morais, Tiago G.; Teixeira, Ricardo F.

Measured NEE was gap-filled and partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem reparation (R-ECO) using the online tool by Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. Annual NEE, GPP, and R-ECO were correlated with main environmental drivers. Net primary productivity was estimated from EC (NPPEC), as a sum of -NEE and R-h obtained using a constant R-h:R-ECO ratio, and from independent periodic biometric measurements (NPPBM). For comparing the NPP at the seasonal level, we propose a simple model that aimed at accounting for late-summer and autumn carbon storage in the non-structural carbohydrate pool. Over the study period, Jastrebarsko forest acted as a carbon sink, with an average (+/- std. dev.) annual NEE of -319 (+/- 94) gC m(-2) year(-1), GPP of 1594 (+/- 109) gC m(-2) year(-1), and R-ECO of 1275 (+/- 94) gC m(-2) year(-1). Annual NEE showed high inter-annual variability and poor correlation with annual average global radiation, air temperature, and total precipitation, but significant (R-2 = 0.501, p = 0.02) correlation with the change in soil water content between May and September. Comparison of annual NPPEC and NPPBM showed a good overall agreement (R-2 = 0.463, p = 0.03), although in all years NPPBM was lower than NPPEC, with averages of 680 (+/- 88) gC m(-2) year(-1) and 819 (+/- 89) gC m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Lower values of NPPBM indicate that fine roots and grasses contributions to NPP, which were not measured in the study period, could have an important contribution to the overall ecosystem NPP. At a seasonal level, two NPP estimates showed differences in their dynamic, but the application of the proposed model greatly improved the agreement in the second part of the growing season. Further research is needed on the respiration partitioning and mechanisms of carbon allocation.","[Anic, Mislav; Sever, Masa Zorana Ostrogovic; Balenovic, Ivan; Paladinic, Elvis; Tijan, Goran; Vuletic, Dijana; Marjanovic, Hrvoje] Croatian Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Management & Forestry Econ, Cvjetno Naselje 41, Jastrebarsko 10450, Croatia; [Alberti, Giorgio; Peressotti, Alessandro] Univ Udine, Dept Agr Food Environm & Anim Sci, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Alberti, Giorgio] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Biometeorol, Via Caproni 8, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Vecenaj, Zeljko] Univ Zagreb, Dept Geophys, Fac Sci, Horvatovac 95, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Marjanovic, H (reprint author), Croatian Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Management & Forestry Econ, Cvjetno Naselje 41, Jastrebarsko 10450, Croatia.",mislava@sumins.hr; masao@sumins.hr; alberti@uniud.it; ivanb@sumins.hr; elvisp@sumins.hr; peressotti@uniud.it; gorant@sumins.hr; zvecenaj@gfz.hr; dijanav@sumins.hr; hrvojem@sumins.hr,"Marjanovic, Hrvoje/C-9640-2017; Ostrogovic Sever, Masa Zorana/D-3796-2019","Marjanovic, Hrvoje/0000-0001-5701-7581; Ostrogovic Sever, Masa Zorana/0000-0001-9369-0685","Carbon balance drafting and new resources management tools according to Kyoto Protocol-CARBON-PRO - EU programme INTERREG-IIIB CADSES [131669]; Carbon balance and carbon cycling in young Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands - Croatian Forest Ltd.

In plant species that critically rely on mycorrhizal fungi, differences in mycorrhizal communities can contribute to ecological isolation by reducing or even inhibiting germination of immigrant seeds. In this study, we investigated whether the mycorrhizal communities available in the soil and associating with the roots of seedlings and adult plants of the partially mycoheterotrophic Pyrola rotundifolia differed between populations growing in sand dunes and forests. In addition, reciprocal germination experiments were performed to test whether native seeds showed higher germination than immigrant seeds. Our results showed that the mycorrhizal communities differed significantly between forest and dune populations, and that within populations seedlings and adults also associated with different mycorrhizal communities. In both forest and dune populations, mycorrhizal communities were dominated by members of the Thelephoraceae, but dune populations showed a higher incidence of members of the Inocybaceae, whereas forest populations showed a high abundance of members of the Russulaceae. Reciprocal germination experiments showed that native seeds showed a higher germination success than immigrant seeds and this effect was most pronounced in dune populations. Overall, these results demonstrate that plants of P. rotundifolia growing in dune and forest habitats associate with different mycorrhizal communities and that reduced germination of non-native seeds may contribute to reproductive isolation. We conclude that selection against immigrants may constitute an important reproductive barrier at early stages of the speciation process.","[Jacquemyn, Hans; Waud, Michael] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Leuven, Belgium; [Brys, Rein] Res Inst Forest & Nat, Geraardsbergen, Belgium","Jacquemyn, H (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Leuven, Belgium.",hans.jacquemyn@kuleuven.be,"Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; Waud, Michael/0000-0001-7426-2896","Onderzoeksraad, KU LeuvenKU Leuven [C12/15/007]","Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven, Grant/Award Number: grant C12/15/007",,63,1,1,3,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

In this study, we investigated the changes in rhizosphere soil properties, fine root parameters and rhizosphere microbial community composition following Robinia pseudoacacia afforestation. Rhizosphere microorganisms were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Soil available phosphorus (AP) and fine root total phosphorus (RTP) were lower at the 25- and 35-Y sites than at the 5- and 15-Y sites, and fine root parameters could be inferred by soil AP, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) and nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P). Rhizosphere microbial community composition clustered into the 5- and 15-Y group and the 25- and 35-Y group at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. At genus level, 28.57% of the major bacterial genera (relative genera abundances >= 0.1%) and 18.33% of the major fungal genera exhibited significant differences. Rhizosphere soil and fine root properties explained 89.42% and 65.04% of the total variation in the major bacterial genera group, and 84.17% and 62.13% of the total variation in the major fungal genera group at the genus level, respectively. Soil AP and fine root TP are crucial for regulating rhizosphere soil microbial communities. Our results suggest that fine root and soil properties cooperatively affect rhizosphere microbial community composition in the root-soil system following Robinia afforestation.","[Liu, Jinliang; Zhao, Zhong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jinliang; Vu Ngoc Ha; Shen, Zhen; Dang, Peng; Zhu, Hailan; Zhao, Zhong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Comprehens Lab Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jinliang; Dang, Peng; Zhao, Zhong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Silviculture Loess Plateau, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Fei] Beijing Agr Technol Extens Stn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Zhao, Z (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zhaozh@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Ha, Vu Ngoc/K-2007-2019","Ha, Vu Ngoc/0000-0002-4361-7612",Key Techniques and Demonstration of Plantation Landscape Management in the Gullied-hilly Area on the Loess Plateau [2017YFC0504605]; Ecological Protection of Gully Conservation in the Hilly and Gully Area; Technology and Demonstration Technology of the Apple Industry [2016YFC0501706]; National Key Research and Development Program,"This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program, Key Techniques and Demonstration of Plantation Landscape Management in the Gullied-hilly Area on the Loess Plateau (Grant No. 2017YFC0504605), and Ecological Protection of Gully Conservation in the Hilly and Gully Area and the Technology and Demonstration Technology of the Apple Industry (Grant No. 2016YFC0501706).",,52,1,1,9,58,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

However, the effect of grazing on soil fungal communities, which are intimately linked to plants, is not currently known. Therefore, our objectives were to investigate changes caused by reindeer grazing on soil fungal communities, litter decomposition rate and litter degrading extracellular enzyme activities. The study was conducted in four areas divided into grazed and non-grazed sites (all together 38 sample plots) in northern boreal forests in Finnish Lapland. Fungal communities were analyzed from humus with high-throughput sequencing technology (454-pyrosequencing), and litter mass loss and extracellular enzyme activities were analyzed after a one-year litterbag experiment. The results showed that grazing significantly affected the fungal community structure and the abundance of certain fungal genera and species. Grazing also decreased laccase and enhanced cellobiohydrolase I activities from the litterbags. Our study is one of the first to describe detailed fungal community composition in sites with long-term history of reindeer grazing and exclusion. Our results indicate that reindeer grazing alter fungal community structure and litter degradation related enzyme activities in the northern boreal forest soils.","[Santalahti, Minna; Sietio, Outi-Maaria; Heinonsalo, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Microbiol, POB 56,Viikinkaari 9, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Santalahti, Minna; Sietio, Outi-Maaria; Koster, Kajar; Berninger, Frank; Heinonsalo, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Santalahti, Minna] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Agr Sci, Environm Soil Sci, POB 56, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Sun, Hui] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry South, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Koster, Kajar; Berninger, Frank; Heinonsalo, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Fac Agr & Forestry, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Laurila, Tuomas] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Climate Syst Res, POB 506, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Pumpanen, Jukka] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland","Santalahti, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Microbiol, POB 56,Viikinkaari 9, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",minna.santalahti@helsinki.fi,"Koster, Kajar/C-8397-2012","Koster, Kajar/0000-0003-1988-5788; Sietio, Outi-Maaria/0000-0003-0127-9368; Heinonsalo, Jussi/0000-0001-8516-1388; Santalahti, Minna E/0000-0002-3004-1714","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [292699, 263858, 259217, 218094, 292967, 294600, 307222, 286685]; University of Helsinki three-year research grant (PYROFUNGI-N -project); University of Helsinki Doctoral Programme in Microbiology and Biotechnology (MBDP); Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence programAcademy of Finland [307331, 1118615]; ICOS-Finland [281255]; ICOS-ERIC [281250]; Kone Foundation; Nordic Center of Excellence CRAICC; Nordic Center of Excellence DEFROST; ADC 165010015; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland [grant numbers 292699, 263858, 259217, 218094, 292967, 294600, 307222, 286685], University of Helsinki three-year research grant (PYROFUNGI-N -project), University of Helsinki Doctoral Programme in Microbiology and Biotechnology (MBDP), Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence program [project number 307331 and 1118615], ICOS-Finland [281255] and ICOS-ERIC [281250], Kone Foundation and the Nordic Centers of Excellence CRAICC and DEFROST.

To investigate the effects of field inoculation on soil remediation, field studies were conducted in Shendong Daliuta mining area in Yulin, northwest China. Amorpha fruticose plants were treated with under five different inoculations, Funneliformis mosseae (F. m), Rhizophagus intraradices (R. i), F. mosseae and R. intraradices (F. m + R. i), Pantoea sp. (CA), F. mosseae and Pantoea sp. (F. m + CA), as well as no inoculation (CK) as control. The diversity and structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities, glomalin, and soil organic carbon (SOC), available phosphorus, available nitrogen, soil pH were investigated. Based on pyro-sequencing on small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSUs), 63 AM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, which belonged to six genera and two families. F. m + CA inoculation exhibited the highest available phosphorus, the lowest N/P ratio, and higher the ratio between total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP) fractions and soil organic carbon (SOC). Fungal community diversity indices, including Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, and pielou, in F. m inoculation were significantly lower than others, and the phylogenetic index in F. m + CA inoculation was the highest (P < 0.05). In addition, Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses showed that the distribution of AM fungal communities without F. m inoculation were not significantly different from CK. These results demonstrated that the diversities and structures of AM fungal communities were sensitive indicators for monitoring the environmental changes in subsidence area. Furthermore, structural equation model (SEM) showed that AM fungal diversity had direct effects on T-GSRP. In summary, field inoculation of Amorpha fruticose plants had a valid effect on soil remediation, and F. m + CA inoculation is the befitting combination for soil restoration in the experimental field.","[Bi, Yinli; Wang, Kun; Wang, Jin] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Bi, YL (reprint author), China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Safe Min, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",ylbi88@126.com,,,State Key Research Development Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2016YFC0501106]; Capital Science and Technology Talents Training Project (Beijing),We gratefully acknowledge the State Key Research Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0501106) and Capital Science and Technology Talents Training Project (Beijing).,,44,1,1,16,69,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,1873-0272,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Dahl' Old World bluestem [OWB, Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz) S.T. Blake] is a persistent pasture grass in the semi-arid Texas High Plains. Some growers are transitioning their irrigated continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) land to dryland or low-irrigation production of WW-B. Dahl owing to diminished water supply. This grass strongly deters soil-dwelling ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), presumably via release of unidentified phytochemical repellants in the soil. Our aim was to determine whether the inhibitory effects of OWB extend to soil microbial community structure and function in relation to other adapted forages. We compared soil chemical and microbial properties in a Pullman clay-loam soil for OWB relative to OWB-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), alfalfa, and native mixed-grass pastures at 0-5 cm and 10-15 cm depth in June and December of 2016. The pastures ranged in age from 7 to 17 yr. Most measurements of organic forms of C and N showed greatest amounts in OWB-alfalfa; however, not always significantly. Enzyme activities linked to C, N, and S transformations were greatest (P <= 0.03) with OWB-alfalfa. This trend was similar for alkaline phosphatase activity, involved in P cycling, but not always significantly. Soil organic C in OWB was 1.2-1.4 fold greater than in the native mix depending on soil depth and sampling date, whereas SOC in OWB-alfalfa was 1.4-1.6 fold greater than in the native mix. Enzyme activities and microbial biomass N (MBN) were likewise greater in OWB and OWB-alfalfa than in the native mix, likely because the latter received no irrigation or N inputs. The microbial community structure demonstrated greater total FAMEs, bacterial markers for Gram+, Gram-, and actinomycetes in OWB-alfalfa compared to OWB, alfalfa, and native mix. Similar results were found in fungal markers for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and saprophytic fungi. Protozoan indicators were found only in December, of which the native mix had the highest levels in the 0-5 cm depth. In general, selected soil properties, soil microbial biomass, community and enzyme activities were greater in December than in June except AMF, which was greater in June. The stimulating effect of OWB growing with alfalfa on the soil microbial community suggested this forage combination as favorable for soil health in relation to OWB, alfalfa alone, and native mixed-grass pastures. The previously reported inhibitory effect of OWB on soil-dwelling ants did not carry over to a depressing effect on the soil microbial component.","[Bhandari, Krishna B.; West, Charles P.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Acosta-Martinez, Veronica; Cotton, Jon; Cano, Amanda] USDA ARS, Cropping Syst Res Lab, Wind Eros & Water Conservat Unit, Lubbock, TX 79401 USA","Bhandari, KB (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",krishna.bhandari@ttu.edu,,"Cano, Amanda/0000-0001-7047-0479",Southern Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE) [LS14-261],Funding for this research was partially provided by Southern Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE) (Project No. LS14-261).

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of 84 published studies to examine the general responses of CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes to altered precipitation. Our results indicated that increased precipitation significantly increased N2O emissions (+154.0%) and CO2 fluxes (+112.2%) and significantly decreased CH4 uptake (-41.4%); decreased precipitation significantly decreased N2O emissions (-64.7%) and CO2 fluxes (-8.6%) and significantly increased CH4 uptake (+32.4%). Moreover, increased precipitation significantly increased litter biomass and microbial biomass and decreased root biomass and the root: shoot ratio. However, decreased precipitation significantly decreased litter biomass and root biomass and significantly increased root: shoot ratio. These results suggest that precipitation changes could alter the carbon distribution patterns in plants. In addition, the CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes exhibited diverse responses to different ecosystems, durations of precipitation changes, and changes in precipitation intensity. These results demonstrate that there are many factors that regulate the responses of GHG to precipitation changes.","[Yan, Guoyong; Mu, Changcheng; Wang, Qinggui] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yan, Guoyong; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Xing, Yajuan] Inst Forestry Sci Heilongjiang Prov, 134 Haping Rd, Harbin 150081, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Wang, QG (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.; Wang, QG (reprint author), Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Agr Resource & Environm, 74 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",qgwang1970@163.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China ""Global Change and Response"" [2016YFA0600800]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41773075, 41575137, 31370494, 31170421]; key projects of Heilongjiang Province Natural Science Foundation [ZD201406]; basic research fund of Heilongjiang Province [HDRCCX-201612]","This research was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China ""Global Change and Response"" (2016YFA0600800), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41773075, 41575137, 31370494, and 31170421), the key projects of Heilongjiang Province Natural Science Foundation (ZD201406), and the basic research fund of Heilongjiang Province (HDRCCX-201612).",,51,0,0,22,67,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",Aug-71,1918-1841,,CAN J SOIL SCI,Can.

Abiotic conditions sift tree species from a regional pool via functional traits that influence species' suitability to the local environment. In addition, human land use can modify species distributions and change functional diversity of forests. However, it is unclear how environment and land use simultaneously shape functional diversity of tree communities. Land-use legacies are especially prominent in temperate forest landscapes that have been extensively modified by humans in the last few centuries. Across a 900-ha temperate deciduous forest in the northeastern United States, comprising a mosaic of different-aged stands due to past human land use, we used four key functional traits-maximum height, rooting depth, wood density, and seed mass-to examine how multiple environmental and land-use variables influenced species distributions and functional diversity. We sampled similar to 40,000 trees >8 cm DBH within 485 plots totaling 137 ha. Species within plots were more functionally similar than expected by chance when we estimated functional diversity using all traits together (multi-trait), and to a lesser degree, with each trait separately. Multi-trait functional diversity was most strongly correlated with distance from the perennial stream, elevation, slope, and forest age. Environmental and land-use predictors varied in their correlation with functional diversities of the four individual traits. Landscape-wide change in abundances of individual species also correlated with both environment and land-use variables, but magnitudes of trait-environment interactions were generally stronger than trait interactions with land use. These findings can be applied for restoration and assisted regeneration of human-modified temperate forests by using traits to predict which tree species would establish well in relation to land-use history, topography, and soil conditions.","[Krishnadas, Meghna; Zuluaga, Juan Carlos Penagos; Zhu, Yan; Queenborough, Simon A.; Comita, Liza S.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Beckman, Noelle G.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beckman, Noelle G.] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Zhu, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Whitacre, James; Wenzel, John W.] Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Powdermill Nat Reserve, 1847 Route 381, Rector, PA 15677 USA; [Comita, Liza S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Box 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Krishnadas, M (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",meghna.krishnadas@yale.edu,"Beckman, Noelle G./E-5554-2011","Beckman, Noelle G./0000-0001-5822-0610",Heinz Endowments; Mathematical Biosciences Institute under the U.S. National Science Foundation [DMS 0931642]; National SocioEnvironmental Synthesis Center under the U.S. National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875],Heinz Endowments funded the vegetation survey at PNR.

Most reports of positive mixture effects on carbon storage focus on mixtures that combine tree species with contrasting traits, but little is known on the effect of mixing species that are expected to behave quite similarly as they belong to the same genus. In this study, we assessed the effect of mixed versus monospecific stands of Pinus sylvestris and P. pinaster on carbon storage and exchangeable cations along the soil profile, based on research with six triplets in the northern Iberian Peninsula (Spain). One soil pit of at least 40cm depth was dug at each plot for organic and mineral horizons characterization. Two trends were found: in the topsoil, higher values of carbon stock and total organic carbon were found in P. sylvestris stands, lower in P. pinaster stands and intermediate in mixed stands; this pattern was related to the C/N ratio of the forest floor. In the intermediate soil layers, it tends to be higher in mixed stands and is related to percentage of fine roots and to the greater thickness of the first mineral horizon. Differences in soil exchangeable cations among stands were related to the total organic carbon content. These results improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying soil carbon accumulation in mixed stands and emphasize the use of mixtures as a strategy to combat climate change, due to the advantage in the accumulation of carbon in the subsoil layers.

Although many case studies have been done, how forest thinning affects soil carbon stocks and dynamics remains unclear, especially at different recovery stage. Here, we synthesized the results from 53 peer reviewed publications and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the general responses of 10 variables related to forest soil carbon stocks and dynamics to forest thinning management. Overall, we did not find remarkable effects of thinning on soil moisture, fine root biomass and soil carbon stocks (including soil total carbon, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon). However, thinning resulted in a significant reduction in litterfall production (-23.7%), while significantly increasing soil temperature (+8.7%) and soil respiration (+29.4%) in general. In particular, the effect of forest thinning on soil respiration was significant in light (thinning intensity < 33%) to moderate (33-67% of thinning intensity) thinning. In the early stage of recovery (<= 2 yr after thinning), this effect was also significant. Thinning significantly increased soil respiration in both broadleaved (+35.6%) and mixed forests (+9.3%) but not in coniferous forest due to the difference of litterfall quality. These results provide a synthetic review of the effects of forest thinning on soil carbon stocks and dynamics and may help to improve forest management strategies.","[Zhang, Xinzhong; Guan, Dexin; Sun, Di; Jin, Changjie; Yuan, Fenghui; Wang, Anzhi; Wu, Jiabing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Weibin] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Grassland Livestock Ind Innovat,State Key, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xinzhong; Sun, Di] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Wu, JB (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",wujb@iae.ac.cn,"Yuan, Fenghui/W-3609-2019","Yuan, Fenghui/0000-0003-1004-873X; Zhang, Xinzhong/0000-0002-1662-1157","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010301]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41675112, 31400541]; National Science and Technology Program of China [2015BAD07B0505]","This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB15010301), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41675112, 31400541) and the National Science and Technology Program of China (2015BAD07B0505).

CaGg is a nonessential mutualist of AMF, whereas the lifestyle of CaMg is unknown. To start unraveling the interactions between AMF and their endosymbionts in nature, we examined diversity and distribution of AMF-associated endobacteria in North Atlantic dunes at Cape Cod. Of nearly 500 foredune AMF isolates successfully genotyped during a systematic study, 94% were classified as Gigasporaceae. Two percent of all AMF spores harbored CaGg, and 88% contained CaMg. CaGg was found only in the Gigasporaceae, whereas CaMg was present in Gigasporaceae, Acaulosporaceae, and Diversisporaceae. Incidence of CaGg across AMF was not affected by any of the environmental parameters measured, whereas distribution of CaMg in one of the fungal hosts was impacted by plant density. CaMg populations associated with AMF individuals displayed high levels of genetic diversity but no evidence of gene flow, suggesting that host physical proximity is not sufficient to facilitate horizontal transmission of CaMg. Finally, in addition to a novel lineage of CaGg, we discovered that AMF likely harbor Burkholderia-related bacteria with close phylogenetic affinity to free-living Burkholderia and endobacteria of other Mucoromycota fungi.","[Lastovetsky, Olga A.] Cornell Univ, Grad Field Microbiol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ahn, Ezekiel; Mondo, Stephen J.; Toomer, Kevin H.; Zhang, Aolin; Pawlowska, Teresa E.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci Plant Pathol & Plant Micro, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Johnson, Lynn M.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Stat Consulting Unit, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Pawlowska, TE (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci Plant Pathol & Plant Micro, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tep8@cornell.edu,,"Pawlowska, Teresa/0000-0002-1094-2427; Lastovetsky, Olga/0000-0002-3989-0915","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0918880, IOS-1261004, DBI-1263103]; National Science Foundation Biology Research Fellowship [DBI-0933921]; Frederic N.

The cells of root tip were analyzed for mitotic and phase indexes as well as aberrations appeared in the interphase and mitotic phase. One way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey HSD test were applied for comparison between experimental groups. The results showed that the mitotic index in one of the treated groups increased significantly compared to the control. Also the frequency of prophase in two of treated groups increased significantly compared to that of the control. There was a borderline significant increase in the frequency average of total aberrations from three treated groups compared to that of the control (p value=0.063). Also, a significant increase was observed in the frequency average of disturbed mitosis from three treated groups compared to that of the control (p value=0.04).

One important issue is to understand which processes are at the origin of observed aboveground overyielding in some mixed forests. We used a beech-maple plantation exhibiting aboveground overyielding to test whether belowground processes could explain this pattern. Soil cores were collected to determine fine root (FR) biomass and vertical distribution. Correlograms were used to detect spatial arrangement. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used to identify the tree species proportion in the FR samples and spatial root segregation. An isotopic approach was used to identify water acquisition patterns. The structure and the composition of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community were determined by high-throughput sequencing of DNA in the soil samples. We found no spatial pattern for FR biomass or for its vertical distribution along the gradients. No vertical root segregation was found, as FR density for both species decreased with depth in a similar way. The two species displayed similar vertical water acquisition profiles as well, mainly absorbing water from shallow soil layers; hence, niche differentiation for water acquisition was not highlighted here. Significant alterations in the fungal community compositions were detected in function of the percentage of maple in the vicinity of beech. Our findings do not support the commonly suggested drivers of aboveground overyielding in species-diverse forests and suggest that competition reduction or between-species facilitation of belowground resource acquisition may not explain the observed aboveground overyielding.","[Fruleux, Alexandre; Bogeat-Triboulot, Marie-Beatrice; Collet, Catherine; Santenoise, Philippe; Bonal, Damien] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Silva, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Deveau, Aurelie] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR IAM, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Saint-Andre, Laurent; Santenoise, Philippe] INRA, UR BEF, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Fruleux, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Silva, F-54000 Nancy, France.",alexandre.fruleux@gmail.com,,"Deveau, Aurelie/0000-0001-6266-5241; Fruleux, Alexandre/0000-0003-4166-8069","French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the ""Investissements d'Avenir"" programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","This study was funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the ""Investissements d'Avenir"" program (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01, Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE).

Herbivores above ground alter plant defenses in both leaves and roots, affecting plant-herbivore interactions above and below ground. Root symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), also influence the defenses of leaves and roots, and alter plant responses to herbivory. However, we lack an understanding of how AMF mediate plant responses to herbivores simultaneously in above and belowground plant tissues, despite the ubiquity of such interactions and their consequences for ecological communities. In a full factorial experiment, we subjected plants of four milkweed (Asclepias) species under three levels of AMF inoculum availability to damage by aphids Aphis nerii, caterpillars Danaus plexippus, or no herbivores. We then measured foliar and root cardenolides (chemical defenses), leaf toughness, latex exudation (physical defenses), foliar carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous concentrations, plant biomass, and levels of AMF colonization of roots. Plants inoculated with AMF generally produced tougher leaves with higher cardenolide concentrations than did plants without AMF. In contrast, root cardenolides were altered by AMF inoculum availability in a plant species-specific manner. The relative induction or suppression of foliar cardenolides and leaf toughness by herbivores was altered strongly by the level of AMF inoculum available to plants. However, AMF did not influence caterpillar-induction or aphid-suppression of root cardenolides. In addition, herbivore feeding induced substantial changes in levels of AMF colonization of roots in a plant species-specific manner. We demonstrate that the availability of AMF in soil alters herbivore induction and suppression of plant defenses strongly, and does so differently in above and belowground plant tissues. Furthermore, we show that herbivore feeding alters levels of AMF colonization substantially, completing a feedback loop between above- and belowground organisms. Our study suggests that indirect interactions between AMF and herbivores may have community-wide consequences by altering plant phenotype above and below ground.","[Meier, Amanda R.; Hunter, Mark D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Meier, AR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",armeier@umich.edu,,"Meier, Amanda/0000-0003-1085-4715",University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1256115]; NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD),"The work was supported by a Block Grant, Matthaei Botanical Gardens Research Award, and Rackham Graduate Student Research Grant from the University of Michigan to ARM, NSF DEB 1256115 to MDH and a NSF GRFP to ARM.",,134,4,4,19,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2018,127,12,,,,,1759,1775,,10.1111/oik.05402,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC5OB,WOS:000451851200006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wubs, ERJ; Melchers, PD; Bezemer, TM",,,,"Wubs, E.

However, the origin of the donor material may differentially influence early- and late-successional plant species. Donor soil from late-succession stages may benefit target plant species due to a higher abundance of soil-borne mutualists. Arable soils, on the other hand, may suppress ruderals as they support more root herbivores that preferentially attack ruderal plant species, while mid-succession soils may be intermediate in their effects on ruderals and target species performance. We hypothesized that a mixture of arable and late-succession inocula may outperform pure late-successional inocula for restoration, by promoting late-successional target plants, while simultaneously reducing ruderal species' performance. Methods We conducted a glasshouse experiment and tested the growth of ruderal and target plant species on pure and mixed inocula. The inocula were derived from arable fields, mid-succession grasslands and late-succession heathlands and we created a replacement series testing different pairwise mixitures for each of these inocula types (ratios: 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 of inoculum A and B respectively). Results In general, we found that a higher proportion of heathland material led to a higher aboveground biomass of target plant species, while responses of ruderal species were variable. We found synergistic effects when specific inocula were mixed. In particular, a 50:50 mixture of heathland and arable soil in the inoculum led to a significant reduction in ruderal species biomass relative to the two respective pure inocula. The overall response was driven by Myosotis arvensis, since the other two ruderal species were not significantly affected. Conclusions Mixing inocula from different successional stages can lead to synergistic effects on restoration, but this highly depends on the specific combination of inocula, the mixing ratio and plant species. This suggest that specific inocula may need to be developed in order to rapidly restore different plant communities.","[Wubs, E. R. Jasper; Melchers, Pauline D.; Bezemer, T.

Methods Soil samples were collected from treatments submitted to different fertilization strategies (chemical fertilizers, A. sinicus green manure, various input levels). Nodules obtained from the A. sinicus trapping plants grown in the soil samples were used for rhizobial isolation. The isolates were grouped into PCR-RFLP genotypes based on analyses of 16S rRNA gene and IGS, and representatives for each genotype were further subjected to phylogenetic analyses of housekeeping genes (16S rRNA gene, atpD, glnII, and rpoB), as well as symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH). Soil physicochemical characteristics were also estimated and redundancy analysis was performed to examine the relations between soil features and distribution of rhizobial genotypes across different fertilization treatments. Results A total of 257 rhizobial isolates were obtained and discriminated into 12 IGS types in a single 16S rRNA type by RFLP analyses. Further 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogeny and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) distinguished a minor group (10 strains, 4 IGS types) affiliated to Mesorhizobium huakuii and a main group (247 strains, 8 IGS types) to Mesorhizobium jarvisii, for which a novel symbiovar, sv. astragali, was described. The long-term input of A. sinicus green manure increased rhizobial diversity and modified rhizobial community structures, via the increase of organic matter and decrease of soil pH, available phosphate, available potassium, and total salt. Conclusions M. jarvisii sv. nov. astragali was the predominant microsymbiont of A. sinicus in the tested acidic soils. The long-term input of green manure modified the soil features, enhancing the genetic diversity of rhizobia associated with A. sinicus and alternating the rhizobial community structure.","[Zhang, Junjie; Shang, Yimin; Guo, Chen; Yang, Xu; Zheng, Jianqiang] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Henan Key Lab Cold Chain Food Qual & Safety Contr, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Food Prod & Safety Henan P, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Entao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Dept Microbiol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [Chen, Wenfeng] State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Rhizobium Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [de Lajudie, Philippe] LSTM, IRD, Campus Baillarguet TA-A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Li, Benyin; Liu, Chunzeng] Henan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Nutr & Resource Environm, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China","Zhang, JJ (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.; Liu, CZ (reprint author), Henan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Nutr & Resource Environm, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",kirka640@163.com; liucz321@aliyun.com,"de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008","de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352; Wang, En Tao/0000-0001-6606-6916","China Agriculture Research System-Green Manure [CARS-22]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400008, 31571778]; National Human and Social Security Ministry of Science and Technology for Overseas Returnees [21104000005]; Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico [SIP20171259]","This work was financed by the China Agriculture Research System-Green Manure (Project No. CARS-22), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31400008 and 31571778), National Human and Social Security Ministry of Science and Technology for Overseas Returnees (Project No. 21104000005).

This study investigated how OMR influences long-term stability of soil fungi to a depth of 1 m using a replicated experimental pine forest in the Gulf Coastal Plain, USA. Treatments included unharvested control stands as well as low- and high-OMR stands. Intensive OMR led to significant differences in community structure and the abundance of functional guilds in surficial soil. Saprophytic taxa increased while ectomycorrhizal (ECM) taxa decreased with intensive-OMR, which correlated strongly with increased surface temperature and reduced soil nitrogen. Ericoid mycorrhizae (ERM) also increased in intensive-OMR stands, which may indicate that following disturbance, ERM could outcompete ECM for colonization of subsequent seedlings. Overall, no differences were observed below 30 cm, except for alpha diversity, which was a function of high inter-replicate variability. Our results illustrate a distinct long-term structural and functional response of soil fungi to intensive-OMR in the upper portions of the soil profile, which could lead to altered stand productivity and ecosystem services.","[Mushinski, Ryan M.; Boutton, Thomas W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, TAMU 2138, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gentry, Terry J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, TAMU 2474, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mushinski, Ryan M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Mushinski, RM (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rymush@iu.edu,"; Boutton, Thomas/C-5821-2016","Mushinski, Ryan/0000-0003-3572-3500; Boutton, Thomas/0000-0002-7522-5728",Office of Graduate and Professional Studies; McMillan-Ward Fellowship from the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at Texas AM University; USDA/NIFA Hatch Project [1003961],"Ryan Mushinski was supported by a Graduate Merit Fellowship from the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies, and by a McMillan-Ward Fellowship from the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at Texas A&M University.

The aim of this study was to clarify whether coarse root diameter of C. japonica in weathered granite soils can be estimated using GPR in a forest. Roots of mature C. japonica were scanned using a 900MHz GPR antenna before being excavated. The diameter and distribution of excavated roots were compared with those identified by GPR, and the relationships between the diameter and waveform indices in radar profiles were also examined. The detection frequency of the number of roots larger than 5mm in diameter was 47.7%. Limiting factors affecting root detection using GPR in forest field conditions were small root diameter, increasing root depth, and number of adjacent roots. Only one waveform index, using the sum of time intervals between zero crossings (sigma T, ns) of all reflection waveforms of GPR within the range from the first break time at the root top to the delay point time at the root bottom, had a significant relationship with excavated root diameters. A linear regression model was constructed to estimate root diameter using sigma T, and a significant positive relationship in diameter between GPR-estimated and excavated roots was confirmed. The results in this study indicate that the diameter and distribution of C. japonica coarse roots under forest field conditions could be estimated using GPR and this technique could contribute to future evaluation of slope stability by evaluating tree roots under vulnerable soils, such as weathered granite.","[Yamase, Keitaro; Todo, Chikage] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, 430 Shiso, Kobe, Hyogo 6712515, Japan; [Tanikawa, Toko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ohashi, Mizue; Ikeno, Hidetoshi] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Aono, Kenji] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd KANSO Technos, Osaka 5410052, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Yamase, K (reprint author), Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, 430 Shiso, Kobe, Hyogo 6712515, Japan.",kei-yamase@nike.eonet.ne.jp,,"Yamase, Keitaro/0000-0002-2689-0633","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25252027]","This study was funded partly by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant number, 25252027).",,50,1,1,7,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

After the end of the stress episode, plants may modify some leaf and plant traits to compensate for biomass loss. The aim of this work was to analyze the post-flooding responses of different willow genotypes under two different depths of floodwater. The hypothesis was that the growth recovery in the post-flooding period would be different according to the genotype and the floodwater depth. We analyzed three genotypes of five willow families (four interspecific hybrids and one open-pollinated family). The treatments were: (1) Control: plants watered to field capacity; (2) T10: water covering 10cm above soil level; (3) T65: water covering 65cm above soil level. Both flooding treatments were followed by a period of recovery (without flooding). Growth was reduced by flooding in T65 but not in T10, while root-to-shoot ratio was reduced in both flooding treatments. The relative growth rate in height, leaf nitrogen concentration, stomatal conductance and electron transport rate changed in a different manner during the post-flooding period, depending on the treatment and genetic background. These results emphasize the need for evaluating a post-flooding recovery period for the breeding of willow genotypes destined for areas under risk of flooding. According to our results, Salix matsudana could be a source of flooding tolerance for willow breeding programs.","[Doffo, Guillermo N.; Rodriguez, Maria E.; Olguin, Flavia Y.; Luquez, Virginia M.

However, these enhancements are not widely observed under field conditions because field sterilization is difficult. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AM fungi on P uptake and the growth of Allium fistulosum in non-fumigated and fumigated fields, under different levels of P availability. Plants were inoculated with the AM fungus Glomus R-10 and grown in fumigated soil. For the uninoculated treatment, a sterilized inoculum was applied directly. The field was fumigated using dazomet. Superphosphate was applied to the field at the rates of 0 (P0) or 500 (P500) kg P2O5 ha(-1). The inoculated and uninoculated plants were transplanted into the fields and sampled three times to measure AM fungal colonization, shoot P concentration, and shoot dry weight of the plants. At the transplanting stage, AM fungal colonization was observed in the inoculated plants (>70%) but not in the uninoculated plants. At the third sampling, irrespective of P treatment, AM fungal colonization was observed both in the uninoculated and inoculated plants in the non-fumigated field, and there was no difference in shoot P content and shoot dry weight between the inoculated and uninoculated plants. AM fungal colonization in the fumigated field was higher in the inoculated than uninoculated plants, irrespective of P treatment; shoot P content and shoot dry weight were both higher in the inoculated plants than in the uninoculated plants with P0. These results suggest that the responses of A. fistulosum to AM fungal inoculation under the low-P and fumigated conditions are similar to those observed in sterilized pot culture conditions.","[Sato, Takumi; Cheng, Weiguo; Tawaraya, Keitaro] Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan","Tawaraya, K (reprint author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",tawaraya@tds1.tr.yamagata-u.ac.jp,", Tawaraya/R-1981-2019",,JST ACCELJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJAC1403],"This work was supported by JST ACCEL [Grant Number: JPMJAC1403), Japan.",,29,0,0,5,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

This study assessed the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, in particular of Funneliformis mosseae, on the biological invasion process by P. aculeata and P. juliflora. F. mosseae is a cosmopolitan arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) frequently found in association with plants of different regions of the world. The present study was conducted to determine if F. mosseae is present in the soils from two invaded areas by P. aculeata and P. juliflora and to evaluate its contribution to the growth of these invasive plant species. Firstly, AMF colonization and AMF spore abundance was assessed in the roots and rhizosphere of both species in the field. Spores of F. mosseae were obtained from the soil samples and used to set up a greenhouse experiment to evaluate its effect on plant dry biomass and plant phosphorus concentration for both exotic plant species. We found that F. mosseae inoculation promoted the growth of the invaders and lead to a higher P concentration. Our results demonstrate that (a) AMF play an important role in the biological invasion process of the Brazilian tropical seasonal dry forest by P. aculeata and P. juliflora and (b) F. mosseae might be an important AMF species during the biological invasion process.","[Feitosa de Souza, Tancredo Augusto; Santos, Djail] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agr Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil; [Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana; Freitas, Helena] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [de Andrade, Leonaldo Alves] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agr Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil","de Souza, TAF (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soils & Rural Engn, Agr Sci Ctr, BR-58397000 Areia, Paraiba, Brazil.",tancredo_agro@hotmail.com; susanar@ci.uc.pt; hfreita@ci.uc.pt; landrade@cca.ufpb.br,,"Souza, Tancredo/0000-0001-8729-5478",,,,40,0,0,2,4,PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC,MOSCOW,"PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA",1067-4136,1608-3334,,RUSS J ECOL+,Russ.

On the one hand, mutualists might thrive in new habitats thanks to the resources, stress tolerance or defence provided by their partners. On the other, specialized mutualists might fail to find compatible partners beyond their range margins, limiting further spread. A recent global analysis of legume ranges found that non-symbiotic legumes have been successfully introduced to more ranges than legumes that form symbioses with rhizobia, but there is still abundant unexplained variation in introduction success within symbiotic legumes. We test the hypothesis that generalist legumes have spread to more ranges than specialist legumes. We used published data and rhizobial 16S rRNA sequences from GenBank to quantify the number of rhizobia partners that associate with 159 legume species, spanning the legume phylogeny and the globe. We found that generalist legumes occur in more introduced ranges than specialist legumes, suggesting that among mutualists, specialization hinders range expansions.","[Harrison, Tia L.; Stinchcombe, John R.; Frederickson, Megan E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Simonsen, Anna K.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Harrison, TL (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",tia.harrison@mail.utoronto.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We acknowledge funding from NSERC Discovery Grant (J.R.S., M.E.F.) and NSERC Graduate Scholarship (T.L.H.).",,17,2,2,3,7,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Exploitation of rainwater is an effective avenue for alleviating water scarcity in semiarid regions since ground water is generally unavailable there. Through the method of space-for-time substitution, we investigated the soil moisture and root distribution along a range of stand ages (6, 9, 12, 18 and 21 years) in rain-fed apple (Malus pumila Mill) orchards and the effects of rainwater collection and infiltration systems (RWCI) on root-zone soil water and fine root distributions in matures apple orchards (21 years) in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that the mean soil moisture content (SMC) in the shallow layer (< 2 m) decreased with apple tree age (6 to 18 years); the deep SMC (> 2 m) was higher than shallow soil layers (< 2 m) in most cases and the SMC increased with depth in stands of all ages. Fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) showed an obvious trend of extending deeper with apple tree age - nearly 8 m in a 12-yr-old apple plantation and > 8 m in plantations > 12 years old. Dry root weight density (RWD) decreased sharply with depth, but densities at each depth were greater in older stands. The RWCI system significantly increased SMCs from the surface down to the maximum rainfall infiltration depth (MRID) (2 m depth) (P < 0.05), especially in the 0.2-1 m soil layer. Further, we found that apple tree water requirements could be sustainably met when RWCI system and a low-volume of irrigation water was applied. The distribution of root system was greatly affected by the RWCI system, which led to higher root densities close to the wetted area in the shallow soil layers (2 m soil depth) under RWCI system, down to a depth of 3 m in the soil. Overall, the application of RWCI system could be an effective water management strategy for providing sustainable water resources for semiarid orchards.","[Song, Xiaolin; Wu, Pute] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xiaodong; Wu, Pute; Zhao, Xining] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Xiaolin; Gao, Xiaodong; Zhang, Wei; Wu, Pute; Zhao, Xining] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Water Saving Agr Arid Areas China, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Xiaolin; Gao, Xiaodong; Zhang, Wei; Wu, Pute; Zhao, Xining] Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Saving Irrigat Yangling, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Dyck, Miles] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Zhang, Wei] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Water Conservancy & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jie] Baota Dist Fruit Bur Yanan City, Yanan 716000, Peoples R China","Zhao, XN (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zxn@nwafu.edu.cn,,"Dyck, Miles/0000-0003-4986-673X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41401315, 41571506, 51579212]; key development foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFZD-SW-306]; Technical Innovation Engineering Project of Shaanxi [2015KTCL02-25]","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41401315, 41571506, 51579212), the key development foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KFZD-SW-306), and the Technical Innovation Engineering Project of Shaanxi (No. 2015KTCL02-25).",,65,4,7,6,41,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,NOV,2018,170,,,,,,324,334,,10.1016/j.catena.2018.06.026,,,11,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,GQ4YD,WOS:000441681500028,,,,,10/31/19J,"Duarte, B; Silva, H; Dias, JM; Sleimi, N; Marques, JC; Cacador, I",,,,"Duarte, Bernardo; Silva, Helena; Dias, Joao Miguel; Sleimi, Noomene; Marques, Joao Carlos; Cacador, Isabel",,,Functional and ecophysiological traits of Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis ecotypes in Mediterranean salt marshes under different tidal exposures,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biomass allocation; Photobiology; Oxidative stress; Adaptation; Salt marsh,SPARTINA-MARITIMA; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; PLANT ZONATION; BIOMASS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES; GROWTH; LEAF; RIA; DECOMPOSITION,"The present paper aims to discuss the functional and ecophysiological traits of two abundant succulent halophytes in Mediterranean salt marsh systems, considering two ecotypes differing on their tidal exposure. In Halimione portulacoides the higher root/shoot (R/S) biomass ratio verified in low inundation frequency (LF) marshes, as compared with that in high inundation frequency (HF), indicates an optimal partitioning strategy, inducing differential allocation patterns along with varying environmental factors. Conversely, Sarcocornia perennis appear to have an isometric allocation strategy, based on intrinsic biomass allocation mechanisms independent from the surrounding environmental conditions. Similarly, the photosynthetic traits appear to reflect the intrinsic ecology of the species. Sarcocornia perennis habitat adaptation to HF conditions is clearly revealed by its high photosynthetic efficiency under HF conditions. On the other hand, the cosmopolitan H. portulacoides shows no differences between ecotypes, in which concerns this trait, mostly due to the high carotenoid content of the HF ecotype, which allows this specie to counteract the stress generated during submersion. Additionally, anti-oxidant enzymatic activities revealed that S. perennis presents a high degree of stress tolerance under HF conditions, while H. portulacoides is highly adapted to LF conditions. These functional (biomass-related) and physiological traits determine the optimal habitats for H. portulacoides and S. perennis. While H. portulacoides optimal biomass partitioning, along with its efficient anti-oxidant defence system, makes this species fitter to LF conditions, S. perennis isometric allocation strategy, along with a higher photosynthetic efficiency under frequent flooding conditions, provides this species the mechanisms to efficiently colonize the intertidal habitat.","[Duarte, Bernardo; Cacador, Isabel] Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Sci, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Helena] Univ Aveiro, Biol Dept, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Silva, Helena; Dias, Joao Miguel] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Dias, Joao Miguel] Univ Aveiro, Phys Dept, Campus Santiago, Aveiro, Portugal; [Sleimi, Noomene] Univ Carthage, Fac Sci Bizerte, UR MaNE, Jarzouna 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia; [Marques, Joao Carlos] Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Zool, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal","Duarte, B (reprint author), Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Sci, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",baduarte@fc.ul.pt,"Duarte, Bernardo/H-2001-2011; Dias, Joao Miguel/F-3292-2010; MARQUES, JOAO CARLOS/L-9478-2014","Duarte, Bernardo/0000-0003-1914-7435; Dias, Joao Miguel/0000-0002-7613-6241; MARQUES, JOAO CARLOS/0000-0001-8865-8189",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UID/MAR/04292/2013]; Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) [UID/AMB/50017/2013]; ECOSAM project [PTDC/AAC-CLI/104085/2008]; Mar 2020 program through the RESTAURA2020 project [16-01-04-FMP-0014]; FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH/BPD/115162/2016],"The authors would like to thank to the ""Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)"" for funding the research in the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre (MARE) and in the Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) throughout the projects UID/MAR/04292/2013 and UID/AMB/50017/2013, respectively, and this specific work throughout the ECOSAM project (PTDC/AAC-CLI/104085/2008).

Globally, does orchid diversity correlate with land area? In Australia, does diversity correlate with herbarium collecting effort, range size, or climate niche breadth? Where are Australia's orchids distributed spatially, in protected areas, and in climate space? Location Global, then Australia. Methods We compared orchid diversity with land area for continents and recognized orchid diversity hotspots. Then, we used cleaned herbarium records to compare collecting effort (for Australian Orchidaceae vs. all other plant families, and also among orchid genera). Spatial and climate distributions were mapped to determine orchids' coverage in the protected area network, range sizes, and niche breadths. Results Globally, orchid diversity does not correlate with land area (depauperate regions are the subantarctic: 10 species, and northern North America: 394 species). Australian herbarium records and collecting effort generally reflect orchid species diversity (1,583 spp.), range sizes, and niche breadths. Orchids are restricted to 13% of Australia's landmass with 211 species absent from any protected areas. Species richness is the greatest in three biomes with high general biodiversity: Temperate (especially southwest and southeast Australia), Tropical, and Subtropical (coastal northern Queensland). Absence from the Desert is consistent with our realized climate niche-orchids avoid high temperature/low rainfall environments. Orchids have narrower range sizes than nonorchid species. Highly diverse orchid genera have narrower rainfall breadths than less diverse genera. Main conclusions Herbarium data are adequate for testing hypotheses about Australian orchids. Distribution is likely driven by environmental factors. In contrast, diversification did not correlate with increases in range size, rainfall, or temperature breadths, suggesting speciation does not occur via invasion and local adaptation to new habitats. Instead, diversification may rely on access to extensive obligate symbioses with mycorrhizae and/or pollinators.","[Gaskett, Anne C.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Gallagher, Rachael V.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Gaskett, AC (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.",a.gaskett@auckland.ac.nz,,"Gallagher, Rachael/0000-0002-4680-8115",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE170100208],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DE170100208",,88,0,0,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, the abandoned charcoal hearths form a network of microhabitats with peculiar vegetation and soil conditions. Previous observational studies showed that establishment of woody species at these sites is severely hindered for unknown reasons. To test the effects of charcoal hearth soil on tree growth we used a common garden experiment with three major Euro-Mediterranean forest trees with different traits and ecology, one evergreen (Quercus ilex, holm oak) and two deciduous (Fagus sylvatica, beech, and Quercus cerris, Turkey oak). These were sown on control and charcoal-enriched soil collected in forest hearths abandoned since decades. Seed germination, seedling growth, photosynthetic efficiency and mortality were measured over a period of two years. Some responses were species-specific, while others were possibly associated to key traits such as evergreen vs. deciduous habit. Although charcoal soil effects were mainly positive on growth rate (height increase), they were mostly negative on germination of beech seeds, survival of holm oak seedlings, and photosynthetic efficiency. Although total biomass was not significantly affected, the root:shoot ratio was increased as a possible effect of physiological drought on hearth soil. These results support field-based evidence that the long persistence of charcoal remains in the soil may be not a favourable condition for forest regeneration. Management implications concern the use of biochar practices to promote forest restoration, which should be further tested on a wide range of species in different life-stages before applications in the field, also considering its long-term consequences.","[Carrari, Elisa] CNR, Ist Prot Sostenibile Marge, Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Ampoorter, Evy; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, Dept Forest & Water Management, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium; [Bussotti, Filippo; Selvi, Federico] Univ Firenze, Labs Bot, Sect Soil & Plant Sci, Dept AgriFood Prod & Environm Sci, Ple Cascine 28, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Coppi, Andrea] Univ Firenze, Bot Labs, Dept Biol, Via G La,Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Garcia Nogales, Ana] Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Pollastrini, Martina] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale Santa Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy","Carrari, E (reprint author), CNR, Ist Prot Sostenibile Marge, Via Madonna del Piano 10, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",elisa.carrari@ipsp.cnr.it,"Pollastrini, Martina/Y-1046-2019; Coppi, Andrea/D-2886-2016; Carrari, Elisa/P-8468-2018","Pollastrini, Martina/0000-0003-0959-9489; Coppi, Andrea/0000-0003-4760-8403; Garcia-Nogales, Ana/0000-0002-6124-3415",Ministry of University and Scientific Research; University of Florence; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [614839 - PASTFORWARD],Authors wish to thanks Dilek Killi Haworth and Caterina Sandrini (University of Firenze) for their suggestions and help during measurements.

Given the proliferation of studies aimed at understanding the effects of climate and disturbance on forest ecosystems, it is important to understand the tradeoffs between field-based age estimates and precise dendrochronological techniques. We assessed the accuracy of age estimates from node counts in the field against precise tree-ring counts at the root-shoot boundary, in 1279 ponderosa pine and 1268 Douglas-fir seedlings sampled from across three study regions in the western U.S. We also assessed the accuracy of age estimates from bud-scar counts in the field against node counts and precise tree-ring counts in a subset of 757 seedlings from the Northern Rockies. Node counts systematically underestimated ring counts by an average of 4.1 years, with bias increasing with tree age. At annual, +/- 1-, +/- 2-, and +/- 5-yr precision, the accuracy of node counts was 5%, 15%, 29%, and 74% across all regions and species, respectively. Similar results were found for bud scars. Given the magnitude of the bias between field-based methods and ring counts, it is critical to select appropriate aging methods, based on the precision required to answer specific ecological questions. To improve the accuracy of field-based age estimates in these species, we provide a tool for correcting for the bias when precise dendrochronological aging is not feasible.","[Hankin, Lacey E.; Higuera, Philip E.; Davis, Kimberley T.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Dobrowski, Solomon Z.] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Higuera, PE (reprint author), Univ Montana, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",philip.higuera@umontana.edu,"Higuera, Philip Edward/B-1330-2010; Dobrowski, Solomon/Q-7132-2019; Davis, Kimberley/A-4797-2017","Higuera, Philip Edward/0000-0001-5396-9956; Dobrowski, Solomon/0000-0003-2561-3850; Davis, Kimberley/0000-0001-9727-374X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1461576]; Joint Fire Science Program [16-1-01-15],"We thank S.

The main reasons for this conversion were probably to increase productivity, including timber production, and enhance other ecosystem services, such as conservation of biodiversity and other nature values. This study was done by synthesizing results from studies carried out in Dutch mixed forests compared with monoculture stands and evaluating them in the perspective of the current theory. Then we explored possible mechanisms of higher productivity in mixed stands, in relation to the combination of species, stand age and soil fertility, and discussed possible consequences of forest management. The study covered five two-species mixtures and their corresponding monoculture stands from using long-term permanent forest plots over multiple decades as well as two inventories (around 2003 and 2013) across the entire Netherlands. These forest plot data were used together with empirical models at total stand level, species level and tree level. Overyielding in Douglas-fir-beech and pine-oak mixtures was maintained over time, probably owing to the intensive thinning and was achieved on the poorer soils. However, this overyielding was not always driven by fast-growing light-demanding species. On individual tree level, intra-specific competition was not necessarily stronger than inter-specific competition and this competitive reduction was less seen at lower soil fertility and dependent on species mixtures. Moreover, size-asymmetric competition for light was more associated with tree basal area growth than size-symmetric competition for soil resources. Overall, this study suggests a substantial potential of species mixing for increasing productivity and implies developing forest management strategies to convert monospecific forests to mixed-species forests that consider the complementarity in resource acquisition of tree species.","[Lu, Huicui; Mohren, Godefridus M.

They can be a significant component of soil organic matter, which effectively acts to bind mineral particles together, so improving soil structure. Although it is known that high temperatures and tillage both have a negative impact on GRSP, there is no study aimed at comparing and contrasting the effects of fire and enduring cultivation on GRSP content in contiguous areas undergoing the two forms of soil disturbance. We studied such a situation in Kurdistan, Iran, where the top 5 cm of soil was sampled in i) an unmanaged and unburned oak sparse forest, both inside and outside sprout clumps, ii) a vineyard, both under and outside the canopy, and iii) a burned portion of the forest in between. In the latter, the samples were collected from areas burned with high and moderate severity inside sprout clumps, and areas burned with low severity outside sprout clumps. All soil samples were air-dried and sieved to obtain four aggregate size fractions (8-2, 2-1, 1-0.25, and < 0.25 mm in diameter). Total organic carbon (TOC), easily extractable glomalin (EEG) and residual glomalin (RG) were determined in all fractions. Both TOC and GRSP were significantly lower in the cultivated soil than in the unburned forest. Fire did not change the content of TOC, although GRSP increased with increasing fire severity. The relative amount of small aggregates was higher in the burned and cultivated soils, likely because of the breakdown of macroaggregates by heating and tillage, respectively. TOC, EEG, and RG generally increased in concentration with decreasing aggregate size. The linear regression analysis revealed significant relations between GRSP and TOC in all studied treatments; however, the GRSP/TOC ratio was significantly higher in the soil burned with the highest severity and in the vineyard compared to the unburned soil: Overall, this study demonstrated that GRSP in soil is significantly affected by both severe fire and cultivation, and suggests that total amount of GRSP and GRSP distribution between the aggregate size fractions might be two reliable indicators of these types of perturbations of the soil environment.","[Sharifi, Zahed; Azadi, Nahid; Rahimi, Sharmin] Univ Kurdistan, Dept Soil Sci, Coll Agr, Pasdaran St, Sanandaj 6617715177, Iran; [Certini, Giacomo] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Prod Agroalimentari & Ambiente, Piazzale Cascine 28, I-50144 Florence, Italy","Sharifi, Z (reprint author), Univ Kurdistan, Dept Soil Sci, Coll Agr, Pasdaran St, Sanandaj 6617715177, Iran.",Z.Sharifi@uok.ac.ir,,,"University of Kurdistan, Iran","The authors acknowledge the University of Kurdistan, Iran, for funding this project.

However, it still remains unclear how changing soil and site-specific factors, associated with the changing depth of the permafrost table due to thawing, influence the spatial distribution and variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) stocks in high-latitude mineral soils. The relationships between the spatial variation of SOC and N stocks (0-30 cm) and active layer (AL) thickness, thickness of the organic layer (OL), soil acidity, Al and Fe hydroxides as well as plant- and microbial-derived C inputs were studied using ordinary statistics and geostatistics within six landscape patches (16 m(2) ) in the Siberian forest-tundra ecotone underlain by warm and discontinuous permafrost. At deeper permafrost table, SOC and N stocks (0-30 cm) were lower and, according to the semivariogram analysis, an overall homogenization of SOC and N distribution at the analyzed scale occurred. Total N and SOC stocks were spatially independent from root-derived organic matter distribution (i.e. the concentration of suberin-derived monomers) at shallow AL patches, whereas there was a significant positive spatial correlation within deep AL and non-permafrost soils. Hence, the development of root systems and an increase in rooting depth, leading to ""hot spots"" of SOM accumulation at intensively rooted soil patches, was observed as a result of deeper AL. Total N and SOC stocks within deeper AL and non-permafrost subsoils were also positively spatially correlated with the concentration of Fe and Al hydroxides, demonstrating the importance of organo-mineral associations for SOM stabilization in soils with lower permafrost table. This study confirmed that deepening of the AL in boreal forest ecosystems may lead to an overall homogenization of SOM distribution and simultaneous development of distinct mechanisms of SOM accumulation and stabilization.","[Evgrafova, Alevtina; de la Haye, Tilman Rene; Spielvogel, Sandra] Univ Bern, Soil Sci Grp, Geog Dept, Bern, Switzerland; [Evgrafova, Alevtina] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Integrated Nat Sci, Germany Geog Dept, Koblenz, Germany; [Haase, Ina; Shibistova, Olga; Guggenberger, Georg; Sauheitl, Leopold] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Soil Sci, Hannover, Germany; [Shibistova, Olga; Guggenberger, Georg] RAS, VN Sukachev Inst Forest, SB, Krasnoyarsk, Russia; [Tananaev, Nikita] Melnikov Permafrost Inst, Igarka Geocryol Lab, Yakutsk, Russia; [Spielvogel, Sandra] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Kiel, Germany","Evgrafova, A (reprint author), Univ Bern, Soil Sci Grp, Geog Dept, Bern, Switzerland.",alevtina.evgrafova@gmail.com; tilman.delahaye@giub.unibe.ch; haase@ifbk.uni-hannover.de; olgas@ifbk.uni-hannover.de; guggenberger@ifbk.uni-hannover.de; sauheitl@ifbk.uni-hannover.de; s.spielvogel@soils.uni-kiel.de,"Tananaev, Nikita/J-3471-2012; Evgrafova, Alevtina/B-1335-2017","Tananaev, Nikita/0000-0003-2997-0169; Evgrafova, Alevtina/0000-0003-0288-2978","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Sa2521/1-1, SP943/2-1]; Russian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Russian Federation [14.B25.31.0031]","Financial support was provided by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, Sa2521/1-1 and SP943/2-1).

Under increasing anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, some plant species will thrive while others will not. Previous work has shown that plant phylogeny can predict these responses, and that interactions with mycorrhizal fungi are a mechanism that drives variation in plant responses to N enrichment. Yet, much of this work has ignored the roles of other root-associated fungi and whole soil fungal communities in driving these responses. 2. We tested whether soil fungi mediate responses of plant growth and plant-soil feedbacks (between close and distant plant relatives) to N enrichment by implementing a greenhouse experiment in which we applied factorial treatments of N fertilization, host-specific soil inocula and fungicide to 15 eucalypt tree species that co-occur on the island state of Tasmania, Australia, and form two phylogenetic lineages within the subgenus Symphyomyrtus. 3. Conspecific-conditioned soil fungi enhanced growth responses to N enrichment for plants within one lineage (lineage 1) but depressed growth responses to N enrichment for plants within another lineage (lineage 2). Lineage-specific shifts in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization were consistent with previous evidence that more vs. less successful strategies under N enrichment are those where carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi is reduced vs. maintained, respectively. The latter was also accompanied by a stronger reduction in root colonization of non-filamentous fungi (of unknown function) under N enrichment. Plant-soil feedbacks were neutral for lineage 1 but negative for lineage 2 (i.e. greater growth in soils conditioned by opposite vs. same lineage individuals), but were not altered by N enrichment or fungicide. Lineage-level differences in root colonization suggest that these feedbacks could be driven by differential plant responsiveness to dark septate endophytes and non-filamentous fungi, the colonization of which seemed to benefit plant growth. 4. Synthesis: Our results confirm that interactions with soil fungi (ECM fungi, in particular) underlie phylogenetic patterns in tree species' growth responses to N enrichment and may, thus, influence which plants win or lose under future N deposition scenarios. Yet, we provide some of the first evidence (albeit from controlled rather than natural conditions) that N deposition may not play a strong role in shifting plant-soil feedbacks.","[Wooliver, Rachel C.; Bailey, Joseph K.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA; [Senior, John K.; Potts, Brad M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Potts, Brad M.] Univ Tasmania, ARC Training Ctr Forest Value, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Van Nuland, Michael E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Wooliver, RC (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA.",rwoolive@utk.edu,"Potts, Brad/C-6489-2013","Potts, Brad/0000-0001-6244-289X; Wooliver, Rachel/0000-0002-7723-437X",Office of International Science and Engineering [1514942],"Office of International Science and Engineering, Grant/Award Number: 1514942",,88,3,4,7,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Plant roots mediate the impacts of environmental change on ecosystems, yet knowledge of root responses to environmental change is limited because few experiments evaluate multiple environmental factors and their interactions. Inferences about root functions are also limited because root length dynamics are rarely measured. 2. Using a 5-year experiment in a mixed-grass prairie, we report the responses of root biomass, length and life span to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), warming, elevated CO2 and warming combined, and irrigation. Root biomass was quantified using soil cores and root length dynamics were assessed using minirhizotrons. By comparing root dynamics with published results for soil resources and above-ground productivity, we provide mechanistic insights into how climate change might impact grassland ecosystems. 3. In the upper soil layer, 0-15 cm depth, both irrigation and elevated CO2 alone increased total root length by twofold, but irrigation decreased root biomass and elevated CO2 had only small positive effects on root biomass. The large positive effects of irrigation and elevated CO2 alone on total root length were due to increases in both root length production and root life span. The increased total root length and life span under irrigation and elevated CO2 coincided with apparent shifts from water limitation of plant growth to nitrogen limitation. Warming alone had minimal effects on root biomass, length and life span in this shallow soil layer. Warming and elevated CO2 combined increased root biomass and total root length by c. 25%, but total root length in this treatment was lower than expected if the effects of CO2 and warming alone were additive. Treatment effects on total root length and root life span varied with soil depth and root diameter. 4. Synthesis. Sub-additive effects of CO2 and warming suggest studies of elevated CO2 alone might overestimate the future capacity of grassland root systems to acquire resources. In this mixed-grass prairie, elevated CO2 with warming stimulated total root length and root life span in deeper soils, likely enhancing plant access to more stable pools of growth-limiting resources, including water and phosphorus. Thus, these root responses help explain previous observations of higher, and more stable, above-ground productivity in these projected climate conditions.","[Mueller, Kevin E.] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [LeCain, Daniel R.; Carlson, Mary; Blumenthal, Dana M.] ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, USDA, Ft Collins, CO USA; [McCormack, M.

Henry (Changbai larch) is a productive commercial species and good candidate for afforestation in northeast China. It is widely planted in lead-stressed soils which can induce oxidative damage in this plant. Increasing tolerance to lead (Pb) stress is therefore of keen interest. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to identify the biomass, physiological responses and Pb accumulation of L. olgensis seedlings to Pb stress under succinic acid (SA) application and to explore the interaction of exogenous SA applications and stress resistance. L. olgensis seedlings were planted in Pb-stressed or unstressed haplic cambisols in pots. In Pb-contaminated soils the seedlings were treated daily with concentrations of SA solutions at a rate approximately equivalent to 0, 0.04, 0.2, 1.0, or 2.0 mmol kg(-1) of soil for 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Pb treatment induced damage in the seedlings and led to the inhibition of biomass accumulation in roots, stems and leaves, and a rise in Pb accumulation in fine roots and leaves. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage in leaves significantly increased while peroxidase (POD) activities, soluble protein and photosynthetic pigment contents in leaves were all reduced. Physiological toxicity was promoted with increasing Pb treatment times. When Pb-stressed seedlings were exposed to SA (especially 10.0 mmol L-1 over 20 days), the physiological responses for Pb-only were reversed and the biomass of roots, stems, and leaves dramatically increased. SA facilitated Pb uptake in fine roots and leaves but more Pb accumulated in fine roots. The results demonstrate that exogenous SA alleviates Pb-induced oxidative injuries and improves the tolerance of L. olgensis seedlings to Pb stress.","[Song, Jinfeng; Duan, Chengwei; Cui, Xiaoyang] Northest Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongguang] Northest Forestry Univ, Maoershan Forest Res Stn, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Cui, XY (reprint author), Northest Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",songnefu@126.com; c_xiaoyang@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370613]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017CA03],"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370613), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017CA03).",,50,1,1,1,12,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

The objectives of the study are to quantify the temporal variation of soil and aggregate-associated organic carbon (OC) and identify factors controlling the variation following natural vegetation restoration after farmland abandonment. We collected soils from sites having 5, 30, 60, 100, and 160 years of a natural vegetation restoration chronosequence after farmland abandonment in the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that natural vegetation restoration increased macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm; 46.6% to 73.9%), SOC (2.27 to 9.81 g kg(-1)), and aggregate OC (7.33 to 36.98 g kg(-1)) in the top 20-cm soil compared with abandoned farmland, and the increases mainly occurred in the early stage (<60 years). The increase of SOC was contributed by OC accumulated in macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm) rather than microaggregates (<= 0.25 mm). Moreover, SOC sequestration in the topsoil (0-10 cm) was mainly determined by fine root biomass (FR), labile organic carbon (LOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). And in the subsoil (10-20 cm), SOC sequestration was mainly determined by the proportion of macroaggregates. The results suggest that natural vegetation restoration increased SOC and aggregate OC, and FR, MBC, LOC, and the physical protection of aggregates played important roles in regulating SOC and aggregate OC.","[Deng, Lei; Shangguan, Zhouping] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lei; Shangguan, Zhouping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lei; Shangguan, Zhouping] Minist Water Resources, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Kim, Dong-Gill] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Shashemene, Ethiopia; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr CEF ESCER, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Shangguan, ZP (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",shangguan@ms.iswc.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41877538, 41771549]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0501605]; Special Support Plan of Young Talent Project; Promoting Plan to Creative Talents [2018KJXX-088]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41877538 and 41771549; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0501605; Funding of Special Support Plan of Young Talent Project, and Funding of Promoting Plan to Creative Talents, Grant/Award Number: 2018KJXX-088",,48,7,7,17,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

However, different stand types and stand ages, where afforestation is initiated, may have a different effect on soil carbon storage. Two stand types, including the apricot and poplar stand, both with 40 years, and two stand ages, including the apricot stand with 40 years and apricot stand with 16 years were sampled on the Loess Plateau, to explore the differences in soil carbon storage between both of them, respectively. The results showed that the total soil carbon storage up to the 1.0 m soil depth for the poplar stand was 79.07 Mg ha(-1), and for the apricot stand with 40 years was 88.36 Mg ha(-1), while for the apricot stand with 16 years, it was 56.16 Mg ha(-1). About 50% the soil carbon was stored in the 0-0.4 m soil layer for all these forested lands. This ascertains that the soil carbon was very sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Based on these results, if we are interested in combating global warming issue, the apricot trees can be a preferred option for future plantations. However, these plants are likely to consume more water than any other vegetation types. Since water is a limited resource both in arid and semi-arid regions, a tradeoff between soil carbon and soil water should also be considered in future afforestation policy options.","[Cao, Jianjun; Zhang, Xiaofang; Gong, Yifan] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Deo, Ravinesh; Feng, Qi] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm Engn Res Inst, Alashan Desert Ecohydrol Expt Res Stn, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Deo, Ravinesh] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, ICACS, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia","Feng, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm Engn Res Inst, Alashan Desert Ecohydrol Expt Res Stn, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",qifeng@lzb.ac.cn,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41461109]; Gansu Provincial Sci Tech [1506RJZA124]; Key Laboratory of Ecohydrology of Inland River Basin, Chinese Academy of Science [KLERB-ZS-16-01]","The authors thank to the reviewers and the editor for their comments that has helped improve this paper.

Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in water and nitrogen addition plots were more sensitive to drought stress than the control plots. The enhanced NEE drought sensitivity (S-NEE) in nitrogen fertilization habitat is associated with changes in aboveground biomass and root/shoot ratio, rather than variation in species diversity, while S-NEE in the unfertilized plots was controlled by root/shoot ratio. Compared to the water and nitrogen addition plots, the control plots had the highest percentage recovery of ecosystem carbon exchange (R-NEE) during the rehydration period. R-NEE is likely determined by aboveground biomass and level of damage in the photosynthetic organ.ConclusionThese findings suggest that long-term changes in precipitation regimes and nitrogen deposition may significant alter the susceptibility of key ecosystem processes to drought stress.","[Wang, Yunbo; Meng, Bo; Zhong, Shangzhi; Wang, Deli; Sun, Wei] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunbo] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianying] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China","Sun, W (reprint author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Ma, JY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",jyma@ms.xjb.ac.cn; sunwei@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150800]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570470, 41671207, 31660679]; 9th Thousand Talents Program of China (2013); Main Service Project of Characteristic Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences [TSS-2015-014-FW-5-1]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412018ZD010]","Qi Jiang helped with the field experiment.

We investigated the role of P. indica for phosphate (P) mobilization in soils enriched with different P sources and for P uptake into Brassicae napus (B. napus) plants.MethodsSeedlings of B. napus colonized by P. indica were cultivated in pots with sterilized-sands supplied with Ca-3 (PO4)(2) [Ca-3-P], AlPO4 [Al-P] or FePO4 [Fe-P]. The growth of the seedlings, P content, phosphatase activities, amount of organic acids, and expression of the genes BnACP5 for a phosphatase and BnPHt1;4 for a P transporter were investigated.ResultsPiriformospora indica promotes growth of B. napus and the accumulation of P in roots and shoots when P was supplied as Ca-3-P, Al-P or Fe-P in the soil. The endophyte stimulated the P availability for the plant by higher phosphatase activities and higher expression of BnACP5 in roots exposed to soil with Ca-3-P, Al-P or Fe-P as main P source. The amounts of oxalic, malic and citric acids increased in rhizosphere soil with P. indica colonized by B. napus seedlings. Thus, root-colonization by P. indica promotes the accumulation of organic acids in the rhizosphere. Stronger up-regulation of BnPht1;4 in colonized vs. non-colonized roots demonstrates the involvement of the fungus in counteracting P deficiency by promoting its uptake.ConclusionP. indica promotes the mobilization of P from inorganic sources and P uptake into the roots of B. napus. This is a combined effect of the stimulation of the P solubilizing phosphatase activity in the symbiotic interaction, the production of organic acids as well as the stimulation of the BnPht1;4 and BnACP5 genes under P limitation conditions.","[Wu, Meiyan; Wei, Qiao; Xu, Le; Li, Huizhi; Zhang, Wenying] Yangtze Univ, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Grain Ind, Hubei Key Lab Waterlogging Disaster & Agr Use Wet, Jinzhou 434025, Peoples R China; [Oelmueller, Ralf] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Gen Bot & Plant Physiol, Jena, Germany","Zhang, WY (reprint author), Yangtze Univ, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Grain Ind, Hubei Key Lab Waterlogging Disaster & Agr Use Wet, Jinzhou 434025, Peoples R China.; Oelmuller, R (reprint author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Gen Bot & Plant Physiol, Jena, Germany.",ralf.oelmueller@uni-jena.de; wyzhang@yangtzeu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Wenying/P-2509-2018","Zhang, Wenying/0000-0002-9926-4115",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31471496]; Open Fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Waterlogging Disaster and Agricultural Use of Wetland [KF201506];  [CRC 1127],This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31471496) and Open Fund of Hubei Key Laboratory of Waterlogging Disaster and Agricultural Use of Wetland (No. KF201506).

Here, we aimed to assess the generality of the SDH using both leaf and absorptive root traits and phylogenetic diversity at a large scale.MethodsWe examined the changes in the trait and phylogenetic diversity of six leaf and absorptive root traits along a soil fertility gradient from tropical to boreal forests. Trait and phylogenetic convergence and divergence were tested by the null model approach.ResultsLeaf economic traits (i.e. specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration) and root tissue density (RTD) exhibited a coordinated response to soil fertility gradient, shifting from convergence toward species with conservative leaf traits and low RTD under infertile condition to high trait divergence under fertile soil. Similarly, community phylogenetic structure varied from convergence to divergence along the soil fertility gradient. However, variation in other traits was not consistent with the SDH prediction.ConclusionsThe SDH depends on the trait's ecological role, and RTD is the most consistent root trait with leaf economic traits that reflect community assembly along soil fertility gradient. These results offer a new perspective for understanding complex integration of above- and belowground assembly processes, and emphasize the importance of incorporating belowground traits and phylogenetic information into community ecology.","[Wang, Ruili; Zhang, Shuoxin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiufeng; Liu, Congcong; Kou, Liang; Yu, Guirui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lab Remote Sensing & Geospatial Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhiwei] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China","Wang, RL (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangrl@nwafu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31700381]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0500202, 2017YFA0604803]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017 M623252, 2018 T111101]; Doctoral Start-up Fund of Northwest AF University [2452016138]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700381), the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFC0500202, 2017YFA0604803), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017 M623252, 2018 T111101), and the Doctoral Start-up Fund of Northwest A&F University (2452016138).

In southern China, the introduced fast-growing Sonneratia apetala and native Kandelia obovata have been widely afforested since the mid-1980s. While S. apetala has spread extensively, the implications and ecosystem services are yet to be ascertained.MethodsSoil/root coring was conducted in two 12-year-old S. apetala and K. obovata plantations, respectively. Fine-root mass and soil physicochemical properties were obtained and compared.ResultsFine-root mass and soil organic carbon stock ranged between 129 and 394gm(-2) and 7.9 and 15.8Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Soil organic carbon stock and fine-root mass were both significantly different between the forests. Organic carbon in soil is significantly correlated to fine-root mass and organic carbon in fine roots.ConclusionsThe contribution to soil organic carbon by fine-root mass may be different between the two species. Growth and physiological traits not only may influence stand characteristics but also soil properties that drive overall carbon accumulation. Contrary to the original expectation driving the introduction, the shrubby native K. obovata may have higher potential as a carbon sink than the introduced S. apetala.","[He, Ziying; Peng, Yisheng; Guan, Dongsheng; Chen, Yujuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Ziying; Peng, Yisheng; Guan, Dongsheng; Chen, Yujuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control &, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Inst Estuarine & Coastal Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Shing Yip] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Simon FS Li Marine Sci Lab, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Shing Yip] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Peng, YS; Guan, DS (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",pyish@mail.sysu.edu.cn; eesgds@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"; Lee, Shing Yip/B-9185-2008","Peng, Yisheng/0000-0002-8331-3429; Lee, Shing Yip/0000-0001-9336-2323","National Nature Science Foundation Grant of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371109, 41771095, 51609269]","This research was funded by a National Nature Science Foundation Grant of China (41371109, 41771095, 51609269).

While melanin and nitrogen content have been identified as factors that influence the decomposition rate of fungal necromass, the effects of mycelial morphology on necromass decomposition remain largely unknown. Using the fungus Armillaria mellea, which produces both diffuse and rhizomorphic biomass in pure culture, we assessed the effects of necromass morphology on decomposition in a 12 week field experiment in Pinus and Quercus dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Diffuse and rhizomorphic necromass was incubated for 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks to assess differences in decay rates and changes in residual necromass chemistry. Rhizomorphic necromass decomposed significantly slower than diffuse necromass in both forest types. This difference was correlated with initial necromass chemistry, particularly nitrogen content, but not with hydrophobicity. Over the course of the incubation, there was a greater change in the chemistry of diffuse versus rhizomorphic necromass, with both becoming more enriched in recalcitrant compounds. Given that many fungi with both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal ecologies produce rhizomorphs, these results suggest that mycelial morphology should be explicitly considered as an important functional trait influencing the rate of fungal necromass decomposition.","[Certano, Amanda K.; Fernandez, Christopher W.; Kennedy, Peter G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Heckman, Katherine A.] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, Houghton, MI USA; [Kennedy, Peter G.] Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN USA","Kennedy, PG (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kennedyp@umn.edu,,"Fernandez, Christopher/0000-0002-6310-6027",Norwegian Centennial Chairs Grant; NSF grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1554375],The authors thank E.

In the present study, we investigated morphological, physiological and transcriptome changes in Populus simonii Carr. root responding to long-term drought and low N stresses. Both stresses resulted in lower net photosynthetic rates, chlorophyll content and total dry weight. Transcriptome analysis of fine roots identified 4642 genes that were differentially expressed in response to drought and/or low N stresses. Most ammonium transporters had high transcript abundances in response to drought and/or low N stress; meanwhile the ratio of ammonium to nitrate concentrations was increased under drought condition. Data of N uptakes and metabolism further supported that fine roots under drought stress increased ammonium uptake, and the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway might play a key role in tolerating drought stress in poplar roots. The large-scale dataset in this study presents a global view of the critical pathways involved in drought and low N stress. When linked with physiology and metabolomics data, these results provide new insights into the modulation of N uptake, metabolism and storage, and events within the N-related pathways for transportation, assimilation and amino acid metabolism.","[Zhang, Chunxia; Zhao, Zhong] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chunxia; Meng, Sen] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Mingjun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Hort, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, CX (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Zhang, CX (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Li, MJ (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Hort, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",czhang2012@163.com; limingjun@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Li, Mingjun/0000-0001-5508-895X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500543]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2452016054],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 31500543) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant no. 2452016054).,,61,3,3,22,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,2018,38,11,,,,,1672,1684,,10.1093/treephys/tpy085,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,HD3XF,WOS:000452458300006,30099549,,,,10/31/19J,"Aboutaleb, S; Behnia, M; Bagherpour, R; Bluekian, B",,,,"Aboutaleb, Shekoufeh; Behnia, Mahmoud; Bagherpour, Raheb; Bluekian, Behzad",,,Using non-destructive tests for estimating uniaxial compressive strength and static Young's modulus of carbonate rocks via some modeling techniques,BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Uniaxial compressive strength; Static Young's modulus; Indirect methods; Dynamic elastic properties; Asmari formation; Support vector regression,DYNAMIC ELASTIC PROPERTIES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; P-WAVE; PREDICTION; VELOCITY; HARDNESS; INDEX,"Prediction of elastic mechanical properties such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and static Young's modulus (E-s) is one of the main purposes of studies in geological, geotechnical, geophysical, petroleum, and rock engineering projects. The UCS test is applied to determine them. However, this test is destructive, expensive, time-consuming, and requires high-quality samples. Therefore, using indirect methods seems to be indispensable for estimating dynamic elastic properties. Consequently, the main intention of this study was to predict the relationship between UCS and E-s with dynamic poisson ratio (?(d)) and dynamic Young's modulus (E-d), using simple and multivariate regression analysis (SRA and MRA), an artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), and to compare and evaluate these methods with each other. For this purpose, different intact limestone rock samples of Asmari formation (ranged from limestone to marl) were collected from five different dam sites located in the southwest of Iran. Following regression analysis, the best equations for estimating UCS and E-s of these samples with high and acceptable accuracy in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are suggested. These equations are simple, practical, and accurate enough to apply for prediction purposes at preliminary design stages. Although ANN and SVR models are both powerful techniques, the SVR run time is considerably faster. Besides, when cocmparing the three models used, the SVR model was found more desirable and advantageous.","[Aboutaleb, Shekoufeh; Behnia, Mahmoud; Bagherpour, Raheb] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Min Engn, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran; [Bluekian, Behzad] Islamic Azad Univ, Najafabad Branch, Dept Comp Engn, Esfahan, Iran","Aboutaleb, S (reprint author), Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Min Engn, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran.",Shekoufeh.aboutaleb@gmail.com; Behnia@cc.iut.ac.ir; Bagherpour@cc.iut.ac.ir; Behzad.bluekian@gmail.com,,,,,,68,5,5,2,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9529,1435-9537,,B ENG GEOL ENVIRON,Bull.

To test if and how interspecific plant competition modifies the PSFs observed in our previous monoculture experiment, five naturally-occurring plant species (Artemisia capillaris, Dodnrtia orientalis, Lespedeza davurica, Oxybropis racemosa, and Stipa bungeana) were grown in mixed communities in sterilized and unsterilized soils from plots of four grazing intensities (0, 2.7, 5.3, and 8.7 sheep/ha). Further, the five plant species were grown in mixtures in treatment-specific soil following inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and/or a mixture of pathogenic Fusarium species (FU), to test the contribution of these two fungal groups to biotic PSFs. All plant species experienced net neutral to positive abiotic and biotic PSFs. Compared with our previous monoculture experiment, we found that the presence of interspecific competition did not change the abiotic PSF effects generated with increasing grazing intensity, but shifted the direction and strength of the biotic PSFs generated within each grazing intensity. The presence of pathogenic Fusarium-only significantly decreased the proportional biomass of the dominant species A. capillaris and S. bungeana, and the presence of AM fungi-only significantly increased the proportional biomass of the subordinate species D. orientalis and O. racemosa. Our study strongly suggests that in grazed ecosystems interspecific competition and biotic PSFs interact to drive plant community dynamics, and also that soil mutualists such as AM fungi have the potential to promote plant species coexistence by facilitating the performance of subordinate species.","[Chen, Tao; Nan, Zhibiao; Duan, Tingyu; Wang, Jianfeng; Hou, Fujiang] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Song, Hui] Qingdao Agr Univ, Grassland Agrihusb Res Ctr, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China; [Li, Chenhui] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Nan, ZB (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, POB 61, Lanzhou 730020, Gansu, Peoples R China.",zhibiao@lzu.edu.cn,"; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015","Fujiang, Hou/0000-0002-5368-7147; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB138702]; National Public Welfare Industry of Agricultural Science and Technology Special Projects [201303057]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100368],"This research was financially supported by National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB138702), National Public Welfare Industry of Agricultural Science and Technology Special Projects (201303057) and the National Nature Science Foundation of China (31100368).",,72,1,1,13,84,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Previous investigations reported near-exclusive colonization of liverworts by the most recently evolved arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the Glomeraceae, indicating a recent acquisition from flowering plants at odds with the widely held notion that arbuscular mycorrhizal-like associations in liverworts represent the ancestral symbiotic condition in land plants. We performed an analysis of symbiotic fungi in 674 globally collected liverworts using molecular phylogenetics and electron microscopy. Here, we show every order of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonizes early-diverging liverworts, with non-Glomeraceae being at least 10 times more common than in flowering plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in liverworts and other ancient plant lineages (hornworts, lycopods, and ferns) were delimited into 58 taxa and 36 singletons, of which at least 43 are novel and specific to liverworts. The discovery that early plant lineages are colonized by early-diverging fungi supports the hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizas are an ancestral symbiosis for all land plants.","[Rimington, William R.; Bidartondo, Martin I.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Rimington, William R.; Pressel, Silvia; Duckett, Jeffrey G.] Nat Hist Museum, Life Sci Dept, Algae Fungi & Plants Div, London SW7 5BD, England; [Rimington, William R.; Bidartondo, Martin I.] Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; [Field, Katie J.] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Ctr Plant Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Read, David J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Rimington, WR (reprint author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 2AZ, England.; Rimington, WR (reprint author), Nat Hist Museum, Life Sci Dept, Algae Fungi & Plants Div, London SW7 5BD, England.; Rimington, WR (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England.",w.rimington@imperial.ac.uk,,"Field, Katie/0000-0002-5196-2360","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Doctoral Training Programme (Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet) studentship; NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N009665/1, NE/N00941X/1]; Royal Society research grantRoyal Society of London [RG150276]; Leverhulme Emeritus FellowshipLeverhulme Trust; Leverhulme Early Career FellowshipLeverhulme Trust","This work was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Doctoral Training Programme (Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet) studentship to W.R.R., a NERC standard grant to M.I.B.

Climate is often considered the major driver of local adaptation but, although biotic factors such as soil pathogens or mutualists could be as important, their role has typically been neglected. Biotic drivers might also interact with climate to affect performance and mycorrhizae, in particular, are likely to play a key role in determining drought resistance, which is important in the context of adaptation to future environmental change. To address these questions, we performed a fully reciprocal soil-plant transplant experiment using Fagus sylvatica seedlings and soils from three regions in Germany. To separate the biotic and abiotic effects of inoculation, half of the plants were inoculated with natural soil from the different origins, while the rest were grown on sterilized substrate. We also imposed a drought stress treatment to test for interactions between soil biota and climate. After 1 year of growth, we measured aboveground biomass of all seedlings, and quantified mycorrhizal colonization for a subset of the seedlings, which included all soil-plant combinations, to disentangle the effect of mycorrhiza from other agents. Results: We found that plant origin had the strongest effect on plant performance, but this interacted with soil origin. In general, trees showed a slight tendency to produce less aboveground biomass on local soils, suggesting soil antagonists could be causing trees to be maladapted to their local soils. Consistently, we found lower mycorrhizal colonization rate under local soil conditions. Across all soils, seedlings from low elevations produced more annual biomass than middle (+ 290%) and high (+ 97%) elevations. Interestingly, mycorrhizal colonization increased with drought in the two provenances that showed higher drought tolerance, which supports previous results showing that mycorrhizae can increase drought resistance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that soil communities play a role in affecting early performance of temperate trees, although this role may be smaller than that of seed origin. Also, other effects, such as the positive response to generalists or negative interactions with soil biota may be as important as the highly specialized mycorrhizal associations.","[Manzanedo, R.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial development and efficiency of water and nitrogen use by seedlings of four native and exotic species (Calophyllum brasiliense (native). Eucalyptus urograndis (exotic), Mona ciliata (exotic) and Mbebuia impetiginosa (native)) with age of approximately 120 days after sowing for 120 days after transplantation in green-house conditions. Destructive samples were carried out to assess the dry biomass (Leaf, Stern, Root and Total), leaf area, the root shoot ratio and total nitrogen in seedlings. Based on these variables, it was calculated the physiological parameters of growth and efficiency of water use, which was obtained by the ratio between the total dry biomass accumulation and evapotranspiration of vessels in the period, determined by daily weighing in a balance bench. At the end of 240 days after sowing, Calophyllum brasiliense and Tabebuia impetiginosa produced more total biomass and Toona ciliata showed higher root shoot ratio. There were no differences between the relative growth rate of the species evaluated. Eucalyptus urograndis, Toona ciliata and Calophyllum brasiliense showed the highest values of leaf area ratio, Toona ciliata, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Eucalyptus urograndis showed the highest values of specific leaf area, Eucalyptus urograndis and Calophyllum brasiliense show the highest values for leaf mass ratio and Tabebuia impetiginosa, Toona ciliata and Eucalyptus urograndis showed the highest values of net assimilation rate. Based on quantification of total nitrogen, Tabebuia impetiginosa and Toona ciliata were the most efficient species in the use of nitrogen.

However, little is known about the impacts of seasonal drought on the water use efficiency (WUE) and plant nitrogen (N) availability of dominant trees under field conditions. In this study, a field throughfall exclusion experiment simulating short-term drought (similar to 67% throughfall exclusion during the dry season from October to March) and prolonged drought (similar to 67% throughfall exclusion prolonging the dry season from October to May) was designed to understand the effects of seasonal drought on two dominant tree species (Michelia macclurei and Schima superba) in subtropical forest. The C and N content and isotopes in the deeper but not the surface soils in the forest were significantly affected by the seasonal drought. Neither the short-term nor the prolonged drought significantly altered delta C-13 values in the leaves and fine roots of the two species, but the short-term drought caused significant changes in delta N-15 values in the leaves and fine roots of S. superba. The WUE of the two dominant trees, indicated by the leaf delta C-13 values, was not significantly changed by the short-term and the prolonged drought. However, the N availability of S. superba, indicated by the delta N-15 values, was significantly altered by the seasonal short-term drought. Long-term influence of seasonal drought on the forest hydrological and N cycling and the potential shifts of species dominance induced by the changed N availability in subtropical forests should be assessed in the future research.

This study investigated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as one possible explanation for the outstanding ecological success of this exceptional palm. We explored the relationships between the babassu palm and native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and babassu effects on the AMF richness and mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) in the eastern periphery of Amazonia. For this purpose, we sampled topsoil (0-20 cm) at the onset of the rainy season from a 5-year-old secondary forest regrowth (SEC) area with three levels of babassu dominance (sites with 10, 50 and 70% babassu biomass shares), and at three distances (0, 2.5 and 4 m) from isolated babassu patches within a degraded pasture (PAS), both with five replications per treatment. Glomerospore density varied from 100 to 302 per gram of soil, 56% higher in SEC than PAS. We identified a total of 16 AMF species, with dominance of Acaulospora (six species) followed by Glomus (three species). AMF richness increased with babassu dominance in SEC sites, and reduced with distance from babassu patches within the PAS. The colonization rate of babassu roots was higher in SEC than in PAS, whereas MIP was similar in both areas and without treatment differences. Our study points to strong mycorrhizal association of the babassu palm as a potential mechanism for its outstanding ecological success in degraded lands.","[Nobre, Camila Pinheiro; Gehring, Christoph] Univ Estadual Maranhao UEMA, PPGA, Campus Paulo 6, BR-65055310 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [da Costa, Marlon Gomes] Inst Fed Maranhao IFMA, Campus Sao Raimundo das Mangabeiras,BR-230,Km-319, BR-65840000 Sao Raimundo Das Mangabe, MA, Brazil; [Goto, Bruno Tomio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte UFRN, DBEZ, Campus Univ Lagoa Nova, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil","Nobre, CP (reprint author), Univ Estadual Maranhao UEMA, PPGA, Campus Paulo 6, BR-65055310 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.",camilaenobre@yahoo.com.br,"Nobre, Camila/L-4252-2014","Nobre, Camila/0000-0001-8137-7456",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Universidade Estadual do Maranhao - UEMA,"To the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq for financial support, and to Universidade Estadual do Maranhao - UEMA for the scholarship of the first author.",,51,2,2,0,2,INST NACIONAL PESQUISAS AMAZONIA,MANAUS,"CAIXA POSTAL 478,  ALAMEDA COSME FERREIRA, 1756, MANAUS, AMAZONAS 00000, BRAZIL",0044-5967,1809-4392,,ACTA AMAZON,ACTA AMAZON.,OCT-DEC,2018,48,4,,,,,321,329,,10.1590/1809-4392201800092,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry; Zoology,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Zoology,GX5GV,WOS:000447773900007,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Malik, RJ",,,,"Malik, Rondy J.",,,Recent Trend: Is the Role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Plant-Enemies Performance Biased by Taxon Usage?,AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MEDICAGO-TRUNCATULA; BENEFICIAL MICROBES; INDUCED RESISTANCE; INSECT HERBIVORES; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; EXTERNAL HYPHAE; SOIL; COLONIZATION; PATHOGEN; ROOTS,"The potential for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to confer resistance and provide bioprotection against plant pests and pathogens is intriguing to biologists studying at many levels of biological organization, including the organismal, population, and community levels.

Yet, it remains unclear whether taxon usage in these studies arc biasing the results. Here I conducted a survey, while strictly focusing on the effect of AM-fungi, with respect to plant-enemies performance. I found 25% of case studies did not observe a reduction in performance. Interestingly, 75% of studies featured a single AM-fungal taxon, as opposed to multiple taxa. What is even more compelling, 72% of studies featured Rhizophagus irregularis and Funnelformis mosseae. These findings demonstrate a lack of AMfungal diversity in this area of research and a need for expansion in mycorrhizal taxon usage, to understand more fully the significance of mycorrhizal application in conferring bioprotection.","[Malik, Rondy J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Malik, RJ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rjm472@psu.edu,"Malik, Rondy/L-4252-2019","Malik, Rondy/0000-0003-0386-6347",,,,49,1,1,2,9,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The mycophagous woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) was once widespread across the Australian continent and currently exists in a greatly reduced range, while the omnivorous quenda (Isoodon fusciventer), which once occurred across the southern part of Western Australia (WA), remains common in south west WA over a reduced range. Populations of these two digging marsupials are currently maintained within sanctuaries where they can reach high densities. To assess the influence these digging marsupials have on fungal assemblages, we investigated fungal root associations among seedlings of a key mycorrhizal forest canopy species, Corymbia calophylla, R. Br. K. D. Hill and L. A. S. Johnson. Seedlings were grown in soil collected from inside (heavily-dug soil) and outside (minimally-dug soil) two predator-proof sanctuaries. Our results showed that above-ground seedling biomass was significantly greater for seedlings grown in soil collected from inside the sanctuaries. There were no differences in the diversity or species richness of rhizosphere fungal communities isolated from these seedlings; however, the community composition was significantly different. This was most obvious for the predator-proof enclosure that had been in place for 20 years (Karakamia Sanctuary) compared with the more recently-installed Perup Sanctuary (fenced in 2010; 4 years before this study). At Karakamia, there were greater numbers of putatively hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi inside the enclosure and four times the number of operational taxonomic units of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi outside the enclosure. The differences in fungal communities suggest that digging mammals play a pivotal role in ecosystem functioning by influencing the rhizosphere of this key forest canopy species, which has implications for maintaining the health and persistence of forests.","[Dundas, Shannon J.; Hopkins, Anna J.

Shrubs have great potential for green roofs because they have higher rates of water use, and many species are also drought tolerant. However, not all shrub species will be suitable and there may be a trade-off between water use and drought tolerance. We conducted a glasshouse experiment to determine the possible trade-offs between shrub water use for stormwater management and their response to drought conditions. We selected 20 shrubs from a wide range of climates of origin, represented by heat moisture index (HMI) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Under well-watered (WW) and water-deficit (WD) conditions, we assessed morphological responses to water availability; evapotranspiration rate (ET) and midday water potential (Psi(MD)) were used to evaluate species water use and drought response. In response to WD, all 20 shrubs adjusted their morphology and physiology. However, there were no species that simultaneously achieved high rates of water use (high ET) under WW and high drought tolerance (low Psi(MD)) under WD conditions. Although some species which had high water use under WW conditions could avoid drought stress (high Psi(MD)). Water use was strongly related to plant biomass, total leaf area, and leaf traits (specific leaf area [SLA] and leaf area ratio [LAR]). Conversely, drought response (Psi(MD)) was not related to morphological traits. Species' climate of origin was not related to drought response or water use. Drought-avoiding shrubs (high Psi(MD)) could optimize rainfall reduction on green roofs. Water use was related to biomass, leaf area, and leaf traits; thus, these traits could be used to assist the selection of shrubs for stormwater mitigation on green roofs. The natural distribution of species was not related to their water use or drought response, which suggests that shrubs from less arid climates may be suitable for use on green roofs. Selecting species based on traits and not climate of origin could both improve green roof performance and biodiversity outcomes by expanding the current plant palette.","[Du, Pengzhen; Arndt, Stefan K.; Farrell, Claire] Univ Melbourne, Dept Ecosyst & Forestry Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia","Farrell, C (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Ecosyst & Forestry Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia.",c.farrell@unimelb.edu.au,"Arndt, Stefan/G-5021-2013","Arndt, Stefan/0000-0001-7086-9375; Farrell, Claire/0000-0002-5822-7529",China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council,We thank Guiqing Xu and Xiang Zhang for assistance planting and harvesting plants and Chris Szota for assistance with the use of the pressure chamber during this experiment.

However, belowground C changes temporally due to forest growth and tree mortality (natural and via harvesting) and these fluctuations are critical for modeling C in forests under varying management regimes. To date, little progress has been made in quantifying the rate of decay of southern pines in general, and specifically in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) coarse root systems. Decomposition rates of lateral roots and tap roots of longleaf pine were quantified in situ under field conditions across the species' range to create a model for necromass loss. The roots of 37 longleaf pine stumps were excavated from Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The age of the trees when cut ranged from 14 to 260 years, and the time since cut ranged from 5 to 70 years. Remaining lateral roots to a 1 m depth plus the entire tap root were removed, dried, weighed and analyzed for C and nitrogen (N) content. Total dry necromass of harvested roots ranged from 8 to 195 kg tree(-1). Soil C and N content at 15 cm depth were significantly higher near the stump compared to half-way between and adjacent to the nearest living longleaf pine. A regression model was developed to predict necromass loss. The final model included years since cut, stump diameter, and average minimum monthly air temperature as predictors (R-2 = 0.83). For example, a 100 year-old tree would have a predicted root decomposition rate (k) of -0.120 for lateral roots and -0.038 per year for tap roots. Results suggest that longleaf pine coarse roots persist in the environment longer than the tap roots of loblolly pine.","[Anderson, Peter H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 3041 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 1577 Brevard Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 USA; [Butnor, John R.] Univ Vermont, USDA, US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn,Aiken Ctr, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, 280 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Samuelson, Lisa J.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, 3301 SFWS Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Anderson, PH (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 3041 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",phanderson@fs.fed.us; kjohnsen@fs.fed.us; jbutnor@fs.fed.us; carlos.gonzalez@oregonstate.edu; samuelj@auburn.edu,"Butnor, John/P-9738-2016","Butnor, John/0000-0003-0602-3898",US Department of Defense through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP)United States Department of Defense,"This research was supported wholly (or in part) by the US Department of Defense through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP).

It is thought that the effects of root rot on plant physiology vary depending on external stress factors. Plant growth and biomass allocation are useful tools to characterize differences in the response to drought and infection. The study of physiological responses together with growth patterns will clarify how and to what extent root rot is able to damage the plant. A fully factorial experiment, including drought and Phytophtora cinnamomi Rands infection as factors, was carried out with Quercus ilex L. seedlings. Photosynthesis, biomass allocation and root traits were assessed. Photosynthetic variables responded differently to drought and infection over time. The root mass fraction showed a significant reduction due to infection. P. cinnamomi root rot altered the growth patterns. Plants could not recover from the physiological effects of infection only when the root rot coincided with water stress. Without additional stressors, the strategy of our seedlings in the face of root rot was to reduce the biomass increment and reallocate resources. Underlying mechanisms involved in plant-pathogen interactions should be considered in the study of holm oak decline, beyond the consideration of water stress as the primary cause of tree mortality.","[Ruiz Gomez, Francisco J.; Sanchez-Cuesta, Rafael; Quero, Jose L.; Navarro Cerrillo, Rafael M.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Ingn Forestal, Lab Ecofisiol Sistemas Forestales ECSIFOR ERSAF, Campus Rabanales,Crta 4,Km 396, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Perez-de-Luque, Alejandro] Ctr Alameda Obispo, IFAPA, Area Genom & Biotecnol, Avda Menendez Pidal S-N,Apdo 3092, Cordoba 14080, Spain","Gomez, FJR (reprint author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Ingn Forestal, Lab Ecofisiol Sistemas Forestales ECSIFOR ERSAF, Campus Rabanales,Crta 4,Km 396, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",g72rugof@uco.es; alejandro.perez.luque@juntadeandalucia.es; rscuesta@uco.es; jose.quero@uco.es; rmnavarro@uco.es,"Gomez, Francisco Jose Ruiz/I-4823-2019; Perez-de-Luque, Alejandro/F-5970-2010; Perez, Jose Luis Quero/M-1074-2013","Gomez, Francisco Jose Ruiz/0000-0002-1999-3415; Perez-de-Luque, Alejandro/0000-0002-5609-0354; Perez, Jose Luis Quero/0000-0001-5553-506X","project QUERCUSAT - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity [CGL2013-40790-R]; Spanish Ministry of Education (FPU fellowship)German Research Foundation (DFG)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain [FPU13/00231]; project ESPECTRAMED - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity [CGL2017-86161-R]; project ENCINOMICA - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity [BIO2015-64737-R]","This study was conducted with support from the projects QUERCUSAT (CGL2013-40790-R), ESPECTRAMED (CGL2017-86161-R), and ENCINOMICA (BIO2015-64737-R), funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity.

In this study, we sought to determine the influence of nanoparticles of silver and copper (AgNPs and CuNPs) on growth parameters and spontaneous mycorrhizal colonisation of roots in 2-year-old container-grown seedlings of Scots pine. Foliar applications of nanoparticles were made through two growing seasons, four times a season, at concentrations of 0, 5, 25 and 50 ppm. Comparisons of the ultrastructures characterising the needles, stems and roots of the treated or untreated pines were conducted with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The deployed CuNPs stimulated mycorrhizal colonisation at all concentrations, although the growth of seedlings was only promoted at a concentration of 25 ppm. Higher concentrations of AgNPs (25 and 50 ppm) inhibited the formation of mycorrhizae, though the lowest concentration (5 ppm) produced an increase in both mycorrhizal colonisation and the dry mass of roots. The species of ectomycorrhizal fungi found were Thelephora terrestris, Suillus bovinus and Sphaerosporella brunnea. The TEM results comparing treated and control (untreated) needles revealed changes in the chloroplasts from lens-shaped to spherical. Furthermore, an increase in the number of plastoglobules and the presence of large osmophilic globules in the cytoplasm associated solely with the needles of pines receiving 50 ppm nanoparticles were observed. In contrast, ultrastructural changes in stems and roots associated with the applications of NPs were not found. Overall, the results indicated that CuNPs and AgNPs could be used as stimulators of growth in general, and mycorrhizal colonisation in particular, among container-grown Scots pines. However, further work is needed to determine their optimal doses and concentrations.","[Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, Marta; Szaniawski, Adam; Olchowik, Jacek] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Protect & Ecol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Studnicki, Marcin; Olchowik, Jacek] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Agr & Biol, Dept Expt Design & Bioinformat, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Bederska-Baszczyk, Magdalena; Olchowik, Jacek] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Agr & Biol, Dept Bot, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Urban, Alexander] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, M (reprint author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Protect & Ecol, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",marta_aleksandrowicz_trzcinska@sggw.pl,"Studnicki, Marcin/J-4927-2019","Studnicki, Marcin/0000-0001-9773-7313; Aleksandrowicz-Trzcinska, Marta/0000-0002-1397-4475; Olchowik, Jacek/0000-0001-5084-6758",Rector of Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) [505-10-030400-L00373-99],This work was supported by the Rector of Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) within the framework of research projects 505-10-030400-L00373-99.,,50,0,0,2,10,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,OCT,2018,11,,,,,,690,697,,10.3832/ifor2855-011,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,GY7LQ,WOS:000448792400003,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Freund, SM; Soper, FM; Poulson, SR; Selmants, PC; Sullivan, BW",,,,"Freund, Stephanie M.; Soper, Fiona M.; Poulson, Simon R.; Selmants, Paul C.; Sullivan, Benjamin W.",,,"Actinorhizal species influence plant and soil nitrogen status of semiarid shrub-dominated ecosystems in the western Great Basin, USA",JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ceanothus; Cercocarpus; Nitrogen fixation; Plant-soil feedbacks; Purshia,VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; CERCOCARPUS-LEDIFOLIUS ROSACEAE; SAGEBRUSH STEPPE ECOSYSTEMS; N-15 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; PURSHIA-TRIDENTATA; FIXING TREES; FIXATION; WOODLAND; FIRE; FERTILIZATION,"Actinorhizal plants form symbiotic root associations with dinitrogen (N-2) fixing Frankia and are abundant in North American cold deserts. However, the extent to which actinorhizal species are actively fixing N-2 or altering ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability remains unclear. We used the N-15 natural abundance technique to measure how three widespread actinorhizal species in the western Great Basin of western North America acquired N and influenced soil N cycling and the N status of the surrounding non-fixing plant community. We compared foliar and soil N concentrations and delta N-15 and soil biogeochemistry between reference plots and plots dominated by actinorhizal species. Actinorhizal species may be actively fixing N and influencing the N status of the surrounding ecosystem. Foliar delta N-15 of actinorhizal shrubs was significantly depleted compared to non-actinorhizal species. Non-actinorhizal plants in the presence of actinorhizal species showed depleted foliar delta N-15 and higher foliar N concentrations than in reference plots. Rates of N transformations in reference plots were similar to rates in actinorhizal plots; isotopic differences between plot types could not be explained by differences in N loss pathways. Actinorhizal species influence N cycling and availability in N-limited cold deserts, in a manner similar to leguminous plants in warm arid regions.","[Freund, Stephanie M.; Sullivan, Benjamin W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Soper, Fiona M.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Poulson, Simon R.] Univ Nevada, Dept Geol Sci & Engn, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Selmants, Paul C.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Sullivan, Benjamin W.] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Sullivan, BW (reprint author), 1664 N Virginia St,Mail Stop 186, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",bsullivan@cabnr.unr.edu,,"Selmants, Paul/0000-0001-6211-3957; Soper, Fiona/0000-0002-9910-9377",,,,51,0,0,2,20,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0140-1963,1095-922X,,J ARID ENVIRON,J.

This study aimed at quantifying the water uptake of plants depending on their distance from the sea and exploring plant responses to changing inundation regimes. We used stable isotope ratios (delta O-18) to determine the proportions of seawater and precipitation water used by three salt marsh species (Spartina anglica, Atriplex portulacoides and Elytrigia atherica) from a German North Sea coast salt marsh. Additionally, A. portulacoides was transplanted to experimental islands at three elevation levels to investigate its plasticity in water use in the course of future sea level rise. We found a marked gradient in plant seawater use from the lowermost pioneer zone (79-98% seawater uptake by S. anglica) to the lower marsh (61-95% by A. portulacoides) and the upper marsh (25-39% by E. atherica). Seasonal differences in water use were not pronounced, likely due to the absence of longer dry periods during summer in these temperate salt marshes. Contradicting our expectation, roots in deeper soil showed higher water uptake rates per fine root mass than topsoil roots suggesting effective root adaptation to the anoxic subsoil. Transplanted A. portulacoides plants significantly increased the uptake of seawater with increasing inundation indicating flexibility in the use of water sources by this species which may facilitate acclimation to rising sea levels. We conclude that the zonation of salt marsh vegetation reflects the availability of water sources along the inundation gradient.","[Redelstein, Regine; Coners, Heinz; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Gottingen, Germany; [Knohl, Alexander] Univ Goettingen, Bioclimatol, Gottingen, Germany; [Knohl, Alexander; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany","Redelstein, R (reprint author), Univ Goettingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Gottingen, Germany.",regine.redelstein@biologie.uni-goettingen.de,"Knohl, Alexander/F-9453-2014","Knohl, Alexander/0000-0002-7615-8870","Ministry for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony, Germany [ZN2930]","We like to thank the administration of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park for giving the permission for study and granting access to the field sampling sites.

In terrestrial ecosystems, plant roots have comprehensive roles in regulating litter-decomposer interactions, yet their potential influences on HFA remain unsolved. To fill this gap, we conducted a litter transplant experiment in a subtropical forest, and tested whether roots affect litter-field affinity via interactions with soil microbial functions. Leaf litters of Quercus variabilis and Pinus massoniana were incubated at their conspecific-dominated and heterospecific-dominated forests. Root-specific incubation microcosms were manipulated by using a series of root ingrowth cores to control the access of living fine roots. Entire exclusion of roots led to a significant suppression of HFA, and the affinity effect was amplified under a medium root constraint treatment (by 0.5 mm mesh). Incubation field ('home' vs. 'away') generally had a positive effect on litter mineralization when roots were present, and roots became more influential after 9 months than 3 months of incubation. Although microbial enzymatic functions and their impact on litter N loss depended on root status, they were not associated with incubation field.

Here, we added C-13-labeled fine roots to 15, 55, and 95 cm depths of a well characterized coniferous forest Alfisol and monitored the amount of root-derived C remaining over 6, 12, and 30 months. We recovered the root-derived C in microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) after 6 months and in coarse (> 2 mm) particulate, fine (< 2 mm) particulate, and dense, mineral-associated pools after 6, 12, and 30 months. Overall, root decomposition in the first 6 months was similar among all depths but significantly diverged at 30 months with faster decomposition at 15 cm than at 95 cm. There were more fungal and Gram negative-associated PLFAs at 15 cm than at 95 cm, and C-13 analysis revealed those microbial groups preferred the added root carbon to native SOC. Mineral-associations were not the cause of slower decomposition at depth because similar amounts of applied root C was recovered in the dense fraction at all depths. The largest difference among depths was in the amount of root C recovered in the coarse particulate fraction, which was greater at 95 cm (50%) than at 15 cm (15%). Slower decomposition of the particulate pool at depth likely contributed to the increase in C:N ratios and depletion of delta C-13 values below 60 cm depth in our soil profiles. Simulations of these soils using the CORPSE model, which incorporates microbial priming effects and mineral stabilization of SOC, reproduced patterns of particulate and mineral-associated SOC over both time and depth and suggested that a lack of priming by root exudates at depth could account for the slower decomposition rate of particulate root material. Decomposition of deep particulate SOC may increase if root exudation or dissolved OC transport to depth increases.","[Pries, Caitlin E.

We examined how vessel and sieve tube structure varied throughout the plant body of P. trichocarpa trees and whether xylem and phloem conduit structure was correlated across different positions within the plant. We excavated entire juvenile P. trichocarpa trees and measured vessel and sieve tube structural traits of current-year growth in 1 m increments along the main root:shoot axis. Trees were >4 m tall and had roots that extended 4-5 m at their longest length. We found that both sieve tube and vessel diameters greatly varied throughout the plant body and with organ diameter. Roots had wider diameter conduits than shoots. Sieve tube diameter was strongly correlated with vessel diameter, which may be related to their common developmental origin. Other structural traits, such as pit membrane area and pit density for xylem, and sieve plate area and number of sieve areas per plate for phloem, also varied and were correlated with changes in conduit diameter. The median air-seeding pressure of vessels (P-m) and vessel length did not differ between roots and shoots. Understanding plant vascular function will likely require increased knowledge of whole plant structure and function, since plant performance may be limited by any point along the transport pathway. Considering intra-organismal variation may be a way to evaluate structure-function hypotheses while controlling for confounding sources of variation that may impact inter-specific comparisons.","[Jacobsen, Anna L.; Valdovinos-Ayala, Jessica; Rodriguez-Zaccaro, F.

While plant phylogenetic relationships alone can predict this variation in some instances, trait conservatism across phylogenies may provide more reliable predictions. Using integrated common garden and glasshouse inoculation experiments including 13 Eucalyptus species across two subgenera, we specifically investigated soil microbial conditioning and root chemical traits as underlying drivers of phylogenetic differences in PSF. We found that eucalypt species responded variably to soils conditioned by closely related species, depending on their phylogenetic lineage, which was further related to root terpene concentrations and the presence/absence of specific fungal taxa in conditioned soils. Overall, these findings show that trait conservatism in root chemical traits and the subsequent conditioning of soil microbial communities can explain whether or not plants show phylogenetic patterns in PSF.","[Senior, John K.; Potts, Brad M.; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Senior, John K.] Sveriges Lantbruksuniv, Inst Vilt Fisk & Miljo, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Bissett, Andrew] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Wooliver, Rachel C.; Bailey, Joseph K.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Glen, Morag] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 54, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Senior, JK (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.; Senior, JK (reprint author), Sveriges Lantbruksuniv, Inst Vilt Fisk & Miljo, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",john.senior@slu.se,"O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/J-7275-2014; Potts, Brad M/C-6489-2013","O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/0000-0003-4801-4412; Potts, Brad M/0000-0001-6244-289X; Wooliver, Rachel/0000-0002-7723-437X",Australian Research Council Discovery GrantAustralian Research Council [DP120102889]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP120200380],"We thank Hugh Fitzgerald, Joanne McEvoy, Euan Rose, Alison Miller, Helen Stephens, and Shannon Troy for their various roles in the setup, measurement, and harvest of the experiment; Brian O'Meara for expert phylogenetic advice; and Michelle Lang for her expert advice in the glasshouse.

It is proactive to develop a new strategy to minimise the application of chemical methods and replace them with natural and biological fungal control options. This study compares the influence after one growing season in a bare-root forest nursery of (a) effective microorganisms (EM) consisting of mixed cultures of beneficial and naturally-occurring microorganisms, (b) the organic fertilizer Actifos (Act), and (c) the mineral fertilizer Busz Forte (BF) on the growth and mycorrhizal colonization of two common forest deciduous tree species: Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur. None of the analysed growth parameters (root collar diameter, length of shoots and roots, dry mass of shoots, and roots) of either tested tree species differed significantly among treatments. For both tree species, seedlings treated with EM exhibited partnerships with a smaller species richness of mycorrhizae than did seedlings in other treatments. Moreover, EM treatment significantly increased the abundance of non-vital root tips for both species. By contrast, BF exerted a negative effect on F. sylvatica non-vital mycorrhiza abundance. Based on morphological and molecular identification, a total of 11 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal taxa were detected in this study; three species (Peziza ostracoderma, Scleroderma areolatum and Cenococcum-like) were shared between both plant species. Across treatments, the most abundant ECM fungal species on F. sylvatica roots were Pezizaceae sp. (51.1%) and Hebeloma sp. (38.1%), while Peziza ostracoderma (26.8%), Naucoria salicis (24.1%), and Scleroderma areolatum (16.9%) were the most abundant taxa on Q. robur seedling roots. Our data indicate a negative effect of EM on ectomycorrhizal colonisation and on species richness of ECM fungi associated with F. sylvatica and Q. robur seedlings. None of the tested products had a negative effect on seedling growth, but seedlings treated with EM were characterised by a significant higher abundance of non-vital mycorrhizae.","[Bzdyk, Roman Mariusz; Oszako, Tomasz; Sikora, Katarzyna; Szmidla, Hanna] Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Protect, Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Poland; [Olchowik, Jacek; Hilszczanska, Dorota] Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Ecol, Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Poland; [Studnicki, Marcin] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Agr & Biol, Dept Expt Design & Bioinformat, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland","Olchowik, J (reprint author), Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Ecol, Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Poland.",romanbzdyk@gmail.com; olchowik.jacek@gmail.com; marcin_studnicki@sggw.pl; t.oszako@ibles.waw.pl; K.Sikora@ibles.waw.pl; H.Szmidla@ibles.waw.pl; D.Hilszczanska@ibles.waw.pl,"Olchowik, Jacek/K-9571-2019; Hilszczanska, Dorota/K-6715-2019; Studnicki, Marcin/J-4927-2019; Oszako, Tomasz/P-3955-2016","Olchowik, Jacek/0000-0001-5084-6758; Hilszczanska, Dorota/0000-0002-4363-704X; Studnicki, Marcin/0000-0001-9773-7313; Szmidla, Hanna/0000-0001-7205-0654; Oszako, Tomasz/0000-0003-4688-2582; Sikora, Katarzyna/0000-0002-3215-5934","State Forest Holding in Poland [BLP 367, OR-2717/21/11]; Forest Research Institute [260102]",This work was financed by the State Forest Holding in Poland through Project No. BLP 367 (contract number OR-2717/21/11) and Forest Research Institute (Project No. 260102).,,54,0,0,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2018,9,10,,,,,,,597,10.3390/f9100597,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,GY4RE,WOS:000448550700016,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Refsland, T; Fraterrigo, J",,,,"Refsland, Tyler; Fraterrigo, Jennifer",,,Fire increases drought vulnerability of Quercus alba juveniles by altering forest microclimate and nitrogen availability,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,drought; fire; microclimate; nitrogen; ontogeny; Quercus alba; resprouting; temperate deciduous forest,RESPROUTING CHAPARRAL SHRUBS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; WATER RELATIONS; ILEX RESPROUTS; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TREES; RESPONSES,"1. Shifts in rainfall patterns due to climate change are expected to increase drought stress and mortality in forests. Natural and anthropogenic fire regimes are also changing, highlighting the need to understand the interactive effects of fire and drought on tree ecophysiological response and growth. 2. Using rainout shelters, we imposed summer drought on natural and planted populations of Quercus alba juveniles located in periodically burned and unburned sites in Shawnee National Forest, IL, USA. A subset of planted juveniles was clipped to simulate topkill. We measured predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)), leaf gas exchange (A(max), g(max)) and relative growth rate (RGR) across treatments to test two hypotheses: (H1) Fire reduces juvenile drought stress by improving water relations through increased root-to-shoot ratios after topkill, or (H2) fire exacerbates juvenile drought stress by promoting a warmer, drier microclimate or amplifying drought-induced nitrogen (N) limitation. 3. Burned stands had higher vapour pressure deficits and 13% lower soil inorganic N availability than unburned stands. Rainout shelters reduced soil moisture (0-45cm) by 10%-24% relative to ambient conditions. Consistent with H2, small, natural resprouts in burned stands experienced greater drought stress than unburned juveniles, with a 7% decrease in leaf nitrogen content (LNC), a 21%-29% reduction in A(max) and g(max) and a 41% reduction in RGR under drought. Drought effects on unburned juveniles, in contrast, were limited to a 5% reduction in LNC and a neutral to positive effect on leaf gas exchange and RGR. Large natural juveniles were largely unaffected by drought. Recent resprouts (i.e., clipped, planted juveniles) experienced less drought stress than unclipped juveniles, providing partial support for H1. 4. Collectively, these results suggest that resprouting after fire can temporarily improve leaf water relations until root-to-shoot ratios re-equilibrate. In contrast, fire can exacerbate drought-driven declines in the growth of small juveniles by both promoting a warmer, drier microclimate and intensifying N limitation. Our results suggest that despite the high drought tolerance of Quercus spp., fire-driven changes to local microclimate and resource conditions could limit tree recruitment under future scenarios of rainfall variability.","[Refsland, Tyler; Fraterrigo, Jennifer] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Fraterrigo, Jennifer] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Refsland, T (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",refslan2@illinois.edu,,"Refsland, Tyler/0000-0002-7210-9174","Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) Graduate Innovation Award (GRIN) [14-3-01-16]; Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture; US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [ILLU 875-952]","Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) Graduate Innovation Award (GRIN), Grant/Award Number: 14-3-01-16; Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service; US Department of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: ILLU 875-952",,68,0,0,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Below-ground competition with grasses often plays a critical role during tree seedling establishment, but many underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We used a controlled field experiment to study how trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings compete with smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis L.) for space during the first 3 years of seedling establishment and how it affected aspen seedling development. Our study showed that competition with grasses had a limited impact on architectural plasticity of aspen seedlings. Seedlings faced with competition from smooth brome were overall smaller and most architectural parameters, with the exception of shoot height, appeared simply scaled down proportionally. Shoot height changed less than other parameters, because aspen competing with grass allocated relatively more carbon to shoots than roots and adopted a slender shoot morphology to quickly overtop the competition. Aspen growing with grass competition had significantly smaller root systems. Both lateral extent and maximum rooting depth were reduced by similar to 50%. In response to the restricted rooting space, roots of aspen seedlings faced with grass competition had a lower specific root length. Root carbohydrate reserves were not affected by competition; however, aspen roots growing with grass competition had higher soluble sugar concentrations which may be associated with the observed three times higher water uptake efficiency per unit root biomass. Our findings suggest that aspen seedlings have limited capacity for architectural plasticity in response to root competition, but are at least temporarily able to compensate for reduced root system size and rooting space, by optimizing water uptake efficiency.","[Bockstette, Simon W.; Pinno, Bradley D.; Landhausser, Simon M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Bockstette, SW (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",simon.bockstette@ualberta.ca; brad.pinno@canada.ca; simon.landhausser@ualberta.ca,,"Pinno, Brad/0000-0001-5680-3601; Bockstette, Simon/0000-0001-5373-8955",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Helmholtz-Alberta Initiative (HAI),"We thank the Genesee coal mine and George Greenhough (Capital Power) for providing field sites and Eckehart Marenholtz for his technical support in setting up the experiment.

However, the host genes encoding proteins associated with Nops remain unknown. We constructed a Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 Omega nopL mutant and analyzed the nodule number (NN) and nodule dry weight (NDW) of 10 germplasms inoculated with the mutant or wild-type strain. Using recombinant inbred lines (RILs), the conditional and unconditional quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with NopL were detected. The regions overlapping conditional and unconditional QTLs were identified. Additionally, the expression levels of selected candidate genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Depending on the germplasm, NopL positively or negatively affected NN and NDW. The NN and NDW of 'Charleston' and 'Dongnong 594' (RIL parents) were lower in samples inoculated with Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 Omega nopL than in samples inoculated with the wild-type strain. In soybean inoculated independently with Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 and HH103 Omega nopL, 11 and 5 unconditional QTLs were identified for NN and NDW, respectively, while five and two conditional QTLs were identified for NN and NDW, respectively. Two overlapping QTLs were identified among the conditional and unconditional QTLs. Furthermore, the enzymes encoded by Glyma.13g170500 and Glyma.07g099700 likely interacted with NopL. The Glyma.13g170500 and Glyma.07g099700 detected at QTLs represent candidate genes that encode enzymes that interact with NopL to regulate the establishment of symbiotic relationships between rhizobia and soybean.","[Zhang, Yanjiao; Liu, Xueying; Chen, Lin; Fu, Ying; Li, Changyu; Qi, Zhaoming; Zou, Jianan; Zhu, Rongsheng; Li, Shuping; Wei, Wei; Wang, Jinhui; Chang, Huilin; Shi, Yan; Wang, Jieqi; Li, Qingying; Zhu, Jingyi; Li, Jianyi; Jiang, Hongwei; Wu, Xiaoxia; Jia, Cunguang; Yin, Zhengong; Hu, Zhenbang; Liu, Chunyan; Chen, Qingshan; Xin, Dawei] Northeast Agr Univ, Chinese Minist Educ, Key Lab Soybean Biol & Breeding Genet,Chinese Agr, Key Lab Soybean Biol,Coll Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Fu, Ying] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Fu, Ying] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Plant Biol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Genet & Dev, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chang, Huilin; Yin, Zhengong] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Suihua Branch, Suihua, Peoples R China; [Chang, Huilin; Yin, Zhengong] Heilongjiang Acad Agr Sci, Crop Breeding Inst, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Liu, CY; Chen, QS; Xin, DW (reprint author), Northeast Agr Univ, Chinese Minist Educ, Key Lab Soybean Biol & Breeding Genet,Chinese Agr, Key Lab Soybean Biol,Coll Sci, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",cyliucn@126.com; qshchen@126.com; dwxin@neau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400074, 31471516, 31271747, 30971809]; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province [ZD201213]; Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Science Foundation [LBH-Q16014]; Harbin Science Technology Project [2013RFQXJ005, 2014RFXXJ012]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China Project [2017YFE0111000]; National Key R & D Program of China [2016YFD0100500, 2016YFD0100300, 2016YFD0100201-21]; Foundation for University Key Teachers from the Education Department of Heilongjiang Province in China [1254G011]; University Project of Young Scientist [UNPYSCT-2015011]","Financial support was received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers: 31400074, 31471516, 31271747, and 30971809), the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (Grant number: ZD201213), the Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number: LBH-Q16014), the Harbin Science Technology Project (Grant numbers: 2013RFQXJ005 and 2014RFXXJ012), the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China Project (Grant number: 2017YFE0111000), the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant numbers: 2016YFD0100500, 2016YFD0100300, and 2016YFD0100201-21), and the Foundation for University Key Teachers from the Education Department of Heilongjiang Province in China (Grant number: 1254G011).

This process can decrease the plant diversity, contributing to loss of endemic microorganisms and natural enemies leading to the replacement of native biota by non-native and generalist species. Thereby, we hypothesized that this conversion changes fungal composition, reduce fungal alpha diversity and community dissimilarity and increase the incidence of potential phytopathogenic genera at pasture soils compared to forest. Soil of 10 sampling points from forest and 10 from pasture were collected at the Mutum-Parana River basin. Via ITS amplicon sequencing of the total soil DNA, differences in composition and in the taxonomic diversity between the two environments were addressed. The phylum Ascomycota predominated in both forest and pasture. Basidiomycota presented lower percent in both, but was higher in pastures. Zygomycota and Glomeromycota presented opposite tendencies, the first being predominately present in forest and the second only present in pasture with low incidence. The fungal diversity was higher in pasture soils, contrasting our hypothesis. There were also significant correlations between soil physicochemical properties and fungal community. The reduction of the dissimilarity in pasture was confirmed and this signalized for a biotic homogenization. In addition, higher incidence of potential phytopathogenic fungi was observed in pasture. These results contribute to a better understanding of how fungal communities are driven by forest-to-pasture conversion.","[Cerqueira, A. E. S.; Silva, T. H.; Veloso, T. G. R.; Kasuya, M. C.

The decomposition of plant biomass has been extensively studied. It revealed that extrinsic biomass properties that restrict its access to decomposers influence decomposition more than intrinsic ones that arc only related to its chemical structure. Fungal biomass has been much less investigated, even though it contributes to a large extent to soil organic matter, and is characterized by specific biochemical properties. In this study, we investigated the extent to which decomposition of heath land fungal biomass was affected by its hydrophobicity (extrinsic property) and melanin content (intrinsic property). We hypothesized that, as for plant biomass, hydrophobicity would have a greater impact on decomposition than melanin content. Mineralization was determined as the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) into CO2 by headspace GC/MS after inoculation by a heathland soil microbial community. Results show that decomposition was not affected by hydrophobicity, but was negatively correlated with melanin content. We argue that it may indicate that either melanin content is both an intrinsic and extrinsic property, or that some soil decomposers evolved the ability to use surfactants to access to hydrophobic biomass. In the latter case, biomass hydrophobicity should not be considered as a crucial extrinsic factor. We also explored the ecology of decomposition, melanin content, and hydrophobicity, among heathland soil fungal guilds. Ascomycete black yeasts had the highest melanin content, and hyaline Basidiomycete yeasts the lowest. Hydrophobicity was an all-or-nothing trait, with most isolates being hydrophobic.","[Lenaers, Mathias; Reyns, Wouter; Vangronsveld, Jaco; Rineau, Francois] Hasselt Univ, Res Grp Environm Biol, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Reyns, Wouter; De Laender, Frederik] Univ Namur, Res Unit Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Namur, Belgium; [Czech, Jan; Carleer, Robert] Hasselt Univ, Res Grp Appl & Analyt Chem, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Basak, Indranil; Deferme, Wim] Hasselt Univ, Inst Mat Res IMO IMOMEC, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Krupinska, Patrycja; Yildiz, Talha; Saro, Sherilyn; Remans, Tony] PXL, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium","Rineau, F (reprint author), Hasselt Univ, Res Grp Environm Biol, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",francois.rineau@uhasselt.be,"deferme, wim/K-3946-2019; De Laender, Frederik/D-2783-2014","De Laender, Frederik/0000-0002-4060-973X; Vangronsveld, Jaco/0000-0003-4423-8363",BOF (Special Research Fund) from Hasselt University; METHUZALEM [08M03VGRJ],"The authors are thankful to the BOF (Special Research Fund) from Hasselt University for financing their research, as well as METHUZALEM provided to Jaco Vangronsveld under grant number 08M03VGRJ.",,29,2,2,3,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

This study investigates the tree flora, substrate, and colonization-development factors on poorly-maintained buildings in Hong Kong. Field surveys gleaned data on species composition, microhabitat, shoot-root dimensions, and biomass structure. The survey sampled 567 trees. They belonged to ten species, distinguished as strong stranglers, moderate stranglers and non-stranglers. Strong stranglers, such as the native Ficus microcarpa and F. virens, were dominant, with diaspores dispersed mainly by frugivorous birds tapping cultivated and ruderal trees. Most trees had limited crown spread and height, and the larger ones were strong stranglers. The compact tree form, reflecting growth constraints, limited their landscape-scenic contributions. Most surface roots displayed restricted lateral growth contrasted by more vertical extension. Five microhabitats were identified. Two mainly vertical ones accommodated 42.3% of the trees, including wall vertical surface holding the most, and pipe surface. Three mainly horizontal microhabitats, more conducive to seed lodging and tree establishment, held 57.7%, including awning & ledge, roof top & edge taking the second largest share, and window sill & canopy. The stranglers scaled more vertical sites, whereas non-stranglers more horizontal. Root-shoot and root-biomass ratios reflected microhabitat controls. The findings were discussed vis-a-vis pre-adaptation of stranglers to vertical-habitat existence, enabling and restrictive microhabitat traits, plaster degradation as critical pre-condition, leap-frog succession and species paucity, analogy with rocky cliff habitat, and application to building-tree management.","[Jim, C.

While current literature provides evidence for an N2O emission reduction effect due to reduced fertiliser input, little is known about the effect of increased legume proportions potentially offsetting these reductions, i.e. by increased N2O emissions from plant residues and root exudates. In order to assess the overall effect of this mitigation strategy on permanent grassland, we performed an in situ experiment and quantified net N2O fluxes and biomass yields in two differently managed grass-clover mixtures. We measured N2O fluxes in an unfertilised parcel with high clover proportions vs. an organically fertilised control parcel with low clover proportions using the eddy covariance (EC) technique over 2 years. Furthermore, we related the measured N2O fluxes to management and environmental drivers. To assess the effect of the mitigation strategy, we measured biomass yields and quantified biologically fixed nitrogen using the 15N natural abundance method. The amount of BFN was similar in both parcels in 2015 (control: 55 +/- 5kgNha(-1)yr(-1); clover parcel: 72 +/- 5 kg Nha-1 yr(-1)) due to similar clover proportions (control: 15% and clover parcel: 21%), whereas in 2016 BFN was substantially higher in the clover parcel compared to the much lower control (control: 14 +/- 2 kg Nha(-1) yr(-1) with 4% clover in DM; clover parcel: 130 +/- 8 kg Nha(-1 )yr(-1) and 44% clover). The mitigation management effectively reduced N2O emissions by 54% and 39% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, corresponding to 1.0 and 1.6 tha(-1 )yr(-1) CO2 equivalents. These reductions in N2O emissions can be attributed to the absence of fertilisation on the clover parcel. Differences in clover proportions during periods with no recent management showed no measurable effect on N2O emissions, indicating that the decomposition of plant residues and rhizodeposition did not compensate for the effect of fertiliser reduction on N2O emissions. Annual biomass yields were similar under mitigation management, resulting in a reduction of N2O emission intensities from 0.42g N2O-N kg(-1)DM (control) to 0.28g N2O-N kg(-1)DM (clover parcel) over the 2-year observation period. We conclude that N2O emissions from fertilised grasslands can be effectively reduced without losses in yield by increasing the clover proportion and reducing fertilisation.","[Fuchs, Kathrin; Hortnagl, Lukas; Buchmann, Nina; Eugster, Werner; Merbold, Lutz] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Snow, Val] AgRes Lincoln Res Ctr, Private Bag 4749, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Merbold, Lutz] ILRI, Mazingira Ctr, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Fuchs, K (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",kafuchs@ethz.ch,"Snow, Val/S-2106-2019; Merbold, Lutz/K-6103-2012; Hortnagl, Lukas/P-6800-2017; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011","Snow, Val/0000-0002-6911-8184; Merbold, Lutz/0000-0003-4974-170X; Hortnagl, Lukas/0000-0002-5569-0761; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [40FA40_154245]; New Zealand government,"This study was carried out within the framework of FACCE-JPI in the Models4Pastures project with the Swiss contribution funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF; contract number 40FA40_154245) and the New Zealand contribution funded by the New Zealand government to support the objectives of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance for Agricultural Greenhouse Gases - Integrative Research Group (http://globalresearchalliance.org/research/integrative, last access: 5 September 2018).

In sand-filled percolated columns we tested how and to what degree chemoeffectors influenced bacterial transport and thereby promoted accessibility and degradation of distantly located C-14-naphthalene (NAH) at the centimeter scale. Sunflower root exudates and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used as chemoeffectors to stimulate opposing effects of motility and tactic swimming of NAH-degrading Pseudomonas putida G7. Sunflower exudates prompted smooth bacterial movement and positive taxis, while AgNPs induced tortuous movement and repellent responses. Compared to chemoeffector-free controls exudates reduced deposition and stimulated bacterial transport during percolation experiments. AgNPs, however, provoked bacterial deposition and concomitant saturation of the collector surfaces (filter blocking) that led to progressively increased percolation of cells. Despite mechanistic differences, both motility patterns supported bacterial transport and promoted mineralization rates of NAH desorbing from a source placed at the column outlet. Observed mineralization rates in the presence of the chemoeffectors were 5-fold higher than those in their absence and similar to NAH-mineralization in well-stirred batch assays. Our results indicate that chemically mediated, small-scale bacterial motility patterns may become relevant for long-distance bacterial transport and the biodegradation of patchy contaminants at higher scales, respectively.","[Jimenez-Sanchez, Celia; Ortega-Calvo, Jose-Julio] CSIC, IRNAS, Ave Reina Mercedes 10, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Wick, Lukas Y.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permosertr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Ortega-Calvo, JJ (reprint author), CSIC, IRNAS, Ave Reina Mercedes 10, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",jjortega@irnase.csic.es,"Ortega-Calvo, Jose-Julio/A-2240-2015","Ortega-Calvo, Jose-Julio/0000-0003-1672-5199","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [CGL2013-44554-R, CGL2016-77497-R]; Andalusian Government [RNM 2337]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [LIFE15 ENV/IT/000396]","We thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness (CGL2013-44554-R and CGL2016-77497-R), the Andalusian Government (RNM 2337) and the European Commission (LIFE15 ENV/IT/000396).

In the southeastern United States, we established a factorial throughfall reduction (D) x fertilization (F) experiment in 2012 in four loblolly pine (Paws taeda L.) plantations encompassing the climatic range of the species in Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), Oklahoma (OK), and Virginia (VA). Net primary productivity (NPP) was estimated from tree inventories for four consecutive years, and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) as NPP minus heterotrophic respiration (R-H). Soil respiration (R-S) was measured biweekly-monthly for at least one year at each site and simultaneous measurements of R-S & R-H were taken five to eight times through the year for at least one year during the experiment. Reducing throughfall by 30% decreased available soil water at the surface and for the 0-90 cm soil profile. Fertilization increased NPP at all sites and D decreased NPP (to a lesser extent) at the GA and OK sites. The F + D treatment did not affect NPP. Mean annual NPP under F ranged from 10.01 +/- 0.21 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) at VA (mean +/- SE) to 17.20 +/- 0.50 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) at FL, while the lowest levels were under the D treatment, ranging from 8.63 +/- 0.21 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) at VA to 14.97 +/- 0.50 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) at FL. R-S and R-H were, in general, decreased by F and D with differential responses among sites, leading to NEP increases under F. Throughfall reduction increased NEP at FL and VA due to a negative effect on R-H and no effect on NPP. Mean annual NEP ranged from 1.63 +/- 0.59 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) in the control at OK to 8.18 +/- 0.82 MgC center dot ha(-1).yr(-1) under F + D at GA. These results suggest that fertilization will increase NEP under a wide range of climatic conditions including reduced precipitation, but either NPP or R-H could be the primary driver because F can increase stand growth, as well as suppress R-S and R-H. Moreover, D and F never significantly interacted for an annual C flux, potentially simplifying estimates of how fertilization and drought will affect C cycling in these ecosystems.","[Bracho, Rosvel; Vogel, Jason G.; Jokela, Eric J.; Gezan, Salvador A.; Cucinella, Joshua; Martin, Timothy A.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Will, Rodney E.; Meek, Cassandra R.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Noormets, Asko] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Samuelson, Lisa J.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36840 USA; [Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Markewitz, Daniel; Teskey, Robert O.; Kane, Michael B.; Yang, Jinyan] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Seiler, John R.; Strahm, Brian D.; Fox, Thomas R.; Laviner, Marshall A.; McElligot, Kristin M.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Lin, Wen] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, 2820 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Akers, Madison K.] Dougherty & Dougherty Forestry Serv Inc, Wake Forest, NC 27588 USA","Bracho, R (reprint author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rbracho@ufl.edu,"Noormets, Asko/P-1197-2019","Noormets, Asko/0000-0003-2221-2111","Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation project (PINEMAP), a Coordinated Agricultural Project - USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68002-30185]","This research was funded by The Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation project (PINEMAP), a Coordinated Agricultural Project funded by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Award #2011-68002-30185.

Here, we analyzed water budgets of pine forests worldwide. We first estimated local water balance of forests dominated by two wide-ranging species: Pinus taeda (36 degrees N) and Pinus sylvestris (64 degrees N). In these stands, growing season evapotranspiration (ET) was largely insensitive to inter-annual variation of precipitation (P), consistent with the insensitivity of canopy transpiration to P. Extending the analyses to include published data from 117 studies on 27 pine species, we found that pine forests annually use -66% +/- 17% (SD) of P as ET, regardless of climatic regime, leaving a third of P as runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems and users. However, during the growing season, pine forests used more water as ET than P in regions where P 5 326 39 (SE) mm. Forests in regions of low growing season P exist in their current state only where the rooting depth is sufficient to supply trees with water from soil storage in addition to P, and these forests are likely to support only ephemeral streams that dry down during the growing season. Thus, globally, water use by pine forests is adapted to mean annual P, but shows a limited capacity to respond to inter-annual variability in P. Forests with a small buffer of growing season water availability (P + soil water storage - E-T), are likely to be most sensitive to variation in P regimes, changing canopy leaf area, tree density, and species composition depending on the degree, direction and persistence of the change in P.","[Tor-ngern, Pantana] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Tor-ngern, Pantana; Oren, Ram; Palmroth, Sari] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Tor-ngern, Pantana; Palmroth, Sari; Ottosson-Lofvenius, Mikaell; Nasholm, Torgny] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Oren, Ram] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Novick, Kimberly] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Oishi, Andrew] USDA Forest Serv Coweeta Hydrol Lab, Otto, NC 28763 USA; [Linder, Sune] Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SLU, POB 49, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Tor-ngern, P (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",Pantana.T@chula.ac.th,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Oishi, Andrew/0000-0001-5064-4080","Kempe Foundation; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [2015.0047]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Science Foundation (VR)Swedish Research Council; ""Future Forests"" (Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental -MISTRA); ""Trees and Crops for the Future"" (Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems - VINNOVA); ""Nitrogen and Carbon in Forests"" (FORMAS); United States Department of Agriculture through the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative [2011-67003-30222]; Department of Energy through the Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Science program [DE-SC0006967, DE-0006700]; Royal Thai government; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Erkko Visiting Professor Programme of the Jane and Aatos Erkko 375th Anniversary Fund, through the University of Helsinki; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2016VBA036]","We appreciate the field assistantship from Nils Henriksson and Ulla Nylander in the Scots pine forest in Rosinedal, Sweden.

However, the effectiveness of such biological conservation measures has not been investigated for the Ethiopian highlands. This study investigates the reinforcement that plant roots may provide to strengthen gully banks in Ethiopia. The root systems of 26 indigenous and exotic plant species of 3 plant life forms (grasses, shrubs, and trees) were sampled, and root tensile strength and distribution were determined. The RipRoot model was used to quantify the additional cohesion derived from the plant roots. Among all tested roots, Eleusine floccifolia (grass), Tephrosia vogelii (tree), and Rosa abyssinica (shrub) had the strongest roots for each life form. The root volumetric ratio (root volume divided by soil volume) in the top 0.6 m of soil ranged from 0.03% to 0.46%. Roots of Digitaria abyssinica provided the maximum added cohesion (10.6 kPa) over this depth. For a given plant species, root volumetric ratio had a greater effect on additional cohesion than root tensile strength. Plant species with a fibrous root system provided greater additional cohesion values in the top 0.6m (on average 3.4 vs. 1.7 kPa for tap root systems) and could potentially enhance gully bank stability for shallow gullies more than plants having a tap root system. To effectively rehabilitate larger gullies, plants should be integrated with other gully rehabilitation measures, such as regrading of gully banks and structural measures such as check dams to trap sediments, thereby reducing the effective gully bank height relative to rooting depth.","[Zegeye, Assefa D.; Steenhuis, Tammo S.] Cornell Univ, Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY USA; [Zegeye, Assefa D.] Amhara Reg Agr Res Inst, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Langendoen, Eddy J.] ARS, USDA, Natl Sedimentat Lab, Oxford, MS 38655 USA; [Tilahun, Seifu A.; Steenhuis, Tammo S.] Bahir Dar Univ, Fac Civil & Water Resources Engn, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Mekuria, Wolde] IWMI, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Poesen, Jean] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","Langendoen, EJ (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Natl Sedimentat Lab, Oxford, MS 38655 USA.",eddy.langendoen@ars.usda.gov,,,"Norman E.

Borrowing the well-established framework developed by psychologists, we propose that plant behaviors can be constructively modeled by identifying four distinct components: (1) a cue or stimulus that provides information, (2) a judgment whereby the plant perceives and processes this informative cue, (3) a decision whereby the plant chooses among several options based on their relative costs and benefits, and (4) action. Judgment for plants can be determined empirically by monitoring signaling associated with electrical, calcium, or hormonal fluxes. Decision-making can be evaluated empirically by monitoring gene expression or differential allocation of resources. We provide examples of the utility of this judgment and decision-making framework by considering cases in which plants either successfully or unsuccessfully induced resistance against attacking herbivores. Separating judgment from decision-making suggests new analytical paradigms (i.e., Bayesian methods for judgment and economic utility models for decision-making). Following this framework, we propose an experimental approach to plant behavior that explicitly manipulates the stimuli provided to plants, uses plants that vary in sensory abilities, and examines how environmental context affects plant responses. The concepts and approaches that follow from the judgment and decision-making framework can shape how we study and understand plant-herbivore interactions, biological invasions, plant responses to climate change, and the susceptibility of plants to evolutionary traps.","[Karban, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53704 USA","Karban, R (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rkarban@ucdavis.edu,,,USDA regional research grants,"We thank Mikaela Huntzinger, Ian Pearse, Jay Rosenheim, and Rob Fletcher for comments that improved the manuscript and Gary Felton, Kelli Hoover, Dawn Luthe and Junji Takabayashi for helpful discussions.

However, the long-term recovery of forest carbon (C) storage following wildfire remains unclear, especially during late succession. Uncertainty surrounding C storage in old forests largely stems from both a lack of repeated measurements in forest stands older than the longevity of the pioneer cohort and a lack of consideration of multiple succession pathways. In this study, we constructed a replicated chronosequence, which covered a wide range of forest stand age classes (up to 210years old) following fire in the boreal forest of central Canada. We selected stands of different overstorey types (that is, broadleaf, conifer, or mixedwood) and age classes to account for multiple succession pathways known to occur in our study area. Our results show a strong relationship between total ecosystem C storage and stand age following fire. Broadleaf stands had on average higher total ecosystem C; however, the inferred temporal dynamics of total ecosystem C were similar among all three overstorey types. Importantly, we found that total ecosystem C storage declined from canopy transition to late-succession stages, irrespective of succession pathway, contradicting views that old forests continually accumulate C as they age. Our findings emphasize that further study of stands older than the longevity of the pioneer cohort is critical to better understand the contribution of old forests to the global C cycle.","[Gao, Bilei; Searle, Eric B.; Kumar, Praveen; Ma, Zilong; Hume, Alexandra M.; Chen, Han Y.

With long-term ecological and economic impacts in mind, it is critical to quantify the negative effects of this disease on tree and forest health in order to make informed management decisions. We measured litterfall to determine the timing and magnitude of WPND-induced defoliation across four study sites in the northeastern US between 2014-2016. We measured N concentrations of needles cast throughout the 2014 growing season to estimate total litter N flux resulting from WPND. Additionally, to quantify growth declines we measured annual basal area increment (BAI) from six symptomatic study sites in the infected region. We found that WPND-induced defoliation in the months of June and July accounted for 47% of the total annual litterfall across the study sites, often exceeding normal needle senescence in October. Foliar %N in June and July was 0.78 and 0.84% respectively, significantly higher than October concentrations of 0.40%, suggesting incomplete resorption of N during the summer months. Untimely summer defoliations resulted in a mean estimated N loss of 0.92 g N m(-2) yr(-1), representing 63% of the total growing season N input from foliage. Growth of symptomatic trees at all sites was reduced following outbreaks of WPND initiating between 2007-2009. Severely infected trees reduced BAI 25-73% compared to pre-outbreak years. Our results show that WPND-induced defoliation significantly alters litterfall and N dynamics of affected stands, and suggest that subsequent N limitation in addition to reduced foliar area greatly reduces annual wood growth within infected stands.","[McIntire, Cameron D.; Asbjornsen, Heidi] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Munck, Isabel A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, State & Private Forestry, 271 Mast Rd, Durham, NH USA; [Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.; Asbjornsen, Heidi] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Livingston, William H.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME USA","McIntire, CD (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, 114 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",cameron.d.mcintire@gmail.com,"; Munck, Isabel/R-8693-2016","Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708; McIntire, Cameron/0000-0001-9666-5805; Munck, Isabel/0000-0001-6889-9196",USDA Forest Health Protection NA grant [15DG-11420004-150]; New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station,"This research was funded by USDA Forest Health Protection NA grant 15DG-11420004-150 and the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station.

Here, we examined the dynamics of soil organic carbon, water-stable macroaggregates, litterfall production, fine-root ((sic) < 1 mm) biomass, and soil microbial biomass carbon with stand development in poplar plantations (Populus deltoides L.'35') in Eastern Coastal China, using an age sequence (i.e., five, nine, and 16 years since plantation establishment). We found that the quantity of water-stable macroaggregates and organic carbon content in topsoil (0-10 cm depth) increased significantly with stand age. With increasing stand age, annual aboveground litterfall production did not differ, while fine-root biomass sampled in June, August, and October increased. Further, microbial biomass carbon in the soil increased in June but decreased when sampled in October. Ridge regression analysis revealed that the weighted percentage of small (0.25 mm <= (sic) < 2 mm) increased with soil microbial biomass carbon, while that of large aggregates ((sic) >= 2 mm) increased with fine-root biomass as well as microbial biomass carbon. Our results reveal that soil microbial biomass carbon plays a critical role in the formation of both small and large aggregates, while fine roots enhance the formation of large aggregates.","[Ge, Zhiwei; Zhu, Rongwei; Peng, Sili; Ruan, Honghua] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fang, Shuiyuan] Tongzi Cty Forestry Bur Guizhou, Tongzi 563200, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

Subalpine areas of the Eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have experienced different forest re-establishment methods after clear-cutting primary forest. However, little is known about fine root dynamics of these forests originating from artificial, natural and their combined processes. Here, we determined fine root traits (biomass, production and turnover rate) of three subalpine forest types, i.e., Picea asperata Mast. plantation forest (artificial planting, PF), natural secondary forest (natural without assisted regeneration, NF) and P. asperata broadleaved mixed forest (natural regeneration after artificial planting, MF) composed of planted P. asperata and naturally regenerated native broadleaved species. At the soil depth of 0-30 cm, fine root biomass was the highest in PF and fine root production was the highest in NF, and both were the lowest in MF. Fine root dynamics of the three forest types tended to decrease with soil depth, with larger variations in PF. Fine root biomass and production were the highest in PF in 0-10 cm soil layer but were not significantly different among forest types in the lower soil layers. There were positive correlations between these parameters and aboveground biomass across forest types in soil layer of 0-10 cm, but not in the lower soil layers. Fine root turnover rate was generally higher in mixed forests than in monocultures at all soil depths. In conclusion, the natural regeneration procedure after clear-cutting in the subalpine region of western Sichuan seems to be superior from the perspective of fine root dynamics.","[Liu, Shun; Luo, Da; Yang, Hongguo; Shi, Zuomin] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm Sci, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zuomin] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zuomin] Natl Res Council Italy, Tree & Timber Inst, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy; [Liu, Qianli; Zhang, Li; Kang, Ying] Aba Prefecture Inst Forestry Sci & Technol, Wenchuan 623000, Peoples R China","Shi, ZM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm Sci, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.; Shi, ZM (reprint author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Shi, ZM (reprint author), Natl Res Council Italy, Tree & Timber Inst, Via Madonna Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy.",liushun89@163.com; luoda2010@163.com; yanghg@caf.ac.cn; shizm@caf.ac.cn; abzlqn68@126.com; zhangli7107@163.com; kangyingabf@163.com,,"Liu, Shun/0000-0003-2636-4219","Fundamental Research Funds of CAF [CAFYBB2014MA004, CAFYBB2018ZA003]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0502104-02]","This study was financially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds of CAF (CAFYBB2014MA004, CAFYBB2018ZA003) and the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0502104-02).",,88,0,0,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2018,9,9,,,,,,,517,10.3390/f9090517,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,GY2UC,WOS:000448398100013,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Zhao, B; Geng, Y; Cao, J; Yang, L; Zhao, XH",,,,"Zhao, Bo; Geng, Yan; Cao, Jing; Yang, Lu; Zhao, Xiuhai",,,Contrasting Responses of Soil Respiration Components in Response to Five-Year Nitrogen Addition in a Pinus tabulaeformis Forest in Northern China,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil respiration; nitrogen addition; Pinus tabulaeformis; microbial biomass carbon; root respiration; root trenching; soil enzyme activity,MICROBIAL BIOMASS; HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; EXTRACTION METHOD; TEMPERATURE; DEPOSITION; BACTERIAL; FUNGAL; LITTER; GROWTH,"Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has profound effects on carbon (C) cycling in forest ecosystems. As an important part of belowground C dynamics, soil respiration is potentially affected by changing N availability. However, the responses of total soil respiration (RST) and its three components, soil respiration derived from plant roots (RSR), root-free soil (RSS) and the litter layer (RSL), to such N enrichment remains poorly understood. To assess the effects of N enrichment on soil respiration components, three levels of N addition, namely low (LN, 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), medium (MN, 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and high (HN, 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), were conducted over five growing seasons from 2011 to 2015 in a temperate Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) forest in northern China. A control plot without N addition (CK) was also established. The five-year mean annual rate of RST was 2.18 +/- 0.43 mol m(-2) s(-1), and the contributions of RSR, RSS and RSL were 8.8 +/- 3.1%, 82.2 +/- 4.5% and 9.0 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Compared with CK, RST was significantly increased by 16.5% in the HN plots, but not in the LN or MN treatments. RSS was significantly decreased by 18.1%, 26.6% and 18.4% in the LN, MN and HN plots, respectively, due to the reduction of both microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme activity. In contrast, RSR was increased by more than twice under the MN treatment, which promoted root growth and activity (higher fine root biomass and N concentration). A significant elevation in RSL was only detected in the HN plots, where the increased litter input enhanced litter decomposition and hence RSL. Our findings clearly demonstrated that N addition of different intensities had different effects on soil components. In particular, the above- and belowground components of heterotrophic respiration, RSL and RSR, showed contrasting responses to high level addition of N. Thus, we highlight that the response of soil respiration components to N addition should be examined individually. Our results may contribute to a better understanding of soil respiration dynamics under future N scenarios, and have important implications in forest management.","[Zhao, Bo; Geng, Yan; Cao, Jing; Yang, Lu; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn State Forestry & G, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Zhao, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn State Forestry & G, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",job0824@163.com; gengyan@bjfu.edu.cn; caojingsmart@163.com; yanglu0108@163.com; zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,,,Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC050400101],This study was financially supported by the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFC050400101).,,54,0,0,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2018,9,9,,,,,,,544,10.3390/f9090544,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,GY2UC,WOS:000448398100040,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Tsunoda, T; Grosser, K; van Dam, NM",,,,"Tsunoda, Tomonori; Grosser, Katharina; van Dam, Nicole M.",,,Locally and systemically induced glucosinolates follow optimal defence allocation theory upon root herbivory,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,plant-insect interactions; plant-soil (below-ground) interactions; root defence; systemic-induced plant responses; white grubs,INDUCED RESPONSES; PLANT DEFENSE; INDUCED RESISTANCE; INSECT HERBIVORY; ARABIDOPSIS; TOLERANCE; PATTERNS; COSTS; PERFORMANCE; METABOLITES,"1. Herbivore-induced defences in plants are considered a strategy to manage multiple interactions while saving resources. The optimal defence theory (ODT) is one of the most prominent theoretical frameworks to explain the defence allocation patterns within plants. It was recently shown that the ODT generally applies to constitutive glucosinolate (GSL) allocation in shoot and root organs. Previous studies showed that both root and shoot herbivore feeding may alter defence allocation over plant organs. For shoots, the effect depends on where the herbivores feed. It is as yet unknown whether similar principles apply to root-herbivore-induced GSLs. 2. To analyse the effects of root localized herbivore feeding on GSL allocation, we conducted a pot experiment using Anomala cuprea grubs and four Brassicaceae; Brassica rapa, B.nigra, B.oleracea and Sinapis alba. Individuals of these four plant species were grown in dedicated mesocosms. The grubs were confined either to the bottom soil, the middle section or the topsoil. Plants grown in the same set-ups but without root herbivores served as controls. Glucosinolate levels of the leaf lamina, petiole and stem as well as of the taproot, lateral roots and fine roots were measured after 8 days of herbivory. 3. Plant biomass reduction due to herbivory was the largest when herbivores were confined to the topsoil. In the three Brassica species, taproot GSL levels increased upon herbivory independent of where the root herbivores were feeding. Glucosinolate levels in fine roots and shoots, on the other hand, hardly responded to root herbivory. Indole GSLs, which are more effective to pathogens than to herbivores, were more strongly induced than aliphatic and aromatic GSLs, especially in the taproots. Sinapis alba did not show remarkable increments in any GSL level upon herbivory. 4. These results show that locally and systemically induced defences in roots are consistent with the ODT: The taproot which is the most vulnerable and valuable to plant performance shows the highest increase in defence induction. The induced GSL profiles suggest that the response may not only target herbivores, but may also help to prevent secondary infection by microbial pathogens.","[Tsunoda, Tomonori; Grosser, Katharina; van Dam, Nicole M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Tsunoda, Tomonori] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan; [Grosser, Katharina; van Dam, Nicole M.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany","Tsunoda, T (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",tomonori.tsunoda@idiv.de,,,"Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FZT 118]; Fujiwara Natural History Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [546]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FZT 118; Fujiwara Natural History Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Overseas Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: 546",,82,0,0,19,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Here, we investigate the influence of recent environmental changes on the growth and physiology of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees, a key indicator species of forest health, spanning three locations along a 100km transect in the Central Appalachian Mountains. We incorporated a multiproxy approach using 75-year tree ring chronologies of basal tree growth, carbon isotope discrimination (C-13, a proxy for leaf gas exchange), and N-15 (a proxy for ecosystem N status) to examine tree and ecosystem level responses to environmental change. Results reveal the two most important factors driving increased tree growth since ca. 1989 are reductions in acidic sulfur pollution and increases in atmospheric CO2, while reductions in pollutant emissions of NOx and warmer springs played smaller, but significant roles. Tree ring C-13 signatures increased significantly since 1989, concurrently with significant declines in tree ring N-15 signatures. These isotope chronologies provide strong evidence that simultaneous changes in C and N cycling, including greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of trees and increases in ecosystem N retention, were related to recent increases in red spruce tree growth and are consequential to ecosystem recovery from acidic pollution. Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of the red spruce trees increased by similar to 51% across the 75-year chronology, and was driven by changes in atmospheric CO2 and acid pollution, but iWUE was not linked to recent increases in tree growth. This study documents the complex environmental interactions that have contributed to the recovery of red spruce forest ecosystems from pervasive acidic air pollution beginning in 1989, about 15years after acidic pollutants started to decline in the United States.","[Mathias, Justin M.; Thomas, Richard B.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Mathias, JM (reprint author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",jmathia6@mix.wvu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1354689],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1354689",,108,5,5,11,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

They are proposed to promote organic matter accumulation by suppressing saprotrophs, but have also been suggested to play an active role in decomposition themselves. Here we show that exclusion of tree roots and associated ectomycorrhizal fungi in a boreal forest increased decomposition of surface litter by 11% by alleviating nitrogen limitation of saprotrophs-a ""Gadgil effect"". At the same time, root exclusion decreased Mn-peroxidase activity in the deeper mor layer by 91%. Our results show that ectomycorrhizal fungi may hamper short-term litter decomposition, but also support a crucial role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in driving long-term organic matter oxidation. These observations stress the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in regulation of below-ground organic matter accumulation. By different mechanisms they may either hamper or stimulate decomposition, depending upon stage of decomposition and location in the soil profile.","[Sterkenburg, Erica; Clemmensen, Karina E.; Finlay, Roger D.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Box 7026, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ekblad, Alf] Orebro Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, SE-70185 Orebro, Sweden; [Lindahl, Bjorn D.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Box 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Lindahl, BD (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Box 7014, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",Bjorn.Lindahl@slu.se,"; Clemmensen, Karina/C-9555-2014","Lindahl, Bjorn/0000-0002-3384-4547; Clemmensen, Karina/0000-0002-9627-6428","Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [2007-1365, 2011-1747]","The work behind this manuscript was supported by The Swedish Research Council FORMAS, grants 2007-1365 and 2011-1747 to BDL.

The quest for understanding the maintenance of species diversity has matured in recent decades under the umbrella of species coexistence theory, founded by Chesson (2000). The central conclusion of the theory is that coexistence at local scales depends on two opposing forces: average fitness differences between species, which drive the best-adapted species to exclude others, and stabilizing mechanisms, which promote diversity via niche differentiation. 2. Recent theoretical work has focussed on how interactions between plants and other organisms influence the equalizing and stabilizing forces. However, there is a lack of empirical information. Therefore, the next fundamental step is to assess the prevalence of these mechanisms for controlling plant coexistence across a wide range of interactions and systems. 3. To that end, this special feature presents 10 theoretical, observational, or manipulative studies illustrating 9 different biotic interactions including mutualisms (pollinators, seed dispersers, soil microbes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and antagonisms (leaf and seed herbivores, and leaf and root pathogens). All studies share a common question: how biotic interactions regulate plant coexistence? 4. Comparisons across studies suggest that biotic interactions modify both stabilizing and average fitness differences. In those cases where biotic interactions promote stable coexistence between plant species, both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act more frequently as an equalizing rather than as a stabilizing mechanisms. 5. Besides these generalities, the studies of this special issue also present novel theoretical and empirical approaches to better understand the maintenance of species diversity over a wide variety of systems, environmental conditions, and organisms. 6. Synthesis. The studies presented here constitutes a solid base to empirically explore how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act upon the determinants of plant species competition, and open novel paths for future research. Collectively, these advances will serve to pave the road for a better theoretical and empirical understanding of how biotic interactions control biodiversity.","[Bartomeus, Ignasi] CSIC, EBD, Av Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Godoy, Oscar] CSIC, IRNAS, Seville, Spain","Bartomeus, I (reprint author), CSIC, EBD, Av Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain.",nacho.bartomeus@gmail.com,"Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; Bartomeus, Ignasi/0000-0001-7893-4389",Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Ministry of Economy & Competitiveness [LINCX CGL2014-61590-EXP]; H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [661118-BioFUNC],"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: LINCX CGL2014-61590-EXP; H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, Grant/Award Number: 661118-BioFUNC",,50,0,0,12,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

While there are numerous reviews of molecular methods and bioinformatic steps, there has been little consideration of the methods used to collect samples upon which these later steps are based. This represents a critical knowledge gap, as methodologically sound field sampling is the foundation for subsequent analyses. We reviewed field sampling methods used for metabarcoding studies of both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem biodiversity over a nearly three-year period (n=75). We found that 95% (n=71) of these studies used subjective sampling methods and inappropriate field methods and/or failed to provide critical methodological information. It would be possible for researchers to replicate only 5% of the metabarcoding studies in our sample, a poorer level of reproducibility than for ecological studies in general. Our findings suggest greater attention to field sampling methods, and reporting is necessary in eDNA-based studies of biodiversity to ensure robust outcomes and future reproducibility. Methods must be fully and accurately reported, and protocols developed that minimize subjectivity. Standardization of sampling protocols would be one way to help to improve reproducibility and have additional benefits in allowing compilation and comparison of data from across studies.","[Dickie, Ian A.; Makiola, Andreas] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.; Gardner, Paul P.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Boyer, Stephane] Univ Tours, UMR CNRS 7261, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, Tours, France; [Boyer, Stephane] Unitec Inst Technol, Environm & Anim Sci, Appl Mol Solut Res Grp, Auckland, New Zealand; [Buckley, Hannah L.] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Duncan, Richard P.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT, Australia; [Hogg, Ian D.] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Hogg, Ian D.] Polar Knowledge Canada, CHARS Campus, Cambridge Bay, NU, Canada; [Holdaway, Robert J.] Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Lear, Gavin] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Morales, Sergio E.] Univ Otago, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Powell, Jeff R.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Weaver, Louise] Inst Environm Sci & Res Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Dickie, IA (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",Ian.dickie@canterbury.ac.nz,"Gardner, Paul P./B-1978-2009; Morales, Sergio/O-5680-2019; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013; Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010; Boyer, Stephane/H-8624-2013","Gardner, Paul P./0000-0002-7808-1213; Morales, Sergio/0000-0002-5862-0726; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452; Hogg, Ian D./0000-0002-6685-0089; Boyer, Stephane/0000-0002-0750-4864","Biological Heritage National Science Challenge, New Zealand; BioProtection Research Centre; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","Biological Heritage National Science Challenge, New Zealand; BioProtection Research Centre; Australian Research Council; Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment",,59,10,10,16,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-098X,1755-0998,,MOL ECOL RESOUR,Mol.

Scientific experts forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation in the Argentine Patagonian Cordillera. Knowledge of the variation of adaptive traits at the seedling stage is crucial to prediction the adaptability of forest tree species. We aim to analyze genetic variation in root and shoot quantitative traits among and within natural populations of two key North Patagonian forest species, in order to evaluate their ability to deal with CC through adaptation. We established two common garden nursery trials: (1) 81 open pollinated families of Nothofagus obliqua from eight natural populations, and (2) 74 families of Nothofagus alpina from seven populations. At the end of the first growing season we measured shoot height, diameter, root length and root and stem dry biomass; we also estimated foliage biomass. In addition the root to stem ratio, specific root length and the root to shoot ratio were calculated. For both species intra-population variation was generally low, and average differentiation was moderate, with high levels of differentiation in some traits related to drought stress, indicating low adaptation capacity but also adaptation to current stressful conditions, which means it may be possible for some populations to survive CC without changing their genetic structures. Further studies are needed, including phenotypic plasticity assays, to complete the picture.","[Duboscq-Carra, Virginia G.; Pastorino, Mario J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Duboscq-Carra, Virginia G.; Letourneau, Federico J.; Pastorino, Mario J.] EEA Bariloche, INTA, CC 277, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Duboscq-Carra, VG (reprint author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Duboscq-Carra, VG (reprint author), EEA Bariloche, INTA, CC 277, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",duboscq.virginia@inta.gob.ar,,,project PROMEF-Subprograma Nothofagus [BIRF 7520 AR]; project Domesticacion de especies forestales nativas patagonicas [INTA PNFOR-44321]; project Variacion genetica de poblaciones naturales argentinas de Rauli y Roble Pellin en caracteres adaptativos tempranos relevantes para domesticacion; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [112-200801-02867],"We would like to thank Priscila M.

The ability to take advantage of novel mutualists or survive and reproduce despite a lack of mutualists may facilitate invasion by those individuals with such traits. Here, we used two greenhouse studies to examine how soil microbial communities in general and mutualistic rhizobia in particular affect the performance of a legume species (Medicago polymorpha) that has invaded five continents. We performed two plant growth experiments with Medicago polymorpha, inoculating them with soil slurries in one experiment or rhizobial cultures in another experiment. For both experiments, we compared the growth of Medicago in competition with conspecific or heterospecific plants and examined variation among plant genotypes collected from the native and introduced ranges. We found that all genotypes experienced similar increases in biomass and formed more nodules that house rhizobia bacteria when inoculated with soil from a previously invaded site, compared to uninoculated plants or plants inoculated with soil from uninvaded and low invasion sites. In a second experiment, plants inoculated with rhizobia generally produced more biomass, had greater tolerance to interspecific competition, and had greater effects on competitor biomass than uninoculated plants. However, plant genotypes collected from the native range benefited more from rhizobia and were less tolerant of competition relative to genotypes collected from the introduced range. In the introduced range, compatible mutualists may not be readily available but competition is intense, causing Medicago to evolve to benefit less from interactions with rhizobia mutualists, while simultaneously becoming more tolerant of competition.","[terHorst, Casey P.; Wirth, Camdilla] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 East Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 East Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","terhorst, CP (reprint author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",casey.terhorst@csun.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0918963, DEB-1257756, DMS-1312490, OCE-1559105]","We thank S.

The interdependence between plants and soil microbes could generate complex dynamics in which the composition of plant communities is regulated by the feedbacks of microbial communities on plant growth. In a greenhouse experiment we tested whether the soil microbes in roots of an invasive annual (Avena barbata, wild oat) and a native grass (Rytidosperma caespitosum, wallaby grass) can affect invasive and/or native plant performance. Individuals of each plant species were planted in sterilized soil to which pieces of roots of the same or the other species were added as a layer below the top soil. When plants were harvested after 10 weeks, the addition of roots of any species reduced the total biomass of wild oat. On the other hand, addition of roots of wild oat caused a much stronger reduction of the growth of wallaby grass, while roots of wallaby grass tended to increase its plant growth and shifted biomass allocation patterns. On balance, given the strength of the negative effects, our results indicated that invasion-induced changes in the soil microbial community could contribute to a displacement of the native grass. Thus, these changes might induce a positive feedback mechanism, contributing to the increased dominance of wild oat over wallaby grass in South Australian grasslands.","[Ba, Lei] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Ba, Lei; Facelli, Evelina; Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Ba, L (reprint author), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.",bal337@nenu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30900184]; Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities [B16011],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30900184) and the Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (B16011).,,41,1,1,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,SEP,2018,219,9,,,,,1045,1052,,10.1007/s11258-018-0857-8,,,8,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GQ3KG,WOS:000441561700003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Aspinwall, MJ; Blackman, CJ; de Dios, VR; Busch, FA; Rymer, PD; Loik, ME; Drake, JE; Pfautsch, S; Smith, RA; Tjoelker, MG; Tissue, DT",,,,"Aspinwall, Michael J.; Blackman, Chris J.; de Dios, Victor Resco; Busch, Florian A.; Rymer, Paul D.; Loik, Michael E.; Drake, John E.; Pfautsch, Sebastian; Smith, Renee A.; Tjoelker, Mark G.; Tissue, David T.",,,Photosynthesis and carbon allocation are both important predictors of genotype productivity responses to elevated CO2 in Eucalyptus camaldulensis,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,atmospheric CO2; carbon sequestration; forestry; intraspecific; nitrogen-use efficiency; roots,SPRUCE PICEA-SITCHENSIS; NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION; GAS-EXCHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; FOREST PRODUCTIVITY,"Intraspecific variation in biomass production responses to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) could influence tree species' ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying genotypic variation in responsiveness to eCO(2) remain poorly understood. In this study, we grew 17 Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. subsp. camaldulensis genotypes (representing provenances from four different climates) under ambient atmospheric CO2 and eCO(2). We tested whether genotype leaf-scale photosynthetic and whole-tree carbon (C) allocation responses to eCO(2) were predictive of genotype biomass production responses to eCO(2). Averaged across genotypes, growth at eCO(2) increased in situ leaf net photosynthesis (Anet) (29%) and leaf starch concentrations (37%). Growth at eCO(2) reduced the maximum carboxylation capacity of Rubisco (-4%) and leaf nitrogen per unit area (Narea,-6%), but Narea calculated on a total non-structural carbohydrate-free basis was similar between treatments. Growth at eCO(2) also increased biomass production and altered C allocation by reducing leaf area ratio (-11%) and stem mass fraction (SMF,-9%), and increasing leaf mass area (18%) and leaf mass fraction (5%). Overall, we found few significant CO2 x provenance or CO2 x genotype (within provenance) interactions. However, genotypes that showed the largest increases in total dry mass at eCO(2) had larger increases in root mass fraction (with larger decreases in SMF) and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) with CO2 enrichment. These results indicate that genetic differences in PNUE and carbon sink utilization (in roots) are both important predictors of tree productivity responsiveness to eCO(2).","[Aspinwall, Michael J.; Blackman, Chris J.; de Dios, Victor Resco; Rymer, Paul D.; Drake, John E.; Pfautsch, Sebastian; Smith, Renee A.; Tjoelker, Mark G.; Tissue, David T.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Aspinwall, Michael J.] Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [de Dios, Victor Resco] Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Dept Crop & Forest Sci, E-25198 Lleida, Spain; [de Dios, Victor Resco] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Peoples R China; [Busch, Florian A.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Loik, Michael E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Drake, John E.] SUNY ESF, Forest & Nat Resources Management, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Aspinwall, MJ (reprint author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.; Aspinwall, MJ (reprint author), Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",m.aspinwall@unf.edu,"Busch, Florian A./I-3816-2012; Drake, John/N-8490-2014; Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016; Aspinwall, Michael/M-2083-2014","Busch, Florian A./0000-0001-6912-0156; Drake, John/0000-0001-9453-1766; Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238; Aspinwall, Michael/0000-0003-0199-2972; Rymer, Paul/0000-0003-0988-4351","Science and Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF) [RP04-122]; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment (HIE), Western Sydney University","This study was funded by the Science and Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF; project code RP04-122), and supported by the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment (HIE), Western Sydney University.",,93,2,2,7,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,2018,38,9,,,,,1286,1301,,10.1093/treephys/tpy045,,,16,Forestry,Forestry,HD3WR,WOS:000452456200004,29741732,,,,10/31/19J,"Mandavi, SME; Salehi, H; Zarei, M",,,,"Mandavi, Sayyed Mohammad Ehsan; Salehi, Hassan; Zarei, Mehdi",,,Can arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ameliorate the adverse effects of deficit irrigation on tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)?,JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal; fungi; drought tolerance; enzyme activity; osmoprotectant; phosphorus; turfgrass,DROUGHT TOLERANCE; STRESS; PROLINE; PLANTS; ASSAY; INOCULATION; METABOLISM; ZINC; ROOT,"With increasing concerns over global warning, the shortage of water supplies has turned to be a disputable problem in the world. Drought stress is one of the most prevalent abiotic stresses that affect turfgrass growth and quality in landscapes of arid or semi-arid regions. Among the common cool-season turfgrasses, tall fescue can tolerate drought more than other grasses. Fungal bio-fertilizers, especially Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMFs) are able to alleviate the harmful effects of abiotic stresses in the plant This study was conducted in two consecutive years, 2014 and 2015, to evaluate how two types of AMFs (Funnelifiomis mosseae and Rhizophagus itregularis) would affect the growth characteristics of two cultivars ('H-d' and 'J-r') of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in the greenhouse and field conditions. Three irrigation intervals were applied, i.e. 7, 14 or 21-days. Results showed that by irrigating less frequently, the visual quality of turfgrass decreased, and there were reductions in the fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and relative water content. However, there were increases in the amount of phosphorus in the shoots, root colonization, compatible solutes (proline and glycine betaine) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and peroxidase). However, these changes were more pronounced in turfgrasses that were treated with AMFs. Qualitative and quantitative characteristics were substantially more promising in the greenhouse than in the field. This is the first report on the morpho-physiological and biochemical responses of tall fescue to AMFs. Results of this investigation could inspire further such works on other turfgrasses, given that the inoculation of turfgrasses with AMFs is a new approach with uncharted potentials that aims at reducing water consumption in the landscape environment.","[Mandavi, Sayyed Mohammad Ehsan; Salehi, Hassan] Shiraz Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Sch Agr, Shiraz, Iran; [Zarei, Mehdi] Shiraz Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Sch Agr, Shiraz, Iran","Salehi, H (reprint author), Shiraz Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Sch Agr, Shiraz, Iran.",hsalehi@shirazu.ac.ir,"Salehi, Hassan/Q-2817-2017; Mahdavi, Mohammad Ehsan/Q-2891-2019","Salehi, Hassan/0000-0002-9759-3329; Zarei, Mehdi/0000-0001-5199-2618",,,,46,0,0,1,5,SOC CHILENA CIENCIA SUELO,TEMUCO,"CASILLA 54-D, TEMUCO, 00000, CHILE",0718-9516,,,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,J.

However, the effects of climate and forest characteristics on biomass allocation fractions (the fraction of total forest biomass distributed in organs) remains unknown. The authors use a large Chinese biomass dataset (1081 forests encompassing 10 forest types) to analyse the responses of biomass allocation fractions to biogeography, climate, and forest characteristics. The authors found that the stem mass fraction significantly increased with age and precipitation and significantly decreased with latitude and temperature. The branch mass fraction significantly decreased with age and density, but significantly increased with temperature and latitude. The leaf mass fraction significantly decreased with age and precipitation and significantly increased with temperature. The root mass fraction significantly increased with latitude and density, and significantly decreased with precipitation. The results suggest that latitude, temperature, precipitation, stand age and density are good predictors of biomass partitioning. These findings support the hypotheses that variation in resource availability constrains organ allocation and provides biogeographically explicit relationships between biomass allocation and both environmental and forest characteristics, which might be used for assessing the impact of changing environmental and forest characteristics on forest carbon dynamics and fixation.","[Fang, Yiran; Zou, Xiaojun; Lie, Zhiyang; Xue, Li] South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lie, Zhiyang] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Xue, L (reprint author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fangyiran@stu.scau.edu.cn; zouxiaojun@stu.scau.edu.cn; liezhiyang@scbg.ac.cn; forxue@scau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31600353],This research was funded by [the National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [31600353].,,92,2,2,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2018,9,9,,,,,,,521,10.3390/f9090521,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,GY2UC,WOS:000448398100017,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Song, JF; Markewitz, D; Wu, SP; Sang, Y; Duan, CW; Cui, XY",,,,"Song, JinFeng; Markewitz, Daniel; Wu, Shaoping; Sang, Ying; Duan, Chengwei; Cui, XiaoYang",,,Exogenous Oxalic Acid and Citric Acid Improve Lead (Pb) Tolerance of Larix olgensis A.

Henry) seedlings in northeast China. The seedlings were exposed to 100 mgkg(-1) Pb in soil alone or in combination with OA or CA irrigation for 10, 20, or 30 days. Pb-induced damage in L. olgensis was evident from elevated lipid peroxidation that significantly inhibited plant growth. Malondialdehyde (MDA) contents also increased in the presence of elevated Pb; however, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, as well as proline and pigment contents, all decreased. The damage increased in controls over the application periods. Pb contents in fine roots and leaves generally decreased with low-concentration organic acids (<1.0 mmol.L-1), but often increased at 5.0 and 10.0 mmol.L-1. Alternatively, when Pb-stressed plants were exposed to an organic acid (especially 5.0 or 10.0 mmol.L-1 for 10 days), the damage, as indicated by the physiological parameters, was reversed, and plant growth was promoted; CA was more effective in inducing these changes than OA. Therefore, exogenous organic acids have the potential to alleviate Pb-induced oxidative injuries, and can improve the tolerance of L. olgensis seedlings to Pb stress. Under lower OA and CA concentrations, the detoxification mechanism appears to be an external resistance mechanism; however, under higher concentrations (5.0-10.0 mmol.L-1) internal resistance mechanisms appear dominant. It is also possible that the two mechanisms work in tandem.","[Song, JinFeng; Wu, Shaoping; Sang, Ying; Duan, Chengwei; Cui, XiaoYang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Markewitz, Daniel] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Cui, XY (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",songnefu@126.com; dmarke@uga.edu; wxibao@sina.com; sangying70@hotmail.com; 18845128152@163.com; c_xiaoyang@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370613]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017CA03],This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370613) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017CA03).,,36,2,2,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,SEP,2018,9,9,,,,,,,510,10.3390/f9090510,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,GY2UC,WOS:000448398100006,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Paolucci, AJ; Stolt, MH",,,,"Paolucci, Andrew J.; Stolt, Mark H.",,,Assessing Dynamic Soil Properties in Southern New England Forests within an Ecological Site Framework,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; ORGANIC-CARBON; LAND-USE; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; TRANSITION MODELS; ECOSYSTEM CARBON; WHITE-PINE; SALT-MARSH; RED MAPLE; RESPIRATION,"Ecological sites are a framework for documenting ecosystem conditions within a region but few have been developed for forested ecosystems. We developed ecological site concepts for southern New England glaciated forested upland and riparian benchmark soils with contrasting inherent properties. Within upland and riparian soils, we quantified the resistance or resilience of dynamic soil properties following specific management or disturbance. Although the upland soils had contrasting particle size classes, the vegetation composition, tree productivity, and soil organic C (SOC) pools were similar, suggesting that these soils have similar ecological potential. Coniferous and deciduous upland sites showed minimal differences. Selective harvest of 50% of overstory trees in the uplands decreased C addition from litter by 28% (p = 0.036) but did not significantly impact 0 horizon thickness or SOC contents, suggesting that C pools in these soils are resilient to selective harvesting. Although poorly and very poorly drained riparian soils had similar stands of Acer rubrum L., very poorly drained soils had larger SOC pools and thicker 0 horizons, and Carex stricta Lam. and Symplocarpus foetidus (L.) Salisb. ex W.P.C.Barton dominated the understory. These differences suggest these riparian soils should be considered separate ecological sites. Simulated N enrichment of riparian soils significantly (p = 0.006) increased root biomass but not CO2 respiration. Over time, N additions may increase C pools in riparian soils. Our studies suggest that ecological site concepts can be applied in southern New England forest ecosystems to establish a framework for understanding plant and soil responses to disturbance or management.","[Paolucci, Andrew J.] USDA Nat Resources Conservat Serv, 19777 Greenley Rd, Sonora, CA 93570 USA; [Paolucci, Andrew J.; Stolt, Mark H.] Univ Rhode Isl, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Stolt, MH (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",mstolt@uri.edu,,,National Soil Survey Center,"This paper is a contribution of the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (No. 5465).

Understanding these associations has important implications for ecological theory and for restoration practice. Here, we tested whether the presence of AMF and rhizobia influences the performance of native woody plants invaded by a non-native grass in experimental microcosms. We planted eight plant species (i.e., Acacia acuminata, A.microbotrya, Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. loxophleba, E.astringens, Calothamnus quadrifidus, Callistemon phoeniceus, Hakea lissocarpha and H.prostrata) in microcosms of field-conditioned soil with and without addition of AMF and rhizobia in a fully factorial experimental design. After seedling establishment, we seeded half the microcosms with an invasive grass Bromus diandrus. We measured shoot and root biomass of native plants and Bromus, and on roots, the percentage colonization by AMF, number of rhizobia-forming nodules and number of proteaceous root clusters. We found no effect of plant root symbionts or Bromus addition on performance of myrtaceous, and as predicted, proteaceous species as they rely little or not at all on AMF and rhizobia. Soil treatments with AMF and rhizobia had a strong positive effect (i.e., larger biomass) on native legumes (A.microbotrya and A.acuminata). However, the beneficial effect of root symbionts on legumes became negative (i.e., lower biomass and less nodules) if Bromus was present, especially for one legume, i.e., A.acuminata, suggesting a disruptive effect of the invader on the mutualism. We also found a stimulating effect of Bromus on root nodule production in A.microbotrya and AMF colonization in A.acuminata which could be indicative of legumes' increased resource acquisition requirement, i.e., for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, in response to the Bromus addition. We have demonstrated the importance of measuring belowground effects because the aboveground effects gave limited indication of the effects occurring belowground.","[Birnbaum, Christina; Standish, Rachel J.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Environm & Conservat Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia; [Morald, Tim K.; Tibbett, Mark; Standish, Rachel J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Tibbett, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Ctr Agri Environm Res, Reading, Berks, England; [Tibbett, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Soil Res Ctr, Reading, Berks, England; [Bennett, Richard G.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Plant Genet & Breeding, Crawley, WA, Australia","Birnbaum, C (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",chbirnbaum@gmail.com,"Bennett, Richard G/Q-4403-2018; Tibbett, Mark/P-2079-2019; Standish, Rachel J/B-1028-2011","Bennett, Richard G/0000-0001-7519-3036; Tibbett, Mark/0000-0003-0143-2190; Birnbaum, Christina/0000-0002-2511-1845",University of Western Australia Research Development Award,University of Western Australia Research Development Award,,89,0,0,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

KARST; GROWTH; GERMANY,"Norway spruce is a widely cultivated species in Central Europe; however, it is highly susceptible to droughts, which are predicted to become more frequent in the future. A solution to adapt spruce forests to droughts could be the conversion to mixed-species stands containing species which are less sensitive to drought and do not increase the drought stress in spruce. Here we assessed the drought response of spruce and the presumably more drought-tolerant silver fir and Douglas fir in mixed-conifer stands. We measured tree ring widths of 270 target trees, which grew in mixed and mono-specific neighbourhoods in 18 managed stands in the Black Forest, to quantify the complementarity effects caused by species interactions on growth during the extreme drought event of 2003 and for a number of years with normal growth and climatic conditions. Mixed-species neighbourhoods did not significantly affect tree ring growth in normal years. However, during the drought, silver fir benefitted from mixing, while Douglas fir was more drought-stressed in the mixture. The drought response of spruce was dependent on the density and species composition of the neighbourhood, showing both positive and negative mixing effects. Mixed stands containing these tree species could improve adaptation to drought because the risks of extreme events are spread across species, and the performance of individual species is improved. Our knowledge about specific species interactions needs to be improved to manage tree mixtures more effectively with regard to the participating species and stand density.","[Vitali, Valentina; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Forrester, David I.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Vitali, V (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",vitali.valentina@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013; Vitali, Valentina/J-4851-2019; Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Vitali, Valentina/0000-0002-3045-6178; Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986","KLIMOPASS Grant by the Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy [4500354096/23]; ForstBW","This study was financially supported through a KLIMOPASS Grant (No. 4500354096/23) provided by the Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy to Jurgen Bauhus.

Our understanding of how SOM forms and is stabilized, however, is shifting. Traditional theory maintains the formation of SOM is due to chemical complexity: difficult to decompose plant inputs persist in the soil while easily decomposable inputs are respired as CO2. However, consensus is now building around an alternative thesis, hypothesizing that the plant inputs most easily assimilated by soil decomposers are the ones stabilized as SOM because dead microbial biomass is now considered one of the primary components of stable SOM. As such, the efficiency with which the microbial community uses these plant inputs has direct implications for the amount and rate of SOM formation under both a constant and changing climate. Our study empirically tests and measures the effects of substrate quality, quantity, and temperature on SOM formation rates a process that may have profound impact on carbon stocks. We used C-13-labeled substrates representative of plant root exudates (simple sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) to determine the proportion of substrate retained within SOM, microbial biomass, dissolved organic carbon, or evolved as (CO2)-C-13. We found that glucose, the substrate most efficiently assimilated by the microbial biomass, leads to the greatest amount of SOM formation compared to glycine and oxalic acid. In contrast to expectations, higher concentrations of substrate addition lead to proportionally less C-13 label retention than lower concentrations. Temperature had a negligible impact on SOM formation, with higher temperatures actually leading to slight increases in SOM formation. While substrate quality and quantity drove the largest differences in SOM formation rates, once metabolized by the microbial biomass, eventual incorporation of carbon into the mineral associated SOM pool (thought to be the most stable of the soil C pools), was effectively equivalent across treatments. Our data suggest that changing composition and amount of labile carbon substrates supplied to soils will likely be key determinants of SOM formation rates and, hence, potentially soil carbon stock sizes.","[Oldfield, Emily E.; Bradford, Mark A.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Crowther, Thomas W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Oldfield, EE (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",emily.oldfield@yale.edu,"Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012","Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Oldfield, Emily/0000-0002-6181-1267",Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies; Yale Analytical and Stable Isotope Center,Thanks to Brad Erkkila at Yale and Tom Maddox at the University of Georgia for their work in completing stable isotope lab analysis; and to the Bradford Lab for constructive comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

We investigated whether pre-heating locally sourced rhizosphere soil (inoculum) could acclimatize plants to a field-imposed heat wave in a restoration setting. Soil heating in the laboratory caused a marked shift in rhizosphere bacterial community composition, accompanied by an increase in species evenness. Furthermore, pre-heated rhizosphere soil reduced plant height, number of leaves, and shoot mass of the C-4 grass, blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and it reduced the shoot mass of the C-3 grass, Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) in the glasshouse. Following transplantation and the application of a field heat wave, pre-heated inoculum did not influence heat wave survival for either plant species. However, there were strong species-level responses to the field heat wave. For instance, heat wave survivorship was over four times higher in blue grama (92%) than in Arizona fescue (22%). These results suggest that the use of C-4 seeds may be preferable for sites exhibiting high heat wave risk. Further research is needed to understand whether inocula are more effective in highly degraded soil in comparison with partially degraded soils.","[Rubin, Rachel L.; Koch, George W.; Martinez, Ayla; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Rubin, Rachel L.; Koch, George W.; Martinez, Ayla; Mau, Rebecca L.; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Bowker, Matthew A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Rubin, RL (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.; Rubin, RL (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",rlr276@nau.edu,,,METER Environmental; NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0949460]; ARCS Phoenix Chapter; SSSA Francis and Evelyn Clark Soil Biology Scholarship,"We thank METER Environmental for providing soil sensors, data loggers, and analytical software through the Grant A.

That island characteristics, including remoteness, can profoundly modulate biological diversity has been borne out by studies of animals and plants. By contrast, the processes influencing microbial diversity in island systems remain largely undetermined. We sequenced arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal DNA from plant roots collected on 13 islands worldwide and compared AM fungal diversity on islands with existing data from mainland sites. AM fungal communities on islands (even those >6000 km from the closest mainland) comprised few endemic taxa and were as diverse as mainland communities. Thus, in contrast to patterns recorded among macro-organisms, efficient dispersal appears to outweigh the effects of taxogenesis and extinction in regulating AM fungal diversity on islands. Nonetheless, AM fungal communities on more distant islands comprised a higher proportion of previously cultured and large-spored taxa, indicating that dispersal may be human-mediated or require tolerance of significant environmental stress, such as exposure to sunlight or high salinity. The processes driving large-scale patterns of microbial diversity are a key consideration for attempts to conserve and restore functioning ecosystems in this era of rapid global change.","[Davison, John; Moora, Mari; Opik, Maarja; Hiiesalu, Inga; Jairus, Teele; Kalamees, Rein; Koorem, Kadri; Pussa, Kersti; Reier, Ulle; Partel, Meelis; Vasar, Martti; Zobel, Martin] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Ainsaar, Leho; Ducousso, Marc] CIRAD LSTM UMR082, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Johnson, Nancy] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Jourand, Philippe] IRD, LSTM UMR040, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Meyers, Jean-Yves] Delegat Rech Polynesie Francaise, Batiment Govt,Ave Pouvanaa Oopa,BP 20981, F-98713 Tahiti, French Polynesi, France; [Semchenko, Marina] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Traveset, Anna] UIB, CSIC, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, Global Change Res Grp, Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain","Davison, J (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",john.davison@ut.ee,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Ainsaar, Leho/U-6039-2018; Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012","Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Ainsaar, Leho/0000-0002-0347-9577","Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [IUT 20-28, IUT 20-29, PUT1170, PUTJD78]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange); GIP CNRT [GIPCNRT98]","This study was supported by the Estonian Research Council (IUT 20-28, IUT 20-29, PUT1170, PUTJD78), the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange) and GIP CNRT (GIPCNRT98).",,75,5,6,10,52,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,SEP,2018,12,9,,,,,2211,2224,,10.1038/s41396-018-0196-8,,,14,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,GQ3QQ,WOS:000441581700010,29884829,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Gomes, SIF; Merckx, VSFT; Hynson, NA",,,,"Gomes, Sofia I.

Furthermore, few of these studies have taken place in tropical ecosystems that experience an inordinate rate of invasions into native habitats. Here, we examined the effects of plant invasions dominated by non-native tree species on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in Hawaii. To test the hypothesis that invasions result in consistent changes in AM fungal diversity across spatial gradients relative to native forest habitats, we sampled soil in paired native and invaded sites from three watersheds and used amplicon sequencing to characterize AM fungal communities. Whether our analyses considered phylogenetic relatedness or not, we found that invasions consistently increased the richness of AM fungi. However, AM fungal species composition was not related to invasion status of the vegetation nor local environment, but stratified by watershed. Our results suggest that while invasions can lead to an overall increase in the diversity of microbial mutualists, the effects of plant host identity or geographic structuring potentially outweigh those of invasive species in determining the community membership of AM fungi. Thus, host specificity and spatial factors such as dispersal need to be taken into consideration when examining the effects of biological invasions on symbiotic microbes.","[Gomes, Sofia I.

A field litterbag experiment was conducted in monospecific and mixed-species plantations of Pinus massoniana and Castanopsis hystrix in subtropical China, to examine the effects of litter mixing and changing stand environment on the litter decomposition rate and the composition-specific litter organic C loss rate of P. massoniana and C. hystrix. Admixing with the lower-quality P. massoniana litter slowed C. hystrix litter decomposition and recalcitrant C loss, whereas admixing with the higher-quality C. hystrix litter hastened P. massoniana litter decomposition in the mixed-species plantation. The P. massoniana litter exhibited a faster decomposition rate in the mixed-species plantation than in the P. massoniana monospecific plantation. The same trend was found in the loss rates of aromatic C and carbonyl C from P. massoniana litter. The greater soil organic matter content and nitrogen availability in the mixed-species plantation than in the P. massoniana monospecific plantation could have resulted in the increased rates of decomposition and organic C loss in P. massoniana litter. This study highlights that maintaining mixed conifer-broadleaf forests and/or adopting close-to-nature forest management could accelerate the decomposition of recalcitrant coniferous litter, facilitating C sequestration and mitigating the C emissions derived from the labile broadleaf litter.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Yang, Yujing; Shi, Zuomin] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingxin] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, POB 6215, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [You, Yeming; Huang, Xueman] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Lu; Li, Zhaoying; Ming, Angang; Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",liusr@caf.ac.cn,,"Yang, Yujing/0000-0003-4878-8063","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470627, 31100380]; Fundamental Research Funds of Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2017QB004, CAFYBB2018SZ005]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2015DFA31440]; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds","We would like to thank the Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosystem Research Station for experimental and logistical support, and RM He and H Chen for assistance in field work.

Understanding the links between stand dynamics and mushroom productivity together with the impact of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., forest management) is necessary to provide further insight into plant-soil interactions in forest ecosystems. The aim of this research was to shed light on the relationship between tree growth and mushroom yield of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprobic fungi in a Mediterranean forest ecosystem. We hypothesized that: (i) increased tree growth is linked to higher ECM mushroom yield arising from increased carbohydrate allocation to ECM fungi; (ii) saprobic mushroom yield is less dependent on tree growth patterns; and (iii) mushroom yields can be predicted based on certain wood-anatomical features. The study area was a Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forest located in northeastern Spain. Mushroom yield data were measured from 2008 to 2014 in 27 permanent plots within a thinning experiment. Dendrochronological analyses were conducted in each plot to characterize and quantify seasonal radial growth (earlywood and latewood width) and the frequency of latewood intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs). Spearman correlation and ""Gleichlaufigkeit"" (GLK) analyses were conducted to detect significant correlations and to quantify the synchrony between tree-ring features and ECM and saprobic mushroom yield patterns, the latter being used as a benchmark to better assess the relationships between tree growth and ECM fungi. To further inspect tree growth-mushroom yield relationships, mixed-effects models using dendrochronological variables as predictors were fitted to annual ECM and saprobic mushroom occurrence and yield data. We observed that the latewood IADFs frequency was the best predictor of ECM mushroom yield, i.e., better than early- or latewood width. The analysis also revealed that not only the precipitation of late summer and early autumn, but also forest thinning effects, were mediating the relationship between tree growth and ECM mushroom production. We found 2-year lagged effects between the current saprobic mushroom production and latewood width, whereas ECM mushroom yield was more correlated with current latewood production. The models presented in this study may be used to reconstruct mushroom production along historical periods based on dendrochronological information, but also to predict future mushroom yield based on climate-sensitive tree and stand growth predictions.","[Collado, Eduardo; Peman, Juan; Antonio Bonet, Jose; de-Miguel, Sergio] Univ Lleida, Agrotecnio Ctr UdL Agrotecnio, Dept Prod Vegetal & Ciencia Forestal, Av Rovira Roure 191, E-25198 Lleida, Spain; [Martinez de Aragon, Juan; Antonio Bonet, Jose] Consorci Ctr Ciencia & Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys Km 2, E-25280 Solsona, Spain; [Julio Camarero, J.] Inst Pirenaico Ecol IPE CSIC, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50192, Spain","Collado, E (reprint author), Univ Lleida, Agrotecnio Ctr UdL Agrotecnio, Dept Prod Vegetal & Ciencia Forestal, Av Rovira Roure 191, E-25198 Lleida, Spain.",ecc@pvcf.udl.cat; jjcamarero@ipe.csic.es; mtzda@ctfc.es; jpr2@alumnes.udl.cat; jantonio.bonet@pvcf.udl.cat; sergio.demiguel@pvcf.udl.cat,"de Aragon, Juan Martinez/K-2631-2014; Bonet, Jose-Antonio/G-7951-2015; de Miguel, Sergio/B-8358-2016","de Aragon, Juan Martinez/0000-0001-5663-2080; de Miguel, Sergio/0000-0002-9738-0657","University of Lleida; European Union's Horizon MultiFUNGtionality Marie Sklodowska-Curie (IF-EF) [655815]; Generalitat of CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya; research projects MYCOSYTEMS (MEC Spain) [AGL2015-66001-C3-1-R, CGL2015-69186-C2-1-R]; Collaborative European projects ERANET-INFORMED [PCIN-2014-050]","This work benefited from the scholarship provided by the University of Lleida to the first author.

However, limited information is available about the diversity of root-associated EcM fungi of Pinus wallichiana A.B. Jackson, a coniferous species endemic to Himalayan forests that has hampered the reforestation programs in the area. The study was carried at three major forest areas of the Kashmir Himalaya believed to be pure stands of P. wallichiana. Fine root tips harbouring EcM fungi were collected and processed for extraction of fungal DNA, which was subsequently subjected to ITS rDNA targeted PCR-RFLP profiling. DNA sequencing analysis of the overlapping ITS amplifications followed by global nucleotide BLAST analyses of the assembled nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) revealed a total of 33 fungal taxa associated with P. wallichiana of which 23 species were EcM fungi. Of the 10 non-EcM fungi, we found a peculiar saprophytic wood decaying fungus, Chalara microchona, associated with P. wallichiana for the first time. The study not only reveals the species richness of fungi associated with this conifer but also documents new fungal associations with it, which have not been reported so far. The results in the study set a baseline for the broad association of ectomycorrhizal fungi with P. wallichiana, which may serve as guiding cue to design reforestation programs in the Kashmir Himalaya.","[Tyub, Sumira; Kamili, Azra N.] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Res Dev, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Reshi, Zafar A.; Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Mokhdomi, Taseem A.; Bukhari, Shoiab; Amin, Asif; Wafai, Asrar H.; Qadri, Raies A.] Univ Kashmir, Dept Biotechnol, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India","Rashid, I (reprint author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",ecoirfan@yahoo.co.in,,,"Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), New Delhi [14/79/2013-RE]","The financial supported provided to IR by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), New Delhi, under grant No. 14/79/2013-RE is acknowledged.

Using a meta-analysis of 38 published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs. fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic. Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure.","[Lekberg, Ylva; Larkin, Beau G.] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bunn, Rebecca A.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Hart, Miranda M.; Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Reinhart, Kurt O.] USDA ARS, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Remke, Michael] No Arizona Univ, Coll Engn Forestry & Nat Sci, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol NIOO KNAW, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ WUR, Dept Plant Sci, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Lekberg, Y (reprint author), MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.; Lekberg, Y (reprint author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",ylekberg@mpgranch.com,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",MPG Ranch; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1553518]; NSF EPSCoR Track-1 [EPS-1101342],"This manuscript is the product of a workshop sponsored by MPG Ranch.

They constitute an important pathway for plant-derived carbon into the soil and facilitate nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition. However, the mechanisms that drive ectomycorrhizal diversity and community composition are still subject to discussion. We investigated patterns in ectomycorrhizal diversity, community composition, and exploration types on root tips in Fagus sylvatica,Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris stands across Europe. Host tree species is the most important factor shaping the ectomycorrhizal community as well as the distribution of exploration types. Moreover, abiotic factors such as soil properties, N deposition, temperature, and precipitation, were found to significantly influence EM diversity and community composition. A clear differentiation into functional traits by means of exploration types was shown for all ectomycorrhizal communities across the three analyzed tree species. Contact and short-distance exploration types were clearly significantly more abundant than cord- or rhizomorph-forming long-distance exploration types of EM fungi. Medium-distance exploration types were significantly lower in abundance than contact and short-distance types, however they were the most frequent EM taxa and constituted nearly half of the EM community. Furthermore, EM taxa exhibit distinct ecological ranges, and the type of soil exploration seemed to determine whether EM taxa have small or rather big environmental ranges.","[Rosinger, Christoph; Sanden, Hans; Matthews, Bradley; Mayer, Mathias; Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Godbold, Douglas L.] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Landscape Carbon Deposit, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Godbold, DL (reprint author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.; Godbold, DL (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Landscape Carbon Deposit, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",christoph.rosinger@boku.ac.at; hans.sanden@boku.ac.at; bradley.matthews@boku.ac.at; mathias.mayer@boku.ac.at; douglas.godbold@boku.ac.at,,"Sanden, Hans/0000-0002-2496-6307; Mayer, Mathias/0000-0003-4366-9188","Marie Curie Actions Career Integration GrantEuropean Union (EU) [GPF333996]; Austrian Academy of Sciences grant C-Alp; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I [LO1415]","This work was funded by a Marie Curie Actions Career Integration Grant GPF333996 LINKTOFUN and an Austrian Academy of Sciences grant C-Alp.

Groundwater lowering can produce dramatic changes in the physiological performance and survival of plant species. The impact of decreasing water availability due to climate change and anthropogenic groundwater extraction on coastal dune ecosystems has become of increasing concern, with uncertainties about how vegetation will respond in both the short and long terms. 2. We aimed to evaluate the water-use responses of different plant functional types to increasing groundwater table depth and how this would affect their physiology in Mediterranean coastal dune systems differing in aridity. 3. We modelled water-table depth, quantified the contribution of different soil layers to plant water through Bayesian isotope mixing models and used a combination of spectral and isotope data to characterize plant ecophysiology. We found that increasing depth to groundwater triggered water uptake adjustments towards deeper soil layers only in the dry season. These adjustments in water source use were made by conifer trees (Pinus pinea, P. pinaster) and hygrophytic shrubs (Erica scoparia, Salix repens) but not by the xerophytic shrub Corema album. Moreover, we observed a greater use of groundwater under semi-arid conditions. Accompanying the greater use of water from deep soil layers as a response to increasing groundwater depth, the semi-arid dimorphic-rooted conifer tree P. pinea and hygrophytic shrub E. scoparia declined their water content (WI), without implications on photosynthetic parameters, such as chlorophyll content (CHL), photochemical index (PRI) and delta C-13. Unexpectedly, under semi-arid conditions, the shallow-rooted xerophytic shrub C. album, associated with an absence of water source use adjustments, showed a decline in WI, CHL and PRI with groundwater table lowering. 4. We provide insight into how different species, belonging to different functional types, are acclimating to groundwater changes in a region experiencing climatic drought and a scarcity in groundwater due to anthropogenic exploitation. Greater depth to groundwater combined with limited precipitation can have a significant effect on plants' water source use and ecophysiology in semi-arid coastal dune ecosystems.","[Antunes, Cristina; Anjos, Andreia; Correia, Otilia; Maguas, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, Lisbon, Portugal; [Antunes, Cristina] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, PPG Ecol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Diaz Barradas, Mari Cruz; Zunzunegui, Maria] Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Seville, Spain; [Vieira, Simone] Univ Estadual Campinas, Nucleo Estudos & Pesquisas Ambientais, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pereira, Angela; Pereira, Maria Joao] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Recursos Nat & Ambiente, Lisbon, Portugal","Antunes, C (reprint author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, Lisbon, Portugal.; Antunes, C (reprint author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, PPG Ecol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",cmaantunes@fc.ul.pt,"Pereira, Maria Joao/H-5456-2012; Zunzunegui, Maria/L-8357-2014; Maguas, Cristina/G-3441-2011; Vieira, Simone/H-1225-2011; vieira, Sabrina n/X-1702-2018; Correia, Otilia/K-1928-2012; Pereira, Angela/M-1413-2018","Pereira, Maria Joao/0000-0003-2580-6281; Zunzunegui, Maria/0000-0002-3815-9290; Maguas, Cristina/0000-0002-4396-7073; Vieira, Simone/0000-0002-0129-4181; Antunes, Cristina/0000-0002-5934-388X; Correia, Otilia/0000-0002-1053-0561; Pereira, Angela/0000-0002-9879-1407","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PTDC/AAC-CLI/118555/2010, UID/BIA/00329/2013]; Fundacao de Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES; CERENA [FCT-UID/ECI/04028/2013]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Grant/Award Number: PTDC/AAC-CLI/118555/2010 and UID/BIA/00329/2013; Fundacao de Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CERENA, Grant/Award Number: FCT-UID/ECI/04028/2013",,79,3,4,7,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Compared to terrestrial environments, the fungal ecology of aquatic environments is rarely studied, and the few published studies have tended to be of lotic habitats in the northern hemisphere. We explored fungal communities and their responses to a gradient of copper in five year old artificial, replicated ponds in Australia. Ponds were subject to natural variations in temperature, precipitation and biotic colonisation. To explore the fungal communities, we amplified the ITS1 region of rDNA from samples of the water column, the sediment and cellulose baits (analogues to leaf fall) alone and in the presence of a gradient of copper. Fungal amplicon data revealed almost 800 fungal species from these habitats within the ponds. Interestingly, no chytrids from the Cladochytriales and Rhizophlyctidales were detected on cellulose baits, instead, putatively novel zoosporic taxa in the Chytridiomycota and the Rozellomycota were observed. Given the keystone role zoosporic fungi are thought to play in aquatic food webs, along with their role as primary decomposers of plant material, improved knowledge of their diversity and distribution is vital for understanding ecosystem function in standing water habitats. In aquatic environments copper tends to be bound to sediment and is not especially mobile in the water phase. The presence of copper in our sediment samples was correlated with repeatable and profound shifts in the fungal community, with chytrid species appearing to be the most sensitive, suggesting that they may be useful indicator organisms. Indirect effects of copper on fungal communities living on leaf analogues and in the water column were also explored. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using reciprocal transplantation experiments we tested the performance of two plant species (Primula atrodentata and Aster himalaicus) and AM fungal associations and their interactions in response to environmental change at sites of contrasting elevation. The results show a clear home advantage of plant performance and fungal colonization in most cases, and the consistently positive responses of plants to AM fungi in all home-away combinations. Specifically, mycorrhizal responses showed home-site advantage in P. atrodentata and the AM fungi consistently increased the fitness of A. himalaicus at the high elevation site, suggesting that the stress gradient hypothesis and adaptation hypothesis are both important theoretically in the prediction of functional responses of AM associations to environmental change in alpine ecosystems.

We amplified the nrDNA ITS2 region of 130 orchid individuals with Illumina MiSeq technology and tested whether changes in the structure of fungal communities are associated with hosts' phylogeny or the sites where the orchids grow. We identified 3492 OTUs corresponding to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota phyla. Fungal communities associated with orchids at the lower geographic areas (between 2050 and 2800 m a.s.l.) showed that host evolution and sites are drivers that could shape distinct fungal communities, while at the highest geographic areas (between 3000 and 3500 m a.s.l.), no distinct fungal communities were found neither between co-existing orchid species nor between sites.

A recent hypothesis predicts that soils under trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) store less C than soils dominated by trees associated with ectomycorrhizas (ECM), due to slower decomposition in ECM-dominated forests. However, an incipient hypothesis predicts that systems with rapid decompositione-e.g. most AM-dominated forestsenhance soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization by accelerating the production of microbial residues. To address these contrasting predictions, we quantified soil C and N to 1 m depth across gradients of ECM-dominance in three temperate forests. By focusing on sites where AM- and ECM-plants co-occur, our analysis controls for climatic factors that covary with mycorrhizal dominance across broad scales. We found that while ECM stands contain more SOM in topsoil, AM stands contain more SOM when subsoil to 1 m depth is included. Biomarkers and soil fractionations reveal that these patterns are driven by an accumulation of microbial residues in AM-dominated soils. Collectively, our results support emerging theory on SOM formation, demonstrate the importance of subsurface soils in mediating plant effects on soil C and N, and indicate that shifts in the mycorrhizal composition of temperate forests may alter the stabilization of SOM.","[Craig, Matthew E.; Clay, Keith; Phillips, Richard P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Turner, Benjamin L.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Liang, Chao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Johnson, Daniel J.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA","Craig, ME (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",maecraig@indiana.edu,"Turner, Benjamin L/E-5940-2011; Phillips, Richard P/C-6429-2009","Turner, Benjamin L/0000-0002-6585-0722; ",Biological and Environmental Research [DE-SC0016188]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41471218]; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Division of Environmental Biology [1153401]; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE),"Biological and Environmental Research, Grant/Award Number: DE-SC0016188; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41471218; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1153401; U.S. Department of Energy",,104,15,16,21,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The present study was to explore the effect of labile carbon on microbial reduction of Fe(III) and release of phosphorus in root-free sub-tropical soil. A two-compartment microcosm was collected, in which the roots of Medicago sativa L. cultivar Aohan' were confined within one compartment by a barrier of 30-m nylon mesh, while mycorrhizal hyphae could penetrate to the second compartment. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Funelliformis mosseae) were added to the root compartment and iron-reducing bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae) were added to the hyphal compartment. Hyphal compartments were provided with two levels of additional carbon (0 and 23 mg C kg(-1) soil as sodium acetate) and eight levels of inorganic phosphorus (0 to 35 mg P kg(-1) soil as KH2PO4). At low phosphorus levels (< 5 mg P kg(-1) soil), shoot biomass, and total biomass phosphorus were substantially less with added carbon in the presence of iron-reducing bacteria. Carbon had little effect without iron-reducing bacteria. At higher phosphorus levels (> 15 mg P kg(-1) soil), the effect of added carbon was reversed; that is shoot biomass and total biomass phosphorus were greater with added carbon. Available soil phosphorus showed a similar response to added carbonless at low levels of phosphorus and greater at higher levels of phosphorus. Microbial phosphorus in the presence of iron-reducing bacteria was always higher with added carbon at all corresponding levels of soil phosphorus. Taken together, these results show that some phosphorus mobilized by iron-reducing bacteria was converted into microbiological phosphorus, but there was an obligatory requirement for labile carbon for this to happenreducing the amount of phosphorus that was absorbed by the mycorrhizal hyphae. Iron-reducing bacteria and mycorrhizae showed a competitive interaction at lower levels of available soil phosphorus, and a complementary, or possibly a carbon-dependent synergistic function at higher levels of available phosphorus. These results demonstrate that phosphorus released from ferralsols by iron-reducing bacteria is positively mediated by both phosphorus and labile carbon and, hence, that phosphorus release and mobilization by iron-reducing bacteria is likely to be enhanced by additions of exogenous carbon.","[Zhang, Shirong; Ding, Xiaodong] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China","Ding, XD (reprint author), Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China.",xiaodongding2004@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFD0200208-3]; Nature Science Foundation of Shandong [ZR2017MC015]; Foundation for High-level Talents of QAU [1115028]; Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong [2015GNC111014],"We acknowledge Dr. David Ugalde (StumpJump Foundation, Australia) for constructive comments and language revision on this manuscript.

Biocrusts are proposed to enhance soil fertility and productivity, but simultaneously act as a barrier to the invasive grass, Bromus tectorum, in western North America. Both biocrusts and B. tectorum are sensitive to climate change drivers, yet how their responses might interact to affect dryland ecosystems is unclear. Methods Using mesocosms with bare soil versus biocrust cover, we germinated B. tectorum seeds collected from warmed, warmed + watered, and ambient temperature plots within a long-term climate change experiment on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We characterized biocrust influences on soil fertility and grass germination, morphology, and chemistry. Results Biocrusts increased soil fertility and B. tectorum biomass, specific leaf area (SLA), and root:shoot ratios. Germination rates were unaffected by mesocosm cover-type. Biocrusts delayed germination timing while also interacting with the warmed treatment to advance, and with the warmed + watered treatment to delay germination. Conclusions Biocrusts promoted B. tectorum growth, likely through positive influence on soil fertility which was elevated in biocrust mesocosms, and interacted with seed treatment-provenance to affect germination. Understanding how anticipated losses of biocrusts will affect invasion dynamics will require further investigation of how plant plasticity/adaptation to specific climate drivers interact with soil and biocrust properties.","[Ferrenberg, Scott] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Ferrenberg, Scott; Howell, Armin; Reed, Sasha C.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Faist, Akasha M.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Anim & Range Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Ferrenberg, S (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",ferrenbe@nmsu.edu,,"Ferrenberg, Scott/0000-0002-3542-0334; Reed, Sasha/0000-0002-8597-8619",U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DESC-0008168]; U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystems Mission Area,"Our manuscript was improved by comments from two anonymous reviewers, R.

Responses of Rs to such N enrichment has been widely investigated in forest ecosystems, both in natural and planted forests. As natural and planted forests differ in many aspects (e.g. species composition, forest management and succession stage, soil properties etc.), the responses of Rs in natural and planted forests to N addition may be different. However, so far, few studies have made a direct comparison between natural versus planted forests. To fill this gap, we have examined how autotrophic (Ra), heterotrophic (Rh) and total Rs respond to experimental N addition in a natural and a planted Pinus tabulaeformis forests in northern China. Methods Three levels of N addition (CK = 0, LN = 50 and HN = 100 kg N ha(-1) yr.(-1)) were applied monthly over five growing seasons. Soil respiration and its components, soil properties, microbial biomass (MBC), enzymes activity and fine root biomass were measured. Results After 5-years of N addition, our results showed that: (1) for all three treatments, mean annual Rs of the planted forest were significantly higher than that of the natural forest; (2) in the natural forest, mean annual Rh was reduced by 16.8 and 28.3% under LN and HN treatments, respectively, whereas in the planted forest, mean annual Rh was reduced by 14.4 and 18.3% under LN and HN treatments, respectively. (3) mean annual Ra was increased by 47.6 and 59.5% under LN and HN, respectively, in the natural forest. In contrast, in the planted forest, LN and HN both enhanced Ra to the same rate. Conclusions In both natural and planted forests, the inhibition of Rh was largely associated with the decreased microbial biomass C (MBC) and reduced activity of the cellulose degrading enzyme. However, inconsistent patterns of Ra to N addition of different intensities in the natural vs. planted forests might be due to root ammonium toxicity under high N-availability scenarios. We demonstrated that the natural and planted forests may differ in their Rs responses to N addition, depending on different responses of Ra. Our results may have potential implications for forest management and predicting forest ecosystem carbon balance under future N scenarios.","[Zhao, Bo; Cao, Jing; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinsong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gadow, Klaus V.] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Burckhardt Inst, Gottingen, Germany","Zhao, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41330530],This study was financially supported by the State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41330530).,,73,3,3,5,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2018,429,2-Jan,,,SI,,375,389,,10.1007/s11104-018-3702-x,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GO1YU,WOS:000439759200028,,,,,10/31/19J,"Slominski, AH; German, Z; Burkle, LA",,,,"Slominski, Anthony H.; German, Zac; Burkle, Laura A.",,,Growth and physiological responses of subalpine forbs to nitrogen and soil moisture: investigating the potential roles of plant functional traits,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Photosynthesis; Transpiration; Floral display,STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTANCE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; WATER; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ENRICHMENT; DEPOSITION,"Anthropogenic inputs of biologically available nitrogen (N) and climate change are simultaneously altering N and soil moisture availability in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, plant responses to concurrent changes in both N and soil moisture in non-grassland ecosystems remain poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate how rooting depth and N-fixing ability-two functional traits we expected to mediate soil moisture and N limitations-influence forb responses to N and soil moisture availability in the Rocky Mountains USA. We assessed the growth and physiological responses (i.e., chlorophyll fluorescence, transpiration rate, and floral display) of four subalpine forb species to N additions across a naturally-occurring soil moisture gradient during one growing season. Soil moisture had a stronger positive effect on growth in shallow-rooted species and N additions had a stronger positive effect on photosynthetic capacity in species without N-fixing abilities. Transpiration rates were not consistent with soil moisture limitations expected for shallow-rooted species, and soil moisture and N had a neutral or negative influence on maximum floral displays across species. Nitrogen and soil moisture appeared to each limit separate response variables in some cases and we did not observe any N x soil moisture interactions. These findings suggest that shallow-rooted species may be more vulnerable to increased drought severity and that increased N availability may disproportionately benefit species without N-fixing abilities. However, mixed support for our hypotheses suggests that environmental conditions and functional traits not evaluated here likely influence subalpine plant responses to soil moisture and N availability.","[Slominski, Anthony H.] Western State Colorado Univ, Dept Biol, Gunnison, CO 81231 USA; [Slominski, Anthony H.; German, Zac] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Slominski, Anthony H.; Burkle, Laura A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [German, Zac] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Slominski, AH (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",anthony.slominski@gmail.com,,,Rocky Mountain Biological Lab Advanced Undergraduate Research Program; Western State Colorado University Thornton Research Grants Program; Montana State University,"We thank the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab for logistical considerations and two anonymous reviewers for providing insightful comments on the manuscript.

However, our understanding of the drought effect on soil respiration (R-s), which comprises the second largest carbon (C) flux of the global C cycle, remains limited. To explore the effects of reduced precipitation on Rs and its components, we conducted an experiment of throughfall rainfall exclusion during two consecutive growing seasons in a subtropical forest in the Southeast China. Following throughfall exclusion R-s declined rapidly, and did not recover until three to four months following rewetting, in both 2014 and 2015. During the experiment, throughfall exclusion significantly reduced autotrophic soil respiration (R-a); however, heterotrophic soil respiration (R-h) was unaffected, resulting in a reduced contribution (R-a/R-s) from 33 +/- 1% for the control to 16 +/- 3% under throughfall exclusion. Experimental drought significantly reduced soil microbial C and fine root biomass, and subsequent to rewetting, soil microbial C recovered quickly, but fine root biomass relapsed slowly. Our results suggested that prolonged drought decreases R-s through modifications in soil microbial activities and fine root metabolic capacity, which are induced by reduced soil water availability. Moreover, our results imply that drought-induced reductions in R-s originate primarily from R-a. Our results highlight the need to account for asymmetric responses to drought between R-a, and R-h when predicting the reaction of the ecosystem C balance in response to future drought events.","[Huang, Shide; Xu, Xia; Ruan, Honghua] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Coll Biol & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shide; Ye, Gongfu; Lin, Jie; Tan, Fanglin] Fujian Acad Forestry Sci, Fuzhou 350012, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shide; Ye, Gongfu; Lin, Jie; Chen, Kaituan] Wuyi Mt Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Wuyishan 354315, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kaituan] Adm Bur Wuyi Mt Natl Pk, Wuyishan 354315, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

The results showed that new C sequestered in the soil labile C pool was primarily (77%) from mycelium-derived C, while 60% of the root derived C sequestered in the soil was incorporated into the recalcitrant pool. Furthermore, although the total native SOC pool was not significantly influenced by new C derived from both roots and mycelia, mycelium derived C induced a remarkably greater negative priming effect (-12.0%) on the native labile C pool than did root-derived C (-5.8%); in contrast, mycelium-derived C induced a greater positive priming effect (13.8%) than root-derived C (7.1%) on the native recalcitrant C pool. Collectively, our findings suggest that mycelium-derived C make a greater contribution to the newly sequestered C in the soil labile C pool than root-derived C, thereby inducing a remarkably greater positive priming effect on the decomposition of native soil recalcitrant C. Therefore, mycelium-derived C inputs may play a dominant role in soil C dynamics and long-term C storage, at least in alpine forest ecosystems where ectomycorrhizal mutualisms dominate.","[Zhang, Ziliang; Yuan, Yuanshuang; Zhao, Chunzhang; Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ziliang; Yuan, Yuanshuang; Zhao, Chunzhang; Liu, Qing; Yin, Huajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat & Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichu, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ziliang; Yuan, Yuanshuang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Juan; Yin, Huajun] China West Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Nanchong 637000, Peoples R China","Liu, Q; Yin, HJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, 9 Sect 4,South Renmin Rd,POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liuqing@cib.ac.cn; yinhj@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFC0505200]; Frontier Science Key Research Programs of CAS [QYZDB-SSW-SMC023]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670449, 31570477, 31700387]; Sichuan Key R D Program [2017SZ0038]; Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation [2016JQ0037]","This study was supported jointly by the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0505200), Frontier Science Key Research Programs of CAS (QYZDB-SSW-SMC023), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31670449, 31570477 and 31700387), Sichuan Key R & D Program (2017SZ0038), and Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation (2016JQ0037).

Coarse roots, the skeleton of the root system, are of primary importance for soil exploration and plant anchorage and only recently have been recognized as playing a major role in ""long-term"" carbon sequestration. Despite this role, the 3D architecture of coarse roots represents a gap in knowledge on the biomass and carbon allocation within the root system and, consequently, below-ground carbon sequestration capacity. Using a semi-automatic 3D digitizing approach (3 Space Fastrak plus Long Ranger), the 3D distribution in the soil environment of coarse root biomass and C content and how these parameters were affected by manual and mechanical (trunk shaker) harvesting methods were quantified in a high-density olive orchard. The below-ground C content at stand level was estimated to be 11.93 Mg C ha(-1) and distributed at deeper soil layers (45-60 cm) in the form of first- and second-order branching roots. The present study also revealed that the mechanical harvesting method significantly increased both the angle of growth (0A degrees = vertically downwards) of first-order lateral roots and the stump biomass, but neither the biomass allocation nor the C content was increased within the first three branching orders.","[Sorgona, A.; Proto, A.

A significant source of model error stems from vegetation categorizations that are mostly taxonomical with no basis in plant hydraulic strategy and response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we compile hydraulic traits from 355 species around the world to determine trait covariations in order to represent hydraulic strategies. Simple and stepwise regression analyses demonstrate the interconnectedness of multiple vegetative hydraulic traits, specifically, traits defining hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to embolism with wood density and isohydricity. Drought sensitivity is strongly (Adjusted R-2 = 0.52, p < 0.02) predicted by a stepwise linear model combining rooting depth, wood density, and isohydricity. Drought tolerance increased with increasing wood density and anisohydric response, but with decreasing rooting depth. The unexpected response to rooting depth may be due to other tradeoffs within the hydraulic system. Rooting depth was able to be predicted from sapwood specific conductivity and the water potential at 50% loss of conductivity. Interestingly, the influences of biome or growth form do not increase the accuracy of the drought tolerance model and were able to be omitted. Multiple regression analysis revealed 3D trait spaces and tradeoff axes along which species' hydraulic strategies can be analyzed. These numerical trait spaces can reduce the necessary input to and parameterization of plant hydraulics modules, while increasing the physical representativeness of such simulations.","[Mursinna, A.

The living brush mattress shows favorable protective effects on riverbanks. However, there are few reports on the root structure and the soil strengthening benefit of the living brush mattress. The present work reports a series of experiments on root morphology and soil shear strength enhancement at the temporal and spatial scales. The object of the study is 24 living brush mattress trees constructed with Salix alba L. Tristis' (LBS hereafter). Traditional root morphology and mechanical measurement methods were used to collect the parameters. The results showed that the root systems of LBS had the characteristics of symmetry and upslope growth. The roots were mainly distributed in a cylindrical region of the soil (radius x thickness: 0.4 m x 0.5 m) and their biomass increased with different growth rates for the periods from 1 to 5 and from 5 to 7 years. Both age and slope position were factors that influence root growth. The root diameter falls within 0-5 mm, has a significant effect on the soil shear strength and provides a conical-shape potentiation zone to ensure the efficient protection of a riverbank. The results of this study demonstrate that LBS is an efficient and feasible engineering measure in the field of riverbank protection.","[Zhang, Dong; Cheng, Jinhua; Zhang, Hongjiang; Ma, Lan; Mei, Xuemei; Sun, Yihui] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ying] Hubei Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Ecol Restorat Rivers & Lakes & Alga, Wuhan 430068, Hubei, Peoples R China","Cheng, JH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",allianz_d@bjfu.edu.cn; jinhua_cheng@bjfu.edu.cn; liuy@hbut.edu.cn; zhanghj@bjfu.edu.cn; mlpcz@bjfu.edu.cn; mxm0115@bjfu.edu.cn; yihui_sun@bjfu.edu.cn,,,Beijing Municipal Science and Technology CommissionBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z151100001115001]; Chinese Natural Science Foundation Program [41501297],This research was funded by [the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission] grant number [Z151100001115001] and [the Chinese Natural Science Foundation Program] grant number [41501297].,,54,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,AUG,2018,9,8,,,,,,,493,10.3390/f9080493,,,19,Forestry,Forestry,GS1DA,WOS:000443254400052,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Metcalfe, DB; Rocha, W; Balch, JK; Brando, PM; Doughty, CE; Malhi, Y",,,,"Metcalfe, Daniel B.; Rocha, Wanderley; Balch, Jennifer K.; Brando, Paulo M.; Doughty, Christopher E.; Malhi, Yadvinder",,,Impacts of fire on sources of soil CO2 efflux in a dry Amazon rain forest,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Amazon tropical rain forest; burn experiment; carbon dioxide; climate change; fire; mycorrhizae; soil respiration partitioning,ECTOMYCORRHIZAL MYCELIAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT RESPIRATION; TROPICAL FORESTS; CARBON EMISSIONS; HARDWOOD FOREST; ORGANIC-MATTER; EASTERN AMAZON; CLOUD FORESTS; LAND-USE,"Fire at the dry southern margin of the Amazon rainforest could have major consequences for regional soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but relatively little information exists about impacts of fire on soil C cycling within this sensitive ecotone. We measured CO2 effluxes from different soil components (ground surface litter, roots, mycorrhizae, soil organic matter) at a large-scale burn experiment designed to simulate a severe but realistic potential future scenario for the region (Fire plot) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, over 1year, and compared these measurements to replicated data from a nearby, unmodified Control plot. After four burns over 5 years, soil CO2 efflux (R-s) was similar to 5.5 t C ha(-1) year(-1) lower on the Fire plot compared to the Control. Most of the Fire plot R-s reduction was specifically due to lower ground surface litter and root respiration. Mycorrhizal respiration on both plots was around similar to 20% of R-s. Soil surface temperature appeared to be more important than moisture as a driver of seasonal patterns in R-s at the site. Regular fire events decreased the seasonality of R-s at the study site, due to apparent differences in environmental sensitivities among biotic and abiotic soil components. These findings may contribute toward improved predictions of the amount and temporal pattern of C emissions across the large areas of tropical forest facing increasing fire disturbances associated with climate change and human activities.","[Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Rocha, Wanderley; Brando, Paulo M.] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, Canarana, Brazil; [Balch, Jennifer K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Brando, Paulo M.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA USA; [Doughty, Christopher E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England","Metcalfe, DB (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden.",dbmetcalfe@gmail.com,"Brando, Paulo M/C-4302-2012; Brando, Paulo/AAC-9396-2019","Brando, Paulo M/0000-0001-8952-7025; Brando, Paulo/0000-0001-8952-7025; Metcalfe, Daniel/0000-0001-8325-9269",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1656]; Jackson Foundation,"Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1656; Jackson Foundation",,79,4,4,14,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The effects of the process accompanying the transformations of organic matter into humic substances in the rhizosphere of ""common dandelion"" Taraxacum officinale have been determined, and the properties of humic acids (HAs) were described. The importance of iron and clay minerals for the formation of a stable and water-resistant soil structure has been emphasized. The laboratory analysis involved determination of basic physical and chemical soil properties: texture, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity, and content of total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and quality of humic substances: optical properties of HAs and its separation into hydrophilic (HIL) and hydrophobic (HOB) fractions, speciation of iron, glomalin operationally described as an easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP), and soil aggregate stability (SAS) of six size classes of soil aggregates. The Rs was reported with a higher TOC and DOC content (measured in the CaCl2 extracts), however not significantly. The HAs isolated from Rs revealed a significantly higher content of humic substances at its initial decomposition stage, as compared with nRs. A significantly higher concentration of EE-GRSP was noted in the aggregates of the rhizospheric zone (mean 1.14 g kg(-1)) than in the aggregates collected from root-free soil (mean 0.94 g kg(-1)). There was noted the highest mean share of 1-3 mm soil aggregates in Rs as well as in nRs, respectively 44.4 and 38.3%. The soil material both in Rs and in nRs contained high amounts of exchangeable Ca2+, and smectite is the predominant clay mineral. It was favorable for the accumulation of organic carbon and for the formation of good soil physical condition (tilth). Higher but insignificant SAS values were observed for Rs (mean SAS = 95.6%) than for nRs (mean SAS = 93.9%). The studies confirm the role of common dandelion roots in the process of organic carbon accumulation in rhizospheric zone and a favorable effect on the mechanism of the formation of water-resistant aggregates. Higher values of SAS for the Rs were affected by the content of TOC, DOC, exchangeable Ca2+ and the concentration of EE-GRSP, and, less considerably, the content of Fe and clay minerals.","[Kobierski, Miroslaw; Castejon, Jose Matias Penas] Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Bernardynska 6 St, PL-85029 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Kondratowicz-Maciejewska, Krystyna; Banach-Szott, Magdalena; Wojewodzki, Piotr] Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Dept Environm Chem, Bernardynska 6 St, PL-85029 Bydgoszcz, Poland","Kobierski, M (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Dept Soil Sci & Soil Protect, Bernardynska 6 St, PL-85029 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",kobierski@utp.edu.pl,,"PENAS CASTEJON, JOSE MATIAS/0000-0002-8358-9388; Wojewodzki, Piotr/0000-0002-7752-9311","NCN (National Science Centre), Poland [2716/B/P01/2011/40]","This study was co-financed by the NCN (National Science Centre), Poland, under research project no. 2716/B/P01/2011/40.",,88,2,2,2,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) disinfection process has been proved to be a feasible way to degrade antipyrine (ANT), which is the first synthetic pyrazolone pharmaceutical. In this work, the reaction kinetics, degradation pathways and genetic toxicity of PRP and AMP during ClO2 disinfection process were investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that the reaction of both PRP and AMP with ClO2 followed second-order kinetics, the second-order rate constants were calculated to be k(app)(PRP)= 11.0 M-1 s(-1) and k(app)(AMP)= 1.30 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) at neutral pH. Slightly alkaline environment (pH = 9) was in favor of the reaction. C=C double bond and C-N bond on pyrazolone ring were main active groups under ClO2 electrophilic attack. The degradation pathways of pyrazolone pharmaceuticals could be concluded as C=C cleavage, ring-opening reaction and de-carbonyl reaction. Pyrazolone contaminated water exhibited genetic toxicity according to micronucleus test of Viciafaba root tip, however, the toxicity could be reduced through ClO2 disinfection process.","[Jia, Xing-Hua; Feng, Li; Liu, Yong-Ze; Zhang, Li-Qiu] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing Key Lab Source Control Technol Water Poll, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Zhang, LQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangliqiu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51178046]; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [8152022],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51178046) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 8152022).,,36,3,3,4,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Context Fine root traits are poorly understood, impeding an accurate representation of terrestrial biogeochemical models. Traditionally used, arbitrary diameter thresholds lead to a misestimation of fine root traits such as branching order, environmental relationship, annual production, and turnover rate. Aims Here, we present, as modification of the traditional method, an integrated approach to segregate, at high-resolution, fine root populations of Fagus sylvatica into new diameter sub-classes that better correspond with the traits mentioned above. Methods Samples, collected with a sequential soil coring method, were subjected to a micrometric image analysis, and resultant data were treated with principal component and cluster analysis. Results Results showed that fine roots were distributed into diameter-size sub-classes (0-0.3 mm, 0.3-1 mm, and 1-2 mm) different from those determined by traditional methods (0-0.5 mm, 0.5-1 mm, and 1-2 mm). New sub-classes provided a better resolution of the corresponding branching-orders, and the values of annual production and turnover rate were more coherent with diameter class and soil depth. Moreover, new sub-classes provided a more precise match with soil temperature than traditional methods. Conclusion Our method may help to unveil fine root dynamics and development, reduce data analysis time, and make the diameter-based classification more precise and trustworthy even in the case of non-intact samples.","[Montagnoli, Antonio; Terzaghi, Mattia; Chiatante, Donato] Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci, Varese, Italy; [Giussani, Barbara] Univ Insubria, Dept Sci & High Technol, Como, Italy; [Scippa, Gabriella S.] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, Pesche, IS, Italy","Montagnoli, A (reprint author), Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci, Varese, Italy.",Antonio.montagnoli@uninsubria.it,"Montagnoli, Antonio/V-1724-2019; CHIATANTE, DONATO/B-8783-2015","CHIATANTE, DONATO/0000-0003-4854-5408; Montagnoli, Antonio/0000-0002-8921-0754; Terzaghi, Mattia/0000-0002-8803-7726",University of Insubria (FAR); EC FP7 Project [ZEPHYR-308313],This work was supported in part by the University of Insubria (FAR) and the EC FP7 Project ZEPHYR-308313.,,75,1,1,5,13,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

We determined the degree to which the soil abiotic and biotic properties, such as PLFAs and extracellular enzyme activities, were controlled by understory vegetation. We established a paired treatment in a subtropical Chinese fir plantation, which comprised one plot from which the understory vegetation and litter were removed (None) and another from which the litter was removed but the understory vegetation was left intact (Understory). We evaluated how the understory vegetation influenced the soil abiotic properties, the bacterial, fungal, and actinobacterial PLFAs, and the activities of five hydrolases and two oxidative enzymes. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon, soil organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen contents and soil moisture were 18 %, 25 %, 12 %, 34 %, 8 %, and 4% lower in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments, respectively (P < 0.05). Soil bacterial, fungal, and total PLFAs, and the potential activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase, were as much as 24% lower in None treatments than in Understory treatments (P < 0.05). The specific activities of C-acquiring enzymes were as much as 41% higher (P < 0.05), and the ratio of C- to N-acquiring enzymes was also higher in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments. This suggests that in the absence of understory vegetation microbes invested more in C acquisition than N acquisition because the carbon (C) inputs were less labile. The negative relationship between DOC and AP shows that DOC is consumed when P-acquiring enzymes are produced. The positive correlation between NH4+-N and beta G suggested the increased availability of N promoted the decomposition of C. More extracellular enzymes that degrade soil organic matter are produced when there is understory vegetation, which leads to losses of soil C. On the other hand, the soil C sink is maintained by increased inputs of C. We can therefore conclude that understory vegetation contributes to C sequestration in Chinese fir forests and suggest that understory should be maintained to sustain soil quality in subtropical Chinese fir plantations.","[Yang, Yang; Wang, Jifu] Harbin Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Harbin 150025, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang; Zhang, Xinyu; Wang, Huimin; Fu, Xiaoli; Sun, Xiaomin; Wen, Xuefa] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang; Zhang, Xinyu; Wang, Huimin; Fu, Xiaoli; Sun, Xiaomin; Wen, Xuefa] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chuang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Key Lab Agr Water Resources, 286 Huaizhong Rd, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Fusheng; Wan, Songze] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Wang, JF (reprint author), Harbin Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Harbin 150025, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.; Zhang, X (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Zhang, X (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangxy@igsnrr.ac.cn; 13946004918@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41571251, 41571130043]",This work was jointly financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41571251 and 41571130043).,,55,1,2,8,30,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,24-Jul,2018,15,14,,,,,4481,4494,,10.5194/bg-15-4481-2018,,,14,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,GO0BH,WOS:000439584700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Marden, M; Lambie, S; Rowan, D",,,,"Marden, M.; Lambie, S.; Rowan, D.",,,Root system attributes of 12 juvenile indigenous early colonising shrub and tree species with potential for mitigating erosion in New Zealand,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Root system metrics and architecture; Juvenile seral indigenous species; Erosion mitigation potential,NORTH-ISLAND; CARBON STOCKS; RAINFALL; INTERCEPTION; BIOMASS; TERRAIN; FORESTS; TAITA; REINFORCEMENT; EQUATIONS,"Background: Restoring erosion-prone land with indigenous species, whether by managed reforestation (planting) or by passive natural reversion, is reliant on knowing which species mix is likely to provide the quickest and most effective mitigation against shallow landslides. In turn, this requires knowledge of differences in growth metrics among plant species, particularly during their formative years. This study presents data on the root development and architecture of 12 of New Zealand's commonest early colonising indigenous shrub and tree species. These data are crucial to the development of guidelines and policy for land use conversion and future land management options where unmitigated erosion is of increasing concern. Methods: In a plot-based field trial, the growth performance of Coprosma robusta (karamu), Plagianthus regius (ribbonwood), Sophora tetraptera (kowhai), Pittosporum eugenioides (lemonwood), Pittosporum tenuifolium (kohuhu), Hoheria populnea (lacebark), Myrsine australis (mapou), Pseudopanax arboreus (fivefinger), Cordyline australis (cabbage tree), Knightia excelsa (rewarewa), Leptospermum scoparium (manuka), and Coriaria arborea (tutu) was measured annually over five consecutive years. Results: Eleven species developed a heart-shaped root system and Cordyline australis, a tap-rooted system. By year 5, the root/shoot ratio ranged between 0.24 and 0.44, > 99.5% of the total root mass and root length of all species was confined to within 0.5 m of the ground surface and > 73% within 1 radial metre of the root bole. Regressions between root collar diameter (RCD over bark) and root length were highly significant (P < 0.001) (r(2) values 0.55-0.92), as were regressions for root biomass (r(2) values 0.31-0.97). RCD fitted best for below-ground biomass (r(2) values 0.67-0.94). Conclusions: The species with the greatest potential for mitigating shallow forms of erosion were Pittosporum eugenioides, Plagianthus regius, Coriaria arborea, Pittosporum tenuifolium, Hoheria populnea, Sophora tetraptera, and Cordyline australis. New data on differences in root metrics between species have improved our understanding of their strengths and limitations, alone or as mixed plantings, and of the time (years after planting) and density of plantings required to achieve a successful erosion control outcome. Modelling root-soil reinforcement and the role of root systems in mitigating the initiation of shallow slope failures should include roots > 1 mm in diameter.","[Marden, M.] Landcare Res, Gisborne, New Zealand; [Lambie, S.] Landcare Res, Private Bag 3127, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Marden, M (reprint author), Landcare Res, Gisborne, New Zealand.",mardenm@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,"Tairawhiti Polytechnic Rural Studies Unit, Gisborne; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); Specific Science Investment Fund (SSIF); 'Growing Confidence in Forestry's Future' research programme [CO4X1306]; 'Clean Water Productive Land' research programme [C10X1006]","We acknowledge the support of the Tairawhiti Polytechnic Rural Studies Unit, Gisborne, on whose land the riparian plant trial was located.

Sixteen morphotypes of mycorrhizal fungi were located in three genera: Glomus, Acaulospora and Entrophospora, the first one was considered the most important because it had the highest number of morphotypes and was present in the different soils evaluated. A low mycorrhization of the analyzed roots was found (20 and 27%) and the presence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal association in all the species studied.

Our aim was to study the AMF community in layers from 0 to 800 cm deep, comparing pure and mixed E. grandis and A. mangium plantations. We investigated whether AMF are able to colonize roots and produce spores down to 800 cm of depth, and whether intercropping of A. mangium increases AMF abundance and diversity in E. grandis plantations at the surface and subsurface layers of soil. AMF spore abundance and identification were evaluated morphologically, while the quantification of root colonization following the methodology of root clarification, dyeing and determination of the percentage of root length colonized by AMF. Total root DNA was extracted, and specific PCR was applied, which resulted in clones of the 18S rRNA small-subunit (SSU) gene region of AMF. Results show that AMF spores and some root colonization were present even in the deepest soil layers. Spore evaluation identified 16 species across six AMF genera (Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Intraomatospora, Scutellospora and Racocetra). The genus Glomus was the most abundant and found in all treatments and depths. E. grandis in the mixed plantation with A. mangium presented a significant increase in root colonization in the 0-20 and 20-50 cm layers, indicating a possible stimulation at superficial soil layers of the symbiosis in E. grandis roots when in consortium. Amplification of the 18S region of AMF revealed specific predominant groups at each soil depth. We found that the deep layers, although presenting comparatively low root colonization, still harbour a considerable range of AMF.","[de Araujo Pereira, Arthur Prudencio; Santana, Maiele Cintra; Mescolotti, Denise de Lourdes; Nogueira Cardoso, Elke Jurandy Bran] Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Bonfim, Joice Andrade] Bahia Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol, Campus Urucuca, Salvador, Ba, Brazil","Pereira, APD (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",arthur.prudencio@usp.br,"de Araujo Pereira, Arthur APAP Prudencio/H-2275-2018; de Araujo Pereira, Arthur Prudencio/Y-4251-2019","de Araujo Pereira, Arthur APAP Prudencio/0000-0001-9402-3243; de Araujo Pereira, Arthur Prudencio/0000-0001-9402-3243","FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [10/16623-9, 12279-0]; CNPq (National Council of Technological and Scientific Development)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [476122]","We thank FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation, project no. 10/16623-9 and 12279-0) and CNPq (National Council of Technological and Scientific Development, project No. 476122) for financial support.

We sampled fine (diameter < 2mm) roots using the soil core method to quantify fine-root biomass and architectural and morphological traits to determine root exploitation strategies in an old growth forest and in a 54-yr-old logged-over forest influenced by similar parent material and climate. Seven root traits were considered: four associated with resource exploitation potential or an extensive' strategy (fine-root biomass, length, surface area, and volume), and three traits which reflect exploitation efficiency or an intensive' strategy (specific root area, specific root length, and root tissue density). We found that total fine-root biomass, length, surface area, volume, and fine-root tissue density were higher in the logged-over forest, whereas the old growth forest had higher total specific root length and specific root surface area than the logged-over forest. The results suggest different root exploitation strategies between the forests. Plants in the old growth forest invest root biomass more efficiently to maximize soil volume explored, whereas plants in the logged-over forest increase the spatial distribution of roots resulting in the expansion of the rhizosphere.","[Addo-Danso, Shalom D.; Prescott, Cindy E.; Guy, Robert D.; Marshall, Peter L.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Addo-Danso, Shalom D.; Adu-Bredu, Stephen; Duah-Gyamfi, Akwasi; Owusu-Afriyie, Kennedy] KNUST, CSIR, Forestry Res Inst Ghana, POB 63, Kumasi, Ghana; [Duah-Gyamfi, Akwasi] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Moore, Sam; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks, Oxford OX 3QY, England; [Forrester, David I.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zucherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Addo-Danso, SD (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Addo-Danso, SD (reprint author), KNUST, CSIR, Forestry Res Inst Ghana, POB 63, Kumasi, Ghana.",sadanso@csir-forig.org.gh,"Addo-Danso, Shalom D./Q-9520-2019; Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013","Addo-Danso, Shalom D./0000-0001-5074-1673; ","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of UKNERC Natural Environment Research Council; University of British Columbia Doctoral Fellowship; Peter Rennie Memorial Award; Mary and David Macaree Fellowship (Faculty of Forestry, University of British Columbia); International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, SwedenInternational Foundation for Science; NSERC grantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of UK, a University of British Columbia Doctoral Fellowship, a Peter Rennie Memorial Award, Mary and David Macaree Fellowship (Faculty of Forestry, University of British Columbia), and the International Foundation for Science, Stockholm, Sweden, through a grant to Shalom D.

Host-symbiont compatibility and some degree of host specificity are prerequisites for these processes to occur, and these prerequisites may vary with host abundance. However, direct assessments of whether specificity of root-associated fungi varies with host abundance are lacking. Here, in a diverse tropical forest in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we couple DNA metabarcoding with a sampling design that controls for host phylogeny, host age, and habitat variation, to characterize fungal communities associated with the roots of three confamilial pairs of host species that exhibit contrasting (high and low) relative abundances. We uncovered a functionally and phylogenetically diverse fungal community composed of 1,038 OTUs (operational taxonomic units with 97% genetic similarity), only 14 of which exhibited host specificity. Host species was a significant predictor of fungal community composition only for the subset of OTUs composed of putatively pathogenic fungi. We found no significant difference in the number of specialists associating with common versus rare trees, but we found that host abundance was negatively correlated with the diversity of root fungal communities. This latter result was significant for symbiotrophs (mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and, to a lesser extent, for pathotrophs (mostly plant pathogens). Thus, root fungal communities differ between common and rare trees, which may impact the strength of conspecific negative density dependence. Further studies from other tropical sites and host lineages are warranted, given the role of root-associated fungi in biodiversity maintenance. RESUMEN Las interacciones entre plantas y hongos asociados a las raices pueden afectar el ensamblaje, la diversidad y la abundancia relativa de plantas tropicales. La compatibilidad entre el hospedero y el hongo, asi como el grado de elspecificidad para el hospedero son prerrequisitos para que estos procesos ocurran, y tales requisitos pueden variar con la abundancia del hospedero. Sin embargo, se requiere evaluar directamente si la especificidad de los hongos asociados a la raiz varia con la abundancia del hospedero. En este estudio combinamos metacodigo de barras con un diseno de muestreo que controla la filogenia, edad del hospedero y la heterogeniedad del habitat para caracterizar las comunidades fungicas asociadas a las raices de tres pares confamiliares de especies hospederas de abundancia relativa contrastante (comunues y raras) en un bosque tropical diverso (Los Tuxtlas, Mexico). Descubrimos una comunidad fungica funcional y filogeneticamente diversa, compuesta por 1,038 UTO (unidades taxonomicas operativas con 97% de similitud genetica), de las cuales solo 14 presentaron especificidad. La especie del hospedero fue un buen predictor de la composicion de la comunidad fungica para el subconjunto de UTOs de hongos presuntamente patogenicos. No encontramos diferencias significativas en el numero de hongos especialistas asociados con los arboles comunes vs. raros, pero encontramos que la abundancia del hospedero se correlaciona negativamente con la diversidad de las comunidades de hongos radiculares. Este ultimo resultado fue significativo para los simbiotrofos (principalmente hongos micorrizicos arbusculares), y en menor medida para los patotrofos (principalmente patogenos de plantas). Por lo tanto, las comunidades de estos hongos difieren entre arboles comunes y raros, lo que puede afectar la fuerza del efecto coespecifico densodependiente negativo. Se requiere de estudios que consideren mas linajes de hospederos, dado el papel que juegan los hongos asociados a las raices en el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad tropical.","[Schroeder, John W.; Martin, Jessica T.; Barbosa, Jomar M.; Perea, Ramon; Arias-Del Razo, Itzel; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther; Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 385 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Angulo, Diego F.] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol Evolut, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Angulo, Diego F.] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Ecol Trop, Campus Ciencias Biol & Agr,Apartado Postal 4-116, Merida 97000, Yucatan, Mexico; [Barbosa, Jomar M.; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Avda Univ S-N, Alicante, Spain; [Perea, Ramon] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Sistemas & Recursos Nat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid, Spain; [Arias-Del Razo, Itzel] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Tlaxcala Biol Conducta, Carretera Tlaxcala Puebla Km 1-5 S-N, Tlaxcala 90062, Tlaxcala, Mexico","Schroeder, JW (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 385 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jwschro@stanford.edu,"Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/J-7883-2012; Angulo, Diego/B-3152-2015","Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845; Angulo, Diego/0000-0002-5678-4946",Stanford Global Studies Division at Stanford University; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/02819-7]; Juan de la Cierva program; Marie Curie Fellowship from the European Union [FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IOF-627450]; Simons Foundation [429440],"We gratefully acknowledge the Stanford Global Studies Division at Stanford University for support of field expedition costs under a CLAS grant to RD.
