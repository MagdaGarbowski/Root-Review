Mechanical scarification often speeds up the growth of embryo axes, increases the percentage of germinating seeds and seedling emergence. Cutting off the distal ends of cotyledons is a mechanical scarification technique sometimes used in the container production of oak seedlings. However the consequences of this procedure for seedling development are little known. We wanted to determine these effects on development and metabolic changes of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) seedlings. The majority of seedlings from acorns with cut cotyledons emerged two weeks earlier, more simultaneously and their total emergence (due to rejecting spoiled acorns) was ca. 20% higher. The main result is that the strong damage to cotyledons (more than one fifth of acorn mass) caused a decrease of seedling height and mass even after the second growing season. Negative consequences on seedling root/shoot ratio or on their metabolism were not observed. We conclude that this method is useful for seedling production in containers when acorn mass is reduced by one fifth.","[Giertych, Marian J.; Suszka, Jan] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Giertych, Marian J.] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, PL-65516 Zielona Gora, Poland","Giertych, MJ (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",giertych@man.poznan.pl,,"Giertych, Marian/0000-0001-5578-9545",Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences,"We gratefully thank Ms. Alicja Bukowska, Ms. Ewa Maderek and Ms. Anna Nowak for their help with the chemical analysis.

Eighty-two permanent 1-m(2) chart quadrats that were established as early as 1912 were remeasured in 2007. We reconstructed historical forest structure using dendrochronological techniques. Ponderosa pine basal area increased from an average of 4 m(2)/ha in the early 1900s to 29 m(2)/ha in 2007. Understory plant foliar cover declined by 21%, species richness declined by two species per square meter, and functional diversity also declined. The relative cover of C(4) graminoids decreased by 18% and C(3) graminoids increased by 19%. Herbaceous plant species with low leaf and fine root nitrogen concentrations, low specific leaf area, high leaf dry matter content, large seed mass, low specific root length, short maximum height, and early flowering date increased in relative abundance in sites where pine basal area increased the most. Overall, we observed a long-term shift in composition toward more conservative shade-and stress-tolerant herbaceous species.

We sampled EM and fine roots of pine each month for 6 years (May 2003 to June 2009) in a 40-50-year-old Pinus densiflora forest in Japan. Tree ring width of host pines in the plot was measured to assess the chronological sequence of annual tree growth. EM biomass was not stable during the 6 years of monitoring and seasonal patterns were indistinct. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that the autumn precipitation in the previous year was the most determinative factor of EM biomass in the current year, with a negative correlation. In contrast, tree ring width generally showed a stable annual growth pattern throughout the monitoring period.

In a subtropical moist evergreen broad-leaved forest of southwest China, we examined changes of LOC and its potential turnover time, microbial biomass C (MBC), and soil microbial activity of the organic and the 0-10 cm mineral soil layers with aboveground plant litter and belowground root treatments. In February of 2004, removal of organic layer, root-trenching, and tree-girdling treatments were applied alone and in combination to manipulate plant-C inputs. In 2006, root-trenching and tree-girdling treatments did not significantly change LOC in the organic layer. In the 0-10 cm mineral soil layer, LOC increased substantially due to tree-girdling treatment, especially in the plots of tree-girdling and the combinations of three treatments, but this increase was absent in 2007. Soil MBC in these two layers generally did not change markedly after plant-C inputs manipulations except significant increase under tree-girdling treatment in 2006. The potential turnover times of LOC increased in all plots with the plant-C inputs manipulations. The lack of influence of plant-C inputs manipulations on LOC pools is likely due to high total soil organic C here, while insignificant changes of MBC suggest the soil microbes are not C limited in this forest. The changes of the potential turnover time of LOC imply that the sources of LOC have been shifted from fresh plant litter or root exudates to old soil organic C. Our results suggest that LOC recently derived from plants is preferred by microbes when available, but microbes can also use LOC from soil organic matter when fresh plant C is not available.","[Feng, Wenting; Schaefer, Douglas A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zou, Xiaoming] Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Trop Ecosyst Studies, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Zhang, Min] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Tea Sci, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Feng, Wenting] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Feng, WT (reprint author), Univ Penn, 240 S 33rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",fengwen@sas.upenn.edu,"Feng, Wenting/D-9822-2016","Feng, Wenting/0000-0002-3189-3687; Zou, Xiaoming/0000-0001-9023-3067",Natural Science Foundation of YunnanNatural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2005C0056M]; Wang K.

To this end, we investigated the effects of soil moisture on annual and seasonal fine root production and mortality over 4 years in a mature balsam fir (Abies balsamea L. Mill.) stand using a minirhizotron and soil coring. Droughting and irrigating treatments were imposed for 17 weeks during the third year of the study, and post-treatment recovery was measured during the fourth year. Monthly fine root production was often reduced by low soil water content (SWC) during July-September in the pre-treatment years and by imposed drought. Irrigation resulted in higher summer fine root production than in pre-treatment years. In the recovery year, increased fine root production was observed in the previously droughted plots despite low SWC in August and September. Droughting decreased year-end fine root biomass in the treatment year, but biomass returned to pre-treatment levels during the recovery year. Droughting and irrigating did not affect foliage production during the treatment and recovery years. Our results suggest that for balsam fir, establishment and maintenance of a functional balance between foliage and fine root biomass, with respect to moisture supply and demand, can depend on fine root dynamics occurring over more than one growing season. In addition, our findings provided insights into tree growth responses to interannual variation in moisture supply.","[Olesinski, Jakub; Krasowski, Marek J.] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Lavigne, Michael B.] Atlantic Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Olesinski, J (reprint author), Univ New Brunswick, Fac Forestry & Environm Management, POB 4400,28 Dineen Dr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",j.olesinski@unb.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,M.K. was supported by the Discovery Grant Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,20,18,21,0,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2011,31,3,,,,,339,348,,10.1093/treephys/tpr006,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,753VL,WOS:000289807700011,21489968,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Heath, KD; Lau, JA",,,,"Heath, Katy D.; Lau, Jennifer A.",,,Herbivores alter the fitness benefits of a plant-rhizobium mutualism,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Diffuse interaction; Ecological cost; Indirect effect; Medicago truncatula; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Tri-trophic,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; INSECT HERBIVORES; JASMONIC ACID; EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; NITROGEN-FIXATION; NATIVE PLANT; SELECTION; LEGUME; GROWTH,"Mutualisms are best understood from a community perspective, since third-party species have the potential to shift the costs and benefits in interspecific interactions.

We found that plants in our experiment formed more associations with rhizobia (root nodules) in the presence of herbivores, thereby increasing the fitness benefits of mutualism for rhizobia. In contrast, the effects of rhizobia on herbivores were weak.

Therefore, plants from any given population can be expected to experience strong differences in belowground biotic interactions. Although it is well recognized that the soil biota plays a significant role in the structure and dynamics of plant communities, plastic responses in growth strategies as a function of soil biotic interactions have received little attention. In this study, we question whether the biotic soil context from two forest associated contrasting environments (the forest understory and the hedgerows) determines the balance between clonal growth and flowering of the perennial Stachys sylvatica. Using artificial soils, we compared the growth responses of this species following inoculation with the mycorrhizal and microbial community extracted either from rhizospheric soil of the forest understory or from the hedgerows. The microbial context had a strong effect on plant functional traits, determining the production of runners and inflorescences. Plants inoculated with the hedgerow community had a greater biomass, larger number of runners, and lower resource investment in flower production than was seen in plants inoculated with the understory microbial community. The obtained results illustrate that belowground biotic interactions are essential to understand basic plastic growth responses determinant for plant establishment and survival. The interactions with microbial communities from two contrasting habitats resulted in two different, and presumably adaptive, growth strategies that were optimal for the conditions prevalent in the environments compared; and they are as such an essential factor to understand plant plant, plant animal interactions and the dispersal capacities of clonal plants.

Soil coring and root ingrowth cores were used to assess belowground biomass (BGB) and productivity in grazed and ungrazed (grazing exclosures) plots in two mountain grasslands. Annual belowground production ranged from 472 to 590 gm(-2), representing from 14 to 22% of the maximum root biomass measured over the year. Spring was the most productive season, accounting for more than 50% of total annual production, indicating that factors besides temperature may affect seasonal root dynamics. Although belowground production was much higher in the top 5 cm compared to deeper, the relative productivity rate (production-to-BGB ratio) and renewal time was higher at the subsurface (5-15 cm) layer. The contribution of the subsurface layer to total belowground production increased in spring, possibly due to occasional freezing events at the uppermost layer in the early growing season. The stronger seasonality in subsurface relative productivity rates may reflect depth-dependent changes in root characteristics and lifespan. Excluding grazing increased belowground productivity in summer, but its effects on BGB showed great variability between sites.","[Garcia-Pausas, Jordi; Casals, Pere; Vallecillo, Sara; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] CTFC, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain; [Romanya, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Prod Nat Biol Vegetal & Edafol, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Univ Lleida, Escola Tecn Super Engn Agr, Lleida 25198, Catalonia, Spain","Garcia-Pausas, J (reprint author), CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys Km 2, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain.",jordi.garcia@ctfc.cat,"Casals, Pere/M-2418-2014; Garcia-Pausas, Jordi/L-2984-2014; Romanya, Joan/K-7714-2014; Sebastia, M.

One major question is which is better for shore stabilization: the reed community (a single-species community) or 4Sb, 8Sb. 4Ta and 8Ta (mixed-species communities)? The soil stability index (K) and root length density (RLD) were selected as indicators for evaluating soil stability in response to water erosion. There are two main types of shore facing downward erosion and erosion scarp retreat along the southern coast of Chongming Island, and the erosion period may occur from March to August (scenario 1) or October to December (scenario 2). The assumed erosion period is scenario 1, and 4Sb is the most suitable plant community for preventing erosion scarp failure and mitigating shoreline retreat because it has the greatest K and RLD in the 20-50-cm deep soil layer among all of the vegetation communities within all intertidal zones. Additionally, 4Sb and 8Ta provide the best protection for reducing downward beach face erosion compared to the other vegetation types in the lower intertidal zone (LIT). At the middle intertidal zone (MIT) and higher intertidal zone (HIT), the reed community is optimal for protecting the shore face because it has the greatest K and RLD at 0-20-cm soil among the five vegetation communities in March-April and July-August within the MIT and HIT. Under scenario 2,4Sb is still the most suitable type for reinforcing the scarp and preventing shoreline retreat.

The central question in this study is whether an ecohydrological model which assumes that rooting strategies reflect maximization of transpiration can predict the variations in rooting strategies of plants in dry environments. Location Arid ecosystems across the globe. Methods A model was used to explore interactions between plant biomass, root-shoot allocation, root distribution, rainfall, soil type and water use by plants. Results Model analyses showed that the predicted shifts in rooting depth and root-shoot allocation due to changes in rainfall, soil type and plant biomass were quite similar to observed shifts. The model predicted that soil type, annual rainfall and plant biomass each had strong effects on the rooting strategies that optimize transpiration, but also that these factors have strong interactive effects. The process by which plants compete for water availability (soil evaporation or drainage) especially affected the depth distribution of roots in the soil, whereas the availability of rainfall mainly affected the optimal root-shoot allocation strategy. Main conclusions The empirically observed key patterns in rooting characteristics of herbaceous plant species in arid environments could be explained in this theoretical study by using the concept of hydrological optimality, represented here by the maximization of transpiration.","Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","van Wijk, MT (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",mark.vanwijk@wur.nl,,"van Wijk, Mark/0000-0003-0728-8839",,,,57,19,19,7,71,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1466-822X,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Although these species have evolved independently in many plant families, such events have occurred most often in the Orchidaceae, resulting in the highest concentration of these species in the tracheophytes. Studies of mycoheterotrophic species' mycobionts have generally revealed extreme levels of mycorrhizal specialization, suggesting that this system is ideal for studying the evolution of mycorrhizal associations. However, these studies have often investigated single or few, often unrelated, species without consideration of their phylogenetic relationships. Herein, we present the first investigation of the mycorrhizal associates of all species of a well-characterized orchid genus comprised exclusively of mycoheterotrophic species. With the employment of molecular phylogenetic methods, we identify the fungal associates of each of nine Hexalectris species from 134 individuals and 42 populations. We report that Hexalectris warnockii associates exclusively with members of the Thelephoraceae, H. brevicaulis and H. grandiflora associate with members of the Russulaceae and Sebacinaceae subgroup A, while each member of the H. spicata species complex associates primarily with unique sets of Sebacinaceae subgroup A clades. These results are consistent with other studies of mycorrhizal specificity within mycoheterotrophic plants in that they suggest strong selection within divergent lineages for unique associations with narrow clades of mycorrhizal fungi. Our results also suggest that mycorrhizal associations are a rapidly evolving characteristic in the H. spicata complex.","[Kennedy, Aaron H.; Watson, Linda E.] Miami Univ, Dept Bot, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Taylor, D.

We evaluated the ""linear"" and ""asymptotic"" models by measuring diversity and annual net primary productivity (NPP) within four states of a southern Wisconsin floodplain: a remnant (unplowed) wet prairie, two degraded sites (soybean field and invaded prairie), and a restored prairie. Neither model fit our data for aboveground (ANPP), belowground (BNPP), or total (TNPP) productivity. ANPP declined as species richness increased (r = 0.998, df = 2), with highest values for soybeans (1,024 g/m2; two species in 30 0.25-m2 plots) and invaded prairie (937 g/m2; nine species, 99% cover of Phalaris arundinacea), intermediate for restored prairie (712 g/m2; 28 species), and lowest for diverse remnant prairie (571 g/m2; 36 species). In contrast, BNPP was lowest for soybeans (225 g/m2) and highest for remnant prairie (571 g/m2). TNPP in restored prairie (990 g/m2) matched that of the remnant (1,147 g/m2) within 7 years, but root:shoot NPP ratios were quite different (0.39 and 0.99, respectively). Overall, results suggest that the relationship between species diversity and productivity can differ with the component measured (ANPP, BNPP, or TNPP) and that diversity does not ensure high productivity. Because measuring ANPP does not fully test ecosystem-function theory, we recommend assessing BNPP and additional ecosystem processes in future attempts to determine whether adding species will restore more function to degraded ecosystems.","[Zedler, Joy B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot & Arboretum, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Jelinski, Nicolas A.; Kucharik, Christopher J.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53726 USA","Zedler, JB (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot & Arboretum, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jbzedler@wisc.edu,,"Kucharik, Christopher/0000-0002-0400-758X",Madison Gas and Electric Corp.; University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum; Roy F.

Since fungi predominate in unfertilized soils with acidic pH and have filamentous hyphae, we hypothesized that changes caused by overwintering cattle outdoors (trampling, excreta returns, and changes in soil chemistry) will lead to suppressed species richness, lower biomass, and alter the structure of fungal communities. The research was conducted on an upland pasture used more than 10 years for cattle overwintering. Both culture-dependent and -independent methods were used for the determination of either fungal species composition (cultivation: DGGE) or biomass (numbers of CFU; concentration of fungal PLEA marker 18:2 omega 6,9). Soils under three different levels of cattle disturbance (S - severe, M - moderate, C - no disturbance/control) were investigated during three subsequent years. In addition, the DGGE analysis of soils was completed by comparison with analysis of fresh cattle excrements (Ex). The composition of fungal communities showed significantly higher richness and a substantial shift in species composition in cattle-disturbed soils (S, M) in comparison to the non-disturbed soil (C). The number of separated DGGE bands was significantly higher in S (30.67 +/- 1.63; mean +/- SD) and M (25.50 +/- 1.64) soils than in the C soil (19.33 +/- 1.75). Sequencing of typical bands revealed common fungal genera - Alternaria, Penicillium, Fusarium, Rhizopus, Isaria, and Metarhizium. Profiles of the S soil were enriched by bands of rumen-born anaerobic fungi (Neocallimastix, Cyllamyces) occurring mainly in profiles of excrements, where relatively low band richness (14.33 +/- 1.15) was observed. The increasing level of cattle disturbance induced an increase in the biomass of complex fungal community over the three-year experimental period from 3.39 +/- 2.11 (mean +/- SD) nmol of fungal PLFA per gram of the C soil to 5.87 +/- 3.16 in the M soil and 9.21 +/- 4.69 in the S soil. Concentrations of soil N-tot and C-org were evaluated as the parameters significantly correlating with biomass as well as composition of the fungal community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

NSC contents in needles, branches, stems, and coarse roots were measured throughout an entire growing season. At the tissue level, NSC contents were not significantly more abundant in treeline trees when compared to trees at lower elevations. Along our 425-m elevational transect from the closed forest to the treeline, we failed to find a stable elevational trend in the total NSC pool of entire trees and observed within season increases in the tree's NSC pool that can be attributed to an altitudinal increase in leaf mass as needles contained the largest NSC fraction of the whole tree NSC pool. Furthermore, whole tree NSC contents were positively correlated with net photosynthetic capacity. Although our observed NSC characteristics do not support the hypothesis that treelife at their upper elevational limit is determined by an insufficient carbon balance, we found no consistent confirmation for the sink limitation hypothesis.","[Wieser, G.] Fed Res & Trainings Ctr Forests Nat Hazards & Lan, Dept Alpine Timberline Ecophysiol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Gruber, A.; Pirkebner, D.; Oberhuber, W.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Bot, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Wieser, G (reprint author), Fed Res & Trainings Ctr Forests Nat Hazards & Lan, Dept Alpine Timberline Ecophysiol, Rennweg 1, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Gerhard.Wieser@uibk.ac.at,,", Walter/0000-0002-5197-7044",University of Innsbruck [BIO12]; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [FWF P18819-B03],"This work was supported by the University of Innsbruck (Junior Scientist Program 2006/07, BIO12) and the Austrian Science Fund (Project No. FWF P18819-B03 ""Temperature dependence of Pinus cembra (L.) stem growth and respiration along an altitudinal transect''.",,44,16,19,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,1612-4677,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

Cattle grazing (ungrazed or intensely grazed once), plant species origin (native or exotic), and species richness (4-species mixture or monoculture) treatments were fully crossed and randomly assigned to plots of grassland plants. We tested whether (1) native and exotic plots exhibited different responses to grazing for six ecosystem functions (i.e., aboveground productivity, light interception, fine root biomass, tracer nitrogen uptake, biomass consumption, and aboveground biomass recovery), and (2) biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships depended on grazing or species origin. We found that native and exotic species exhibited different responses to grazing for three of the ecosystem functions we considered. Intense grazing decreased fine root biomass by 53% in exotic plots, but had no effect on fine root biomass in native plots. The proportion of standing biomass consumed by cattle was 16% less in exotic than in native grazed plots. Aboveground biomass recovery was 30% less in native than in exotic plots. Intense grazing decreased aboveground productivity by 25%, light interception by 14%, and tracer nitrogen uptake by 54%, and these effects were similar in native and exotic plots. Increasing species richness from one to four species increased aboveground productivity by 42%, and light interception by 44%, in both ungrazed and intensely grazed native plots. In contrast, increasing species richness did not influence biomass production or resource uptake in ungrazed or intensely grazed exotic plots. These results suggest that converting native grasslands to exotic grasslands or pastures changes ecosystem structure and processes, and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.","[Isbell, Forest I.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Isbell, Forest I.; Wilsey, Brian J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Isbell, FI (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",forest.isbell@mail.mcgill.ca; bwilsey@iastate.edu,"Isbell, Forest/C-6915-2012","Isbell, Forest/0000-0001-9689-769X; Wilsey, Brian J./0000-0002-0628-5006",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0639417]; Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture,"We thank Dan Isbell, Steve Goepferd, Leah Isbell, Kathryn Yurkonis, Joe Reynolds, Chris Johnson, Cedar Johnson, Kim Isbell, Joni Richmond, Robert Handler, Leanne Martin, Adam Heathcote, Wayne Roush, and Don Hummel for help with field work.

As it restrains the sprouting of woody species, land recuperation was performed using a mixed plantation of native and Eucalyptus species to both preservation and to supply the demand for wood. In order to evaluate the recuperation, a study of microbial communities was proposed. In addition to the highest soil phosphorus content found in the Carrasco area, the greatest spore density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities occurred in the rhizosphere of the both pioneer species: Carrasco and Eucalyptus. In contrast to the DGGE bacteria profile, it was possible to group AMF species of the preserved and experimental sites which were not clustered with Carrasco species through the DGGE of Glomales DNA and also by the principal component analysis (PCA) based on diversity index. Glomus and Acaulospora were the dominant genera at both the preserved site and Carrasco. Nevertheless, Gigaspora species were preferentially found in Dry Forest, while Scutellospora were absent. In contrast, Carrasco favoured the genus Scutellospora and the species Acaulospora scrobiculata. Our results allow one to conclude that vegetation type modifies the AMF communities, which may be used as good indicator of soil quality. Based on AMF communities as soil quality indicator, the mixed forest plantation appears to be underway towards the preserved site two years after transplantation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The different kinetics of early in vivo physiological and cytogenetic responses to Cd might be relevant to the characterization of its toxicity mechanisms in disrupting primarily the mitosis process.","[Souguir, D.; Ledoigt, G.; Goupil, Pascale] Univ Blaise Pascal Clermont II, Lab Physiol & Genet Vegetales, UMR PIAF UBP INRA 547, F-63177 Aubiere, France; [Souguir, D.; Ferjani, E.] Fac Sci Bizerte, Lab Physiol & Genet Plantes Interet Agron, Jarzouna 7021, Tunisia","Goupil, P (reprint author), Univ Blaise Pascal Clermont II, Lab Physiol & Genet Vegetales, UMR PIAF UBP INRA 547, Campus Univ Cezeaux 24,Ave Landais, F-63177 Aubiere, France.",Pascale.GOUPIL@univ-bpclermont.fr,,"GOUPIL, Pascale/0000-0002-8297-6503","ADEME ""Bioindicateurs de Qualite des Sols"" (PNETOX)","This work was supported by a grant from ADEME ""Bioindicateurs de Qualite des Sols"" (PNETOX 2003).",,36,26,29,2,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,MAR,2011,20,2,,,,,329,336,,10.1007/s10646-010-0582-0,,,8,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,719XO,WOS:000287245000003,21153701,,,,10/31/19J,"Mohamed, DJ; Martiny, JBH",,,,"Mohamed, Devon J.; Martiny, Jennifer B.

We sequenced 18S rRNA genes to investigate patterns in sediment fungal diversity (richness and evenness of taxa) and composition (taxonomic and phylogenetic) along an estuarine salinity gradient. We sampled three marshes-a salt, brackish and freshwater marsh-in Rhode Island. To compare the relative effect of the salinity gradient with that of plants, we sampled fungi in plots with Spartina patens and in plots from which plants were removed 2 years prior to sampling. The fungal sediment community was unique compared with previously sampled fungal communities; we detected more Ascomycota (78%), fewer Basidiomycota (6%) and more fungi from basal lineages (16%) (Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and four additional groups) than typically found in soil. Across marshes, fungal composition changed substantially, whereas fungal diversity differed only at the finest level of genetic resolution, and was highest in the intermediate, brackish marsh. In contrast, the presence of plants had a highly significant effect on fungal diversity at all levels of genetic resolution, but less of an effect on fungal composition. These results suggest that salinity (or other covarying parameters) selects for a distinctive fungal composition, and plants provide additional niches upon which taxa within these communities can specialize and coexist. Given the number of sequences from basal fungal lineages, the study also suggests that further sampling of estuarine sediments may help in understanding early fungal evolution.

Knowledge of biomass partitioning is essential for estimating spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of root biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. The isometric hypothesis predicts that aboveground biomass scales isometrically with belowground biomass across both individual plants and community types (i.e. the slope of the log-log relationship between above- and belowground biomass is not significantly different from 1.0), and that the isometric pattern is independent of variation in environmental conditions. However, current evidence primarily comes from observations over space. It is still unknown whether biomass partitioning patterns occurring over time are similar to those observed over space. 2. In this study, we explored biomass partitioning patterns in forest ecosystems over space and time by synthesizing biomass measurements made in 112 stands extracted from 16 age sequences a:round the world. We characterized biomass partitioning patterns in forest ecosystems using both root: shoot ratio and the relationship between above- and belowground biomass. Data across various individual studies were organized to reflect biomass partitioning patterns over space, while data within each individual study were used to illustrate biomass allocation patterns over time. 3. Our results showed that root:shoot ratio did not exhibit any significant trend with stand age over space. Similarly, root:shoot ratio remained relatively constant over time in 10 out of 16 age sequences. 4. Reduced major axis analysis indicated that the slope of the log log relationship between above- and belowground biomass did not reveal a significant difference from 1.0 over space, supporting the isometric hypothesis. Likewise, the slope was not statistically different from 1.0 in 10 out of 16 age sequences, nor did it show any significant change with climatic factors and stand age. Thus, the isometric hypothesis also most probably holds true during forest stand development. 5. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that biomass partitioning patterns occurring over time are consistent with those observed over space, suggesting that belowground biomass dynamics in forest ecosystems may be reliably estimated from aboveground biomass using biomass partitioning patterns generated over space.","[Yang, Yuanhe; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Yang, YH (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yhyang@ou.edu,"Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011",,"US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, DBI 0850290, EPS 0919466]; Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]","We are grateful to Dr Robert Jones and three anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

Four levels of N treatments: control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were set in the present study. The results showed that soil respiration followed a clear seasonal pattern, with the maximum rates in mid-summer and the minimum in late winter. The annual cumulative soil respiration was 585+/-43 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots. Simulated N deposition significantly increased the mean annual soil respiration rate, fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass C (MBC), and N concentration in fine roots and fresh leaf litter. Soil respirations exhibited a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, and a linear relationship with MBC. The net primary production (NPP) ranged from 10.95 to 15.01 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and was higher than the annual soil respiration (5.85 to 7.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in all treatments. Simulated N deposition increased the net ecosystem production (NEP), and there was a significant difference between the control and high N treatment NEP, whereas, the difference of NEP among control, low-N, and medium-N was not significant. Results suggest that N controlled the primary production in this bamboo plantation ecosystem. Simulated N deposition increased the C sequestration of the P. amarus plantation ecosystem through increasing the plant C pool, though CO2 emission through soil respiration was also enhanced.","[Tu, Li-Hua; Hu, Ting-Xing; Zhang, Jian; Dai, Hong-Zhong; Luo, Shou-Hua] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Forestry Ecol Engn Sichuan Prov, Xingkang Rd 46, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Ren-Hong] Sichuan Forestry Inventory & Plan Inst, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China","Hu, TX (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Forestry Ecol Engn Sichuan Prov, Xingkang Rd 46, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hutx001@yahoo.com.cn,,,"National Key Technology RAMP;D Program of China [2006BAC01A11-03]; Key Discipline Construction Project in Sichuan Province, China [SZD0419]","We would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editor, whose constructive comments have greatly improved the quality of the paper.

Freshly exposed reservoir sediment may not support rapid reestablishment of native plant species due to poor fertility or absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi propagules. This field study evaluated treatment effects involving combinations of native plants, mycorrhizal inoculum, and mulch on restoration of dewatered reservoir sediment over 20 months. Most plants, even those uninoculated, became mycorrhizal. In all treatments, sediment pH decreased, as did nitrogen and organic matter, compared to original reservoir sediment, while aggregate stability doubled from original anaerobic sediment. Revegetated plots with mulch had significantly greater vegetation cover and more native volunteer species compared to plots without mulch. The planted mulch treatment also decreased plot runoff tenfold, reducing erosion to the same degree. Indicators suggest that the primary benefit of mulch resulted in increased moisture retention making the planted mulch treatment most successful for restoration of reservoir sediment due to extensive native plant growth, improved soil characteristics, and reduced runoff and erosion compared to nonmulched plots. While results from this plot-scale study suggest commercial mycorrhizal inoculum is unnecessary since natural inoculum sources sufficiently colonized plants, reservoir-scale restoration may require creation of additional source areas to encourage rapid reestablishment of native plants and mycorrhizal fungi.","[Wallender, Wesley W.; Bledsoe, Caroline S.; Pasternack, Gregory; Upadhyaya, Shrini K.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Cook, KL (reprint author), N Cascades Natl Pk Serv Complex,810 State Route 2, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284 USA.",Kerri_Cook@nps.gov,"Pasternack, Gregory Brian/B-8619-2012","Pasternack, Gregory Brian/0000-0002-1977-4175",North Coast and Cascades Research Learning Network; UC Davis,"We thank the ONP staff for providing hours of multidivision labor to help establish, maintain, and deconstruct the Boulder Creek Delta field research site.

The soil properties, spores, seeds, stem fragments, mycorrhizae, species, populations and other remnants of the previous inhabitants contribute to shaping the replacement community and building a new ecosystem. The loss of ecological memory for the natural stability domain of a site reduces ecosystem resilience and enables alien invasive species to become established more easily. These invasives may eventually create a new ecosystem with its own ecological memory and resilience. These new ecosystems are described here as novel ecosystems and are placed in the context of adaptive cycles. Ecological restoration of urban ecosystems requires removing the ecological legacy of invasive alien species. To be successful, invasive species control must address both internal within patch memory of invasives and external between patch memory.

After 6 days, the percent biodegradation of 2,4,4'-TCB was 77.4% compared with the control. The main intermediate was identified as 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhex-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) for 2,4,4'-TCB as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Inoculation with S. meliloti greatly enhanced the degradation of target PCB mixtures in the soil.

The transmission of hereditary characteristics from parents to their offspring is therefore predictable, although several exceptions are known. Heredity in microorganisms, however, can be very complex, and even unknown as is the case for coenocytic organisms such as Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF). This group of fungi are plant-root symbionts, ubiquitous in most ecosystems, which reproduce asexually via multinucleate spores for which sexuality has not yet been observed. Results: We examined the number of nuclei per spore of four AMF taxa using high Z-resolution live confocal microscopy and found that the number of nuclei was correlated with spore diameter. We show that AMF have the ability, through the establishment of new symbioses, to pass hundreds of nuclei to subsequent generations of multinucleated spores. More importantly, we observed surprising heterogeneity in the number of nuclei among sister spores and show that massive nuclear migration and mitosis are the mechanisms by which AMF spores are formed. We followed spore development of Glomus irregulare from hyphal swelling to spore maturity and found that the spores reached mature size within 30 to 60 days, and that the number of nuclei per spores increased over time. Conclusions: We conclude that the spores used for dispersal of AMF contain nuclei with two origins, those that migrate into the spore and those that arise by mitosis in the spore. Therefore, these spores do not represent a stage in the life cycle with a single nucleus, raising the possibility that AMF, unlike all other known eukaryotic organisms, lack the genetic bottleneck of a single-nucleus stage.","[Marleau, Julie; Dalpe, Yolande; St-Arnaud, Marc; Hijri, Mohamed] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Dalpe, Yolande] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada","Hijri, M (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",Mohamed.Hijri@umontreal.ca,"St-Arnaud, Marc/D-1184-2017","St-Arnaud, Marc/0000-0002-7181-9895; Hijri, Mohamed/0000-0001-6112-8372",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)Canada Foundation for Innovation; FQRNTFQRNT,"This work was supported by NSERC discovery grant to MH.

However, whether this holds true for different microbial groups and under different soil conditions is unresolved. We tested how plant species richness, identity and biomass influence the abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), saprophytic bacteria and fungi, and actinomycetes, in model plant communities in soil of low and high fertility using phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Abundances of saprophytic fungi and bacteria were driven by larger plant biomass in high diversity treatments. In contrast, increased AMF abundance with larger plant species richness was not explained by plant biomass, but responded to plant species identity and was stimulated by Anthoxantum odoratum. Our results indicate that the abundance of saprophytic soil microbes is influenced more by resource quantity, as driven by plant production, while AMF respond more strongly to resource composition, driven by variation in plant species richness and identity.

GAERTN; ALNUS BETULACEAE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; GENUS RHIZOPOGON; RDNA SEQUENCES; SPECIFICITY; CORTINARIACEAE; MYCORRHIZAE; INFERENCE,"Background: Mycorrhizal fungi form intimate associations with their host plants that constitute their carbon resource and habitat. Alnus spp. (Betulaceae) are known to host an exceptional species-poor and specialized ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community compared to other tree species, but the host-specificity pattern and its significance in terms of fungal diversification and speciation remain poorly documented. The degree of parallel speciation, host switching, and patterns of biogeography were explored in the historical associations between alders and three ECM taxa of Basidiomycetes: Alnicola (Agaricales), Alpova (Boletales), and Lactarius (Russulales). The aim was to develop an evolutionary framework on host specificity and diversification of Basidiomycetes in this highly specialized plant-fungus symbiosis. Results: Sporocarps of Alnicola (220), Lactarius (61) and Alpova (29) were collected from stands of the four European alder species (A. alnobetula including the endemic subsp. suaveolens in Corsica, A. cordata, A. glutinosa, A. incana) in Western Europe (mainly in France and Austria), from 1995 to 2009. Specimens were morphologically identified to the species level. From these, 402 sequences of four DNA regions (ITS, rpb2, gpd, and the V9 domain of the mit-SSU rDNA) were successfully obtained and analyzed in addition with 89 sequences available in GenBank and UNITE databases. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on all sequence data sets (individual and combined) using maximum likelihood reconstruction and Bayesian inference. Fungal phylogenies are compared and discussed in relation to the host, with a focus on species boundaries by associating taxonomic, systematic and molecular information. Conclusions: Patterns of host specificity and phylogenies of Alnicola and Lactarius suggest coevolution as a basal factor of speciation in relation with the subgeneric diversification of Alnus, possibly due to the very selective pressure of the host. A second element of the historical associations between Alnus and its fungal symbionts is a host-dependent speciation (radiation without host change), here observed in Alnicola and Alpova in relation with Alnus subgen. Alnus. Finally host shifts from Alnus subgen. Alnus to A. alnobetula are found in most lineages of Alnicola (at least four times), Alpova (twice) and Lactarius (once), but they do not represent such a common event as could be expected by geographic proximity of trees from the two subgenera. However, active or very recent host extensions clearly occurred in Corsica, where some fungi usually associated with Alnus glutinosa on mainland Europe locally extend there to A. alnobetula subsp. suaveolens without significant genetic or morphological deviation.","[Rochet, Juliette; Manzi, Sophie; Gardes, Monique] Univ Toulouse, UPS, UMR EDB 5174, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France; [Rochet, Juliette; Manzi, Sophie; Gardes, Monique] CNRS, UMR EDB 5174, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France; [Moreau, Pierre-Arthur] Univ Lille Nord France, Lab Bot, Fac Sci Pharmaceut & Biol, F-59006 Lille, France","Gardes, M (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, UMR EDB 5174, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France.",monique.gardes@univ-tlse3.fr,,,region Midi-PyreneesRegion OccitanieRegion Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur [2008-2011]; Office de l'Environnement de la Corse (OEC)Region Corse,"We thank P.

This is especially important in extremely adverse situations found in some substrates from mining activities or soils that have lost their upper horizons. Under these conditions, recolonization of the area by native vegetation through natural succession processes may be extremely limited. Once the main physical and chemical factors restrictive to plant growth are corrected or attenuated, the introduction of leguminous trees able to form symbioses with nodulating N-2-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi constitutes an efficient strategy to accelerate soil reclamation and initiate natural succession. These symbioses give the legume species a superior capacity to grow quickly in poor substrates and to withstand the harsh conditions presented in degraded soils. In this article we describe several successful results in Brazil using N-2-fixing legume tree species for reclamation of areas degraded by soil erosion, construction and mining activities, emphasizing the potential of the technique to recover soil organic matter levels and restore ecosystem biodiversity and other environmental functions.","[Chaer, Guilherme Montandon; Resende, Alexander Silva; Carneiro Campello, Eduardo Francia; de Faria, Sergio Miana; Boddey, Robert Michael] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil","Chaer, GM (reprint author), Embrapa Agrobiol, BR 465,Km 7,Caixa Postal 74505, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil.",gchaer@cnpab.embrapa.br,"Resende, Alexander/H-5376-2015; Chaer, Guilherme/B-1241-2013; de Faria, Sergio Miana/C-1405-2013","Resende, Alexander/0000-0002-1433-9203; schmidt, susanne/0000-0001-8369-1238; Chaer, Guilherme/0000-0003-0734-2866",,,,69,56,58,1,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2011,31,2,,,,,139,149,,10.1093/treephys/tpq116,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,745KP,WOS:000289164600004,21378065,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Saito, M; Oba, H; Kojima, T",,,,"Saito, Masanori; Oba, Hirosuke; Kojima, Tomoko",,,Effect of nitrogen on the sporulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonizing several gramineous plant species,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,grass; mycorrhiza; nitrogen; sporulation; volcanic deposit,INOCULATION; RECLAMATION; PHOSPHATE; ICELAND,"We examined the effect of nitrogen on sporulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonizing gramineous plant species growing in a volcanic deposit with a nitrogen deficit.

The AM dependent species (M. sinensis and P. notatum) which showed growth response to the inoculation increased sporulation with nitrogen addition. However, the species that did not depend on AM for their growth (S. spontaneum and E. curvula) showed decreased or non-increased sporulation with nitrogen application.

Soil scientists have tackled this challenge by taking advantage of approaches such as fractal geometry, which describes soil architectural complexity through a scaling exponent (D) relating mass and numbers of particles/aggregates to particle/aggregate size. Typically, soil biologists use empirical indices such as mean weight diameters (MWD) and percent of water stable aggregates (WSA), or the entire size distribution, and they have successfully related these indices to key soil features such as C and N dynamics and biological promoters of soil structure. Here, we focused on D, WSA and MWD and we tested whether: D estimated by the exponent of the power law of number-size distributions is a good and consistent correlate of MWD and WSA; D carries information that differs from MWD and WSA; the fraction of variation in D that is uncorrelated with MWD and WSA is related to soil chemical and biological properties that are thought to establish interdependence with soil structure (e.g., organic C, N, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). We analysed observational data from a broad scale field study and results from a greenhouse experiment where arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and collembola altered soil structure. We were able to develop empirical models that account for a highly significant and large portion of the correlation observed between WSA and MWD but we did not uncover the mechanisms that underlie this correlation. We conclude that most of the covariance between D and soil biotic (AMF, plant roots) and abiotic (C. N) properties can be accounted for by WSA and MWD. This result implies that the ecological effects of the fragmentation properties described by D and generally discussed under the framework of fractal models can be interpreted under the intuitive perspective of simpler indices and we suggest that the biotic components mostly impacted the largest size fractions, which dominate MWD, WSA and the scaling exponent ruling number-size distributions.

The SOC pool was the highest in the A horizon (47.4 Mg ha(-1)) and smaller in the Btl (6.9 Mg ha(-1)) and Bt2 (6.7 Mg ha(-1)) horizons. The SOC and TN concentrations sharply decreased with depth. Fine root C and N pools were much larger in the A horizon (0.71 and 0.025 Mg ha-1) than in underlying horizons. Although only 22% of the SOC pool was stored below the A horizon, 58% of the chemically stabilized and 31% of the physically stabilized SOC fractions pool occurred in the subsoil horizons.

We hypothesized that soil water depletion occurred below the depth previously measured by sensors in 11-m-deep soil pits and that only a small root biomass is necessaiy to affect water uptake and the isotopic signature of soil CO(2). A noninvasive electrical profiling method demonstrated greater depletion of soil water in the 11-18 m depth increment in the exclusion ploi compared with the control plot by the end of the 3rd year of the experiment. A fine root biomass of only 0.1 g/cm(3) measured at 3-6 m was sufficient for soil water drawdown and for imparting an isotopic signature of modern soil (14)CO(2) in both plots. A soil (13)CO(2) profile indicated drought stress in the exclusion plot.

The objectives of this study were to assess if changes in the understory vegetation caused by altered light microclimate after clear-cutting affect the infectivity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on herbaceous plant species in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests naturally regenerating from clear-cutting and to test if the use of bioassays for studying the infectivity of native AMF could provide useful information to improve the management of clear-cut areas. Three nearby beech forests in northwest Navarra, Spain, a region in the northwest part of the Pyrenees, were selected: an unmanaged forest, a forest clear-cut in 1996, and another forest clear-cut in 2001. High stem density in the forest clear-cut in 1996 (44 000 trees ha(-1)) attenuated photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and impaired the growth of herbaceous species within the ecosystem. The percentage of AMF colonization of plants in bioassays performed on soil samples collected from the forest clear-cut in 1996 was always lower than 10%. In the forest clear-cut in 2001, where soil was covered by perennial grasses, PAR was high and the infectivity of native AMF achieved minimum values in spring and autumn and a maximum value in summer. In contrast, the infectivity of native AMF in the unmanaged forest remained similar across the seasons. Our results demonstrated that changes in the composition of understory vegetation within beech forests strongly affected the infectivity of native AMF in clear-cut areas and suggested that the assessment of the infectivity of native AMF through bioassays could provide helpful information for planning either the removal of overstory when the tree density is so high that it impairs the correct development of herbaceous species or the plantation of new seedlings when high light intensity negatively affects the establishment of shade species.","[Closa, I.; Goicoechea, N.] Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Plant Biol Sect, Dept Plant Biol, Pamplona 31008, Spain","Goicoechea, N (reprint author), Univ Navarra, Sch Sci, Plant Biol Sect, Dept Plant Biol, C Irunlarrea 1, Pamplona 31008, Spain.",niegoi@unav.es,"Goicoechea, Nieves/K-7847-2014","Goicoechea, Nieves/0000-0003-0550-4366","University Foundation of Navarra, Spain; Caja Navarra, Spain; University of Navarra, Inc., Spain","Supported by the University Foundation of Navarra, Spain; the Caja Navarra, Spain; and the University of Navarra, Inc., Spain.",,47,6,8,0,18,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,FEB,2011,21,1,,,,,65,74,,10.1016/S1002-0160(10)60080-X,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,717NT,WOS:000287055400008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Osman, N; Barakbah, SS",,,,"Osman, Normaniza; Barakbah, S.

Four experimental plots, with differing plant pioneers and number of species (diversity), were designed in order to assess the effects of plant succession on slope stability. Plant growth pattern was assessed by observing the increment in species diversity (number), species frequency and plant biomass. Higher vegetation biomass in a mixed culture situation (LLSS) in the field with Leucaena leucocephala as a pioneer, marked an increase in species diversity after 24 months of observation. In contrast, G (grasses and legume creepers) plot revealed the slowest rate of succession and the lowest above-ground biomass amongst the plots. The mixed-culture plot without L. leucocephala (SS) had also shown a lower biomass, a similar phenomenon observed in a plot grown by L. leucocephala (LL) with low plant diversity. Consequently, these plant growth patterns gave a positive effect on slope stability where the regression study showed that the shear strength was much affected by plant biomass. Meanwhile, throughout the succession process in LLSS plot, root length density reached the highest value amongst the plots, 23 Km m(-3). In relation to this, the saturation level of the slope indicates the unsaturated condition of the soil which resulted in the enhancement of both soil penetrability and soil shear strength of the plot. These attributes reveal a strong positive relationship between the process of natural succession and the stability of slopes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Two Chinese fir clones with high P efficiency (M1 and M4) were chosen as the research materials and their adaptive responses to low P stress were examined. The increment in root morphological traits and biomass production of these clones was measured by a sand culture experiment with a heterogeneous P supply. For both clones, P starvation resulted in significantly higher root surface area and root volume but not root length. For clone M4, the mean root diameter was also larger under P deficiency than under normal P supply. Interestingly, the root morphological traits varied substantially within the same root system where the starved roots had higher values for all morphological traits than the nonstarved ones. Phosphorus starvation did not affect shoot and root biomass or the root to shoot ratio, but the whole-plant biomass increment was large under P deficiency for clone M4. In conclusion, the adaptation to low P stress in these clones is attributed to increased P acquisition and utilization efficiencies.","[Wu, Pengfei; Ma, Xiangqing; Wang, Chen; Liu, Aiqin] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Tigabu, Mulualem; Oden, Per Christer] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Fac Forest Sci, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Ma, XQ (reprint author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lxymxq@126.com,,"Tigabu, Mulualem/0000-0003-2471-1168",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30972354],"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 30972354).

We studied fine root parameters of a Norway spruce stand treated with reduced input (clean rain) for 13 years. Fine roots of the clean rain plot had smaller N and Al contents, however, fine roots in the subsoil were still subjected to soil acidity and Al toxicity as indicated by a fine root Ca/Al ratio of less than 0.5. The treatment effect was most pronounced in the organic layer of the clean rain plot where fine root biomass increased by 66% and the live/dead ratio of fine roots increased by more than 100%. The elevated live/dead ratio was attributed to reduced mortality and faster decomposition of fine root litter. The latter was supported by a positive relationship between live/dead ratio and manganese content of fine roots. In contrast to the organic layer, fine root biomass was not different in the mineral soil. However, at 20-40 cm fine root diameter was greater and specific root tip density was smaller than in the topsoil likely because of strong N limitation as indicated by a C/N ratio of > 50. Based on these morphological changes we postulate differing functional properties of fine roots in the organic layer and mineral soil below 20 cm depth. Further, our results suggest that Picea abies is able to adapt morphology and functional traits of its root system following reduced N availability.","[Zang, Ulrich; Borken, Werner] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Soil Ecol, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany; [Lamersdorf, Norbert] Univ Gottingen, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Zang, UR (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Soil Ecol, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany.",ulrich.zang@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,45,12,12,4,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2011,339,2-Jan,,,,,435,445,,10.1007/s11104-010-0598-5,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,706GA,WOS:000286204800034,,,,,10/31/19J,"Inoue, T; Nohara, S; Takagi, H; Anzai, Y",,,,"Inoue, Tomomi; Nohara, Seiichi; Takagi, Hiroyuki; Anzai, Yasuharu",,,Contrast of nitrogen contents around roots of mangrove plants,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mangrove rhizosphere; Nitrogen fixing; Soil oxygenation; Soil pore water,FIXATION ACETYLENE-REDUCTION; PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER; COASTAL LAGOON KENYA; RHIZOPHORA-MANGLE; LEAF-LITTER; AVICENNIA-GERMINANS; SOUTH FLORIDA; GAZI BAY; DECOMPOSITION; TURNOVER,"Nitrogen is one of the most limiting elements for plant growth. Although nitrogen dynamics in mangrove forests are well understood at the ecosystem level, the nitrogen conditions in the root-zones of plants are less clear. The aim of this study was to analyze in detail the nitrogen conditions in the root zone of mangroves. We conducted a field survey in an area inhabited by three species of mangroves (Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh., Rhizophora stylosa Griff. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam.). We collected soil and soil pore-water from the mangrove root zone, in which there were abundant fine roots, and from an area 10-cm away from the root zone (no-root zone). We determined soil organic nitrogen contents and concentrations of ammonium-N, nitrite-N and nitrate-N in soil pore-water along with soil temperature, NaCl and pH. We observed several common characteristics among the three mangrove species; in the root zone, pH was lower, soil organic matter content was higher, soil C:N was lower, and soil pore-water nitrite-N and nitrate-N were higher than their respective values in the no-root zone. These trends were observed in both summer and winter while soil temperature was about 10A degrees C higher in summer than in winter. The fact that C:N was lower in the root zone than in the no-root zone suggests that bacterial nitrogen assimilation occurred near plant roots. The contrast in nitrogen content within a small scale (10 cm) between the root zone and no-root zone suggests that mangroves retain nitrogen source in their root zone. This property clearly works efficiently in intertidal habitats where tidal nitrogen export occurs naturally.","[Inoue, Tomomi; Nohara, Seiichi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Takagi, Hiroyuki] Kabira Farm, Okinawa, Japan","Inoue, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",tomomi.inoue@nies.go.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Japanese GovernmentMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [20770020]","We thank Mr K.

White clover (Trifoliurn repens) was inoculated with the AM fungi Glomus fasciculatum and Clam us mosseae individually and in combination, and larvae of the clover root weevil (Sitona lepidus) reared on mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. On emergence, adult weevils were weighed and the percentage of larvae surviving to adulthood was calculated for each treatment. Larval survival to adulthood was increased by both species of fungi, but weight was unaffected. Larval feeding reduced foliar biomass, but had no effect when two fungi colonized the root system. Although larval survival was greatest in the dual fungal treatment, the proportion of grazed root nodules was lower, suggesting that AMF may improve root quality for the herbivore. Root feeding caused an increase in arbuscular colonization in the dual fungal treatment, and this may have enabled plants to tolerate herbivory, through enhanced mycorrhizal benefit. We conclude that a specialist root feeder is less affected by the presence of AMF than are generalist species. However, AMF enable a plant to tolerate the effects of root loss, and this is dependent on the number of mycorrhizal species in the root system. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies attributed the asymptotic diversity-productivity pattern to plant competition and differential resource use (e.g., niche complementarity). Using an analytical model and a series of experiments, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that host-specific soil microbes can be major determinants of the diversity-productivity relationship in grasslands. In the presence of soil microbes, plant disease decreased with increasing diversity, and productivity increased nearly 500%, primarily because of the strong effect of density-dependent disease on productivity at low diversity. Correspondingly, disease was higher in plants grown in conspecific-trained soils than heterospecific-trained soils (demonstrating host-specificity), and productivity increased and host-specific disease decreased with increasing community diversity, suggesting that disease was the primary cause of reduced productivity in species-poor treatments. In sterilized, microbe-free soils, the increase in productivity with increasing plant species number was markedly lower than the increase measured in the presence of soil microbes, suggesting that niche complementarity was a weaker determinant of the diversity-productivity relationship. Our results demonstrate that soil microbes play an integral role as determinants of the diversity-productivity relationship.","[Schnitzer, Stefan A.; Mangan, Scott A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Schnitzer, Stefan A.; Mangan, Scott A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa 03092, Panama; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol & Phys Geog Unit, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [HilleRisLambers, Janneke] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kinkel, Linda L.; Xiao, Kun] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Pathol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Sikes, Benjamin A.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Schnitzer, Stefan A.; van Nes, Egbert H.; Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands","Schnitzer, SA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",Schnitzer@uwm.edu,"Sikes, Benjamin/G-8895-2018; van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012","van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X; Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Sikes, Benjamin/0000-0003-0774-2624; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Schnitzer, Stefan/0000-0002-2715-9455","DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-96ER62291]; NSF LTERNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0080382]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0614406, 9977907]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Research Growth Initiative","We thank L.

Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO2 enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the rhizosphere. Over the course of 3 years, we measured in situ rates of root exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated with elevated CO2 (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates (mu g C cm-1 root h-1) by 55% during the primary growing season, leading to a 50% annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R2 = 0.66; P = 0.006) in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO2 and N fertilization did not increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO2 in low fertility soils are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in forest ecosystems.","[Phillips, Richard P.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bernhardt, Emily S.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Phillips, RP (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rpp6@indiana.edu,"Phillips, Richard P/C-6429-2009; Bernhardt, Emily/D-9940-2011; Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016; Bernhardt, Emily/B-4541-2010","Bernhardt, Emily/0000-0003-3031-621X; Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533; ",,,,52,315,348,32,368,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Here, we investigate the fine root productivity of mature, fire-origin stands of Populus tremuloides-Picea spp.-Abies balsamea (mixed-species stands) and relatively pure P. tremuloides (single-species stands) in two regions of North American boreal forest to better understand the link between plant diversity and below-ground productivity in forest ecosystems. We hypothesized that: (i) mixed-species stands have higher fine root productivity compared with single-species stands and (ii) this difference may be the result of greater soil space filling by the fine roots due to the contrasting rooting traits of the component species in the mixed-species stands. 3. We found that fine root productivity, measured by annual production and total biomass, was higher in mixed- than single-species stands. We also found that mixed-species stands had lower and higher horizontal and vertical fine root biomass heterogeneity, respectively, indicating that soil space is more fully occupied by fine roots in the mixed- than single-species stands. 4. In all, our study supports that below-ground niche differentiation may be a key driver of higher fine root productivity in mixed stands of species with contrasting rooting traits than single-species stands by facilitating greater soil space filling of fine roots and soil resource exploitation.","[Brassard, Brian W.; Chen, Han Y.

In this study, we quantified atmospheric N deposition and revealed current plant and soil N status in 14 forests along a 150 km urban to rural transect in southern China, with an emphasis on examining whether foliar delta 15N can be used as an indicator of N saturation. Bulk deposition ranged from 16.2 to 38.2 kg N ha-1 yr-1, while the throughfall covered a larger range of 11.7-65.1 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Foliar N concentration, NO(3)- leaching to stream, and soil NO(3)- concentration were low and NO(3)- production was negligible in some rural forests, indicating that primary production in these forests may be limited by N supply. But all these N variables were enhanced in suburban and urban forests. Across the study transect, throughfall N input was correlated positively with soil nitrification and NO(3)- leaching to stream, and negatively with pH values in soil and stream water. Foliar delta 15N was between -6.6 parts per thousand and 0.7 parts per thousand, and was negatively correlated with soil NO(3)- concentration and NO(3)- leaching to stream across the entire transect, demonstrating that an increased N supply does not necessarily increase forest delta 15N values. We proposed several potential mechanism that could contribute to the delta 15N pattern, including (1) increased plant uptake of 15N-depleted soil NO(3)-, (2) foliage uptake of 15N-depleted NH(4)+, (3) increased utilization of soil inorganic N relative to dissolved organic N, and (4) increased fractionation during plant N uptake under higher soil N availability.","[Fang, Yunting; Mo, Jiangming; Zhang, Wei; Lu, Xiankai] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yunting; Yoh, Muneoki; Koba, Keisuke; Takebayashi, Yu] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Sci, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Zhu, Weixing] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Xiao, Yihua] CAF, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lei, Chunyi] Heishiding Nat Reserve, Zhaoqing 526536, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Fang, YT (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fangyt@scbg.ac.cn,"Mo, Jiangming/M-2104-2014; Yoh, Muneoki/C-2047-2013; Koba, Keisuke/A-3699-2012; Fang, Yunting/G-4456-2012","Koba, Keisuke/0000-0003-1942-9811; Fang, Yunting/0000-0001-7531-546X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40703030, 30725006]; Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [8351065005000001, 7006915]; Pearl River Delta Forest Ecosystem Research Station, CAF of Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21310008, 19310019]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20-08421];  [187801172];  [20780113]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 40703030 and 30725006), Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong (Nos. 8351065005000001 and 7006915), Pearl River Delta Forest Ecosystem Research Station, CAF, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) (Nos. 21310008 and 19310019), Grants-in-Aid for Creative Scientific Research (Nos. 187801172 and 20780113) and the Program to Create an Independent Research Environment for Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

This study contributes to our broad goal of understanding the causes and consequences of increased fine-root production and mortality under elevated [CO2] by examining potential gross nitrogen (N) cycling rates throughout the soil profile. Our study was conducted in a CO2-enriched sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) plantation in Oak Ridge, TN, USA. We used 15N isotope pool dilution methodology to measure potential gross N cycling rates in laboratory incubations of soil from four depth increments to 60 cm. Our objectives were twofold: (1) to determine whether N is available for root acquisition in deeper soil and (2) to determine whether elevated [CO2], which has increased inputs of labile C resulting from greater fine-root mortality at depth, has altered N cycling rates. Although gross N fluxes declined with soil depth, we found that N is potentially available for roots to access, especially below 15 cm depth where rates of microbial consumption of mineral N were reduced relative to production. Overall, up to 60% of potential gross N mineralization and 100% of potential net N mineralization occurred below 15 cm depth at this site. This finding was supported by in situ measurements from ion-exchange resins, where total inorganic N availability at 55 cm depth was equal to or greater than N availability at 15 cm depth. While it is likely that trees grown under elevated [CO2] are accessing a larger pool of inorganic N by mining deeper soil, we found no effect of elevated [CO2] on potential gross or net N cycling rates. Thus, increased root exploration of the soil volume under elevated [CO2] may be more important than changes in potential gross N cycling rates in sustaining forest responses to rising atmospheric CO2.","[Iversen, C.

The objective of this study was to compare specific N-uptake rates for economically and ecologically important tree species in Central European forests: pine (Pinus sylvestris), spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus petraea), beech (Fagus sylvatica), lime (Tilia cordate), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) when they grow in mineral soil from an old fallow site with a pH of 6. We used an (15)N-labeling method to measure tree seedling (15)N uptake in potted soils (Humic Cambisol) when both N forms NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) were simultaneously present in the soil solution for interspecies comparison and assessment of relationships between specific (15)N-uptake rates and amino acid-accumulation rates or relative growth rates (RGR). The results demonstrate that tree species varied significantly in their capacity to take up NH(4)(+) or NO(3)(-) into roots, stems, or leaves, but indicate only marginal differences in their preference for NH(4)(+) or NO(3)(-) when they grow in mineral soil. The ranking of specific (15)N-uptake rates for NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) was oak < beech < spruce < pine < lime < ash. Fine roots of all species had the highest specific (15)N-uptake rates for both N forms, followed by total roots, leaves/needles, and stems. As regards tree seedling species, we found negative relationships between glutamine (Gln)-accumulation rates in leaves/needles and total (15)N-uptake rates in fine roots. Noteworthy was the fact that, at high Gln-accumulation rates, the N-uptake system in fine roots of ash was probably lower under feedback inhibition by the amino acid.","[Schulz, Horst; Haertling, Sigrid] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, D-6120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Stange, Claus F.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Phys, D-6120 Halle, Saale, Germany","Schulz, H (reprint author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-6120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",horst.schulz@ufz.de,"Stange, Claus Florian/A-4009-2009","Stange, Claus Florian/0000-0002-8247-6074",,,,36,14,20,2,56,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1436-8730,,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

(2) How do seedling root growth morphological traits affect the water threshold required for seedling establishment? Location: Arid scrubland, Atacama Desert, north-central Chile. Methods: We conducted a field experiment with nine native shrub species under a gradient of simulated rainfall to test if species with deep root architecture have higher seedling survival rates and establish more successfully during water pulses. Results: Seedling survival rate was very low; only 2% of the 12 150 planted seedlings survived the first summer drought. Seedling survival required at least 206mm of water, which is twice the average rainfall and roughly equivalent to the precipitation during an ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event in this region. Seedling survival at the onset of the summer drought was best explained by leaf habit, root length and initial seedling size. However, only Senna cumingii seedlings survived through the first year. S. cumingii seedlings had distinctively longer roots than the other shrub species, enabling them to reach moister soil layers. Conclusions: Water conditions resembling rainy years enhance shrub seedling establishment in the Atacama Desert, but the effects of higher water availability are strongly dependent on the shrub species. Rapid and deep rooting appears to be a very important functional trait for successful first-year survival in this arid system where water availability is highly episodic.","[Holmgren, Milena] Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Leon, Mario F.; Squeo, Francisco A.; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Inst Ecol & Biodivers IEB, La Serena, Chile; [Leon, Mario F.; Squeo, Francisco A.; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Ctr Adv Studies Arid Zones CEAZA, La Serena, Chile","Holmgren, M (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",mleon.36@gmail.com; f_squeo@userena.cl; jgutierr@userena.cl; Milena.Holmgren@wur.nl,,"Squeo, Francisco/0000-0003-3559-0250",IEB; ICMConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) [P05-002]; Chilean Basal Financing ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL [PFB-23]; Fundacion BBVA [BIOCON06/105]; Dutch NWO Meervoud Programme [836.05.021];  [PFB-23-CONICYT],"We thank the Pacifico Mining Company (PMC) for facilitating the permits and logistic support.

A common approach is to rely almost entirely on DNA sequence data for estimates of microbial diversity, but to date there is no objective method of clustering sequences into groups that is grounded in evolutionary theory of what constitutes a biological lineage. The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model uses a likelihood-based approach to distinguish population-level processes within lineages from processes associated with speciation and extinction, thus identifying a distinct point where extant lineages became independent. Using two independent surveys of DNA sequences associated with a group of ubiquitous plant-symbiotic fungi, we compared estimates of species richness derived using the GMYC model to those based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined by fixed levels of sequence similarity. The model predicted lower species richness in these surveys than did traditional methods of sequence similarity. Here, we show for the first time that groups delineated by the GMYC model better explained variation in the distribution of fungi in relation to putative niche-based variables associated with host species identity, edaphic factors, and aspects of how the sampled ecosystems were managed. Our results suggest the coalescent-based GMYC model successfully groups environmental sequences of fungi into clusters that are ecologically more meaningful than more arbitrary approaches for estimating species richness.","[Powell, Jeff R.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Monaghan, Michael T.] IGB, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Oepik, Maarja] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia","Powell, JR (reprint author), Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jeffpowell2@gmail.com,"Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Monaghan, Michael T/A-2589-2009","Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452; Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Monaghan, Michael T/0000-0001-6200-2376","European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [PIIF-GA-2009-236798, PERG03-GA-2008-231034]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; German Research Council (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 816]; Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [7738, SF0180098s08]; Centre of Excellence FIBIR","We thank Tancredi Caruso for statistical advice and Benjamin Sikes, Stefan Hempel, Ingeborg Haug, Dirk Redecker, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this manuscript.

We hypothesized that N deposition would lead to significant changes in the AMF community structure. We studied the diversity and community structure of AMF in northern hardwood forests after more than 12 years of simulated nitrogen deposition. We performed molecular analyses on maple (Acer spp.) roots targeting the 18S rDNA region using the fungal-specific primers AM1 and NS31. PCR products were cloned and identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. N addition significantly altered the AMF community structure, and Glomus group A dominated the AMF community. Some Glomus operational taxonomic units (OTUs) responded negatively to N inputs, whereas other Glomus OTUs and an Acaulospora OTU responded positively to N inputs. The observed effect on community structure implies that AMF species associated with maples differ in their response to elevated nitrogen. Given that functional diversity exists among AMF species and that N deposition has been shown to select less beneficial fungi in some ecosystems, this change in community structure could have implications for the functioning of this type of ecosystem.","[van Diepen, Linda T.

We predict that, to counteract their shallow-rooting systems and to maximize seedling survival, non-resprouters have root traits that confer higher efficiency in soil resource acquisition than resprouters. We tested this prediction in seedlings of less than 1.5 months old. We select 13 coexisting woody species (including both resprouters and non-resprouters), grew them in a common garden and measured the following root traits: length, surface, average diameter, root tissue density (RTD), specific root length (SRL), surface:volume ratio (SVR), specific tip density (STD), tip distribution in depth, internal links ratio (ILR), and degree of branching. These root traits were compared between the two resprouting life histories using both standard cross-species and phylogenetic-informed analysis. Non-resprouters showed higher SRL and longer, thinner and more branched laterals, especially in the upper soil layers. The external links (i.e. the most absorptive root region) were also more abundant, longer, thinner and with higher SVR for non-resprouters. The results were supported by the phylogenetic-informed analysis for the root traits most strongly related to soil resource acquisition (SRL, SVR and branching pattern). The seedling root structure of non-resprouters species allows them to more efficiently explore the upper soil layer, whereas seedling roots of resprouters will permit both carbon storage and deep soil penetration.","[Pausas, Juli G.] CSIC, CIDE Ctr Invest Desertificac, Valencia 46470, Spain; [Paula, Susana] CEAM Ctr Estudios Ambientales Mediterraneo, Valencia 46980, Spain","Pausas, JG (reprint author), CSIC, CIDE Ctr Invest Desertificac, Cami Marjal S-N,Apartado Oficial, Valencia 46470, Spain.",juli.g.pausas@uv.es,"Pausas, Juli G/C-5794-2008","Pausas, Juli G/0000-0003-3533-5786",SINREG [REN2003-07198-C02-02/GLO]; PERSIST [CGL2006-07126/BOS]; GRACCIE [CSD200-00067]; Bancaixa; University of Valencia,"We thank all the volunteers for their help in the common garden and laboratory tasks, especially H.

Since exotic invasions are generally studied at the species level, relatively little is known about intraspecific variation in the traits that determine an invader's effect on native species. Alliaria petiolata is a widespread and aggressive invader of forest understories that succeeds in part by interfering with mutualistic interactions between native plants and soil fungi. Here, I show that the impact of A. petiolata on soil microbial communities varied among individuals due to variation in their allelochemical concentrations. The differential impacts translated into varied effects on native tree growth, partly because A. petiolata's allelochemicals preferentially affected the most mutualistic fungal taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering the spatial and temporal variation in an invasive species' impacts for understanding and managing the invasion process.","Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL USA","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL USA.",ralankau@illinois.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-02894],"I thank Emily Wheeler and Alison Bennett for comments on the manuscript and advice on molecular methods, Joanne Chee-Sanford and Angela Kent for access to equipment, and the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center for sample processing.

However, the high frequency of management practices and the fertilisation could reduce C storage into the soil, by increasing CO2 emissions and annulling the potential of C sequestration. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the impacts of coppicing and fertilisation on total soil CO2 efflux, soil heterotrophic processes and consequent changes of soil C storage in a short rotation poplar plantation. Field soil CO2 efflux, heterotrophic soil CO2 efflux and soil organic C were compared before and after coppicing. Temporal dynamics of fine root biomass and water-soluble carbon after coppicing were also analysed. Coppicing increased total soil CO2 efflux by more than 50%, while heterotrophic soil CO2 efflux remained unchanged. Nevertheless, an increase in total organic carbon was observed as a result of above and belowground litter inputs, as well as root re-growth and exudation. This trend was more evident in fertilised soils due to lower heterotrophic and autotrophic soil CO2 effluxes. Fertilisation can reduce the increase of CO2 emissions after coppicing. Although soil organic C storage increased, the accumulation of labile fractions may trigger microbial respiration in the following years.","[Abou Jaoude, Renee; De Angelis, Paolo] Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Environm & Resources DISAFRI, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Lagomarsino, Alessandra] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agrobiol & Agrochem DABAC, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy","De Angelis, P (reprint author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Environm & Resources DISAFRI, Via S Camillo de Lellis Snc, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",pda@unitus.it,"De Angelis, Paolo/A-6863-2012","De Angelis, Paolo/0000-0001-8310-8831; Lagomarsino, Alessandra/0000-0003-3325-0084",,,,61,9,9,1,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2011,339,2-Jan,,,,,219,230,,10.1007/s11104-010-0570-4,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,706GA,WOS:000286204800017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Thonar, C; Schnepf, A; Frossard, E; Roose, T; Jansa, J",,,,"Thonar, Cecile; Schnepf, Andrea; Frossard, Emmanuel; Roose, Tiina; Jansa, Jan",,,Traits related to differences in function among three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Extraradical mycelium; Functional diversity; Hyphal growth model; Medicago truncatula; Phosphorus,TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM L; PLANT PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; EXTERNAL HYPHAE; PHOSPHATE; GROWTH; SOIL; DIVERSITY; SYMBIOSIS; TRANSPORT; ROOTS,"Diversity in phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies was assessed among three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) isolated from a single field in Switzerland. Medicago truncatula was used as a test plant. It was grown in a compartmented system with root and root-free zones separated by a fine mesh. Dual radioisotope labeling ((32)P and (33)P) was employed in the root-free zone as follows: (33)P labeling determined hyphal P uptake from different distances from roots over the entire growth period, whereas (32)P labeling investigated hyphal P uptake close to the roots over the 48 hours immediately prior to harvest. Glomus intraradices, Glomus claroideum and Gigaspora margarita were able to take up and deliver P to the plants from maximal distances of 10, 6 and 1 cm from the roots, respectively. Glomus intraradices most rapidly colonized the available substrate and transported significant amounts of P towards the roots, but provided the same growth benefit as compared to Glomus claroideum, whose mycelium was less efficient in soil exploration and in P uptake and delivery to the roots. These differences are probably related to different carbon requirements by these different Glomus species. Gigaspora margarita provided low P benefits to the plants and formed dense mycelium networks close to the roots where P was probably transiently immobilized. Numerical modeling identified possible mechanisms underlying the observed differences in patterns of mycelium growth. High external hyphal production at the root-fungus interface together with rapid hyphal turnover were pointed out as important factors governing hyphal network development by Gigaspora, whereas nonlinearity in apical branching and hyphal anastomoses were key features for G. intraradices and G. claroideum, respectively.","[Thonar, Cecile; Frossard, Emmanuel; Jansa, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Anim & Agroecosyst Sci, Plant Nutr Grp, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland; [Thonar, Cecile] ICRAF, Trop Soil Biol & Fertil Inst, CIAT TSBF, Nairobi, Kenya; [Schnepf, Andrea] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Roose, Tiina] Univ Southampton, Sch Engn Sci, Southampton, Hants, England","Thonar, C (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Anim & Agroecosyst Sci, Plant Nutr Grp, Eschikon 33, CH-8315 Lindau, Switzerland.",cecile.thonar@ipw.agrl.ethz,"Roose, Tiina/A-6352-2010; Thonar, Cecile/A-6258-2013; Jansa, Jan/H-3161-2014; Schnepf, Andrea/F-5203-2015; Schnepf, Andrea/Q-4457-2019","Roose, Tiina/0000-0001-8710-1063; Thonar, Cecile/0000-0002-1806-688X; Jansa, Jan/0000-0002-0331-1774; Schnepf, Andrea/0000-0003-2203-4466; Schnepf, Andrea/0000-0003-2203-4466",ETH ZurichETH Zurich [10 TH 14/05-3]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [T341-N13],"The authors would like to express their gratitude to a number of colleagues, who helped with establishment, maintenance and harvest of the cuvette experiment as well as with data acquisition.

In addition, novel pressures in the introduced range may lead to phenotypic changes related to fitness or competitive ability of introduced plants. Polyploidy appears to be over-represented in invasive plants, but differences between cytotypes in growth strategies including trade-offs among plant traits have received little attention so far in the context of biological invasions. We grew Centaurea stoebe L. and Senecio inaequidens D.C. in a greenhouse experiment to test for differences in fitness (shoot biomass, reproductive output) and competitive ability (vegetative size, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, root-shoot ratio) between diploid and polyploid cytotypes as well as between native and introduced plants. For both species, diploid and tetraploid genotypes occur in the native range, whereas only tetraploids are present in the introduced range. In the native range of both species, diploid and tetraploid genotypes had different growth strategies. Tetraploid genotypes of C. stoebe and S. inaequidens had, respectively, higher specific leaf area and stem height than diploid ones. Thus, for both species, native tetraploids appeared more competitive than native diploids, which could explain, at least partially, the invasion success of the pre-adapted tetraploid genotypes. The comparison of native and introduced tetraploid genotypes revealed differences in traits linked to competitive ability, which could be linked to novel selection in the new environment. In S. inaequidens, we found evidence for a competition-colonisation trade-off, whereas persistence of C. stoebe in the new range seemed to be linked to a competition-defence trade-off.","[Thebault, Aurelie; Gillet, Francois; Buttler, Alexandre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecol Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Thebault, Aurelie; Buttler, Alexandre] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Grp Restorat Ecol, Co EPFL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gillet, Francois; Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Unit Ecol & Evolut, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland","Thebault, A (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecol Syst, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",aurelie.thebault@epfl.ch,"Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz/H-5277-2011; Buttler, Alexandre AB/K-1137-2012; Gillet, Francois/B-6160-2008","Gillet, Francois/0000-0002-3334-1069; Muller-Scharer, heinz/0000-0003-0936-1470",National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Plant SurvivalSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),"This project was funded by the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Plant Survival, research programme of the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Ecosystems in these regions are prone to land degradation, which may be aggravated by climate change. Soil respiration is one of the main processes responsible for organic carbon losses from arid and semi-arid ecosystems. We measured soil respiration over one year in two steppe ecosystems having different degrees of land degradation under three ground-covers: with vegetation, bare soil, and an intermediate situation between plants and bare soil. The largest differences in soil respiration rates between the sites were observed in spring, coinciding with the highest level of plant activity. The degraded site had drier and hotter soils with less soil water availability and a longer drought period. As a result, vegetation on the degraded site did not respond to spring rainfall events. Soil respiration showed a strong seasonal variability, with average annual rates of 1.1 and 0.8 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) in the natural and degraded sites, respectively. We did not observe significant differences in soil respiration rates associated with ground-cover i.e., the temporal variation was much larger than the spatial variation. At both sites, soil moisture was the controlling driver of soil respiration for most of the year, when temperatures were above 20 degrees C and constrained the response to temperature for the few months when the temperature was below 20 degrees C. An empirical model based on soil temperature and soil moisture explained 90% and 72% of the seasonal variability of soil respiration on the natural and degraded sites, respectively. For the first time, this study suggests that land degradation may alter the carbon balance of these ecosystems through changes in the temporal dynamics of soil respiration and plant productivity, which have important negative consequences for ecosystem functioning and sustainability.

We collected P. australis plants, rhizosphere sediments, and unvegetated sediments from natural aquatic sites and conducted degradation experiments using sediments spiked with pyrene or benzo[a]pyrene. Accelerated removal of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene was observed in P. australis rhizosphere sediments with plants, whereas both compounds persisted in unvegetated sediments without plants and in autoclaved rhizosphere sediments with sterilized plants, suggesting that the accelerated removal resulted largely from biodegradation by rhizosphere bacteria. Initial densities of pyrene-utilizing bacteria were substantially higher in the rhizosphere than in unvegetated sediments, but benzo[a]pyrene-utilizing bacteria were not detected in rhizosphere sediments. Mycobacterium gilvum strains isolated from rhizosphere sediments utilized pyrene aerobically as a sole carbon source and were able to degrade benzo[a]pyrene when induced with pyrene. Phragmites australis root exudates containing phenolic compounds supported growth as a carbon source for the one Mycobacterium strain tested, and induced benzo[a] pyrene-degrading activity of the strain. The stimulatory effect on benzo[a]pyrene biodegradation and the amounts of phenolic compounds in root exudates increased when P. australis was exposed to pyrene. Our results show that Mycobacterium-root exudate interactions can accelerate biodegradation of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene in P. australis rhizosphere sediments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Nine, 20-ha plots that received clearcut harvesting (100% basal area removal), partial harvesting (50% basal area removal), or no harvesting (control) were sampled to measure height, root-collar diameter, leaf, stem and root biomass, and leaf mass ratio (LMR), stem mass ratio (SMR) and root mass ratio (RMR) of ash regeneration. Six years after treatment, plot-level analyses indicated that ash growth was greatest in plots receiving clearcut harvesting, and least in control plots. Examination of LMR. SMR and RMR revealed that this growth response was not associated with acclimation that altered plant morphology. Total biomass ranged 275-fold among sampled plants, and much of this variation was accounted for by measurements of stand leaf area index (LAI). Along the gradient of stand LAI, values greater than 2 inhibited biomass accumulation. Stand LAI values less than 1.5 promoted ash biomass accumulation which reached a maximum where LAI values approached 0.7 and tapered above or below this value. Our findings indicate that green ash regeneration can be managed beneath light canopy cover, and the ability of seedlings to establish and persist beneath closed canopies and vigorously respond to release without having to endure prolonged morphological acclimation provides flexibility in developing regeneration protocols.

We study here the effect of variation in root diameter classes, sampling depth and the inclusion of understorey vegetation root biomass in fine root biomass (FRB) estimates. The FRB estimates for different forest biomes are updated using a database of 512 forest stands compiled from the literature. We also investigate the relationships between environmental or forest stand variables and fine root biomass (<= 2 mm in diameter) at the stand (g m(-2)) and tree level (g tree(-1)). The FRB estimates extrapolated for the whole rooting depth were 526 +/- 321 gm(-2), 775 +/- 474g m(-2) and 776 +/- 518 g m(-2) for boreal, temperate and tropical forests, respectively, and were 26-67% higher than those based on the original sampling depths used. We found significant positive correlations between <= 1 and <= 2 mm diameter roots and between <= 2 and <5 mm roots. The FRB estimates, standardized to the <= 2 mm diameter class, were 34-60% higher and 25-29% smaller than those standardized to the <= 1 mm and <= 5 mm diameter classes, respectively. The FRB of the understorey vegetation accounted for 31% of the total FRB in boreal forests and 20% in temperate forests. The results indicate that environmental factors (latitude, mean annual precipitation, elevation, temperature) or forest stand factors (life form, age, basal area, density) can not explain a significant amount of the variation in the total FRB and a maximum of 30% that in the FRB of trees at the stand level, whereas the mean basal area of the forest stand can explain 49% of the total FRB and 79% of the FRB of trees at the tree level.

Vicieae), and Trifolieae (Papilionoideae); (ii) to characterize those developmental stages of roots that are most useful for comparative studies; (iii) to characterize root developmental patterns during their growth from primary to adult structures; and (iv) to identify developmental patterns that are typical for particular tribes within this plant group. To this end, serial transverse cuts of the main roots of 20 species belonging to the above-mentioned tribes were made from the root tip to the root collar. Vessel density, vessel diameter, secondary cortex area, and xylem area were quantified using appropriate software. Based on root ontogeny, four stages giving evidence for important developmental events were chosen based on which a comparison of the species-specific structures became possible. The first stage corresponds to the primary structure of a root. The second stage corresponds to the onset of cambium and phellogen division, when their first division products become differentiated. The third and fourth stages correspond to adult roots with a well-developed secondary structure. These developmental stages that allowed between-species comparison turned out to be useful characterising those patterns that best typify a particular tribe within the subfamily. Vessel density, vessel diameter, and the xylem transverse area were found to differ significantly between the tribes examined. Some of the analyzed morphological variables had a tribe-specific consistency, so that, together with other characteristics, they should be included in approaches to clarify systematic problems in the legume family.

Standing carbon stocks and rates of sequestration vary with species, site productivity, stand age, and stand structure. The age distribution of forest stands has a particularly large effect on landscape-level carbon storage. Consequently, forest management activities, including creation of early successional habitats, have short-term implications for stand-level carbon storage, but their impact on forest- or landscape-level carbon storage ultimately depends upon the temporal distribution and spatial scale of young forest stands on the landscape.","US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Asheville, NC 28806 USA","Keyser, TL (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, 1577 Brevard Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 USA.",tkeyser@fs.fed.us,,,,,,113,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1568-1319,,978-94-007-1619-3,MANAG FOR ECOSYST,Manag.

The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with year as main plot and turfgrass types as subplot. The cultures were maintained as lawns and were mowed from 3 cm above the ground. The turfgrasses were compared by measuring visual quality after winter and summer, chlorophyll index after winter and summer, rooting depth, verdure and root fresh weight, tiller density, and clippings fresh weight. Poa monoculture had high tiller density, root fresh weight and total fresh weight. Lolium monoculture had high rooting depth after winter and clippings fresh weight. Cynodon monoculture quality was poor with regard to many characters, mainly due to fall sowing. The seed mixture composed of 40% Cynodon + 60% Poa was the best treatment and resulted in the highest verdure fresh weight, chlorophyll index after winter and summer, visual quality after winter and summer, and established a good turf according to the other characters.

Against this background, traditional and well-established silvicultural practices have to be reevaluated concerning their impact on conservation, biodiversity and environmental services and functions but also concerning their capability to ensure the ability of forest ecosystems to adapt to global environmental changes and to deliver the products and services that are requested by society. This chapter reviews exemplarily some of these new aspects, such as climate change, increased importance of goods and services other than timber and increased requirements for inventory, monitoring and planning as well as the consequences for silvicultural science and practice.","Tech Univ Munich, Inst Silviculture, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Weber, M (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Silviculture, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",m.weber@forst.wzw.tum.de,,,,,,139,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1614-9785,,978-3-642-19985-1,TROP FOREST,Trop.

Samples of root system were taken to the lab to measure their quantity and length. In each plot, soil anti-scourability in corresponding soil layer was measured with a C.C. Suoboliev anti-scourability instrument. The results showed the following. (1) The root system was mainly distributed in the 0-40-cm layer of soil, and the root quantity was the greatest in the surface layer of soil. The fine roots smaller than 1 mm in diameter were absolutely predominant in root length. (2) In the same section, the values of the anti-scourability index of surface layer were larger than those of other layers in different types of plants. The tree root system, especially the fine roots less than I mm in diameter, had powerful function on soil loss control. The correlated coefficients between the length, the quantity, and the density of fine roots and the anti-scourability index were 0.817, 0.716, and 0.643, respectively. The mean length of fine roots was a key factor to soil anti-scourability index. The anti-scourability index was closely correlated with non-capillary porosity of each different type of soil, indicating that forest had a soil stability function because their root system improved soil physical properties and finally created a biosoil system with anti-scourability.","[Zhang, J.

We quantified total ecosystem carbon in the 3 major natural upland vegetation communities (grassland, shrubland, and forest) at the northern edge of the North American Great Plains. Total ecosystem carbon storage was significantly greater in forest (125.3 mg C.ha(-1)) than in shrubland (92.4 mg C.ha(-1)) or grassland (80.7 mg C.ha(-1)), and this difference was due mainly to greater aboveground biomass, coarse root biomass, and the presence of a humus layer in the forest. Fine and total root biomass were also greater in forest than shrubland or grassland. In contrast, soil carbon was significantly greater in shrubland (80.6 mg C.ha(-1)) and grassland (75.4 mg C.ha(-1)) than in forest (48.6 mg C.ha(-1)). We also investigated whether aboveground variables could be used to predict belowground carbon pools. Soil carbon increased significantly with aboveground herbaceous biomass, while fine root biomass increased with foliar biomass, but the strongest relationship was between total root biomass and total aboveground biomass (r(2) = 0.785). These are simple and effective predictors of belowground carbon pools. The rapid shift in carbon storage with forest encroachment, from being dominated by soil carbon in grassland to woody vegetation in forest, represents a significant change in ecosystem structure with implications for the carbon budget.","[Pinno, Bradley D.; Wilson, Scott D.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada","Pinno, BD (reprint author), Nat Resources Canada, No Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",brad.pinno@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca,"Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011","Pinno, Brad/0000-0001-5680-3601",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank Saskatchewan Environment for access to the White Butte Recreation Site, M.

Like some other invasive species, garlic mustard is known to exude biochemical compounds that can reduce the fitness of native species when it invades a new habitat. Compounds leached from garlic mustard can reduce growth and survival of mycorrhizal fungi associated with forest trees in eastern North America. We tested whether these compounds could also inhibit the growth or survival of fungi known to infect arthropods, the so-called entomopathogenic (EM) fungi. We found that growth of Beauveria bassiana (Bb), a widespread EM fungus, was significantly reduced when spores were incubated on agar plates made with leachate from garlic mustard. When leachate was added to soil that had been inoculated with Bb spores, waxworms were significantly less infected with Bb than they were on soil inoculated with Bb spores alone. Finally, waxworms were less infected with EM spores when they were held in soil collected from field plots with abundant garlic mustard plants compared to neighbouring soils without garlic mustard plants. Together, these results demonstrate the potential for garlic mustard leachate to significantly inhibit the growth of EM fungi and thereby suppress the effects of EM fungi on arthropods. This effect of garlic mustard could be beneficial to humans if it reduces mortality of arthropods that provide ecosystem services, but it could also be harmful to humans if it reduces mortality of pest insects or arthropod vectors of disease, such as ixodid ticks.","[Keesing, Felicia; Oberoi, Priyanka; Vaicekonyte, Regina; Gowen, Kent; Henry, Lucas; Mount, Sarah; Johns, Philip] Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Ostfeld, Richard S.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Keesing, F (reprint author), Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale On Hudson, NY 12504 USA.",keesing@bard.edu,,,Department of Biology at Bard College,"We gratefully acknowledge support from the Department of Biology at Bard College.

Based on the breast-height diameter (D), a total of 21 sample trees were divided into three tree size classes: the small trees (1 cm <= D <10 cm), the medium trees (10 cm <= D<20 cm) and the big trees (D >= 20 cm). The greatest amount of live branch biomass was located in the middle and bottom layers of the crown, while the largest foliage biomass was found in the middle layer in each tree size category. The relative contribution of canopy biomass components (live branches and foliage) decreased with increasing tree size, while that of coarse root biomass remained almost constant. The relationship between above- and belowground biomass was linear. D and tree height (H) decreased with increasing competition intensity. The small trees had lower average crown ratio and higher average height-to-diameter ratio than those of the medium and big trees. The big trees had higher average stem to foliage mass ratio than those of the small and medium trees. Crown ratio, height-to-diameter ratio and stem to foliage mass ratio were not correlated with competition intensity in the same tree size class. Root to shoot mass ratio was almost constant among tree sizes. Allometric equations based on D gave higher correlations compared to those with other stem diameters: at tree base, at 30-cm height and at crown base.","[Wang, Jinsong; Zhang, Chunyu; Xia, Fucai; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wu, Lianhai] Rothamsted Res, Okehampton, Devon, England; [von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, Gottingen, Germany","Wang, JS (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015",,"State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2011CB403205]; forestry industry of the Finance Ministry of China [200904022, 20100400204]","This research is supported by the State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China (973 Program; Grant No. 2011CB403205), and project supported by the special fund of forestry industry of the Finance Ministry of China (Grant No. 200904022; 20100400204).

Prolonged combustion in duff accumulations at the base of large conifers may lead to fine root mortality, cambial injury, enhanced susceptibility to bark beetle attack, and possibly tree death. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate how moisture content, mineral content, and bulk density affect smouldering combustion in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson) duff mound fuels of the south-eastern Klamath Mountains, California, USA. Samples were divided between upper and lower duff for a total of 100 burn tests. Moisture content was adjusted to observe the transition through the ignition and spread limit. Bulk density, mineral content and percentage consumption were recorded for each burn. The moisture content threshold for smouldering combustion was 57 and 102% respectively for upper and lower duff. Percentage consumption was inversely related to moisture content for both layers of duff, and partially dependent on mineral content for lower duff. Bulk density was a non-significant factor in either ignition or percentage combustion for the conditions examined here. Results from this study identify important attributes of duff that control the burning process in order to inform prescribed burning decisions.","[Garlough, Emily C.; Keyes, Christopher R.] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Keyes, CR (reprint author), Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",christopher.keyes@umontana.edu,,,National Park Service via the Rocky Mountains Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit,"This was a study of the Applied Forest Management Program at the University of Montana, a research and demonstration unit of the Montana Forest and Conservation Experiment Station.

We evaluated the response of 12 aspen (Populus tremula) families to salt stress in two different soils irrigated for 4-weeks with 0, 80 or 160 mM saline solution. Easily measurable characteristics such as shoot height, leaf number, dry mass as well as the distribution of sodium (Na+) ions were measured in 5-month-old aspen seedlings raised in controlled greenhouse conditions on two different soils. Growth among families varied significantly, and the interaction between family and soil type was significant. From 2-5 months, leaf number correlated with that of the first month and salinity tolerance. Sodium ions varied significantly within plants and among families; seedlings that accumulated higher Na+ concentrations in root had more leaves and lower Na+ in shoot. These results suggest that leaf number indicates salt tolerance in young seedlings. Seedling performance was also affected by soil type, especially the root/shoot ratio, suggesting an interaction between salt tolerance and growth medium. This study has identified significant intra-specific variation in salt tolerance of aspen in 160 mM saline and highlighted the potential to select and develop a method for efficient pre-screening of trees to be used in the reclamation of salt-affected land.","[Vaario, Lu-Min; Rousi, Matti] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland; [Yrjala, Kim] Univ Helsinki, MEM Grp, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Sipila, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pulkkinen, Pertti] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Haapastensyrja Res Unit, FI-12600 Layliainen, Finland","Vaario, LM (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, POB 18, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",lu-min.vaario@metla.fi,,"Sipila, Timo/0000-0001-6739-1606",Finnish Forest Research Institute,"This research was supported by the Finnish Forest Research Institute.

With respect to these goals, however, community ecology, in general, and ectomycorrhizal fungal community ecology, in particular, have been rather disappointing. Discussion Indeed, some feel that community ecology is, at best, an esoteric discipline and, at worst, an inane one. But there is hope. As we apply what has been learned about other organisms concerning the relationships between functional traits and success (abundance), it may be possible to elucidate general principles that govern much of the structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Conclusion A hierarchical model of ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure is presented that involves abiotic filtering of immigrant propagules based on functional traits, followed by interspecific competition as ameliorated by disturbance and habitat partitioning, the outcomes of which are dependent on functional traits.","[Koide, Roger T.; Fernandez, Christopher; Petprakob, Krittika] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Koide, Roger T.; Fernandez, Christopher; Petprakob, Krittika] Penn State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Koide, RT (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",rxk13@psu.edu,"Fernandez, Christopher/B-7608-2013; Koide, Roger T/I-4033-2012; Koide, Roger/C-6354-2014","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Fernandez, Christopher/0000-0002-6310-6027",,,,91,32,35,0,71,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Although these forests are very widespread, little is known about the composition and structure of their associated ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Results and discussion We examined seasonal patterns in ectomycorrhizal communities and their response to increased drought using a rainfall exclusion experiment established in a Q. ilex coppice since 2003. Ectomycorrhizae were sampled four times in 2007-2009. By sequencing fungal ITS, we identified 129 species in 1,147 sequenced ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungal community in the surface organic horizon was well described by the logseries theoretical model, with 47.9% of singleton species. The composition of the community was strongly dominated by Basidiomycetes, with three families (Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae and Cortinariaceae) accounting for 72.9% of the root tips. Relative abundance of Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae showed pronounced seasonal shifts. Experimental reduction of rainfall resulted in significant shifts in community composition and seasonal fluctuations but had no effect on global richness of the community. Conclusions Together, these results suggest that the predicted rainfall reduction in this region due to climate change will lead to shifts in species composition in ectomycorrhizal communities.","[Richard, Franck; Roy, Melanie; Shahin, Oula; Sthultz, Christopher; Duchemin, Myriam; Joffre, Richard; Selosse, Marc-Andre] CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Richard, F (reprint author), CNRS, CEFE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",franck.richard@cefe.cnrs.fr,"JOFFRE, Richard/C-1600-2014","JOFFRE, Richard/0000-0001-8205-7710",ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR606-BDIV-06],"This study is part of FUNDIV Grant (ANR606-BDIV-06) funded by the ANR.

Although this view is under debate, the diazotrophs responsible for this activity have still not been investigated in the open sea. In this study, we characterised the surface distribution and species richness of unicellular and filamentous diazotrophs across the Mediterranean Sea by combining microscopic counts with size fractionated in situ hybridization (TSA-FISH), and 16S rDNA and nifH genes phylogenies. These genetic analyses were possible owing to the development of a new PCR protocol adapted to scarce microorganisms that can detect as few as 1 cell ml(-1) in cultures. Low concentrations of diazotrophic cyanobacteria were detected and this community was dominated at 99.9% by picoplankton hybridized to the Nitro821 probe, specific for unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria (UCYN). Among filamentous cyanobacteria only 0.02 filament ml(-1) of Richelia were detected in the eastern basin, while small (0.7-1.5 mu m) and large (2.5-3.2 mu m) Nitro821-targeted cells were recovered at all stations with a mean concentration of 3.5 cell ml(-1). The affiliation of the small Nitro821-targeted cells to UCYN-A was confirmed by 16S and nifH phylogenies in the western Mediterranean Sea. In the central and the eastern Mediterranean Sea no 16S rDNA and nifH sequence from UCYN was obtained as cells concentration were close to, or below PCR detection limit. Bradyrhizobium sequences dominated nifH clone libraries from picoplanktonic size fractions. A few sequences of gamma-proteobacteria were also detected in the central Mediterranean Sea. While low phosphate and iron concentrations could explain the absence of Trichodesmium sp., the factors that prevent the development of UCYN-B and C remain unknown. We also propose that the dominating picoplankters probably developed specific strategies, such as associations with protists or particles, and/or photosynthetic activity, to acquire carbon for sustaining diazotrophy.","[Le Moal, M.; Collin, H.; Biegala, I.

We theoretically analyzed colonization process of mycorrhizal plant in a novel habitat, focusing on the probability of colony establishment under environmental fluctuation. The process is a joint process of two sub-processes before and after the association between the plant and the mycorrhizal fungi. Properties of whole system are influenced by five parameters, means and variances of colony growth rates of two sub-systems, and a reassociation rate. Our analysis revealed that (1) the mean colony growth rates of the host alone and the symbiotic association affect establishment probability in different ways, and (2) a trade-off between the mean colony growth rates of the host alone and the symbiotic association could result in the evolution of either a symbiotic or parasitic relationship, based on a host decision.","[Yamauchi, Atsushi; Nishida, Takaaki; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Yamauchi, Atsushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Nishida, Takaaki] Mitsubishi UFJ Res & Consulting, Chuo Ku, Osaka 5418512, Japan","Yamauchi, A (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano 2-509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",a-yama@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,23,0,0,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-9145,1742-9153,,J PLANT INTERACT,J.

In May 2008, four plots were selected randomly at each fallow. Within each plot five M. sativa, T. officinale and B. sterilis plants were extracted with their associated soil using steel cylinders. The material from each plant species was used for extraction of Collembola and for determination of environmental parameters. Thus, the new aspect of the present study compared to other field studies investigating the relationships between plant and Collembolan communities is the focus on the ""micro-scale"", investigating the Collembolan communities of the soil associated with single plants. We found that species richness and density of total and euedaphic Collembola were significantly higher in B. sterilis than in T. officinale samples with the M. sativa samples being intermediate. Fine-root feeding euedaphic Collembola particularly benefited from the higher amount of fine roots in B. sterilis samples. We also discovered that the age of the fallows had no significant influence on the number of Collembolan species and the density of the Collembolan groups. Notably, however, species of the epedaphic genera Lepidocyrtus and Sminthurinus were associated with the 12-15 year-old fallows and presumably benefited from the high number of plant species in the old fallows. Finally, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the soil organic matter content and the microbial biomass, both potential food sources for many Collembolan species, were important structuring forces for the Collembolan communities.

We examined to what extent leaf life span is related to inter- and intraspecific variation in seedling relative growth rate (RGR). We examined relationships between relative growth rate in mass (RGR(M)) or height (RGR(H)) and leaf life span, together with classical RGR(M) components [net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and leaf area ratio (LAR)] for seedlings of five hardwood species of different successional position across a wide range of environmental resource availability, including the presence or absence of leaf litter in shaded forest understory, small canopy gaps, and large canopy gaps. Both SLA and LAR were negatively correlated with RGR(M) along the environmental gradient for all species. However, positive correlations were observed among species within microsites, indicating that these two components cannot consistently explain the variation in RGR(M). Both NAR and LWR affect interspecific, but not intraspecific, variation in RGR(M). Leaf life span was negatively correlated with either RGR(M) or RGR(H) in both inter- and intraspecific comparisons. Species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth rates, particularly in resource-rich environments. Consequently, leaf life span is a good predictor of seedling RGR.

The root length density (RLD) and root weight density (RWD) were selected as indicators for evaluating soil stability in response to water erosion. The study indicated: 1) The distribution of roots under mixed-species communities was much deeper than under the reed community. 2) There was wide variability in RLD and RWD for five communities at the same intertidal zone. At middle intertidal zone (MIT) and higher intertidal zone (HIT) sites the reed community had a significantly greater overall RLD and RWD than the four mixed-species communities in the 0-10cm depth (p<0.05). At depths greater than 10cm, reed RLD and RWD decreased greatly. 3) Comparison between 8Ta and 4Ta showed the total RLD and RWD increasing with increasing age of T ascendens. On the contrary, the overall RLD and RWD under S. babylonica community decreased greatly with increasing age.

Nodulation of T. repens is often poor, because of suboptimal environmental conditions or absence of host-specific rhizobia. The cultivars Huia, Haifa, Ladino and Regal were selected, as these are popular cultivars available in South Africa. Thousand seed mass (TSM) of each cultivar was measured to determine viability of seed and the possible interaction between TSM and nodulation. Mean TSM values of the cultivars differed significantly, with Huia having the highest TSM followed by Haifa, Ladino and Regal. Biomass production was also measured as an indicator of nitrogen fixation efficiency. The cultivar Huia, with the highest TSM values, resulted in the highest biomass production. Nodulation indices were determined from the size, number and colour of the nodules. All plants, regardless of cultivar, formed nodules within 8 weeks. It was concluded that TSM had no effect on nodulation. Planting date with associated temperature effects and the intrinsic cultivar effect also had no influence on nodulation. It was therefore concluded that nodulation potential of the four cultivars tested was similar under environmental conditions that prevailed during the study.","[Swanepoel, P. A.; Botha, P.

The amount of nitrogen fixed by Rhizobium symbiotically with Trifolium repens (white clover) is ultimately determined by the quality of the soil environment. The effect of SOC on the total number of symbiotic and saprophytic rhizobia was determined. Subsequently, the amount of nitrogen (N) fixed was assessed by using the N difference technique. Most Rhizobium was detected between a SOC content of 2.03% to 3.80% in both inoculated and non-inoculated soils. Inoculation increased the number of rhizobia in soil. Most N was fixed in the soil with the lowest SOC content. Although the amount of N fixed increased as the level of SOC decreased, the efficiency of N fixation decreased proportionally to SOC. Subsequently, more N was rhizodeposited. It was concluded that symbiotic rhizobia introduced by the inoculant were more efficient than free-living rhizobia in soils with higher carbon content, which highlights the importance of inoculation in improving the sustainable production of T. repens pastures.","[Swanepoel, P.

The typical consequences of soil compaction include soil aeration deficiencies, which cause a decrease in soil respiration and fine root growth and the loss of tree vitality; therefore soil protection is an important objective of sustainable forest management. One possibility for minimising the area of compacted soils is to use existing skidding tracks for future harvesting activities. This requires that old skidding tracks can be reliably identified. The micro-relief, field soil science deformation parameters, top soil CO, concentration, root density and forest floor vegetation were investigated at eleven sites in Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, Germany to determine if the methods were suitable for identifying former skidding tracks or compacted soils. Soil compaction can be identified by the field soil science deformation parameters and top soil CO, concentration. The composition of the forest floor vegetation changes with respect to soil structure. Wetland species 199 or ruderal species, such as Carex remota, Carex sylvatica, Deschampsia cespitosa, Holcus lanatus, Impatiens noli-tangere, Juncus effusus and Urtica dioica serve as indicators of soil compaction if they are found growing outside of their normal distribution area. Species that indicate well-structured soils are the following: Dryopteris carthusiana, Dryopteris dilatata, Euphorbia amygdaloides, Fagus sylvatica seedlings, Fraxinus excelsior seedlings, Geranium robertianum, Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Melica uniflora. Using indicator plants of soil compaction is a valid and practicable method to identify compacted soils and old wheeling tracks. The micro-relief, deformation level and CO(2) concentration of soil can provide further evidence of soil compaction.","[Weltecke, Katharina; Gaertig, Thorsten] Hsch Angew Wissensch & Kunst, Fak Ressourcenmanagement, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Weltecke, K (reprint author), Busgenweg 1A, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",weltecke@hawk-hhg.de; gaertig@hawk-hhg.de,,,Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"This project is funded by the programme, ""Sustainable Forestry"" of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

A key factor in the survival of trees is represented by the mycorrhizal association. The success of micropropagated trees also depends on the acquisition of mycorrhizal mutualists. Ectomycorrhizal roots samples from several Quercus species (Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. robur) were examined for mycorrhizal morphotypes' characterization. The samples were collected during the vegetation season from stands located in I Southern and North-Western Romania. 30 morphotypes of active mycorrhizae were identified with Cenococcum geophilum Fr. (Ascomycota) as dominating morphotype. Previous studies on somatic embryogenesis in Q. robur and Q. frainetto demonstrated the utility of in vitro techniques in obtaining plants from these recalcitrant seed producing species, considered at risk in various areas of the country, due to increasingly stressful conditions. The success rate of the acclimatization process depends on the mycorrhization performed either artificially, in the laboratory, either naturally, in the field. Ex situ mycorrhization solutions are considered as less costly, yet efficient alternative to improve the ex vitro survival of micropropagated plants or endangered tree species or for those with economic importance, in vitro propagation is an important conservation tool combined with the acquisition of appropriate mycorrhizal mutualists.","[Fodor, E.; Timofte, A.; Geambasu, T.] Oradea Stn, Oradea, Romania","Fodor, E (reprint author), Oradea Stn, 70 Stefan Cel Mare St, Oradea, Romania.",ecaterina_fodor@yahoo.com,"Fodor, Ecaterina/O-5144-2014","Fodor, Ecaterina/0000-0002-7787-2689",,,,27,3,3,0,15,EDITURA SILVICA,VOLUNTARI,"FOREST RESEARCH MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE ICAS, SOS STEFANESTI NR 128, VOLUNTARI, ILFOV 077190, ROMANIA",1844-8135,,,ANN FOR RES,Ann.

Due to ecological, biological and molecular similarities, they are often studied together. The climatic conditions in this region restrict the build-up of soil organic matter and soils are generally deficient in nitrogen. Studies were carried out to isolate and molecularly characterize the diverse group of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria from root nodules of native A. senegal and P. cineraria and their effect on seed germination and seedling traits in two genotypes of A. senegal. The direct sequencing of 16S rDNA region resulted in molecular identification of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria as Bacillus licheniformis, Sinorhizobium saheli isolated from root nodules of A. senegal and S. kostiense and S. saheli isolated from root nodules of P. cineraria. The partial sequences of 16S rDNA were assigned Gen accession numbers HQ738496, HQ738499, HQ738506 and HQ738508. Scarification treatment with sulphuric acid (98%) for 15 minutes was able to break the exogenous seed dormancy and enhanced germination percentage in control treatment to 90% and 92.5% in A. senegal in genotypes CAZRI 113AS and CAZRI 35AS, respectively. The treatments with Bacillus licheniformis or S. kostiense, either inoculated individually or as coinoculants, had positive effect on phenotypic traits of germination. Two A. senegal genotypes exhibited significant differences with regard to all the phenotypic traits. On the other hand, treatments with S. saheli isolated from either A. senegal or P. cineraria had negative effects on germination and related phenotypic traits. Values of the coeffivient of determination (R-2) over 80% for root length versus shoot length, root/shoot ratio and seedling weight respectively validate that the observed attributes arc inter-dependable and linear progression trend can be predicted.","[Singh, S.

Important lessons emerge by evaluating a set of hypotheses that initially guided the design and longevity of forested FACE experiments. Net primary productivity is increased by elevated CO2, but the response can diminish over time. Carbon accumulation is driven by the distribution of carbon among plant and soil components with differing turnover rates and by interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Plant community structure may change, but elevated CO2 has only minor effects on microbial community structure. FACE results provide a strong foundation for next-generation experiments in unexplored ecosystems and inform coupled climate-biogeochemical models of the ecological mechanisms controlling ecosystem response to the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.","[Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Zak, Donald R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Norby, RJ (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",norbyrj@ornl.gov,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012","Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828",,,,127,302,309,12,382,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1543-592X,,978-0-8243-1442-2,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

This study aimed to investigate the emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes along an altitudinal transect and the relation between these fluxes and other climatic, edaphic and biological variables (temperature, fine roots, litterfall, and soil moisture). Annual means of N2O flux were 3.9 (+/- 0.4), 1.0 (+/- 0.1), and 0.9 (+/- 0.2) ng N cm(-2) h(-1) at altitudes 100, 400, and 1000 m, respectively. On an annual basis, soils consumed CH4 at all altitudes with annual means of -1.0 (+/- 0.2), -1.8 (+/- 0.3), and -1.6 (+/- 0.1) mg m(-2) d(-1) at 100 m, 400 m and 1000 m, respectively. Estimated mean annual fluxes of CO2 were 3.5, 3.6, and 3.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at altitudes 100, 400 and 1000 m, respectively. N2O fluxes were significantly influenced by soil moisture and temperature. Soil-atmosphere exchange of CH4 responded to changes in soil moisture. Carbon dioxide emissions were strongly influenced by soil temperature. While the temperature gradient observed at our sites is only an imperfect proxy for climatic warming, our results suggest that an increase in air and soil temperatures may result in increases in decomposition rates and gross inorganic nitrogen fluxes that could support consequent increases in soil N2O and CO2 emissions and soil CH4 consumption.","[Sousa Neto, E.; Martins, S.

In grassland ecosystems, changes in C cycling are likely to be influenced by land use and management that changes vegetation and the associated soil microbial communities. Here we tested whether changes in grassland vegetation composition resulting from management for plant diversity influences short-term rates of C assimilation and transfer from plants to soil microbes. To do this, we used an in situ C-13-CO2 pulse-labelling approach to measure differential C uptake among different plant species and the transfer of the plant-derived C-13 to key groups of soil microbiota across selected treatments of a long-term plant diversity grassland restoration experiment. Results showed that plant taxa differed markedly in the rate of C-13 assimilation and concentration: uptake was greatest and C-13 concentration declined fastest in Ranunculus repens, and assimilation was least and C-13 signature remained longest in mosses. Incorporation of recent plant-derived C-13 was maximal in all microbial phosopholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers at 24 h after labelling. The greatest incorporation of C-13 was in the PLFA 16:1 omega 5, a marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), while after 1 week most C-13 was retained in the PLFA18:2 omega 6,9 which is indicative of assimilation of plant-derived C-13 by saprophytic fungi. Our results of C-13 assimilation and transfer within plant species and soil microbes were consistent across management treatments. Overall, our findings suggest that plant diversity restoration management may not directly affect the C assimilation or retention of C by individual plant taxa or groups of soil microbes, it can impact on the fate of recent C by changing their relative abundances in the plant-soil system. Moreover, across all treatments we found that plant-derived C is rapidly transferred specifically to AMF and decomposer fungi, indicating their consistent key role in the cycling of recent plant derived C.","[De Deyn, G.

The objective of our study was to assess patterns of belowground carbon allocation among tree species and along seasons. Pure (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling of the entire crown of three different tree species ( beech, oak and pine) was carried out at distinct phenological stages. Excess C-13 in soil CO2 efflux was tracked using tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometry to determine time lags between the start of the labelling and the appearance of C-13 in soil CO2 efflux and the amount of C-13 allocated to soil CO2 efflux. Isotope composition (delta C-13) of CO2 respired by fine roots and soil microbes was measured at several occasions after labelling, together with delta C-13 of bulk root tissue and microbial carbon. Time lags ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 days in beech and oak and were longer in pine (1.6-2.7 days during the active growing season, more than 4 days during the resting season), and the transfer of C to the microbial biomass was as fast as to the fine roots. The amount of C-13 allocated to soil CO2 efflux was estimated from a compartment model. It varied between 1 and 21% of the amount of (CO2)-C-13 taken up by the crown, depending on the species and the season. While rainfall exclusion that moderately decreased soil water content did not affect the pattern of carbon allocation to soil CO2 efflux in beech, seasonal patterns of carbon allocation belowground differed markedly between species, with pronounced seasonal variations in pine and beech. In beech, it may reflect competition with the strength of other sinks (aboveground growth in late spring and storage in late summer) that were not observed in oak. We report a fast transfer of recent photosynthates to the mycorhizosphere and we conclude that the patterns of carbon allocation belowground are species specific and change seasonally according to the phenology of the species.","[Epron, D.; Plain, C.; Priault, P.] Univ Henri Poincare, UMR1137, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Epron, D.; Plain, C.; Priault, P.] INRA, UMR1137, Ctr INRA Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Ngao, J.; Bazot, S.; Barthes, L.] Univ Paris Sud, UMR8079, F-75231 Paris, France; [Ngao, J.; Bazot, S.; Barthes, L.] CNRS, UMR8079, Ctr Rech Gif, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Ngao, J.; Bazot, S.; Barthes, L.] AgroParisTech, UMR8079, F-75231 Paris, France; [Dannoura, M.; Bosc, A.; Loustau, D.] INRA, UR1263, Ctr INRA Bordeaux, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Dannoura, M.] Kyoto Univ, Lab Forest Utilizat, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Bakker, M.

The lack of regularly occurring dry periods and shallow rooting patterns distinguish this experiment from similar experiments conducted in the Amazonian rainforest. We tested the hypotheses that a tree's sun canopy is more affected by soil drought than its shade crown, making tall trees particularly vulnerable even under a perhumid climate, and that extended drought periods stimulate an acclimation in the hydraulic system of the sun canopy. In the abundant and tall tree species Castanopsis acuminatissima (Fagaceae), we compared 31 morphological, anatomical, hydraulic and chemical variables of leaves, branches and the stem together with stem diameter growth between drought and control plots. There was no evidence of canopy dieback. However, the drought treatment led to a 30% reduction in sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity of sun canopy branches, possibly caused by the formation of smaller vessels and/or vessel filling by tyloses. Drought caused an increase in leaf size, but a decrease in leaf number, and a reduction in foliar calcium content. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 signatures of sun canopy leaves gave no indication of a permanent down-regulation of stomatal conductance during the drought, indicating that presenescent leaf shedding may have improved the water status of the remaining leaves. Annual stem diameter growth decreased during the drought, while the density of wood in the recently produced xylem increased in both the stem and sun canopy branches (marginally significant). The sun canopy showed a more pronounced drought response than the shade crown indicating that tall trees with a large sun canopy are more vulnerable to drought stress. We conclude that the extended drought prompted a number of medium-to long-term responses in the leaves, branches and the trunk, which may have reduced drought susceptibility. However, unlike a natural drought, our drought simulation experiment was carried out under conditions of high humidity, which may have dampened drought induced damages.","[Schuldt, B.; Leuschner, C.; Horna, V.] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Moser, G.] Univ Giessen, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Koehler, M.] Univ Gottingen, Burckhardt Inst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [van Straaten, O.] Univ Gottingen, Busgen Inst, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Barus, H.] Tadulako Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Palu 94118, Sulawesi Tengah, Indonesia","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Grisebachstr 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,"Moser, Gerald/F-8085-2011; Yang, Da/L-6267-2013; Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015","Moser, Gerald/0000-0002-0030-2370; Yang, Da/0000-0001-7306-3289; Barus, Henry/0000-0003-2351-2132",German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 552],"This study was conducted in the framework of the joint Indonesian-German Collaborative Research Center ""Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins, Indonesia (STORMA)"" funded by the German Science Foundation (SFB 552).

Focus was on the respiratory turn-over and translocation of recent photosynthates at various positions along the stems, coarse roots and soils. The hypotheses tested were that (1) 2xO(3) decreases the allocation of recent photosynthates to CO2 efflux of stems and coarse roots of adult trees, and that (2) according to their different O3 sensitivities this effect is stronger in beech than in spruce. Labeling of whole tree canopies was applied by releasing C-13 depleted CO2 (delta C-13 of -46.9 %) using a free-air stable carbon isotope approach. Canopy air delta C-13 was reduced for about 2.5 weeks by ca. 8 parts per thousand in beech and 6 parts per thousand in spruce while the increase in CO2 concentration was limited to about 110 mu l l(-1) and 80 mu l l(-1), respectively. At the end of the labeling period, delta C-13 of stem CO2 efflux and phloem sugars was reduced to a similar extend by ca. 3-4% (beech) and ca. 23%( spruce). The fraction of labeled C (f(E,) (new)) in stem CO2 efflux amounted to 0.3 to 0.4, indicating slow C turnover of the respiratory supply system in both species. Elevated O-3 slightly stimulated the allocation of recently fixed photosynthates to stem and coarse root respiration in spruce (rejection of hypothesis I for spruce), but resulted in a significant reduction in C flux in beech (acceptance of hypotheses I and II). The distinct decrease in C allocation to beech stems indicates the potential of chronic O3 stress to substantially mitigate the C sink strength of trees on the long-term scale.","[Ritter, W.; Matyssek, R.; Grams, T.

Thus, the main purpose of this study is to compare the responses of co-occurring species possessing different functional traits, to changes in GW levels (i.e. the lowering of GW levels) in a sand dune ecosystem. For that, five sites were established within a 1 km(2) area in a meso-mediterranean sand dune ecosystem dominated by a Pinus pinaster forest. Due to natural topographic variability and anthropogenic GW exploitation, substantial variability in depth to GW between sites was found. Under these conditions it was possible to identify the degree of usage and dependence on GW of different plant species (two deep-rooted trees, a drought adapted shrub, a phreatophyte and a non-native woody invader) and how GW dependence varied seasonally and between the heterogeneous sites. Results indicated that the plant species had differential responses to changes in GW depth according to specific functional traits (i.e. rooting depth, leaf morphology, and water use strategy). Species comparison revealed that variability in pre-dawn water potential (Psi(pre)) and bulk leaf delta C-13 was related to site differences in GW use in the deep-rooted (Pinus pinaster, Myrica faya) and phreatophyte (Salix repens) species. However, such variation was more evident during spring than during summer drought. The exotic invader, Acacia longifolia, which does not possess a very deep root system, presented the largest seasonal variability in Psi(pre) and bulk leaf delta C-13. In contrast, the response of Corema album, an endemic understory drought-adapted shrub, seemed to be independent of water availability across seasons and sites. Thus, the susceptibility to lowering of GW due to anthropogenic exploitation, in plant species from sand dunes, is variable, being particularly relevant for deep rooted species and phreatophytes, which seem to depend heavily on access to GW.","[Maguas, C.; Rascher, K.

Yet, available information for the propagation and nursery cultivation of this species is conspicuously lacking. To this end, we studied the effect of cover and fertilization on early growth of nursery seedlings over one growing season. Using a split plot experimental design with completely random fixed-effect blocks we monitored seedling growth with three levels of shade (plastic net Raschel (R) of 35, 50, y 80 %) and three doses of slow-release fertilizer (4, 6, and 10 g of Osmocote (R) per litter of growth media). Results demonstrated a significant effect of shade treatments on seedling development. Differences between seedlings treated with 35-50 % when compared with those treated with 80 % cultivated were observed on the evaluated attributes. In general, fertilization did not affect seedling development. In conclusion, it is more efficient to cultivate N. alessandrii nursery seedlings at 35 % shade and 4 g L-1 fertilization. Under this scenario, it is possible to produce plants, on average, with 28 cm in stem length; 4 mm of root collar diameter; 3.2 g plant(-1) total biomass; and quality indices of 6.9 (slenderness), 2.2 (root-shoot), and 2.1 (Dickson).","[Santelices, Romulo] Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Ctr Desarrollo Secano Interior, Talca, Chile; [Navarro Cerrillo, Rafael M.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Ingn Forestal, Fac Agron & Montes, Cordoba, Spain; [Drake, Fernando] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forest, Dept Manejo Bosques & Medioambiente, Concepcion, Chile; [Mena, Carlos] Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Ctr Geomat, Talca, Chile","Santelices, R (reprint author), Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Ctr Desarrollo Secano Interior, Casilla 617, Talca, Chile.",rsanteli@ucm.cl,,,,,,22,4,5,0,11,"UNIV AUSTRAL CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS FORESTALES",VALDIVIA,"CASILLA 567, VALDIVIA, 00000, CHILE",0717-9200,,,BOSQUE,Bosque,,2011,32,1,,,,,85,88,,10.4067/S0717-92002011000100010,,,4,Ecology; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,745XX,WOS:000289206000010,,"Bronze, Other Gold",,,10/31/19J,"Golinska, P; Dahm, H",,,,"Golinska, Patrycja; Dahm, Hanna",,,Enzymatic activity of actinomycetes from the genus Streptomyces isolated from the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the Pinus sylvestris,DENDROBIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest soil Streptomyces; chitinases; proteases; pectinases; cellulases,ROOT-FREE SOIL; PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY; PECTOLYTIC ACTIVITY; CELLULASE ACTIVITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CHITINASE; SYSTEM; ENZYMES; CLONING,"The enzymatic activity (chitinolytic, proteolytic, pectolytic and cellulolytic) of twenty strains of Streptomyces isolated from soil and rhizosphere of Scots pine was analyzed. Most strains produced chitinases, catalyzing the degradation of chitin, the main component of fungal cell walls including fungi pathogenic for plants. This activity was about 4 times higher in the presence of Fusarium oxysporum than Rhizoctonia solani mycelium or chitin flakes. The number of the proteolytic strains was also significant. In general, rhizosphere and soil organisms synthesized comparable amounts of these enzymes. Over half of the analyzed Streptomyces strains produced pectolytic enzymes (polygalacturonase, pectin lyase and pectate lyase). This property was more common among rhizosphere than among soil strains. The Streptomyces strains also showed cellulolytic activity (endocellulases, exocellulases) - enzymes decomposing basic components of cell walls of plant and lower fungi (cellulose). The cellulolytic activity was differentiated and depended on the Streptomyces strain. Conclusion of our studies is that Streptomyces are the microorganisms more chitinolytic and proteolytic than pectolytic and cellulolytic.","[Golinska, Patrycja; Dahm, Hanna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Microbiol, Inst Gen & Mol Biol, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Golinska, P (reprint author), Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Microbiol, Inst Gen & Mol Biol, Gagarina 9, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",golinska@umk.pl,"Dahm, Hanna/O-8721-2015; Golinska, Patrycja/G-4206-2014","Golinska, Patrycja/0000-0001-9154-8191","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [2 PO4 C 040 29]",This research has been financed by a grant from Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Grant No. 2 PO4 C 040 29),,42,4,6,0,11,BOGUCKI WYDAWNICTWO NAUKOWE,POZNAN,"GORNA WILDA 90, POZNAN, 61-576, POLAND",1641-1307,,,DENDROBIOLOGY,Dendrobiology,,2011,65,,,,,,37,46,,,,,10,Plant Sciences; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Forestry,882UX,WOS:000299590500004,,,,,10/31/19S,"Bucking, H",,"Rai, M; Varma, A",,"Bucking, Heike",,,Ectomycoremediation: An Eco-Friendly Technique for the Remediation of Polluted Sites,DIVERSITY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY OF ECTOMYCORRHIZAE,Soil Biology,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CONTAMINATED SOIL; SCOTS PINE; FLUORESCENT PSEUDOMONADS; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; IONIZING-RADIATION; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; FOREST HUMUS,,"S Dakota State Univ, Biol & Microbiol Dept, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Bucking, H (reprint author), S Dakota State Univ, Biol & Microbiol Dept, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",,,,,,,103,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1613-3382,,978-3-642-15195-8,SOIL BIOL,Soil Biol.,,2011,25,,,,,,209,229,,,10.1007/978-3-642-15196-5,,21,Agronomy; Soil Science,Agriculture,BSM95,WOS:000284978900010,,,,,10/31/19S,"Sharma, R; Rajak, RC",,"Rai, M; Varma, A",,"Sharma, Rohit; Rajak, Ram C.",,,Ectomycorrhizal Interaction Between Cantharellus and Dendrocalamus,DIVERSITY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY OF ECTOMYCORRHIZAE,Soil Biology,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,ACID-PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY; IN-VITRO; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; FOREST SOILS; DOUGLAS-FIR; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; LACCARIA-LACCATA; ORGANIC-MATTER,,"[Sharma, Rohit] Univ Pune Ganeshkhind, Natl Ctr Cell Sci, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India; [Rajak, Ram C.] Priyadarshini Housing Soc, Ctr Biotechnol, SGH, Jabalpur 482001, Madhya Pradesh, India","Sharma, R (reprint author), Univ Pune Ganeshkhind, Natl Ctr Cell Sci, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",,,,,,,124,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1613-3382,,978-3-642-15195-8,SOIL BIOL,Soil Biol.,,2011,25,,,,,,405,428,,,10.1007/978-3-642-15196-5,,24,Agronomy; Soil Science,Agriculture,BSM95,WOS:000284978900018,,,,,10/31/19B,"Branco, S",,"Grillo, O; Venora, G",,"Branco, Sara",,,Fungal Diversity - An Overview,DYNAMICAL PROCESSES OF BIODIVERSITY - CASE STUDIES OF EVOLUTION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; QUERCUS SPP.; SOIL; EVOLUTION; REVEAL; MORPHOLOGY; GRADIENT; FORESTS,,"[Branco, Sara] Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Branco, Sara] ESA Polytech Inst Braganca, Braganca, Portugal","Branco, S (reprint author), Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,76,1,1,1,3,INTECH EUROPE,RIJEKA,"JANEZA TRDINE9, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",,,978-953-307-772-7,,,,2011,,,,,,,211,226,,,10.5772/1830,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Plant Sciences; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BE9OQ,WOS:000377981200010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Stavi, I; Lal, R; Owens, LB",,,,"Stavi, Ilan; Lal, Rattan; Owens, Lloyd B.",,,Effects of cattle grazing during the dormant season on soil surface hydrology and physical quality in a moist-temperate region,ECOHYDROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,grazing system; growing season; Midwest USA; soil physical properties; trampling action; water infiltrability,SOUTHERN PIEDMONT USA; ORGANIC-CARBON; PENETRATION RESISTANCE; SEMIARID RANGELAND; CRESTED WHEATGRASS; NATIVE RANGELANDS; MEADOW SOILS; NO-TILL; STABILIZATION; PASTURES,"Livestock grazing in paddocks of temperate regions during the dormant season affects soil surface hydrology and physical quality, thus, impacting its capacity to function. However, very few studies have dealt with these effects in temperate-moist regions. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of grazing on these variables, with reference to soil hydrological and physical characteristics. Soil properties were measured in a paddock under rotational grazing during the growing season only (GR) and compared with those under grazing during the dormant season and rotational grazing during the growing season (DO). Soil series in both paddocks is Coshocton (fine loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquultic Hapludalfs). Soil properties were studied for 0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm depths. In comparison with GR, DO had a smaller soil water sorptivity (36.2 vs 19.4 mm min(-0.5)),transmissivity (2.2 vs 0.6 mm min(-1)), equilibrium infiltration rate (4.8 vs 1.4 mm min(-1)) and cumulative infiltration in 3 h (865.6 vs 260.0 mm). In addition, GR had larger volumetric field moisture capacity (41.4 vs 39.3%), water stable aggregates (880 vs 830 g kg(-1)), coarse root (>1 mm) biomass (12.8 vs 7.2 mg cm(-3)), smaller penetration resistance (0.93 vs 1.42 MPa) and bulk density (1.24 vs 1.44 g cm(-3)). A small difference between GR and DO was observed in vane shear strength (130.3 vs 124.8 kPa), and no difference was found in aggregate's mean weight diameter. Soil properties differed among depths, and the effect of grazing decreased with increased depth.

In this study, we explored the relative contributions of biotic interactions and physical factors to habitat segregation in T. micrantha. Field surveys showed that soils from landslides were significantly richer in available phosphorus and harbored distinct arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities compared to gap soils. Greenhouse experiments designed to determine the effect of these abiotic and biotic differences showed that: (1) both landslide and gap species performed better in sterilized soil from their own habitat, (2) the availability of phosphorus and nitrogen was limiting in gap and landslide soils, respectively, (3) a standardized AMF inoculum increased performance of both species, but primarily on gap soils, and (4) landslide and gap species performed better when sterilized soils were inoculated with the microbial inoculum from their own habitat. A field experiment confirmed that survival and growth of each species was highest in its corresponding habitat. This experiment also showed that browsing damage significantly decreased survival of gap Trema on landslides. We conclude that belowground interactions with soil microbes and aboveground interactions with herbivores contribute in fundamental ways to processes that may promote and reinforce adaptive speciation.","[Pizano, Camila; Mangan, Scott A.; Herre, Edward Allen; Dalling, James W.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, APO, AA 34002 USA; [Pizano, Camila] Univ Los Andes, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Mangan, Scott A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Eom, Ahn-Heum] Korea Natl Univ Educ, Dept Biol, Chungbuk 363791, South Korea; [Dalling, James W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Pizano, C (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",pizanoc@ufl.edu,,,Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute [003109000-5]; Andrew Mellon Foundation; Mars Corporation,"We thank A.

However, in nitrogen-limited ecosystems, increased productivity may cause a decline in soil nitrogen (N) availability and induce a negative feedback on further enhancement of forest production. In a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, the response of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) productivity to elevated CO2 concentrations [CO2] has declined over time, but documenting an associated change in soil N availability has been difficult. Here we assess the time history of soil N availability through analysis of natural N-15 abundance in archived samples of freshly fallen leaf litterfall. Litterfall delta N-15 declined from 1998 to 2005, and the rate of decline was significantly faster in elevated [CO2]. Declining leaf litterfall delta N-15 is indicative of a tighter ecosystem N cycle and more limited soil N availability. By integrating N availability over time and throughout the soil profile, temporal dynamics in leaf litterfall delta N-15 provide a powerful tool for documenting changes in N availability and the critical feedbacks between C and N cycles that will control forest response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.","[Garten, Charles T., Jr.; Iversen, Colleen M.; Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Garten, CT (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",gartenctjr@ornl.gov,"Iversen, Colleen M/B-8983-2012; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012","Iversen, Colleen M/0000-0001-8293-3450; Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Garten, Charles/0000-0001-5303-3031","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","Research was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research.

We used attributes of their sampling design to distinguish three subsets of data according to stringent, intermediate, and lax selection criteria. We tested (1) whether uncertainty over identification of shape increases as the criteria of inclusion of studies relaxes and (2) whether studies that conform to stringent selection criteria show robustness in SRA patterns to variation in method used to identify shape. We identified the shape of each SRA relationship using statistical and visual methods; data sets that suggested several shapes as equally likely were sorted out by consensus. Arthropods suggested multiple forms in the SRA relationship, with predominance of hump-shaped patterns in the stringent subset. Uncertainty over identification of shape increased after application of intermediate and lax selection criteria. The method of analysis interacted with the quality of basic data to influence the relative distribution of patterns. We concluded that the gathering of large quantities of data is insufficient and that critical evaluation of literature is crucial to infer with confidence the general shape of ecological patterns in meta-analysis.","[Werenkraut, Victoria; Ruggiero, Adriana] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Werenkraut, V (reprint author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",vicwkt@gmail.com,,,CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP5113]; Universidad Nacional del Comahue,"J.

Most frequently, resource-based or competitive interactions are thought to drive this positive diversity-productivity relationship. Here, we ask whether suppression of plant productivity by soil fungal pathogens might also drive a positive diversity-productivity relationship. We created plant assemblages that varied in diversity and crossed this with a +/- soil fungicide treatment. In control (non-fungicide treated) assemblages there was a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and above-ground plant biomass. However, in fungicide-treated assemblages this relationship disappeared. This occurred because fungicide increased plant production by an average of 141% at the lower ends of diversity but boosted production by an average of only 33% at the higher ends of diversity, essentially flattening the diversity-productivity curve. These results suggest that soil pathogens might be a heretofore unappreciated driver of diversity-productivity relationships.","[Maron, John L.; Marler, Marilyn] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Biol & Phys Geog Unit, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Cleveland, Cory C.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Maron, JL (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",john.maron@mso.umt.edu,,,,,,44,175,179,7,211,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Here we tested whether clipping techniques influenced the aboveground and belowground structures of 2 closely related invasive taxa: Fallopia japonica and Fallopia x bohemica. We compared the aboveground response (plant height, number of stems, and number of leaves) of rhizome fragments to clipping of both taxa. The second experiment was aimed at comparing the belowground response of both taxa to the same clipping disturbance. Rhizome fragments were planted in rhizoboxes and subjected to a clipping disturbance after 4 weeks of growth. Regrowth, belowground biomass, specific root length, total root length, and distribution of roots in 3 soil layers were measured. Aboveground plant traits of both taxa were unaffected by clipping. On the other hand, clipping induced a reduction in belowground dry mass and an increased proportion of roots in the upper layer of soil in F. japonica. Both taxa of Asian knotweeds are highly tolerant to clipping because they are able to cope with aerial biomass loss. Nevertheless, this tolerance seems to be lower in F. japonica. The potential implications for the impact of these invasive species are discussed.","[Rouifed, Soraya; Bornette, Gudrun; Mistler, Lubiana; Piola, Florence] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux 5023, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Rouifed, S (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux 5023, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",soraya.rouifed@univ-lyon1.fr,"Bornette, Gudrun/B-3938-2009; bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017","bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060",FEDER (Plan Loire Grandeur Nature)European Union (EU); Agence de l'Eau Loire Bretagne; Conseil General du Departement de la LoireRegion Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; Region Rhone-AlpesRegion Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes,"The authors would like to thank F.

Both rhizophores and roots are dichotomously branched, forming a multibranch rhizophore-root system. In the examined Selaginella kraussiana, the first dichotomous division of a rhizophore results in the initiation of the twin root meristems, giving rise to the root primordia. These primordia are temporarily arrested in growth, but at the same time they are elevated, hidden inside the rhizophore apex due to the activity of a meristematic zone at the rhizophore axis. This meristematic region, located basally to the root meristems, apart from the rhizophore tissues consists of the derivative cells of root primordia and may be considered as a specific intercalary meristem. The growth mode of the roots is similar to that of the rhizophore, including dichotomous branching of the meristem and a temporary developmental arrest of the subsequent root primordia. The reiteration of the developmental program also involves the formation of new intercalary zones, thus through divisional activity, the root with dichotomized apex grows for some time as a single axis and, then the young roots emerge. At each step of the rhizophore-root branch system formation, tissues of the parental axis contribute significantly to the growth and emergence of the next axes. Therefore, dichotomous branching in Selaginella appears to be exceptional in comparison with other known dichotomies of axial organs. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Performance, vitality and persistence of a plant are affected by this partitioning process and vice versa. Under harsh climatic conditions such as cold temperature and seasonal drought, perennial plants often invest more in below-ground than above-ground structures. Festuca orthophylla in the subtropical Bolivian Altiplano does not match this 'rule'. This species produces tall, evergreen tussocks, persisting decades and dominating the semi-arid, Andean landscape over thousands of square kilometers at elevation between 3600 and 4600 m a.s.l. The shallow rooting system represents only 21% of total biomass. The tussock base (root-stocks composed of the network of branching below-ground shoots and tiller meristems) comprises 28% of the total biomass. Although located partly below the soil surface, much of this biomass compartment is functionally above-ground (the basis of shoots). With their below-ground position, tiller meristems are protected against grazing and trampling by camelids as well as, to some degree, against fire and freezing. Fifty one percent of the biomass is above-ground (live leaves and inflorescences). In terms of phytomass (including attached necromass), 75% is above-ground. On average, a tussock consists of 3200 tightly packed total tillers (56% are live). Tillers emerge regularly intravaginally (i.e. within the leaf sheath of an existing mother tiller), resulting in dense canopies with strong self-shading: eighty percent of green foliage experience less than 50% of the incident light. The most important Altiplano plant species thus has morphological traits in favour of protection and survival rather than productivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Over 200,000 nursery seedlings have been planted in the western U.S. but survival rates are low and in many areas approach zero. One possibility for enhancing seedling survival is application of mycorrhizal fungi in the greenhouse before out-planting. All pines require ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) to survive in nature, including whitebark pine. Non-mycorrhizal seedlings are at risk of dying when planted in soil lacking appropriate mycorrhizal fungi; this might include ghost forests, severe burns, dry habitats and areas not previously in pine. This study screened 25 isolates of native ECM fungi (primarily suilloids) from whitebark pine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Area as a preliminary step in development of an effective inoculum for whitebark pine seedlings grown in forest nurseries. Most are 'suilloid' fungi specific for 5-needle pines. A majority grew well in vitro and selected strains were then used to develop various types of mycorrhizal inoculum. Four basic inoculation methods were tested under greenhouse conditions using spore slurries and soil inocula. Spore slurries added to soil produced the highest rate of mycorrhizal colonization (100 per cent frequency) in the shortest time (3-5 months), but colonization also occurred with soil inoculum (mycelium). Fertilization was found to suppress mycorrhizal colonization at least at the high levels tested. Soil substrate was found to be an important factor in ECM colonization and some soil mixes suppressed or prevented colonization. Commercial inoculum is not recommended since it risks introduction of alien fungi, it may not favor 5-needle pines, and therefore has the potential to disturb sensitive whitebark pine systems. Here we report results from preliminary trials and discuss on-going research to provide up-to-date information.","[Cripps, Cathy L.; Grimme, Eva] Montana State Univ, Dept Plant Sci & Plant Pathol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Cripps, CL (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Dept Plant Sci & Plant Pathol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Forest Health and Protection grant through the Whitebark Pine Restoration Projects Program; Parks Canada through Cyndi Smith at the Waterton Lakes-Glacier International Peace Park","This research is funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Forest Health and Protection grant through the Whitebark Pine Restoration Projects Program (2008-2010), in particular we thank John Schwandt and Kent Eggleston for their help.

Soil respiration of poplar plantations at three developmental stages was investigated in 2007 and 2008. The results showed that mean soil respiration rate was 5.74, 5.10 and 4.71 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for stands of 2-, 7- and 12-year-old, respectively, during the growing season. Soil temperature decreased with increasing plantation age and canopy cover. As plantation matured, fine root biomass also declined. Multiple regression analysis suggested that soil temperature in the upper layer could explain 73-77% of the variation in soil respiration and fine root biomass in the upper layer could explain further 5-8%. The seasonal dynamics of soil respiration was mainly controlled by soil temperature rhythm and fine root growth since soil water availability remained adequate due to monthly irrigation. Spatial variability of soil respiration varied considerably among three age classes, with the coefficient of variation of 28.8%, 22.4% and 19.6% for stands of 2-, 7- and 12-year-old, respectively. The results highlight the importance of the development stage in soil carbon budget over a rotation, since both temporal and spatial variation in soil respiration displayed significant differences at different developmental stages.

Quantifying pathways and temporal dynamics of carbon (C) flux between plants and soil is critical to our understanding of the long-term fate of C stored in soils. The potential priming of old organic matter decomposition by fresh C input from plants means that the impact of environmental changes on the interactions between plant C allocation and soil C storage need to be better understood. We used forest girdling to investigate the partitioning of total soil CO2 efflux (R-S) into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) flux components and their interaction with litter decomposition. 2. The reduction in R-S in girdled plots stabilized within two weeks at 65% of control plot values, indicating that R-S is dominated by R-H, and that only a small pool of available non-structural C remains in roots in late summer to sustain rhizosphere metabolic processes. R-A contributions declined from 35% late in the growing season to about 25% in winter. 3. Our results indicate that actual root respiration (R-R) and respiration by ectyomycorrhizas and other rhizospheric organisms (R-M) contribute c. 50% each to R-A between September and early November. During winter, R-A remained significantly greater than zero despite frequent sub-zero air temperatures, with R-M being a dominant component of R-A during this period. 4. Forest girdling significantly increased the age of C in soil-respired CO2, consistent with the removal of contemporary C derived from R-A. Partitioning of soil CO2 efflux on the basis of 14C results shows good agreement with the flux reduction observed between girdled and control plots. 5. Litter bag incubations indicate a promoting influence of an intact C supply to the rhizosphere on decomposition, indicating a positive rhizosphere priming effect. 6. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate significant contribution of mycorrhizas and other rhizosphere organisms to R-S, and suggest a direct link between an intact rhizosphere and litter decomposition dynamics. These results highlight the tight coupling between autotroph activity and soil decomposition processes in forest soils, and add to the growing body of evidence that plant and soil processes cannot be treated separately.","[Subke, Jens-Arne] Univ York, Dept Biol, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Leronni, Vincenzo] Univ Bari, Dept Plant Prod Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Garnett, Mark H.] NERC Radiocarbon Facil Environm, Glasgow G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland","Subke, JA (reprint author), Univ Stirling, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",jens-arne.subke@stir.ac.uk,"Subke, Jens-Arne/M-3049-2013; Garnett, Mark H/C-2377-2009","Subke, Jens-Arne/0000-0001-9244-639X; Garnett, Mark H/0000-0001-6486-2126","UK Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E004512/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/E004512/1, NRCF010001]","We would like to thank the Forestry Commission for England and Wales, and particularly Nick Short for the permission to conduct this girdling experiment.

Consequently the need to grow disease-free plants using non-chemical fertilizers and pesticides is the need of the hour. Mentha arvensis cv. kosi is highly infested with Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, and severe oil yield loss occurs due to this nematode pest. Employing ecofriendly ways of nematode management, the mutualistic endophytes (Trichoderma harzianum strain Thu, Glomus intraradices) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas fluorescens) were assessed individually and in combination on plant biomass, oil yield of menthol mint (M. arvensis cv. kosi), reproduction potential and population development of root knot nematode, M. incognita under glasshouse conditions. These microbes enhanced the plant biomass and percent oil yield both with and without M. incognita inoculation. Dual application of mutualistic fungal endophytes and plant growth promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPRs) may be a wise option for enhancing the oil yield and tolerance of menthol mint against M. incognita infection.","[Pandey, Rakesh; Mishra, Arun Kumar; Tiwari, Sudeep; Singh, H.

One hundred seedlings were sampled in 225 m(2) area using a systematic grid design. For each seedling, 20 individual root tips were randomly collected, morphotyped, and surface sterilised for fungal isolation in pure culture. Results showed that ECM community was comprised of nine distinct morphotypes among which Thelephora terrestris (39.7%), Hebeloma sp. (17.8%) and Suillus luteus (6.1%) were the most abundant. Spatial distribution of ECMs in the nursery plot was determined by their relative abundance: even in common ECMs and random in rare ones. Fungal isolation yielded 606 pure cultures, representing 71 distinct taxa. The most commonly isolated fungi were the ascomycetes Neonectria macrodidyma (20.3%), Phialocephala fortinii (13.5%), Neonectria radicicola (6.3%) and the ECM basidiomycete H. cavipes (4.5%). Intraspecific genetic diversity within 27 H. cavipes isolates was studied using two methods: restriction digestion of the amplified intergenic spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA and genealogical concordance of five genetic markers. Five and eight genotypes were revealed by each respective method, but both of those were largely consistent, in particular, in determining the largest genotype (A) composed of 18 isolates. Mapping positions for each H. cavipes isolate and genotype in the field showed that isolates of the A genotype covered a large part of the nursery plot. This suggests that H. cavipes is largely disseminated by vegetative means of local genotypes and that nursery cultivation practices are likely to contribute to the dissemination of this species in the forest nursery soils.","[Menkis, Audrius; Vasaitis, Rimvydas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Menkis, A (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, POB 7026, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",Audrius.Menkis@mykopat.slu.se,,"Vasaitis, Rimvydas/0000-0001-9349-4625; Menkis, Audrius/0000-0002-6545-8907","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [042622 LITCOAST]","We thank Karelyn Cruz for linguistic corrections.

Completely surveyed communities follow log-normal distribution, whereas power law functions best describe incompletely censused communities. It is arguable whether the statistics behind those theories can be applied to voluminous next generation sequencing data in microbiology by treating individual DNA sequences as counts of molecular taxonomic units (MOTUs). This study addresses the suitability of species abundance models in three groups of plant-associated fungal communities - phyllosphere, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We tested the impact of differential treatment of molecular singletons on observed and estimated species richness and species abundance distribution models. The arbuscular mycorrhizal community of 48 MOTUs was exhaustively sampled and followed log-normal distribution. The ectomycorrhizal (153 MOTUs) and phyllosphere (327 MOTUs) communities significantly differed from log-normal distribution. The fungal phyllosphere community in particular was clearly undersampled. This undersampling bias resulted in strong sensitivity to the exclusion of molecular singletons and other rare MOTUs that may represent technical artefacts. The analysis of abundant (core) and rare (satellite) MOTUs clearly identified two species abundance distributions in the phyllosphere data - a log-normal model for the core group and a log-series model for the satellite group. The prominent log-series distribution of satellite phyllosphere fungi highlighted the ecological significance of an infrequent fungal component in the phyllosphere community.","[Unterseher, Martin; Schnittler, Martin] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Jumpponen, Ari] Kansas State Univ, Ecol Genom Inst, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Oepik, Maarja; Tedersoo, Leho; Moora, Mari] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Dormann, Carsten F.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Unterseher, M (reprint author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Grimmer Str 88, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.",martin.unterseher@uni-greifswald.de,"Schnittler, Martin/A-8916-2013; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Unterseher, Martin/B-2381-2014; Tedersoo, Leho/H-3541-2012","Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Dormann, Carsten/0000-0002-9835-1794","Estonian Science Foundation (University of Tartu)Eesti Teadusfond (ETF) [7371, 7434, JD-0092J, 7738, SF0180098s08]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [PERG03-GA-2008-231034]; Centre of Excellence FIBIR; Helmholtz AssociationHelmholtz Association [VH-NG 247]; Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Greifswald","The phyllosphere data were collected with support from Kansas State University, Division of Biology and Ecological Genomics Institute.

Needed now are studies that focus on the relative ecological importance of mycorrhizas, specifically how the effect of mycorrhizas compares with other environmental factors present in soil that may affect plant growth. In a greenhouse, we grew Douglas-fir seedlings in soil collected from 6 sites in a dry region in British Columbia, Canada, predicting that these soils would vary in the ectomycorrhizal fungi present, and in several physical characteristics. In addition, we imposed a gradient of soil moisture. Using model selection based on information theory and multimodel inference, we ranked the relative importance of several abiotic (watering level, pH, C:N) and biotic (ectomycorrhizal richness and % colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi) variables in models predicting seedling biomass. Variation in abiotic factors, namely watering level and pH, tempered by the effects of ectomycorrhizal richness, contributed most to variation in seedling growth. For young Douglas-fir seedlings growing in disturbed environments, small shifts in the species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi bear importance, yet overall remain subordinate to abiotic gradients. By utilizing natural variability in soil abiotic properties and mycorrhizal community composition along with experimental manipulations of additional factors, the experimental approach utilized here helps to move us beyond simply testing for the significance of mycorrhizas for plants to understanding the relative importance of mycorrhizas in comparison with other influential ecological factors.

In particular, we asked if the succession of AMF communities follows or precedes the primary plant succession, and we checked the mycorrhizal status of the pioneer plant Epilobium fleischeri. Soil samples were taken at pioneer and dense grassland sites established during the last hundred years representing different periods of glacier retreat: 1875-1900,1940-1950,1970-1980 and 1990-2000. Extraradical hyphal length densities and AMF spore populations were analyzed in soil samples. Spore formation and mycorrhizal root colonization were monitored in trap cultures grown on Trifolium pratense, Lolium perenne, Plantago lanceolata and Hieracium pilosella or on E. fleischeri over 14 months. We found that E. fleischeri is strongly arbuscular mycorrhizal, but plants in closest distance to the glacier (glacier retreat in the last 4-6 years before sampling) were non-mycorrhizal. Spore densities and root colonization in trap cultures were generally low in samples from glacier stage 1990-2000. Highest spore density and colonization were found for the sites ice-free since 1970-1980, whilst highest AMF species richness and hyphal length densities were found at the sites ice-free since 1875-1900. Our findings show an establishment of a few AMF pioneer species (e.g. Diversispora versiformis and Acaulospora punctata) within 5-10 years and species rich AM F communities at sites ice-free for 100 years (28 species). Their succession generally follows the succession of the plant communities. We conclude that AMF pioneer species might be mainly distributed by wind transport while other AMF fungi (e.g. Glomus rub:forme and Glomus aureum) rather need a below-ground hyphal network to invade new areas.

Here, we tested the influence of HL on the interaction between Retama sphaerocarpa, a nurse lifter shrub from western Mediterranean basin, and the protege shrub Marrubium vulgare. Seedlings of Marrubium were planted under the canopy of Retama in three tube types inserted into the soil. Tubes either did not affect (Mesh), reduced (Netting) or fully prevented root competition (PVC). At the same time, these tubes allowed (Mesh, Netting) or prevented (PVC) soil water flux to/from the tube. Additional seedlings were planted in Mesh tubes in gaps (open spaces between shrubs). Hydraulic lift was measured using soil psychrometers. We detected HL patterns only in mesh and Netting tubes but not in solid-walled PVC tubes. Seedling survival was comparable where root competition was reduced and HL allowed (Netting) and where they were fully prevented (PVC) while survival was 23% lower in Mesh tubes (full root competition plus HL) and no seedlings survived in gaps. Differences in seedlings biomass showed somehow similar patterns, although biomass was greatest in PVC tubes followed by Netting tubes. These results show that, although HL might have contributed to seedling performance under the canopy of Retama, it did not offset root competition from neighbours; when full root competition and HL occurred, competitive effects were stronger than facilitative effects of HL. Overall, intense root competition underneath nurse plants may outweigh the positive effects of the extra water meant by HL. Rather, microclimate amelioration and increased soil fertility under shrubs could account for the reported facilitation of Marrubium seedlings by Retama. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

The expression of nifH genes in the stems and roots of sugarcane plants at 50 (or 59) and 100 days after transplanting was investigated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by examining the nifH nucleotide sequence diversity. N-2 fixation was assessed by the N-15-dilution method. The nifH RNA sequences in the stems and roots of the first experiment were similar to those of Bradyrhizobium sp. and Azorhizobium caulinodans. In the second experiment, nifH expression from these bacteria was not detected in the stems. nifH gene expression in the stems was in accordance with 18-24% N derived from air in the high-temperature season and negligible in the low-temperature season. Both the proliferation of N-2 fixers and expression of the nifH gene indicated that bacteria similar to rhizobia may contribute to N-2 fixation in sugarcane under our experimental conditions.","[Thaweenut, Nisarat; Hachisuka, Yusuke; Yanagisawa, Shuichi; Yoneyama, Tadakatsu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Thaweenut, Nisarat; Ando, Shotaro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Natl Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Nasushiobara, Tochigi 3292793, Japan","Yoneyama, T (reprint author), Tsukuho 3-3-12, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3003257, Japan.",tadakatsu_yoneyama@opal.ocn.ne.jp,,,"Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Council, Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sciences and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [B-1538047]","We would like to thank Drs.

It is the most widely distributed vegetation on the vast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Previous studies suggest that meadow ecosystems play the most important role in both uptake and storage of carbon in the plateau. The ecosystem has been considered currently as an active ""CO2 sink"", in which roots may contribute a very important part, because of the large root biomass, for storage and translocation of carbon to soil. To bridge the gap between the potential importance and few experimental data, root systems, root biomass, turnover rate, and net primary production were investigated in a Kobresia humilis meadow on the plateau during the growing season from May to September in 2008 and 2009. We hypothesized that BNPP/NPP of the alpine meadow would be more than 50%, and that small diameter roots sampled in ingrowth cores have a shorter lifespan than the lager diameter roots, moreover we expected that roots in surface soils would turn over more quickly than those in deeper soil layers. The mean root mass in the 0-20 cm soil layer, investigated by the sequential coring method, was 1995 +/- 479 g m(-2) and 1595 +/- 254 g m(-2) in growing season of 2008 and 2009, respectively. And the mean fine root biomass in ingrowth cores of the same soil layer was 119 +/- 37 g m(-2) and 196 +/- 45 g m(-2) in the 2 years. Annual total NPP was 12387 kg ha(-1) year(-1), in which 53% was allocated to roots. In addition, fine roots accounted for 33% of belowground NPP and 18% of the total NPP, respectively. Root turnover rate was 0.52 year(-1) for bulk roots and 0.74 year(-1) for fine roots. Furthermore, roots turnover was faster in surface than in deeper soil layers. The results confirmed the important role of roots in carbon storage and turnover in the alpine meadow ecosystem. It also suggested the necessity of separating fine roots from the whole root system for a better understanding of root turnover rate and its response to environmental factors.","[Wu, Yibo; Wu, Jing; Deng, Yongcui; Tan, Hongchao; Du, Yangong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gu, Song] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yanhong] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan; [Cui, Xiaoyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Cui, XY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",cuixy@gucas.ac.cn,"Cui, Xiaoyong/B-3669-2016; du, yangong/C-6262-2012; Tang, Yanhong/B-1699-2010","Cui, Xiaoyong/0000-0001-7592-5866; Tang, Yanhong/0000-0001-7207-1965","NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41071174]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XMXX280720, kzcx2-yw-418-02, kzxx2-06-01]; Ministry of Science & Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2006BAD03A04]","The study was partly supported by grants from NSFC (No. 41071174), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XMXX280720, kzcx2-yw-418-02 and kzxx2-06-01), and the Ministry of Science & Technology of China (No. 2006BAD03A04).

This study focuses on the performance of rhizomatous clonal plants under different situations and we proposed a hypothesis that clonal integration will significantly improve the disturbance and drought resistance ability and the competitive ability of Eremosparton songoricum. In 2009, the experiments were carried out in two natural populations. Rhizome was either severed (S) or not (I) in four treatments that include control (C), drought (D), disturbance (E), and competition (F). The biomass and the root-shoot ratio were compared in different experimental treatments. Under drought and disturbance treatments, the biomass of ramet with severed rhizome was significantly less than that of intact ramets, and both were lower than the samples under the control treatment. The differences in root-shoot ratio were opposite to the biomass in drought and disturbance treatments. The ramet biomass under the competition treatment had the same result as that under the drought and disturbance treatments. However, the root-shoot ratio was highest in FS (competition treatment with severed rhizome) and lowest in FI (competition treatment with intact rhizome) under competition and control treatments. Our results suggest that clonal integration enhances the disturbance and drought resistance ability rather than the competitive ability of Eremosparton songoricum. This may be one of the various reasons why E. songoricum is distributed in sand dunes of droughty conditions with more disturbances but less competition. Integration proved to be important for the species occupying adverse patches. For E. songoricum, the existence of rhizome reduces the impact of environmental stress and improves the fitness in association with its location at the dune.","[Wang, Jian-Cheng; Shi, Xiang; Yin, Lin-Ke; Zhang, Dao-Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian-Cheng; Shi, Xiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yin, Lin-Ke; Zhang, Dao-Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Turpan Eremophytes Bot Garden, Turpan 838008, Peoples R China","Yin, LK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",yinlk@ms.xjb.ac.cn; daoyuanzhang@163.net,,,"Chinese Academy of ScienceChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-Z-1020]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB825104]; National Science Foundation, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30970547]","This work was supported by the Key Knowledge Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Science (no.

The fine-root (diameter < 2 mm) biomass, tips, length and volume were determined for the mineral soil layer (0 - 60 cm) by core sampling. The main objective was to determine the average fine-root biomass and morphological characteristics in different classes of young stands of Scots pines. The mean fine-root biomass was calculated for the whole stand by using below-ground biomass measurements of different components of sample trees and measurement of the tree stand. The amount of dry fine-root biomass in the soil layer was 5.3 +/- 1.6 t ha(-1) in the 14-year-old stand and 3.6 +/- 1.5 t ha(-1) in the 12-year-old stand. The study showed that the largest portion (52%) of the total fine-root biomass of 12- and 14-year-old Scots pine stands was located at a depth of 0-10 cm, decreasing in deeper mineral soil layers. The average morphological characteristics of fine roots were higher in the older stand. Analysis of the morphology of fine roots showed that at soil depth of 0 - 10 cm the mean root length was 233 +/- 44 cm, volume - 1.3 +/- 0.6 cm(3), value of tips - 537 +/- 104 and diameter 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm per 100 cm(-3).","[Bardulis, Andis; Liepa, Imants] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Bardulis, Andis; Jansons, Aris] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Salaspils, Latvia","Bardulis, A (reprint author), Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",andis.bardulis@silava.lv,,,,,,21,2,2,0,0,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-4031,,,RES RURAL DEV,,,2011,,,,,,,17,21,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Forestry",Agriculture; Forestry,BF0DO,WOS:000378593000003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Alguacil, MM; Torres, MP; Torrecillas, E; Diaz, G; Roldan, A",,,,"Alguacil, M.

We carried out a study where we analyse the AMF community composition in the roots of Ephedra fragilis, Rhamnus lycioides, Pistacia lentiscus and Retama sphaerocarpa fourteen months after revegetation in a Mediterranean semiarid degraded area of southeast Spain in order to verify whether different plant species can variably promote the diversity of AM fungi in their rhizospheres after planted. We analysed a portion of approximately 795 bases pairs of the small-subunit ribosomal DNA by means of nested PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Eight fungal sequence types belonging to Glomus group A and B and to the genus Paraglomus were identified. The different plant species had different AM fungal community composition. Thus, R. lycioides harboured the highest number of four fungal sequence types while from E. fragilis only two types could be characterized that were specific for this plant species. P. lentiscus and R. sphaerocarpa harboured each one three sequence types and two of them were shared. All AMF sequence types were found in the natural soil. These results show that one effective way of restoring degraded lands is to increase the number of plant species used, which would increase the AMF diversity in the soil and thus the below-ground, positive interactions.

Plants grown in Cd-treated microcosms showed considerable inhibition of shoot growth rates, and leaf chlorophyll content. Soil microbial biomass C and respiration increased with plant age, and most of the measured biochemical indicators decreased with increasing distance from the soil-root interface, thus demonstrating the rhizosphere effect, likely due to the quick assimilation of rhizodeposits by rhizosphere microflora. On the other hand, short-term Cd contamination sometimes had an inhibitory effect on soil respiration, qCO(2), ATP content, and phosphatase activity, while stimulating microbial biomass, mainly at the rhizosphere level. The decrease in rhizosphere microbial activity observed after Cd application to soil may be due to a synergic effect of the metal directly on microbial cells and indirectly on plants, which reduced shoot growth rate and chlorophyll content, resulting in decreased availability of root exudates.","[Astolfi, Stefania; Zuchi, Sabrina; Grego, Stefano] Univ Tuscia, DAFNE, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [De Cesare, Fabrizio] Univ Tuscia, DIBAF, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Badalucco, Luigi] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sistemi Agroambientali, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","Astolfi, S (reprint author), Univ Tuscia, DAFNE, Via SC de Lellis, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",sastolfi@unitus.it,"Badalucco, Luigi/P-5130-2017; De Cesare, Fabrizio/G-7729-2011; astolfi, stefania/R-2581-2016","Badalucco, Luigi/0000-0002-6951-7011; De Cesare, Fabrizio/0000-0001-9810-8746; astolfi, stefania/0000-0002-1450-8783","Italian M.I.U.R.Ministero dell' Istruzione, dell' Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR)",The research was supported by grants from Italian M.I.U.R.-PRIN 2006,,57,6,6,3,28,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1838-675X,1838-6768,,SOIL RES,Soil Res.,,2011,49,7,,,,,642,651,,10.1071/SR11158,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,850BG,WOS:000297168800009,,,,,10/31/19B,"Nannipieri, P",,"Sauer, TJ; Norman, JM; Sivakumar, MVK",,"Nannipieri, Paolo",,,Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Microbial Function in Soil The Effect of Elevated CO2 Concentration,"SUSTAINING SOIL PRODUCTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE: SCIENCE, POLICY, AND ETHICS",,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LOLIUM-PERENNE; BIOMASS RESPONSES; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; NITROGEN; RHIZOSPHERE,,"Univ Florence, Dept Plant Soil & Environm Sci, I-50121 Florence, Italy","Nannipieri, P (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dept Plant Soil & Environm Sci, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",,,"NANNIPIERI, PAOLO/0000-0002-5488-2593",,,,74,3,3,1,11,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,978-0-470-96022-6; 978-0-470-95857-5,,,,2011,,,,,,,201,211,,,10.1002/9780470960257,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,BA6IL,WOS:000337151600016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Nie, M; Yang, QA; Jiang, LF; Fang, CM; Chen, JK; Li, B",,,,"Nie, Ming; Yang, Qiang; Jiang, Li-Fen; Fang, Chang-Ming; Chen, Jia-Kuan; Li, Bo",,,Do plants modulate biomass allocation in response to petroleum pollution?,BIOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass allocation; (13)CO(2) pulse-labelling; petroleum pollution; photosynthesis; Phragmites australis,OIL-SPILLS; SOIL; NITROGEN; RHIZODEPOSITION; TURNOVER,"Biomass allocation is an important plant trait that responds plastically to environmental heterogeneities.

Our data show that plant biomass significantly decreased under petroleum pollution, but the root-shoot ratio for both plant biomass and (13)C increased with increasing petroleum concentration, suggesting that plants could increase biomass allocation to roots in petroleum-polluted soil. Furthermore, assimilated (13)C was found to be significantly higher in soil, microbial biomass and soil respiration after soils were polluted by petroleum.

We investigated nitrate uptake in the fine roots of a deciduous oak (Quercus serrata Thunb. ex. Murray). We conducted a (15)N-labeling experiment using saplings of Q. serrata in the winter. During three weeks of labeled nitrate application, the concentration of (15)N in the fine roots increased significantly. The amount of nitrogen absorbed, as nitrate, was 1.16 +/- 1.02 mg N g DW(-1), equivalent to 7.6 +/- 5.8% of the total nitrogen content. Our results indicate that Q. serrata saplings have significant potential for nitrate uptake in the fine roots in midwinter (i.e., in the absence of leaves). Although a significant amount of nitrogen applied as nitrate was accumulated, nitrate concentration in the fine roots remained low during the labeling period. Furthermore, significant nitrate reductase activity was detected. These data suggest that Q. serrata saplings can assimilate nitrate in the fine roots in midwinter.","[Ueda, Miki U.; Mizumachi, Eri] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Tokuchi, Naoko] Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Ueda, MU (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",m_ueda@m.tohoku.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [19380086]","We thank the members of the Silviculture Laboratory at Kyoto University for helpful discussions.

We analyzed climate change effects on the inter-specific competition in a managed Douglas-fir/beech mixed forest. Therefore, we initialised the process-based forest model 4C with published fine root biomass distributions of Douglas-fir/beech stands and a stand composition originating from yield tables to simulate forest growth under regional climate change scenarios for a Dutch and a German site. The number of days when the tree water demand exceeded the soil water supply was higher for Douglas-fir than for beech. After 45 simulation years the proportion of basal area covered by beech increased from one to seven percent. Beech's competitive strength is mainly explained by the fine root biomass distributions and is highest under the historic climate and the driest climate change scenarios. Higher net primary production (NPP) under warmer/wetter climate but decreased NPP under warmer/drier conditions confirms Douglas-fir's high sensitivity to limited water supply. Simulated climate change does not substantially alter the interaction of the two species but the drought-stressed trees are more susceptible to insects or pathogens. The concept of complementary water use highlights the importance of mixed forest for climate change adaptation.","[Reyer, Christopher; Lasch, Petra] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Reyer, Christopher; Mohren, Godefridus M.

Although widespread, it is locally distributed in dwarf shrub heath and more commonly in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) woodlands. A recent study on the mycorrhizal status of Pyrola suggested that they associate with a restricted range of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Here, we examined the hypothesis that specialisation by P. media for fungi usually associated with Scots pine is a factor in promoting its occurrence in this habitat. The fungal community associated with the roots of P. media growing in a Scots pine forest was determined by morphotyping, polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing. Molecular identification found 49 taxa representing ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytes, saprotrophs, and fungi of unknown trophic status. The majority of the taxa (67.4%) were Basidiomycota, with 24.4% known to be ECM fungi specific to Pinus sp. or conifers. However, a wide range of other mycorrhizal fungi with varying degrees of host specificity were also found, including taxa usually associated with deciduous hosts. In conclusion, the broad range of mycorrhizal fungi recovered from the roots of P. media suggests that specialization is not a major factor in determining its distribution.","[Iason, Glenn R.; Taylor, Andy F.

We made three tracer experiments in a Norway spruce forest soil and qualitatively identified the dominant flow regime based on stained patterns. We analysed soil texture, fine root density and soil bulk density from preferential flow paths and the soil matrix by means of linear mixed-effects models. These models can account for dependences in the data structure caused by hierarchical sampling and can deal with missing values. There were between 44% (topsoil) and 76% (subsoil) larger root densities in preferential flow paths than in the soil matrix. No significant differences in soil texture were detected. The bulk density was greater in the soil matrix by 0.12 g cm(-3), which is probably because of a greater soil organic matter content of preferential flow paths. Using flow patterns and model results we identified the dominant flow mechanisms. At this study site, roots constituted the main preferential flow paths and induced macropore flow, especially in the topsoil. In the subsoil, root density decreased and inhomogeneous infiltration from preferential flow paths into the soil matrix caused unstable flow.","[Bogner, C.; Kolb, A.; Schmiedinger, I.; Huwe, B.] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Soil Phys Grp, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Bogner, C.] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany; [Gaul, D.] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Bogner, C (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Soil Phys Grp, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",christina.bogner@uni-bayreuth.de,"Bogner, Christina/B-8314-2013","Bogner, Christina/0000-0003-4495-0676",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG FOR 562],"The authors are grateful to the R and S-plus communities, especially to Dr John Fox, Dr Douglas Bates, Dr Jose Pinheiro and Dr Kyle Roberts for their help with statistical issues and for providing various R-scripts, and to the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

Accurate estimates are necessary for national reporting of greenhouse gas inventories, carbon credit trading and forest carbon management but in Portugal reliable and accessible forest carbon measurement methodologies are still lacking for some species. The objective of this study was to provide forest managers with a comprehensive database of carbon factors and equations that allows estimating stand-level carbon stocks in Pinus pinea L. (P pinea), regardless of the tree inventory information available. We produced aboveground biomass and stem volume equations, biomass expansion factors (BEF) by component as well as wood basic density (WBD) and component carbon fraction in biomass. A root-to-shoot ratio is also presented using data from trees in which the root system was completely excavated. We harvested 53 trees in centre and south Portugal covering different sizes (6.5 to 56.3 cm), ages (10 to 45 years) and stand densities (20 to 580 trees ha(-1)). The results indicate that aboveground allometry in P pinea is not comparable with other pines and varies considerably with stand characteristics, highlighting the need to develop stand-dependent factors and equations for local or regional carbon calculations. BEFaboveground decreases from open (1.33 +/- 0.03 Mg m(-3)) to closed stands (1.07 +/- 0.01 Mg m(-3)) due to a change in biomass allocation pattern from stem to branches. Average WBD was 0.50 +/- 0.01 Mg m(-3) but varies with tree dimensions and the root-to-shoot ratio found was 0.30 +/- 0.03. The carbon fraction was statistically different from the commonly used 0.5 factor for some biomass components. The equations and factors produced allow evaluating carbon stocks in P pinea stands in Portugal, contributing to a more accurate estimation of carbon sequestered by this forest type.","[Correia, A.

These variables have been investigated in lowland tropical forests, but they have rarely been studied in tropical montane forests (TMFs). This study examines spatial patterns of above- and belowground C dynamics along a transect ranging from lowland Amazonia to the high Andes in SE Peru. Fine root biomass values increased from 1.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 4.95 +/- 0.62 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m, reaching a maximum of 6.83 +/- 1.13 Mg C ha-1 at the 2020 m elevation site. Aboveground biomass values decreased from 123.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 47.03 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m. Mean annual belowground productivity was highest in the most fertile lowland plots (7.40 +/- 1.00 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and ranged between 3.43 +/- 0.73 and 1.48 +/- 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the premontane and montane plots. Mean annual aboveground productivity was estimated to vary between 9.50 +/- 1.08 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (210 m) and 2.59 +/- 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (2020 m), with consistently lower values observed in the cloud immersion zone of the montane forest. Fine root C residence time increased from 0.31 years in lowland Amazonia to 3.78 +/- 0.81 years at 3020 m and stem C residence time remained constant along the elevational transect, with a mean of 54 +/- 4 years. The ratio of fine root biomass to stem biomass increased significantly with increasing elevation, whereas the allocation of net primary productivity above- and belowground remained approximately constant at all elevations. Although net primary productivity declined in the TMF, the partitioning of productivity between the ecosystem subcomponents remained the same in lowland, premontane and montane forests.","[Girardin, C.

Frequency-dependent feedbacks refer to a species performance being dependent on its local abundance in the population; however, frequency dependence is often described as a monolithic trait of a species rather than examining the variation in response for individual genotypes and fitness traits. Here, we investigate frequency-dependent outcomes for individual genotypes and fitness-related traits for the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea. We tested for competition-mediated frequency dependence by establishing hexagonal arrays with the center target plant surrounded by either same, different or no genotype neighbors to determine how changing the small-scale frequency neighborhood-influenced invasion success. We used a Bayesian ANOVA approach which allowed us to easily accommodate our non-normal dataset and found that same neighbor plots had greater biomass production than different neighbor plots. Target plants also had greater stem height and aboveground biomass when surrounded by same genotype neighbors. A greenhouse experiment did not support the hypothesis that increased mycorrhizal associations were the cause of positive frequency dependence. We devised a frequency-dependent metric to quantify the extent of fitness-related differences for individual genotypes and found that individual genotypes showed a range of both positive and negative responses to different frequency treatments; however, only positive responses were statistically significant. The small-scale genotypic neighborhood had no effect for the fitness-related traits of leaf number, belowground biomass and total biomass. We demonstrate that individual invasive genotypes respond differently to changing frequency neighborhoods and that growth responses do not respond with the same direction and magnitude. A range of frequency-dependent responses may allow genotypes to invade a wide range of environments.","[Collins, Alexandra; Molofsky, J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Hart, E.

To enhance the erosion protection ability of coastal shelterbelts, two woody tree species, Taxodium ascendens and Salix babylonica, were planted separately into Phragmites australis + Scirpus mariqueter communities in 2006. Two years later, we investigated whether either of these experiments reduced erosion and increased stability in the native herbaceous plant community. We also examined soil stability and root length density under T. ascendens added, S. babylonica added and native herbaceous vegetation conditions along an intertidal gradient from the soil surface to a depth of 40 cm in each experiment, thus to determine the capacity of T. ascendens and S. babylonica to contribute to shoreline stabilization. Topsoil under the native vegetation had greater stability at the middle and higher intertidal zones because its soil stability index and root length density were significantly higher than in the T. ascendens or S. babylonica planted communities. The effect of T. ascendens on soil stability was not generally better than that of the native vegetation. Only at the 20-30 cm soil depth of the middle intertidal zone and in the 10-20 cm layer of the higher intertidal zone the soil stability index and root length densities under the T. ascendens added condition were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the native vegetation. The S. babylonica planted soil had greater stability in the deeper soil layer than the soil under either the native vegetation or the T. ascendens added condition, and its soil stability index and root length density were significant higher (P < 0.05) than those of other vegetation conditions at the 30-40 cm soil depth for the lower intertidal zone and at the 20-40 cm layer for middle and higher intertidal zones.","[Du Qin; Zhong Qi-Cheng; Wang Kai-Yun] E China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urbanizat & Ecol Restorat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Wang, KY (reprint author), E China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urbanizat & Ecol Restorat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",wangky@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Key Technologies Research and Development Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2006BAC01A14]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, ChinaScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [10dz1200602, 10dz1200902]","Supported by the National Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China during the 11th Five-Year Plan Period (No. 2006BAC01A14) and the Key Project of the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, China (Nos. 10dz1200602 and 10dz1200902).",,40,8,11,3,18,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,DEC,2010,20,6,,,,,692,701,,10.1016/S1002-0160(10)60059-8,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,686AA,WOS:000284668000002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Alford, ER; Pilon-Smits, EAH; Paschke, MW",,,,"Alford, Elan R.; Pilon-Smits, Elizabeth A.

This intriguing phenomenon has received considerable attention in the past decade. While research has mostly focused on the above-ground organs, roots are the sole access point to below-ground trace elements and as such they play a vital role in hyperaccumulation. Here we highlight the role of the root as an effective trace element scavenger through interactions in the rhizosphere. We found that less than 10% of the known hyperaccumulator species have had their rhizospheres examined. When studied, researchers have focused on root physical characteristics, rhizosphere chemistry, and rhizosphere microbiology as central themes to understand plant hyperaccumulation. One physical characteristic often assumed about hyperaccumulators is that their roots are small, but this is not true for all species and many species remain unexamined. Transporters in root membranes provide avenues for root uptake, while root growth and morphology influence plant access to trace elements in the rhizosphere. Some hyperaccumulators exhibit unique root scavenging and direct their growth toward elements in soil. Studies on hyperaccumulator rhizosphere chemistry have examined the role of the root in altering elemental solubility through exudation and pH changes. Different interpretations have been reported for mobilization of non-labile trace element pools by hyperaccumulators. However, there is a lack of evidence for a novel role for rhizosphere acidification in hyperaccumulation. As for microbiological studies, researchers have shown that bacteria and fungi in the hyperaccumulator rhizosphere may exhibit increased metal tolerance, act as plant growth promoting microorganisms, alter elemental solubility, and have significant effects on plant trace element concentrations. New evidence suggests that symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizae may not be rare in hyperaccumulator taxa, even in some members of the Brassicaceae. Although there are several reports on the presence of mycorrhizae, a cohesive interpretation of their role in hyperaccumulation remains elusive. In summary, we present the current state of knowledge about how roots hyperaccumulate and we suggest ways in which this knowledge can be applied and improved.","[Alford, Elan R.; Pilon-Smits, Elizabeth A.

Genotypic analyses of the isolates revealed a high level of chromosomal and plasmid content diversity. The isolates tagged with a plasmid-bearing constitutively expressed gusA gene were used to inoculate vetch (Vicia villosa) in competition experiments carried out under laboratory conditions. Soil extract containing autochthonous rhizobial population was used as competitor for gus-tagged strains, and the competition was studied by: (i) estimation of Gus(+) root nodules on whole root systems, (ii) the pattern of individual nodule colonization by Gus(+)/Gus(-) rhizobia, and (iii) the number of Gus(+)/Gus(-) bacteria recovered from individual nodules. Several patterns of nodule colonization by Gus(+)/Gus(-) bacteria were found. Some nodules identified as Gus(+) contained gus-tagged bacteria only in the young and saprophytic zones, while the symbiotic zone was occupied by unmarked soil rhizobia. In other Gus(+) nodules, despite the visible colonization of the entire nodule by gus-marked bacteria, a high number of Gus(-) soil-derived rhizobia were recovered. The results suggest that rhizobial strains compete with each other also in the late stage of nodule development. Therefore, they may use different strategies to reach the late saprophytic zone of the nodule, which serves as an optimal environment for massive proliferation.","[Wielbo, Jerzy; Kuske, Jan; Marek-Kozaczuk, Monika; Skorupska, Anna] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Genet & Microbiol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Wielbo, J (reprint author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Akad 19 St, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",jerzy.wielbo@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,,"Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education of PolandMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [NN304 026734]",The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant NN304 026734 of Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education of Poland.,,47,14,14,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2010,337,2-Jan,,,,,125,135,,10.1007/s11104-010-0510-3,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,679KI,WOS:000284159900009,,Other Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Montane, F; Romanya, J; Rovira, P; Casals, P",,,,"Montane, Francesc; Romanya, Joan; Rovira, Pere; Casals, Pere",,,Aboveground litter quality changes may drive soil organic carbon increase after shrub encroachment into mountain grasslands,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Litter decomposition; Root decomposition; Litter quality; Litter production; Root production; Ingrowth cores; Legume shrub; Conifer shrub; C sequestration,WOODY PLANT INVASION; FINE-ROOT DYNAMICS; LEAF-LITTER; MESIC GRASSLAND; PATAGONIAN-MONTE; GLOBAL PATTERNS; DECOMPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM; FOREST; STORAGE,"Shrub encroachment into grasslands is ubiquitous but its impact on soil organic C (SOC) remains unclear. In previous work we had observed that shrub encroachment into mesic mountain grasslands increased SOC content. Here we sought the mechanisms of this increase. To this end, we assessed aboveground and belowground production for a conifer shrub (Juniperus communis L), a legume shrub (Cytisus balansae ssp. europaeus (G. Lpez & Jarvis) Muoz Garmendia) and grass (Festuca eskia Ramond ex DC), together with decomposition rates for both aboveground litter and roots. Belowground C net inputs do not clearly explain SOC increase: grass root production was higher than that of either shrub and the decomposition rate of grass roots was the lowest. Aboveground C net inputs were only slightly greater in shrubs than in grass, but the decomposition rate of litter of both shrubs was much lower than that of grass. The decomposition of conifer litter was N-limited, whereas that of legume shrub litter was P-limited. Thus we conclude that the SOC increases after shrub encroachment into mesic grasslands probably as a result of higher recalcitrance of shrub aboveground litter relative to grass litter.","[Montane, Francesc; Rovira, Pere; Casals, Pere] CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Romanya, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Prod Nat Biol Vegetal & Edafol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Montane, F (reprint author), CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys,Km 2 Direccio Port Com, Solsona 25280, Spain.",francesc.montane@gmail.com,"Casals, Pere/M-2418-2014; Romanya, Joan/K-7714-2014; Montane, Francesc/B-7780-2008","Casals, Pere/0000-0002-0372-988X; Romanya, Joan/0000-0002-4519-9653; Montane, Francesc/0000-0001-8126-8612","DURSI-Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2005FI 00801]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP7-ENV-2009-1, 244122]","FM was supported by a grant (2005FI 00801) from the DURSI-Generalitat de Catalunya and the European Social Fund.

However, many of the mechanisms driving the variability of foliar and soil delta N-15 values within and across ecosystems are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the patterns of N concentrations and delta N-15 values in leaves, bulk soils and soil mineral N as well as soil N turnover rates across four temperate and boreal forest ecosystems along a mountain transect. The results showed that plant species and soil properties directly controlled soil delta N-15 patterns and climate factors (air temperature and precipitation) indirectly affected foliar delta N-15 patterns. Foliar N concentrations varied consistently with the concentrations of soil available N and soil NO (3) (-) -N, whereas foliar delta N-15 was most closely associated with the delta N-15 of soil NH (4) (+) , the most abundant form of N in soil solution. N-15 enrichment in surface mineral soil in high elevation forests was mainly attributed to N-15-enriched organic N accumulation. Furthermore, the foliar enrichment factor (epsilon(p/s) = I ' N-15(foliage)-I ' N-15(soil)) was significantly correlated with N transformation and loss rates, and was negatively correlated with the ratio of NH (4) (+) to total inorganic N. These results suggest that foliar delta N-15 value and foliar N concentration together accurately reflect the N availability of forest ecosystems. Foliar epsilon(p/s) can act as an integrated proxy to reflect the status of N cycling within or across forest ecosystems. Soil nitrification and species' NH (4) (+) to NO (3) (-) uptake ratios are key processes controlling foliar delta N-15 patterns in N-limited forest ecosystems. Our findings improve the mechanistic understanding of the commonly observed variability in foliar and soil delta N-15 within and across forest ecosystems.","[Cheng, Shu-Lan; Fang, Hua-Jun; Yu, Gui-Rui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Shu-Lan; Zhu, Tian-Hong; Zheng, Jiao-Jiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Fang, HJ (reprint author), 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",huajunfang@yahoo.com.cn,"__, ____/C-1768-2014","__, ____/0000-0002-1859-8966","National Key Research and Development Program [2010CB833501, 2010CB833502]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30600071, 40601097, 30590381]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-432, O7V70080SZ, LENOM07LS-01]; GUCAS [O85101PM03]","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program (2010CB833501, 2010CB833502), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30600071, 40601097, 30590381), the Knowledge Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-432, O7V70080SZ, LENOM07LS-01) and the President Fund of GUCAS (O85101PM03).

In Costa Rica, these plants are found growing in small and isolated patches, some of them consisting of just four to six individuals. Information about the genetic variability within and among populations is very important for the conservation of this endangered species. A total of 160 samples were collected in six locations and analyzed with amplified fragment length polymorphism technique. The genetic diversity of P. longifolium in Costa Rica (Hw = 0.1711) is high and differentiation among sampled locations is moderate (phi(pt), = 0.2013) in comparison with results of studies in some other terrestrial orchid species using the same technique. The percentage of polymorphic loci was, on average, 51.5. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated the main genetic variation was within sampled locations (80%), even though the variation among locations was also significant. In situ conservation is recommended because, in addition to protecting habitat and avoiding fragmentation, mycorrhizal fungi and pollinators are also protected. Close proximity between populations is required to maintain high genetic variability through a gene flow continuum. It is suggested that conservation of patches with higher genetic variability be prioritized as many are located in unprotected areas. A germplasm bank for ex situ conservation has been established in the living collection at Lankester Botanical Garden using the plants collected in this study. Finally, a search for new locations of this species is also suggested.","[Munoz, Melania; Albertazzi, Federico J.] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Biol Celular & Mol, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Munoz, Melania; Warner, Jorge] Univ Costa Rica, Jardin Bot Lankester, San Jose, Costa Rica","Munoz, M (reprint author), Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Biol Celular & Mol, San Jose, Costa Rica.",melaniamunozg@yahoo.com,,,Vicerrectoria de Investigacion of the University of Costa Rica [VI-814-A6-107]; Comision Nacional de Incentivos of the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia,"The authors thank the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad; Robert Dressler from Lankester Botanical Garden; Orlando Vargas from the Organization of Tropical Studies; Amos Bien from Rara Avis Biological Reserve; Alvaro Salazar from Monteverde Orchid Garden; Ernesto Carman, Luis Diego Gomez, Eladio Cruz, and Vinicio Porras for helping identify localities where Phragmipedium grows and for allowing access to their properties; and Nicola Flanagan for linguistic advice and useful criticisms to the manuscript.

Variovorax paradoxus strain HB44, next to Burkholderia terrae BS001 and Dyella japonica BS003, were found to be selected in the mycosphere of the tricholomataceous fungi Laccaria proxima and Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten in an acid soil denoted G. V. paradoxus HB44 showed poor survival in G bulk soil, irrespective of prior soil sterilization, and this poor survival also occurred for B. terrae BS001 and D. japonica BS003. In contrast, the survival rate of strain HB44 in two other soils, with pH values > 5.5, was significantly raised. Also, significantly enhanced strain HB44 survival in G soil was found if the pH was raised to 5.5 or 6.5, and it was even shown to grow (in the presence of the exogenous carbon source glycerol) at such pH values in the sterile G soil. This behaviour was similar to that of the V paradoxus type strain. Strikingly, Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten, when colonizing the sterilized G soil, significantly raised the soil pH from about 4.6 to >= 5.0. The pH raise was dependent on time, hyphal development, as well as on initial soil pH, but was consistent throughout. The modulated soil pH conditions were shown to be permissive for the survival and growth of strain HB44, and this was extended to strains BS001 and BS003. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that L sp. strain Karsten provides a suitable habitat for acid-sensitive strains like HB44. BS001 and BS003 in its mycosphere in acid soil, which is strongly defined by the establishment of a growth-permissive pH. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Nazir, R.; Boersma, F. G.

Therefore, the time interval between C assimilation and its return to the atmosphere is an important parameter for determining C storage. Especially fine roots (<= 2 mm in diameter) undergo constant replacement and provide a large biomass input to the soil. In this study, we aimed to determine the residence time of C in living fine roots and the decomposition rates of dead fine roots. Therefore, we pulse-labelled nine 20-year-old individual silver fir trees (Abies alba Miller; similar to 70 cm tall) with (CO2)-C-13 in situ to trace the assimilated C over time into the fine-root systems. Whole trees were harvested at different time points after labelling in autumn, biomass was determined and cellulose and starch of fine roots were extracted. Moreover, soil cores were taken and ingrowth cores installed, in which fine roots were genetically identified, to assess incorporation and remobilization of C-13 in the fine roots of silver fir trees; litterbags were used to determine fine-root decomposition rates. The C-13 label was incorporated in the fine-root system as cellulose within 3 days, with highest values after 30 days, before reaching background levels after 1 year. The highest delta C-13 values were found in starch throughout the experiment. C-13 recovery and carbon mean residence times did not differ significantly among fine-root diameter classes, indicating size-independent C turnover times in fine roots of A. alba trees of similar to 219 days. Furthermore, carbon was remobilized from starch into newly grown fine roots in the next spring after our autumn labelling. One year after installation, litterbags with fine roots revealed a decrease of biomass of similar to 40% with relative C-13 content in fine-root bulk biomass and cellulose of similar to 50%, indicating a faster loss of C-13-labelled compounds compared with bulk biomass. Our results also suggest that genetic analysis of fine-root fragments found in soil and ingrowth cores is advisable when working in mixed forest stands with trees of similar fine-root morphology. Only then can one avoid dilution of the labelling signal by mistake, due to analysis of non-labelled non-target species roots.","[Endrulat, Tina; Brunner, Ivano] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Saurer, Matthias] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Brunner, I (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",ivano.bunner@wsl.ch,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Saurer, Matthias/C-6724-2018; Brunner, Ivano/J-8661-2014","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Saurer, Matthias/0000-0002-3954-3534; Brunner, Ivano/0000-0003-3436-995X",Swiss Secretariat for Education and Research; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [E38],The work was part of the COST Action E38 (Woody root processes) and funded by the Swiss Secretariat for Education and Research.,,64,19,19,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2010,30,12,,,,,1515,1527,,10.1093/treephys/tpq090,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,685QV,WOS:000284644100004,21076129,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Luis, VC; Llorca, M; Chirino, E; Hernandez, EI; Vilagrosa, A",,,,"Luis, V.

SEEDLINGS; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; XYLEM VULNERABILITY; INTENSE DROUGHT; WATER RELATIONS; CAVITATION; LIMITATION; GROWTH,"As the main forestry species in the Canary Islands (Spain), Pinus canariensis is frequently used in afforestation programs. Several nursery techniques are commonly employed to modify its morphology and physiology with the aim of improving post-planting survival and growth. In this work, we studied how fertilization and light regime treatments applied during the nursery period modify biomass allocation patterns and produce effects in gas exchange and root hydraulic conductance. Seedlings were grown for a 6-month period in the nursery under two light regimes (full sunlight and 40% PAR reduction), and three fertilization levels were applied in each light regime. Morphology, biomass allocation patterns, leaf gas exchange and hydraulic conductance of the whole root system were evaluated. Fertilization treatments produced significant changes in biomass allocation, gas exchange and root hydraulic conductance under both light regimes. In contrast, no differences were found between full sunlight and shade, except for a slight variation in the root:shoot ratio. Photosynthesis rate and WUE increased with fertilization in both light regimes, while E and gs maintained the same values. An opposite trend was observed for root hydraulic conductance, which showed lower values with high fertilization regimes. The results obtained indicate that fertilization is more important, determining high photosynthetic capacity than high hydraulic conductance rates before planting in Pinus canariensis containerized seedlings.","[Luis, V.

We examined relationships among net assimilation rate (NAR) and other growth components obtained from our published data for trees harvested every 30 days. Strongly negative correlations were found between RMR and root morphological traits. Root mass ratio had a strong negative relationship with LMR, and proportion of fine-root biomass per total root biomass was positively correlated with SLA and NAR. Both NAR and leaf area ratio were important determinants of variation in relative growth rate (RGR). Leaf mass ratio (LMR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were positively correlated with RGR; the correlation was stronger in the case of LMR. Along a water-table gradient, negative relationships between root growth responses are likely to indirectly influence RGR through changes in NAR, LMR, and SLA.","[Imada, Shogo; Yamanaka, Norikazu; Tamai, Shigenobu] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan","Imada, S (reprint author), Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan.",s-imada@alrc.tottori-u.ac.jp,,,,,,39,3,3,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

We compared AMF species composition, and density of their spores in the rhizospheric soils of A. cotula and C. canadensis with comparable nearby un-invaded sites. Whilst 9 and 7 AMF species were recovered from the rhizospheres of A. cotula and C. canadensis, respectively, the corresponding un-invaded sites yielded 17 and 10 AMF species. Only 3 AMF species were common between the rhizospheres of the two invasive species. The spore density of AMF, unlike species richness, was higher in the rhizospheres of both the invasive species compared with the un-invaded sites nearby.

In view of low ecosystem services and ecological instability of pure coniferous plantations, indigenous broadleaf plantations are being advocated as a prospective silvicultural management for substituting in place of large coniferous plantations in subtropical China. However, little information is known about the effects of tree species conversion on stock and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC). The four adjacent monospecific plantations were selected to examine the effects of tree species on the stock and chemical composition of SOC using elemental analysis and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. One coniferous plantation was composed of Pinus massoniana (PM), and the three broadleaf plantations were Castanopsis hystrix (CH), Michelia macclurei (MM), and Mytilaria laosensis (ML). We found that SOC stock differed significantly among the four plantations in the upper (0-10 cm) layer, but not in the underneath (10-30 cm) layer. SOC stocks in the upper (0-10 cm) layer were 11, 19, and 18% higher in the CH, MM, and ML plantations than in the PM plantation. The differences in SOC stock among the four plantations were largely attributed to fine root rather than aboveground litterfall input. However, the soils in the broadleaf plantations contained more decomposable C proportion, indicated by lower percentage of alkyl C, higher percentage of O-alkyl C and lower alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio compared to those in the PM plantation. Our findings highlight that future strategy of tree species selection for substituting in place of large coniferous plantations in subtropical China needs to consider the potential effects of tree species on the chemical composition in addition to the quantity of SOC stock.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shi-Rong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Mo, Jiang-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Zhaoqing 526070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jing-Xin] W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Makeschin, Franz; Wolff, Maria] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Forest Geo & Hydro Sci, Inst Soil Sci, D-01735 Tharandt, Germany","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, 1 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",wanghui@scbg.ac.cn,,,"China's National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30590383]; Ministry of Finance [200804001]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2006BAD03A04]; Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry; Chinese Academy of Forestry","We thank Drs.

The carbon value of such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits. Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on the cloud forest-grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline. The forest near the treeline contained 63.4 +/- A 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) aboveground, with an additional 13.9 +/- A 2.8 Mg C ha(-1) estimated to be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5 +/- A 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62-74, 2010), we found the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US $1,374 per ha over the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.","[Gibbon, Adam; Malhi, Yadvinder; Fisher, Joshua B.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Silman, Miles R.; Farfan, William R.; Garcia, Karina C.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA; [Meir, Patrick; Zimmermann, Michael; Dargie, Greta C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Farfan, William R.; Garcia, Karina C.] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad, Cuzco, Peru","Gibbon, A (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",a.e.gibbon@gmail.com,"Meir, Patrick/J-8344-2012; Farfan-Rios, William/J-9881-2015; Zimmermann, Michael/F-7547-2010","Farfan-Rios, William/0000-0002-3196-0317; Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0002-5162-2008; Fisher, Joshua/0000-0003-4734-9085","Blue Moon Fund; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F010680/1, NE/G018278/1]","We thank the Blue Moon Fund for support.

In F. sylvatica, median fine root longevity from early seasonal to late-seasonal cohorts was low (77 days). Fine root dynamics scaled positively with seasonal changes in soil water and temperature indicating accelerated fine root turnover during favourable soil conditions. In contrast, fine root longevity in P. abies (273 days) was significantly higher when compared to F. sylvatica and increased from early seasonal to late-seasonal cohorts. Fine root dynamics in P. abies did not correlate with soil environmental conditions. Rather a large proportion of new fine roots occurred during the dry season in superficial soil layers. The data suggest species inherent patterns of fine root longevity and temporal patterns of fine root dynamics.","[Mainiero, Raphael] Inst Appl Plant Biol, CH-4124 Schonenbuch, Switzerland; [Kazda, Marian; Schmid, Iris] Univ Ulm, Dept Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89075 Ulm, Germany","Mainiero, R (reprint author), Inst Appl Plant Biol, Sandgrubenstr 27, CH-4124 Schonenbuch, Switzerland.",raphael.mainiero@iap.ch,,,"German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ka941/61, 2]","We thank the German Science Foundation (DFG) for financial support (Grant No. Ka941/61, 2).

Their seeds were germinated and seedlings were transplanted to pots containing sterile soil. Four treatments were applied: inoculation with the AMP Glomus manihotis, inoculation and fertilization with triple superphosphate (TSP), plants with TSP application alone, and untreated controls. Of the seven species studied, six developed successfully symbiosis, while one species. Guapira olfersiana was contaminated with an ectomycorrhizal fungus. In the pioneering and intermediate species, the effect of AMF was evident in higher values of dry weight, root length and P utilization efficiency, and in the case of late species the values were low. The results show three distinct groups of species: pioneer species with high responses to the HMA, an intermediate group comprising the early species, with varying and intermediate responses to AMP and a third group of late species with low responses to HMA. It is concluded that the responsiveness to AMF of the species studied is directly proportional to the percentage of root hairs and is inversely proportional to the size of their seeds.","[Flores, Carmen] UNET, Lab Fitoquim, Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, San Cristobal 5001, Tachira, Venezuela; [Flores, Carmen] Cent Univ Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela","Flores, C (reprint author), UNET, Lab Fitoquim, Inst Venezolano Invest Cient, Av Univ, San Cristobal 5001, Tachira, Venezuela.",cfloresvilla@gmail.com,,,,,,46,2,2,1,4,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,NOV,2010,35,11,,,,,833,839,,,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,687BC,WOS:000284747700008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Heath, KD; Stock, AJ; Stinchcombe, JR",,,,"Heath, K.

Because fixed nitrogen is traded in plant-rhizobium mutualisms, increasing N availability in the soil is predicted to alter coevolution of these interactions. Legumes typically decrease the number of associations (nodules) with rhizobia in response to nitrate, but the evolutionary dynamics of this response remain unknown. We grew plant and rhizobium genotype combinations in three N environments to assess the coevolutionary potential of the nodule nitrate response in natural communities of plants and rhizobia. We found evidence for coevolutionary genetic variation for nodulation in response to nitrate (G x G x E interaction), suggesting that the mutualism response to N deposition will depend on the combination of partner genotypes. Thus, the nitrate response is not a fixed mechanism in plant-rhizobium symbioses, but instead is potentially subject to natural selection and dynamic coevolution.","[Heath, K.

Their biodiversity, host associations and geographical distributions are not well documented. ITS rDNA sequences of Tuber are commonly recovered from molecular surveys of fungal communities, but most remain insufficiently identified making it difficult to determine whether these sequences represent conspecific or novel taxa. In this meta-analysis, over 2000 insufficiently identified Tuber sequences from 76 independent studies were analysed within a phylogenetic framework. Species ranges, host associates, geographical distributions and intra-and interspecific ITS variability were assessed. Over 99% of the insufficiently identified Tuber sequences grouped within clades composed of species with little culinary value (Maculatum, Puberulum and Rufum). Sixty-four novel phylotypes were distinguished including 36 known only from ectomycorrhizae or soil. Most species of Tuber showed 1-3% intraspecific ITS variability and >4% interspecific ITS sequence variation. We found 123 distinct phylotypes based on 96% ITS sequence similarity and estimated that Tuber contains a minimum of 180 species. Based on this meta-analysis, species in Excavatum, Maculatum and Rufum clades exhibit preference for angiosperm hosts, whereas those in the Gibbosum clade are preferential towards gymnosperms. Sixteen Tuber species (>13% of the known diversity) have putatively been introduced to continents or islands outside their native range.","[Bonito, Gregory M.; Gryganskyi, Andrii P.; Vilgalys, Rytas] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Trappe, James M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Bonito, GM (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",gmb2@duke.edu,,"Vilgalys, Rytas/0000-0001-8299-3605","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0641297, DEB-0710213]; Mycological Society of America","This research would not have been possible without the contributions from members of the North American Truffling Society and other collectors who provided specimens and sequences used in this research.

In addition to factors such as climate/land-use change, vertebrate animals can have a considerable impact on soil CO2 emissions. To date, most research has considered herbivores, while the impact of omnivorous animals has rarely been investigated. Our goal was to determine how European wild boars (Sus scrofa L.), large omnivores that consume soil-inhabiting animals and belowground plant parts by grubbing in the soil, affect soil C dynamics. We measured soil respiration (CO2), temperature, and moisture on paired grubbed and non-grubbed plots in six hardwood forest stands for a 3-year period and sampled fine root and microbial biomass at the beginning and after 2 years of the study. We also measured the percentage of freshly disturbed forest soil within the larger surroundings of each stand and used this information together with hunting statistics and forest cover data to model the total amount of CO2 released from Swiss forest soils due to grubbing during 1 year. Soil CO2 emissions were significantly higher on grubbed compared to non-grubbed plots during the study. On average 23.1% more CO2 was released from these plots, which we associated with potential alterations in CO2 diffusion rates, incorporation of litter into the mineral soil and higher fine root/microbial biomass. Thus, wild boars considerably increased the small-scale heterogeneity of soil properties. Roughly 1% of Switzerland's surface area is similar to our sites (boar density/forest cover). Given the range of forest soil disturbance of 27-54% at our sites, the geographic information system model predicted that boar grubbing would lead to the release of an additional 49,731.10-98,454.74 t CO2 year(-1). These values are relatively small compared to total soil emissions estimated for Swiss hardwood forests and suggest that boars will have little effect on large-scale emissions unless their numbers increase and their range expands dramatically.","[Risch, Anita C.; Wirthner, Sven; Schuetz, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Res Unit Community Ecol, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Busse, Matt D.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific SW Res Stn, Redding, CA 96002 USA; [Page-Dumroese, Deborah S.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Moscow, ID 83843 USA","Risch, AC (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Res Unit Community Ecol, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",anita.risch@wsl.ch,"Risch, Anita/A-9836-2012","Risch, Anita/0000-0003-0531-8336",Swiss National Forest Inventory,"We thank Dieter Trummer, Lieven Dekoninck, Florian Risch, Barbara Moser and Ulrich Wasem for their help with establishing the fences and Dieter Trummer, Manuel Lingg and Verena Hechinger for their help during Weld work.

Positive interactions are suggested to prevail in low resource, low productivity (high stress) conditions and negative interactions in high resource availability. A dwarf shrub, mountain crowberry Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, is known to have allelopathic impacts on both Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and its ectomycorrhizal symbionts. We aimed to study if the outcome of Empetrum impacts on Scots pine changes along primary succession gradients on the dune shores of Bothnian Bay, in Finland, where abiotic stress gradually changes to biotic stress along the succession. We found that Empetrum may act as a facilitator despite its allelopathic effects, since the proportion of Scots pine seedlings established in Empetrum patches was higher than in patches without the shrub in early and mid succession stages, whereas patches without Empetrum were preferred in late succession. The amount of mycelial fungal biomass (ergosterol) in the soil in the vicinity of the seedling roots was higher in Empetrum patches than in patches without Empetrum and it increased along the succession gradient. Proportion of pine root tips colonised by suilloid morphotypes with abundant external mycelia and the diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes were higher in mid successional stage in Empetrum patches compared to patches without Empetrum. Our results suggest that in the harsh physical conditions of the dune shore Empetrum facilitates pine seedling establishment in the early and mid stages of succession by providing mechanical and physical shelter whereas in late succession negative interactions (competition and allelopathy) between the shrub and the pine are dominating. To our knowledge we present the first finding that an ericoid mycorrhizal shrub could enhance both the performance of the ectomycorrhizal host tree and the tree's fungal symbionts.","[Grau, Oriol] Univ Barcelona, Dept Plant Biol, ES-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Rautio, Pasi] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Northern Unit, FI-96300 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Grau, Oriol; Heikkinen, Juliana; Saravesi, Karita; Markkola, Annamari] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Kozlov, Mikhail V.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Grau, O (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Plant Biol, Avinguda Diagonal 645, ES-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",grau.oriol@gmail.com,"Grau, Oriol/Y-7075-2019; Rautio, Pasi/A-6595-2013; Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013","Grau, Oriol/0000-0002-3816-9499; Rautio, Pasi/0000-0003-0559-7531; Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244",Comissionat per a Universitats i Recerca of the Dept d'Innovacio; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Universitats i Empresa of the Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya,"We thank Tuulikki Pakonen for organising the help in the laboratory and analysing soil nitrogen, and Alisa Gornostayeva for analysing soil ergosterol (both at the Dept. of Biology, Univ. of Oulu).

Here, we test the hypothesis that plant communities that are genetically impoverished will support fewer species of root-associated fungi. We used established grassland mesocosms comprising non-sterile natural soil supporting defined communities of 11 clonally-propagated plant species. Half of the mesocosms contained one genotype per species and half 16 genotypes per species. After 8 years growth, we sampled roots from the mesocosms and measured root-associated fungal richness and diversity using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the roots of genetically impoverished communities contained more species of fungi and had greater diversity compared to genetically rich communities. Analysis of the plant species composition of the mesocosm communities indicated that genotypic diversity affects root-fungal diversity indirectly through its influence upon plant species diversity. Our findings highlight the need to include feedbacks with plant intraspecific diversity into existing models describing the maintenance of soil biodiversity.","[Johnson, David] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Anderson, Ian C.] Univ Western Sydney, Ctr Plants & Environm, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; [Anderson, Ian C.; Williams, Alison] Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Whitlock, Raj; Grime, J.

In this study, these relationships were investigated for three typical shrubs in Horqin Sand Land, Northeast China. Root diameter, individual root length, tissue carbon concentration, C:N ratio, root lifespan, root cross-sectional area (CSA), stele CSA, proportion of stele in root CSA, mean xylem vessel CSA and the number of xylem vessels all increased with root order for the three shrubs, while specific root length and nitrogen concentration decreased with root order. The combined root biomass of the first two orders accounted for more than 63% of the first-fourth order root biomass for all the three shrubs. Proportion of stele to root CSA and number of xylem vessels of third-order root segments were significantly higher than that of the first two orders, and third-order roots showed secondary development with a continuous cork layer. All first-order and most second-order roots exhibited primary development, had an intact cortex, a lower proportion of stele to root CSA, and a smaller number of vessels. Our research suggests that the first two order roots of shrubs in sandy habitats are responsible mainly for absorption, and that they play a major role in root turnover and C and N flux in the soil organic matter pool due to their high proportion of biomass and N concentration, as well as their short lifespan.","[Huang, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, Key Lab Oasis Ecol & Desert Environm, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Zhao, Xue-yong; Zhao, Ha-lin; Huang, Ying-xin; Zuo, Xiao-an] Chinese Acad Sci, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Cold & Arid Reg & Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Huang, G (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Fukang Stn Desert Ecol, Key Lab Oasis Ecol & Desert Environm, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",fishofbeiming@tom.com,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Zuo, Xiaoan/0000-0002-1063-1100","Chinese National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [2009CB421303-4, 40871004, 30972422]","We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on our manuscript.

Seeds of 2 epiphytic, 1 aquatic, and 7 terrestrial orchids native to North America were compared with respect to water balance profiles: Cleistes bifaria, Encyclia tampensis, Epidendrum nocturnum, Habenaria repens, Isotria medeoloides, Liparis elata, L. hawaiensis, Platanthera holochila, P. integrilabia, and P. leucophaea. Water content, water loss rate, activation energy, and equilibrium humidity were assessed for each species. Seeds of epiphytic orchids were smaller, lighter, more porous, and had higher water loss rates compared to terrestrials. No active mechanism for water absorption exists in seeds of either group. Water loss appears to be a species-specific phenomenon that may be linked to the ecological niches these species occupy.","[Yoder, Jay A.; Imfeld, Samantha M.; Heydinger, Derrick J.; Hart, Chloe E.; Collier, Matthew H.; Gribbins, Kevin M.] Wittenberg Univ, Dept Biol, Springfield, OH 45501 USA; [Zettler, Lawrence W.] Illinois Coll, Dept Biol, Jacksonville, IL 62650 USA","Collier, MH (reprint author), Wittenberg Univ, Dept Biol, Ward St & N Wittenberg Ave, Springfield, OH 45501 USA.",mcollier@wittenberg.edu,,"Gribbins, Kevin/0000-0002-9426-3244",,,,43,9,9,2,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,NOV,2010,211,1,,,,,7,17,,10.1007/s11258-010-9765-2,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,661AV,WOS:000282695700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Veselkin, DV",,,,"Veselkin, D.

The fungal:bacterial PLEA biomass ratio decreased in the bulk soil of A. capillaris, especially with elevated CO2 alone (38%).

Although restoration ecology has been rapidly evolving as a scientific discipline, the principles that have developed regarding aboveground-belowground linkages have yet to be thoroughly integrated into it. In this review, we conceptually integrate the role of aboveground-belowground linkages with the principles of restoration ecology through a framework that transcends multiple levels of ecological organization, and illustrate its application through three examples: restoration of abandoned land, reversal of biological invasions, and restoration of natural disturbances. We conclude that this integration can greatly assist restoration ecology, through aiding identification of effective invention practices and prediction of ecosystem recovery.","[Kardol, Paul; Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Kardol, P (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Paul.Kardol@seksko.slu.se,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Kardol, Paul/A-2600-2010","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; ",,,,100,173,190,22,433,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Root:shoot partitioning ratio for sapling total N was lower than biomass root:shoot ratio in all species. Sapling total N-15 was partitioned between root and shoot in about the same ratio as total N in cacao and inga but in gliricidia much higher proportion of N-15 than total N was found in roots. Thus, whole plant harvesting should be used in N-15 studies whenever possible. Average percentage of fixed N out of total tree N was 74 and 81% for inga estimated by a yield-independent and yield-dependent method, respectively, and 85% for gliricidia independently of estimation method. Strong isotopic evidence on direct N transfer from trees to cacao was observed in two cases out of ten with both tree species. Direct N transfer was not correlated with mycorrhizal colonisation of either donor or receiver plant roots. Direct N transfer from inga and gliricidia to cacao is conceivable but its prevalence and the transfer pathway via mycorrhizal connections or via reabsorption of N-rich legume root exudates by cacao require further study. Competition in the restricted soil space may also have limited the apparent transfer in this study because the trees accumulated more soil-derived N than cacao in spite of active N-2 fixation.","[Kurppa, Miika; Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Leblanc, Humberto A.] EARTH Univ, San Jose 44421000, Costa Rica","Nygren, P (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.nygren@helsinki.fi,,,Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; University of Helsinki; EARTH University Research Committee; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [111796],"The contribution of M.

We quantified fine root length, production, and turnover in boreal forest and aspen parkland of central Canada because the future climate of the boreal site is expected to be similar to the current climate of the parkland site. Root depth distribution and turnover were similar between sites. Fine root mass was 4x greater at the parkland site and root length was 10x greater. Accordingly, the ecosystem level fine root: leaf mass ratio was 1.6 in the boreal site compared to 4.3 in the parkland site. On a per tree basis, however, fine root biomass was similar between sites due to the higher stem density of the parkland site. The parkland site had a greater proportion of very fine roots (62% of the fine roots were < 0.1 mm in diameter) compared with the boreal site (82% of the fine roots were between 0.1-0.5 mm in diameter). These differences indicate a large-scale shift towards increased root allocation at the parkland site associated with decreasing water availability and earlier successional stage.","[Pinno, Bradley D.; Wilson, Scott D.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Van Rees, Ken C.

The study was carried out in a boreal forest along an 80-m-long successional transect (willow, alder, birch, spruce) located on the land-uplift coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, western Finland. The field and ground layer vegetation were recorded by species percentage cover on 2 m(2) sample plots located at 10 m intervals. Organic layer samples were taken from around each vegetation sample plot for the determination of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and chemical composition of the organic layer, as characterized by the concentrations of neutral and acidic sugar units in non-cellulosic polysaccharides, cellulose, the acid-soluble lignin (ASL), and acid-insoluble residue (AIR). The organic layer along the transect showed a decrease in pH (from 5.2 to 4.4), moisture content and concentrations of ASL and the hemicellulosic sugars arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose, and glucuronic acid, while the AIR concentration increased. These organic matter fractions and pH also showed a strong positive or negative correlation with the vegetation and the PLFA ordination. The percentage cover of grasses significantly correlated with the PLFA data, as well as with that of herbs and field layer species. However. PLFA ordination showed a higher correlation with the organic layer properties than with the coverage of plant species groups. In conclusion, our data showed a strong directional relationship between the organic matter characteristics and structure of the vegetation and microbial communities along the study transect. This study is, to our knowledge, the first investigation to apply acid methanolysis in the characterization of non-cellulosic polysaccharides in the organic layer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Both large and small sample volumes are utilized in root research, and this study is designed to help field researchers in optimizing root sampling. We evaluate the performance of three contrasting sampling strategies-large monoliths (LM, 25 dm(-3)), small monoliths (SM, 3 x 1 dm(-3)), and root auger (RA, 5 x 196.3 cm(-3)). We compare root biomass estimates obtained in a shifting cultivation agroecosystem in eastern Amazonia. We sampled a slash-and-burn field at 1/2 and 1 1/2 years of cultivation, and a paired 3-year-old spontaneous secondary forest regrowth down to 1 m soil depth, and we distinguish roots by diameter class and taxonomic origin (palm vs. non-palm roots). LMs are the only reliable quantification method for coarse roots. Both SM and RA methods are inadequate due to high variability and the frequent failure to detect the presence of coarse roots in the sampled soil. The SM method is acceptable for mid-sized (2-5 mm) roots, and both methods are adequate for fine root (< 2 mm) quantification. Labor costs of LM, SM and RA methods are similar since reduced sampling effort in small sample volumes is compensated by increased costs in sample handling. The small sample volumes of SM or RA may be preferable in situations focusing on fine root dynamics, with the necessity to avoid major perturbations, or in repeated sampling schemes. Both SM and RA samplings gave a strong and systematic overestimation of root biomass in all fractions compared to the LM values, with differences being less pronounced for SM. We establish comparability between the three sampling schemes with transformation equations which are remarkably similar between shifting cultivation and secondary forest, between roots of the babassu palm and those of other origin and down the 1-m soil profile. Thus, future field studies in similar environments can utilize SM or RA fine root sampling and subsequently transform data to LM estimates. We recommend the SM rather than the RA method because of the lower data variability and the lower degree of root mass overestimation.","[Rodrigues de Sousa, Joao Thiago; Gehring, Christoph] Univ Estadual Maranhao, BR-65000000 Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil","Gehring, C (reprint author), Univ Estadual Maranhao, Cidade Univ Paulo 6 S-N Tirir, BR-65000000 Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil.",christophgehring@yahoo.com.br,"de Sousa, Joao Thiago Rodrigues/O-7785-2015","Rodrigues de Sousa, Joao Thiago/0000-0002-5761-4631",Brazilian Research Council CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [02/2006]; Maranhao State (FAPEMA),We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Brazilian Research Council CNPq (CT-Universal 02/2006) as well as a research grant provided to the first author by the Research Fund of Maranhao State (FAPEMA).,,42,4,4,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

This interdisciplinary approach together with the fact that is the first study in which Patagonian nurseries EMF are genetically evaluated contributes to the general knowledge of this important group of fungi. Sequencing revealed the presence of 11 taxa. Basidiomycetes included Thelephoraceae (Tomentella sp.), Atheliaceae (Amphinema byssoides (Pers.) J. Erikss.), Hydnangiaceae (Laccaria sp.), Rhizopogonaceae (Rhizopogon roseolus (Corda) Th. Fr.), and Cortinariaceae (Hebeloma mesophaeum (Pers.) Quel.). Ascomycetes included Pezizaceae (Wilcoxina mikolae (Chin S. Yang & H. E. Wilcox) Chin S. Yang & Korf and Wilcoxina sp.) and Tuberaceae (Tuber sp.). Morphotyping proved to be useful for certain EMF species (R. roseolus, H. mesophaeum, A. byssoides, and to a lesser extent Tuber sp.) in which some morphological features are conspicuous and unique. Our detection of W. mikolae and Wilcoxina sp. are new records for ponderosa pine in Patagonia.

In sagebrush steppe, soil water is scarce and is partitioned between deep-rooted perennial shrubs and shallower-rooted native forbs and grasses. Disturbances commonly remove shrubs, leaving grass-dominated communities, and may allow for the exploitation of water resources by the many species of invasive, tap-rooted forbs that are increasingly successful in this habitat. We hypothesized that exotic forb populations would benefit from increased soil water made available by removal of sagebrush, a foundation species capable of deep-rooting, in semiarid shrub-steppe ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, we used periodic matrix models to examine effects of experimental manipulations of soil water on population growth of two exotic forb species, Tragopogon dubius and Lactuca serriola, in sagebrush steppe of southern Idaho, USA. We used elasticity analyses to examine which stages in the life cycle of T. dubius and L. serriola had the largest relative influence on population growth. We studied the demography of T. dubius and L. serriola in three treatments: (1) control, in which vegetation was not disturbed, (2) shrubs removed, or (3) shrubs removed but winter-spring recharge of deep-soil water blocked by rainout shelters. The short-term population growth rate (k) of T. dubius in the shrub-removal treatment was more than double that of T. dubius in either sheltered or control treatments, both of which had limited soil water. All L. serriola individuals that emerged in undisturbed sagebrush plots died, whereas k of L. serriola was high (lambda > 2.5) in all shrub-removal plots, whether they had rainout shelters or not. Population growth of both forbs in all treatments was most responsive to flowering and seed production, which are life stages that should be particularly reliant on deep-soil water, as well as seedling establishment, which is important to most plant populations, especially during invasion. These data indicate the importance of native species, in this case the dominant shrub, in influencing soil resources and restricting population growth of exotic plants. These results argue that management of invasive plants should focus not only on removal of nonnatives, but also on reestablishment of important native species.","[Prevey, Janet S.; Germino, Matthew J.; Huntly, Nancy J.] Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA","Germino, MJ (reprint author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mail Stop 8007, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",germmatt@isu.edu,"Germino, Matthew J./F-6080-2013; Prevey, Janet/O-1537-2014; Huntly, Nancy/A-9329-2010","Germino, Matthew J./0000-0001-6326-7579; Prevey, Janet/0000-0003-2879-6453; Huntly, Nancy/0000-0001-6051-6365",USDA NRIUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS0814387],"We thank Dennis Demshar, Brandi Burns, Heidi Albano, Stephanie Mathies, Michael-Gene Widmer, Cassidy Michaelis, Sam Purkett, Charley Finley, and Evan Piland for help with field and laboratory work.

The effects of root reinforcement depend on the morphological characteristics of the loot system, the tensile strength of single roots, and the spatial distribution of the roots in soil. In the present study the results of research carried out in order to evaluate the biotechnical characteristics of the root system of Persian Ironwood (Parrotia persica), in northern Iran are presented. Profile trenching method was used to obtain root area ratio (RAR) values for uphill and downhill sides of the individual trees. For each species, single root specimens were sampled and tested for their tensile strength It was found that root density generally decreases with depth according to an exponential law. Maximum RAR values were located within the first 0.1 m. with maximum rooting depth at about 065 m RAR values ranged from 0 001% at lower depths to 1.39% near the surface, at upper 0.1 m depth. Significant differences of RAR values, rooting depth and root cohesion between uphill and downhill were observed, however, the differences were not significant for number of roots (ANCOVA) Downhill profiles had higher RAR values, rooting depth and root cohesion. In general, root tensile strength tends to decrease with diameter according to a power law, as observed by other researchers. Downhill roots were significantly stronger in tensile strength than uphill ones. Inter-species variation of tensile strength in downhill roots was also observed The resulting data were used to evaluate the reinforcing effects in terms of increased shear strength of the soil, using Wu/Waldron Model The root reinforcement provided by Persian Ironwood is about 46 0 kPa in the upper layers and 0.3 kPa in the deeper horizons. The results of Spearman test revealed a significant correlation between RAR and C(r) and that best followed by a power law. The results presented in this paper contribute to expanding the knowledge on biotechnical characteristics of Persian Ironwood on slope reinforcement. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Surveys demonstrated the presence of four species of Phytophthora including one novel species. By far, the most common species was P. cinnamomi; P. citricola and P. cambivora were isolated infrequently. In few instances, P. cinnamomi was isolated from fine roots and necroses on larger roots. No special pattern of incidence was found, but P. cinnamomi was more commonly isolated from greater Integrated Moisture Index values suggesting moist lower bottomlands favour this Phytophthora species. When tree crown condition was examined relative to the presence of Phytophthora, no significant association was found. However, roots of declining P. cinnamomi-infested trees had 2.5 times less fine roots than non-infested and healthy trees, which was significantly different. The population densities of P. cinnamomi from declining trees were significantly greater than from healthy trees, suggesting increased pathogen activity that has the potential to cause dieback and decline and possibly the cause of a reduced fine root amount found on declining trees.","[Balci, Y.] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Long, R.

At the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC), we examined how 7 years of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) affected soil CO2 dynamics in a ca. 100-year-old mixed deciduous forest. The use of 13C-depleted CO2 for canopy enrichment allowed us to trace the flow of recently fixed C. In the 7th year of growth at similar to 550 ppm CO2, soil respiratory CO2 consisted of 39% labelled C. During the growing season, soil air CO2 concentration was significantly enhanced under CO2-exposed trees. However, elevated CO2 failed to stimulate cumulative soil respiration (R-s) over the growing season. We found periodic reductions as well as increases in instantaneous rates of R-s in response to elevated CO2, depending on soil temperature and soil volumetric water content (VWC; significant three-way interaction). During wet periods, soil water savings under CO2-enriched trees led to excessive VWC (> 45%) that suppressed R-s. Elevated CO2 stimulated R-s only when VWC was < 40% and concurrent soil temperature was high (> 15 degrees C). Seasonal Q(10) estimates of R-s were significantly lower under elevated (Q(10)=3.30) compared with ambient CO2 (Q(10)=3.97). However, this effect disappeared when three consecutive sampling dates of extremely high VWC were disregarded. This suggests that elevated CO2 affected Q(10) mainly indirectly through changes in VWC. Fine root respiration did not differ significantly between treatments but soil microbial biomass (C-mic) increased by 14% under elevated CO2 (marginally significant). Our findings do not indicate enhanced soil C emissions in such stands under future atmospheric CO2. It remains to be shown whether C losses via leaching of dissolved organic or inorganic C (DOC, DIC) help to balance the C budget in this forest.","[Bader, Martin K. -F.; Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Bader, MKF (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",Martin.Bader@unibas.ch,"Bader, Martin/B-1187-2011; Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Bader, Martin Karl-Friedrich/0000-0002-3742-9762",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [3100AO-111914/1],"We are grateful to Rolf Siegwolf and Matthias Saurer (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) for stable isotope analysis.

Harvesting of replicated plots in three sites differing in geomorphology and vegetation structure allowed the statistical measurement of spatial variability within and among sites. Linear, power log-transformed, and power non-linear regressions were used to relate TAGB with plant metrics. Canopy volume explained the largest proportion of TAGB variance (r(2) = 0.74-0.94) in the three models. All models were highly significant, but the non-linear was more robust, had a better distribution of residuals, and did not require data back-transforming, allowing the accurate estimation of biomass at the plot level using simple measurements of vegetation. TAGB ranged from 6.99 Mg ha(-1) (Plains) to 29.24 Mg ha(-1) (Arroyos) in the desertscrub, and was intermediate in the thornscrub (Hillsides: 13.03 Mg ha(-1)). Within-site variability of TAGB was highest in the Plains and lowest in the Hillsides. The weighted mean AGB was 16 Mg ha(-1). Assuming a 1:1 root:shoot ratio, average total biomass could be 32 Mg ha(-1). This remarkable value sets the Sonoran Desert as a potential reservoir of up to 4.4% of the total world deserts plant biomass in less than 1% of the deserts' global area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequences of such forest conversion for soil fungal communities, however, have not been assessed in detail. Materials and methods We utilised direct DNA extraction from soil coupled with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions to investigate soil fungal community structure under native mixed forest and first and second rotation A. cunninghamii plantations at Yarraman State Forest, Queensland, Australia. We also investigated the influence of forest harvest residue windrows on soil fungi in a second rotation A. cunninghamii plantation and compared soil fungal communities in soil with those in sand-filled hyphal ingrowth bags buried at the site. Results and discussion Ordination analysis of the fungal community T-RFLP data indicated significant separation of native forest soil samples from the plantation forest soil samples along canonical axis 1, while with first rotation plantation forest soil samples separated from second rotation forest soil samples along canonical axis 2. Fungal communities in soil and hyphal ingrowth bag samples were also shown to differ significantly for the three forest types, suggesting that the hyphal ingrowth bags selected for certain fungi at the site. Windrow soil samples did not separate significantly from nonwindrow soil samples in the second rotation A. cunninghamii plantation. Mean terminal restriction fragment numbers were significantly lower in the A. cunninghamii plantation samples than in the native forest samples and lower in the second rotation than the first rotation plantations. Terminal restriction fragment numbers were also lower in the hyphal ingrowth bag samples than in the respective soil samples. Analysis of cloned ITS sequences indicated that Ascomycota were most abundant, followed by Basidiomycota and Zygomycota; however, their relative importance varied in the different forest types. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that conversion of native mixed forest to A. cunninghamii plantations changes soil fungal community composition and that the effect is more pronounced in second rotation forests.","[Curlevski, Nathalie J.

The dynamics of ectomycorrhizal (root-inhabiting) and terricolous saprobic (litter-inhabiting) fungal communities were studied by exhaustive sporocarp inventories in a substitution Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest in two 256-m(2) plots sampled for periods of 1 week at 1-m(2) resolution between 1994 and 2007. N was added to the soil twice per year in one plot from the fourth year onwards. The effects of N input and time on aboveground fungal communities were assessed using redundancy analysis, principal response curves and non-parametric multivariate ANOVA. Results of this long-term experiment revealed that both ectomycorrhizal and saprobic fungal communities responded to an increase in soil N input. The ectomycorrhizal community reacted by a fast decrease in sporocarp production and in species richness, whereas the saprobic community was less affected. The response was highly species specific, especially for the saprobic community. The difference in species composition between control and fertilized plots was significant after 1 year of N addition for ectomycorrhizal fungi and only after 3 years for saprobic fungi. An aging effect affected sporocarp production in the whole area. For both communities, this unidirectional drift in species composition was as important as the treatment effect. This result highlights the importance of considering the respective role of treatment and year effects in long-term field experiments on fungal communities.","[Gillet, Francois] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Chrono Environm 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Gillet, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ecol Syst Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Peter, Martina; Ayer, Francois; Buetler, Rita; Egli, Simon] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Gillet, F (reprint author), Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Chrono Environm 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",francois.gillet@univ-fcomte.fr,"Gillet, Francois/B-6160-2008; Peter, Martina/G-2284-2018","Gillet, Francois/0000-0002-3334-1069; Peter, Martina/0000-0002-6365-6889",Forest Service of the Canton of Fribourg,We would like to thank the Forest Service of the Canton of Fribourg for its support and for allowing us to use the Parabock site for this study.

The simulation was conducted for the 111 days from mid May to early September of 2009. A good agreement between the model simulated and field measured soil water contents was obtained, with a maximum rooting depth estimated within the depth range of 1.3-1.6 m. The results suggest that a reasonable estimate of soil water retention parameters, and especially the use of the root uptake compensation significantly improved both numerical accuracy in predicted soil water dynamics, and the biological importance in the predicted seasonal root water extraction. In particular, the model gave a reasonable simulation of the seasonal progression of the drying zone in the soil profile in the summer of 2009. The method and analyses used in this paper may be useful in a wider context of soil-plant relationships.","[Dong, Xuejun; Patton, Bob D.; Nyren, Anne C.; Nyren, Paul E.] N Dakota State Univ, Cent Grasslands Res Extens Ctr, Streeter, ND 58483 USA; [Prunty, Lyle D.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA","Dong, XJ (reprint author), N Dakota State Univ, Cent Grasslands Res Extens Ctr, Streeter, ND 58483 USA.",xuejun.dong@ndsu.edu,,"Dong, Xuejun/0000-0003-3072-1901","Central Grassland Research Extension Center, North Dakota State University","This work was part of North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station projects ND 6146 and ND 6147.

We studied the in situ decomposition and N dynamics of leaf litter and fine root of four subtropical tree species (Pinus massoniana, Castanopsis hystrix, Michelia macclurei and Mytilaria laosensis) to determine whether leaf litter and fine root decomposition is correlated across species as well as which factors influence decomposition above versus below ground. Decomposition rate of leaf litter was related to that of fine root across species. The strong correlation between leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates arose largely for several reasons. First, soil moisture had the similar influences on both leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates. Second, traits (i.e., initial Ca concentration) important to both leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates showed significant similarity among species. Third, initial P, N and aromatic C concentrations, and C/N ratio were uniquely important for fine root decomposition rate, while no unique traits for leaf litter decomposition rate. This also could account for the strong correlation between leaf litter and fine root decomposition rates. Our study suggests that among these subtropical trees, species effects on in situ decomposition rates of leaf litter and fine root are very similar. Thus, species differences in decomposition rates may be as large as they would be if faster decomposition of leaf litter was correlated with faster decomposition of fine root. N immobilization rate of leaf litter was unrelated to that of fine root across species. Our results help explain some important mechanisms by which tree species influence litter in situ decomposition.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Mo, Jiangming] Chinese Acad Sci, S China Bot Garden, Zhaoqing 526070, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 1 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",wanghui@scbg.ac.cn; Liusr@caf.ac.cn,,,"Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry, the Chinese Academy of Forestry; China's National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30590383]; Ministry of Finance [200804001]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2006BAD03A04]","We appreciate Dr. Wei Zhang, Dr. Zuomin Shi, Dr. Pengsen Sun, the section editor (Dr. Alfonso Escudero), and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

This study assessed the influence of seedling size and N concentration on root growth dynamics and its relation to shoot elongation in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) seedlings. We cultivated seedlings that differed in size and tissue N concentration that were subsequently transplanted into transparent methacrylate tubes in the field. The number of roots, root depth, and the root and shoot elongation rate (length increase per unit time) were periodically measured for 10 weeks. At the end of the study, we also measured the twig water potential (psi) and the mass of plant organs. New root mass at the end of the study increased with seedling size, which was linked to the production of a greater number of new roots of lower specific length rather than to higher elongation rate of individual roots. Neither plant size nor N concentration affected root depth. New root mass per leaf mass unit, shoot elongation rate, and pre-dawn psi were reduced with reduction in seedling size, while mid-day psi and the root relative growth rate were not affected by seedling size. N concentration had an additive effect on plant size on root growth but its overall effect was less important than seedling size. Shoot and roots had an antagonistic elongation pattern through time in small seedlings, indicating that the growth of both organs depressed each other and that they competed for the same resources. Antagonism between shoot and root elongation decreased with plant size, disappearing in large and medium seedlings, and it was independent of seedling N concentration. We conclude that root and shoot growth but not rooting depth increased with plant size and tissue N concentration in Aleppo pine seedlings. Since production of new roots is critical for the establishment of planted seedlings, higher absolute root growth in large seedlings may increase their transplanting performance relative to small seedlings. The lack of antagonism between root and shoot growth in large seedlings suggests that these plants can provide resources to sustain simultaneous growth of both organs.","[Cuesta, Barbara; Vega, Jesus; Villar-Salvador, Pedro; Rey-Benayas, Jose Ma] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ecol, Madrid 28871, Spain","Cuesta, B (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ecol, Carretera Madrid Barcelona Km 33-6, Madrid 28871, Spain.",barbara.cuesta@uah.es,"Villar-Salvador, Pedro/L-1380-2014; Rey Benayas, Jose/C-3218-2011","Villar-Salvador, Pedro/0000-0001-9338-4530; Rey Benayas, Jose/0000-0002-2099-8512","FPI-MECMinistry of Education and Science, Spain; Centro Nacional de Recursos Geneticos Forestales; Ministry of Science and Education [CGL2007-60533/BOS, AGL2006-12609-C02-01/FOR]; Madrid Government [S-0505/AMB/0355, S2009AMB-1783]","This study was supported by a FPI-MEC grant to B.

Improving understanding of the ecological factors that trigger transitions to woodlands is key to developing strategies for heathlands management. The irrational use of fire has been recognized as one of the key factors that drives the loss of heathlands of north-west Italy. The effect of high frequency pastoral burning on the replacement of heathlands by grasslands has been documented by several studies. The relationship between fire and tree encroachment is less clear. The paper examines the effect of the fire regime on the encroachment of Populus tremula L. and Betula pendula Roth. in the heathland. The study was carried out at the Managed Nature Reserve of Vauda (7 degrees 41' E, 45 degrees 13' N), which includes one of the most valuable heathlands of north-western Italy. The experimental design consisted of analysing the age structure, dendrometric variables and the species composition of three aspen and birch stands, circular-shaped and isolated within the heathland matrix. From 1986 to 2009 all stands experienced the same fire regime due to pastoral burning. Wildfires of similar behaviour occurred in 1998, 2003 and 2008 and determined the stand structure observed in 2009. The results evidenced that fire acts as a catalyst not only for seedlings establishment, as previously documented, but also for woodland expansion in the heathland. After initial establishment, stands showed a concentric encroachment dynamic, mainly due to aspen root suckering after post-fire stem mortality, whose steps of expansion coincided with the return interval of wildfires. Moreover, aspen determined the loss of heathland characteristic species, whose relative abundances were inversely correlated to aspen density along a gradient from the stands centre to the surrounding heathland. The regulation of current burning practices by prescribed burning, integrated with rational grazing, presents the next research questions to be addressed.","[Ascoli, D.; Bovio, G.] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Agroselviter, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy","Ascoli, D (reprint author), Univ Turin, Dipartimento Agroselviter, VL da Vinci 44, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",d.ascoli@unito.it,,"Ascoli, Davide/0000-0002-2671-5122",,,,41,15,16,0,23,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,27-Sep,2010,3,,,,,,137,143,,10.3832/ifor0548-003,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,759IW,WOS:000290235000005,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Garrett, LG; Kimberley, MO; Oliver, GR; Pearce, SH; Paul, TSH",,,,"Garrett, Loretta G.; Kimberley, Mark O.; Oliver, Graeme R.; Pearce, Stephen H.; Paul, Thomas S.

Don) plantation forests located throughout New Zealand. Stem and branch decay rates were obtained using (1) post-harvest material from two central North Island locations (Kaingaroa and Tarawera Forests) based on a 10-year chronosequence (in ground contact or suspended) and (2) post-thinning stems and attached branch material from five sites covering a range of climatic conditions across New Zealand (Woodhill, Puruki, Hokonui, Nemona and Selwyn) with up to 5 years of decay. Stem, stump and root decay rates were determined from two central North Island locations (Kinleith and Puruki) from thinnings with 0, 5, and 10 years of decay (Kinleith) and mature trees at 0 and 11 years of decay (Puruki). Stem and branch post-harvest material decayed faster when in contact with the ground than when elevated above the ground. The proportion of material elevated or in ground contact was not estimated in this study. P. radiata discs from young trees and post-harvest residue showed no significant diameter effect on decay rate and could be used confidently to predict whole stem decay rate. Discs from older trees covering a larger diameter range at Puruki showed a significant effect of diameter on decay rate. Decay rates of coarse roots at the two central North Island sites were faster than above-ground whole stem decay rates. Exponential models incorporating mean annual temperature for P. radiata stems in ground contact arising from thinning and harvest currently provide the best estimate of residue decay in New Zealand. There was no increase in carbon concentration with decay, suggesting that live stem values may be applied to all dead wood for determining the mass of carbon change with decomposition. Nitrogen concentrations increased with decay. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Garrett, Loretta G.; Kimberley, Mark O.; Oliver, Graeme R.; Pearce, Stephen H.; Paul, Thomas S.

Classical explanations for the evolution of SRA focus on improving offspring fitness in light of resource availability or mate attractiveness. Here, we use genetic models to demonstrate that SRA can evolve to alleviate sexual antagonism by improving the chance that the alleles of a sexually antagonistic trait are transmitted to the sex they benefit. In cases where the trait is autosomally inherited, this result is obtained regardless of whether SRA is based on the mother's or the father's genotype and irrespective of the recombination rate between the trait and SRA loci. SRA also evolves in this manner when the trait is sex-linked, provided that SRA decisions are based on the homogametic genotype (XX mothers or ZZ fathers). By contrast, when based on traits in the heterogametic sex, SRA promotes fixation of the allele that is detrimental to that sex, preventing the evolution of substantial levels of SRA. Our models indicate that the evolution of SRA in nature should be strongly influenced by the genetic architecture of the traits on which it is based and the form of selection affecting them.","[Otto, Sarah P.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Otto, SP (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",otto@zoology.ubc.ca,"Otto, Sarah Perin/K-5625-2012","Otto, Sarah Perin/0000-0003-3042-0818; Albert, Arianne/0000-0002-3050-0888; Blackburn, Gwylim/0000-0001-9112-5121",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We would like to thank T.

In particular, recovery of anthropogenic soils (mainly human-derived artefacts from housing construction and other inert materials or topsoil of terminal phase municipal landfills) cannot rely on spontaneous processes and low-cost/low-impact strategies are needed to prevent desertification. Mediterranean wild legume shrubs have great potential for soil recovery and conservation against desertification, thanks to drought resistance, and their symbiosis with N-2-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this study double inoculated autochthonous wild legume shrubs (the genistea Spartium junceum L. and the thermopsidea Anagyris foetida L) were used in a long-term trial to recover an anthropogenic hill in a semi-arid site of southern Italy, mainly composed of inert and human-derived artefacts. Microbial inoculants strongly enhanced plant establishment and growth on the anthropogenic soil in the greenhouse and in the field up to two years. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and bacterial cultivation revealed a dramatic effect of the tripartite symbiosis on the structure of soil bacterial communities that largely overcomes plant species effect and suggests synergism of AMF with the bacterial community of the mycorhizosphere. Our results demonstrate that microsymbiont inoculation on wild legume shrubs is a promising strategy to rehabilitate anthropogenic soils in Mediterranean semi-arid regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, [CO2] itself has the potential to impact on Australia's terrestrial biodiversity, due to its importance in the photosynthetic process, which underlies all terrestrial food webs. Here, we review our knowledge regarding the impacts of elevated [CO2] on native terrestrial species and ecosystems, and suggest key areas in which we have little information on this topic. Experimental information exists for 70 (or less than 0.05%) of Australia's native terrestrial plant and animal species. Of these, 68 are vascular plants. The growth of Australian woody species is more reliably increased by elevated [CO2] than it is in grasses. At the species level, the most overwhelming responses to increased [CO2] are a reduction in plant nitrogen concentration and an increase in the production of secondary metabolites. This is of particular concern for Australia's unique herbivorous and granivorous marsupials, for which no information is available. While many plant species also displayed increased growth rates at higher [CO2], this was far from universal, indicating that changes in community structure and function are likely, leading to alterations of habitat quality. Future research should be directed to key knowledge gaps including the relationship between [CO2], fire frequency and fire tolerance and the impacts of increasing [CO2] for Australia's iconic browsing mammals. We also know virtually nothing of the impacts of the increasing [CO2] on Australia's unique shrublands and semi-arid/arid rangelands. In conclusion, there is sufficient information available to be certain that the increasing [CO2] will affect Australia's native biodiversity. However, the information required to formulate predictions concerning the long-term future of almost all organisms is far in excess of that currently available.","[Hovenden, Mark J.; Williams, Amity L.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Hovenden, MJ (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Locked Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Mark.Hovenden@utas.edu.au,"Hovenden, Mark/A-1323-2008","Hovenden, Mark/0000-0001-7208-9700",Australian Department of Climate ChangeAustralian Government,"Prof Derek Eamus, Prof Ross McMurtrie and Dr Sukumar Chakraborty all provided unpublished information to assist in the preparation of this review.

All phages had a typical polyhedral head and long non-contractile tail, representing the bacteriophage family close to Siphoviridae. Phages produced distinct types of plaques on their indicator bacterial strains. The host range of the phage isolates was restricted to Rhizobium leguminosarum biovars and no cross infectivity among susceptible strains was observed. A study on the lytic cycle of the phages under identical conditions exhibited distinct latent period and burst size. Inactivation pattern of phages with temperature and UV light was quite distinct. Phage LRP-1 showed higher thermal resistance, though greater sensitivity to UV light, as compared to other phages. Genome sizes of the phages were estimated to vary between 50-72 kbp. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis of the phage indicator rhizobial strains revealed 81% to 100% similarity with R. leguminosarum bv. viciae.

However, few studies have examined the importance of soil organisms in driving plant-soil feedbacks in forested systems. In a tropical forest in central Panama, we examined whether interactions between tree seedlings and their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) lead to plant-soil feedback. Specifically, do tropical seedlings modify their own AMF communities in a manner that either favors or inhibits the next cohort of conspecific seedlings (i.e., positive or negative feedback, respectively)? Seedlings of two shade-tolerant tree species (Eugenia nesiotica, Virola surinamensis) and two pioneer tree species (Luehea seemannii, Apeiba aspera) were grown in pots containing identical AMF communities composed of equal amounts of inoculum of six co-occurring AMF species. The different AMF-host combinations were all exposed to two light levels. Under low light (2% PAR), only two of the six AMF species sporulated, and we found that host identity did not influence composition of AMF spore communities. However, relative abundances of three of the four AMF species that produced spores were influenced by host identity when grown under high light (20% PAR). Furthermore, spores of one of the AMF species, Glomus geosporum, were common in soils of Luehea and Eugenia but absent in soils of Apeiba and Virola. We then conducted a reciprocal experiment to test whether AMF communities previously modified by Luehea and Apeiba differentially affected the growth of conspecific and heterospecific seedlings. Luehea seedling growth did not differ between soils containing AMF communities modified by Luehea and Apeiba. However, Apeiba seedlings were significantly larger when grown with Apeiba-modified AMF communities, as compared to Apeiba seedlings grown with Luehea-modifed AMF communities. Our experiments suggest that interactions between tropical trees and their associated AMF are species-specific and that these interactions may shape both tree and AMF communities through plant-soil feedback.","[Mangan, Scott A.; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Mangan, Scott A.; Herre, Edward A.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Dpo, AA 34002 USA","Mangan, SA (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",smangan37@gmail.com,,,"Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DIGG-0308779, DEB-0049080, DEB-0616891]; Indiana University; American Mammalogy Society; Sigma Xi","We are indebted to Dora Alvarez, Camila Pizano, Charlotte Jander, Andrea Vincent, and Robert Horan for their assistance.

Lotus strigosus hosts were experimentally inoculated with pairs of Bradyrhizobium strains that naturally vary in symbiotic benefit, including a cheater strain that proliferates in the roots of singly infected hosts, yet provides zero growth benefits. Within co-infected hosts, the cheater exhibited lower infection rates than competing beneficial strains and grew to smaller population sizes within those nodules. In vitro assays revealed that infection-rate differences among competing strains were not caused by variation in rhizobial growth rate or interstrain toxicity. These results can explain how a rapidly growing cheater symbiont - that exhibits a massive fitness advantage in single infections - can be prevented from sweeping through a beneficial population of symbionts.","[Sachs, J.

Despite a growing body of literature identifying orchid mycorrhizal associations, the nature and specificity of the association between orchid species and mycorrhizal fungi remains largely an open question. Nonetheless, better insights into these obligate plant-fungus associations are indispensable for understanding the biology and conservation of orchid populations. To investigate orchid mycorrhizal associations in five species of the genus Orchis (O. anthropophora, O. mascula, O. militaris, O. purpurea, and O. simia), we developed internal transcribed spacer-based DNA arrays from extensive clone library sequence data sets, enabling rapid and simultaneous detection of a wide range of basidiomycetous mycorrhizal fungi. A low degree of specificity was observed, with two orchid species associating with nine different fungal partners. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of Orchis mycorrhizal fungi are members of the Tulasnellaceae, but in some plants, members of the Thelephoraceae, Cortinariaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae were also found. In all species except one (O. mascula), individual plants associated with more than one fungus simultaneously, and in some cases, associations with >= 3 mycorrhizal fungi at the same time were identified. Nestedness analysis showed that orchid mycorrhizal associations were significantly nested, suggesting asymmetric specialization and a dense core of interactions created by symmetric interactions between generalist species. Our results add support to the growing literature that multiple associations may be common among orchids. Low specificity or preference for a widespread fungal symbiont may partly explain the wide distribution of the investigated species.","[Jacquemyn, Hans; Honnay, Olivier] KULeuven, Dept Biol, Plant Ecol Lab, B-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Cammue, Bruno P.

Our study site is the spruce-dominated Howland Forest AmeriFlux site, in central Maine, USA. Our analysis focuses on: (1) full characterization of data uncertainties, and treatment of these uncertainties in the parameter estimation; (2) evaluation of how combinations of different data streams influence posterior parameter distributions and model uncertainties; and (3) comparison of model performance (in terms of both predicted fluxes and pool dynamics) during a 4-year calibration period (1997-2000) and a 4-year validation period (""forward run"", 2001-2004). We find that woody biomass increment, and, to a lesser degree, soil respiration, measurements contribute to marked reductions in uncertainties in parameter estimates and model predictions as these provide orthogonal constraints to the tower NEE measurements. However, none of the data are effective at constraining fine root or soil C pool dynamics, suggesting that these should be targets for future measurement efforts. A key finding is that adding additional constraints not only reduces uncertainties (i.e., narrower confidence intervals) on model predictions, but at the same time also results in improved model predictions by greatly reducing bias associated with predictions during the forward run.","[Richardson, Andrew D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Harvard Univ Herbaria, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hollinger, David Y.; Evans, Robert S.] US Forest Serv, No Res Stn, USDA, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Moore, David J.

Forests act as carbon sinks and hence, play a crucial role in worlds and forests carbon budgets. Unfortunately, growth models and biomass calculations existing so far mainly concentrate on the above-ground part of trees. For this reason, the aim of the present study is to develop an annually resolved 3D growth model for tree roots, which allows for reliable biomass calculations and can later be combined with above-ground models. A FARO scan arm was used to measure the surface of a tree-root segment. In addition, ring-width measurements were performed manually on sampled cross sections using WinDENDRO. The main goal of this study is to model root growth on an annual scale by combining these data sets. In particular, a laser scan arm was tested as a device for the realistic reproduction of tree-root architecture, although the first evaluation has been performed for a root segment rather than for an entire root system. Deviations in volume calculations differed between 5% and 7% from the actual volume and varied depending on the used modeling technique. The model with the smallest deviations represented the structure of the root segment in a realistic way and distances and diameter of cross sections were acceptable approximations of the real values. However, the volume calculations varied depending on object complexity, modeling technique and order of modeling steps. In addition, it was possible to merge tree-ring borders as coordinates into the surface model and receive age information in connection with the spatial allocation. The scan arm was evaluated as an innovative and applicable device with high potential for root modeling. Nevertheless, there are still many problems connected with the scanning technique which have an influence on the accuracy of the model but are expected to improve with technical progress.","[Wagner, Bettina; Gaertner, Holger] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Wagner, Bettina; Ingensand, Hilmar] ETH, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Santini, Silvia] ETH, Inst Pervas Comp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Wagner, B (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",bettina.wagner@wsl.ch,"Gartner, Holger W/J-7887-2013","Gartner, Holger W/0000-0001-6243-9578",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021-113450],"The authors wish to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for funding the project (No.: 200021-113450).

Fine root intercepts were counted on 3 faces of 90-198 soil cubes (1 dm(3) in volume) in each stand and fine root lengths (L) were measured inside 576 soil cubes, sampled between the depths of 10 cm and 290 cm. The number of fine root intercepts was counted on one vertical face perpendicular to the planting row (N-t), one vertical face parallel to the planting row (N-l) and one horizontal face (N-h), for each soil cube sampled. An overall isotropy of fine roots was shown by paired Student's t-tests between the numbers of fine roots intersecting each face of soil cubes at most stand ages and soil depths. Specific root lengths decreased with stand age in the upper soil layers and tended to increase in deep soil layers at the end of the rotation. A linear regression established between N-t and L for all the soil cubes sampled accounted for 36% of the variability of L. Such a regression computed for mean Nt and L values at each sampling depth and stand age explained only 55% of the variability, as a result of large differences in the relationship between L and Nt depending on stand productivity. The equation RLD=1.89*LAI*N-t, where LAI was the stand leaf area index (m(2) m(-2)) and Nt was expressed as the number of root intercepts per cm(2), made it possible to predict accurately (R-2=0.84) and without bias the mean RLDs (cm cm(-3)) per depth in each stand, for the whole data set of 576 soil cubes sampled between 2 years of age and the end of the rotation.","[Laclau, Jean-Paul] Cidade Univ, Dept Ecol IB, CIRAD USP, Rua Matao,Trav 14 N 321, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Laclau, Jean-Paul] CIRAD, St Pierre 97410, Reunion, France; [Ranger, Jacques] INRA, Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Seichamps, France; [Stape, Jose Luiz] NCSU, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC USA; [Maurice, Jerome] AGROPARISTECH, Engref, Fif, Nancy, France; [Laclau, Jean-Paul; Nouvellon, Yann; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre] CIRAD, UPR Ecosyst Plantat, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Scorzoni Re, Danilo] UNESP, Dept Forest Sci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [de Moraes Goncalves, Jose Leonardo; Nouvellon, Yann; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Sao Paulo, Forest Dept, Esalq, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Sao Paulo, Biosci Inst, Dept Ecol, Sao Carlos, Brazil","Laclau, JP (reprint author), Cidade Univ, Dept Ecol IB, CIRAD USP, Rua Matao,Trav 14 N 321, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",laclau@cirad.fr,"Goncalves, Jose Leonardo Moraes/G-4979-2013; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre/E-6929-2014; Laclau, Jean-Paul/O-2189-2019; Nouvellon, Yann/C-9295-2016","Goncalves, Jose Leonardo Moraes/0000-0003-1068-5448; Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; Nouvellon, Yann/0000-0003-1920-3847",European Integrated Project [515960]; Eucflux project; Usp/Cofecub; Brafagri programme; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; European Integrated Project [515960]; Eucflux project; Usp/Cofecub; Brafagri programme; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"We are grateful to the European Integrated Project ""Ultra Low CO<INF>2</INF> Steelmaking"" (Ulcos, Contract no 515960), the Eucflux project (www.ipef.br/eucflux/), Usp/Cofecub, the Brafagri programme, and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their financial support.

Thus, most investigations focussed on the C- and N-input via litter fall, widely neglecting the importance of root exudation. As microbes, which are known to be important drivers of matter fluxes in soil, feed on these root exudates, increased knowledge on the availability of these compounds in soil might help to understand biodiversity effects on soil. We therefore investigated the effect of plant diversity on size and composition of the free soil amino acid pool in a grassland experiment, as amino acids are an important C- as well as N-source for microbes. Despite a positive diversity effect on plant productivity, we only found an insignificant increase of the size of the free amino acid pool in soil. This was most likely caused by an increase of the microbial population and thus an increased amino acid mineralization. At the same time the composition of the amino acid pool changed significantly between plant diversity levels. This most likely reflects differences in plant input as well as differences in microbial mineralization and enabled us to separate diversity levels by means of discriminant analysis.","[Sauheitl, Leopold; Glaser, Bruno; Dippold, Michaela; Leiber, Katharina] Univ Bayreuth, Soil Phys Sect, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","Sauheitl, L (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Soil Phys Sect, Univ Str 30, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany.",leopold.sauheitl@uni-bayreuth.de,"Dippold, Michaela/C-1548-2017",,"German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [GL327/4, FOR 456]; Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung","We thank the German Research Foundation (GL327/4,4) and the Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung for the financial support of this study.

Priority effects can operate in two ways: size-asymmetric competition and creation of ""soil legacies,"" effects on soil that may last long after the competitive effect. We examined how these two types of priority effects, competition and soil legacies, drive interactions between seedlings of native and exotic California grassland plants. We established native and exotic communities in a mesocosm experiment. After 5 weeks, we removed the plants from half the treatments (soil legacy treatment) and retained the plants in the other half (priority effect treatment, which we interpret to include both competition and soil legacies). We then added native or exotic seed as the colonizing community. After 2 months, we measured the biomass of the colonizing community. When germinating first, both natives and exotics established priority effects, reducing colonist biomass by 86 and 92%, respectively. These priority effects were predominantly due to size-asymmetric competition. Only exotics created soil legacies, and these legacies only affected native colonizers, reducing biomass by 74%. These results imply that exotic species priority effects can affect native grassland restorations. Although most restorations focus on removing exotic seedlings, amending soil to address soil legacies may also be critical. Additionally, because native species can exclude exotics if given a head start, ensuring that natives germinate first may be a cost-effective restoration technique.","[Grman, Emily] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Grman, Emily] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Grman, E (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",grmanemi@msu.edu,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176",,,,63,109,112,8,191,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

The height, number of leaves and stem diameter were analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment, dry matter of the leaves, shoots, roots, root to shoot ratio and biomass allocation in leaf, stem and roots were determined. Leaf area, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were also calculated. Water stress reduced the height, number of leaves and shoot diameter in the plants of the several treatments. Water stress reduced leaf stem and root dry matter. Only the biomass allocation to leaves was reduced. Leaf area was also reduced; however, there were not significant differences for leaf area ratio and specific leaf area. The recovery of the re-watering plants was evident by emitting new leaves. The results suggest that neem seedlings must be cultivated. in the initial phase of development, under 80% of field capacity, with maximum production.","[Martins, Marcio de Oliveira] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Mansur Custodio Nogueira, Rejane Jurema] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil; [de Azevedo Neto, Andre Dias] UFRB, Cruz Das Almas, BA, Brazil; [dos Santos, Mauro Guida] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil","Martins, MD (reprint author), Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",momartins@yahoo.com.br; rjmansur1@gmail.com; azevedo_neto@yahoo.com.br; mauroguida@yahoo.com.br,"Santos, Mauro/N-1211-2019; Santos, Mauro G/D-7026-2012; Martins, Marcio/S-3062-2016","Santos, Mauro/0000-0001-5146-4591; Santos, Mauro G/0000-0001-5146-4591; Martins, Marcio/0000-0003-4947-9019",,,,29,7,7,0,6,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

We review a selection of the increasing body of literature on this subject and assess the relevance of its expectations by examining the methods used to determine, the impact of environmental factors on, and the expected ecosystem consequences of fungal:bacterial dominance. Considering methods, we observe that fungal:bacterial dominance is contingent on the actual measure used to estimate it. This has not been carefully considered; fungal:bacterial dominance of growth, biomass, and residue indicate different, and not directly relatable aspects, of the microbial community's influence on soil functioning. Considering relationships to environmental factors, we found that shifts in fungal:bacterial dominance were not always in line with the general expectation, in many instances even being opposite to them. This is likely because the traits expected to differentiate bacteria from fungi are often not distinct. Considering the impact of fungal:bacterial dominance on ecosystem function, we similarly found that expectations were not always upheld and this too could be due to trait overlap between these two groups. We explore many of the potential reasons why expectations related to fungal:bacterial dominance were not met, highlighting areas where future research, especially furthering a basic understanding of the ecology of bacteria and fungi, is needed.

A 60 x 100-m plot was established in an A. mangium plantation that included different topographical elements of the upper plateau, lower plateau, upper slope and foot slope. The plot was divided into 10 x 10-m grids and gas fluxes and soil properties were measured at 77 grid points at 10-m intervals within the plot. Spatial structures of the gas fluxes and soil properties were identified using geostatistical analyses. Averaged N2O and CO2 fluxes in the wetter season (1.85 mg N m(-2) d(-1) and 4.29 g Cm-2 d(-1), respectively) were significantly higher than those in the drier season (0.55 mg N m(-2) d(-1) and 2.73 g Cm-2 d(-1), respectively) and averaged CH4 uptake rates in the drier season (-0.62 mg Cm-2 d(-1)) were higher than those in the wetter season (-0.24 mg Cm-2 d(-1)). These values of N2O fluxes in A. mangium soils were higher than those reported for natural forest soils in Sumatra, while CO2 and CH4 fluxes were in the range of fluxes reported for natural forest soils. Seasonal differences in these gas fluxes appears to be controlled by soil water content and substrate availability due to differing precipitation and mineralization of litter between seasons. N2O fluxes had strong spatial dependence with a range of about 18 m in both the drier and wetter seasons. Topography was associated with the N2O fluxes in the wetter season with higher and lower fluxes on the foot slope and on the upper plateau, respectively, via controlling the anaerobic-aerobic conditions in the soils. In the drier season, however, we could not find obvious topographic influences on the spatial patterns of N2O fluxes and they may have depended on litter amount distribution. CO2 fluxes had no spatial dependence in both seasons, but the topographic influence was significant in the drier season with lowest fluxes on the foot slope, while there was no significant difference between topographic positions in the wetter season. The distributions of litter amount and soil organic matter were possibly associated with CO2 fluxes through their effects on microbial activities and fine root distribution in this A. mangium plantation.

The AM fungi were grown in symbiosis with cucumber in a compartmented growth system, which allowed AM fungal external mycelium to grow into root-free compartments. The fungicide Benomyl was applied to the root-free compartments to create an alternative non-mycorrhizal control treatment. Whole cell biomarker fatty acids were employed to quantify different groups of soil microorganisms including the two AM fungi. Abundance of most microbial groups were reduced by external mycelium of both AM fungi, though differential effects on the microbial community composition were observed between the two AM fungi as revealed from principal component analysis. Inhibition of other soil microorganisms was more pronounced in root-free soil with mycelium of G. mosseae than with mycelium of G. intraradices. In general, cellulose increased the amount of biomarker fatty acids of most groups of soil microorganisms, but cellulose did not affect the influence of AM fungi on other soil microorganisms. Benomyl suppressed growth of the external mycelium of the two AM fungi and had limited non-target effects on other microbial groups. In conclusion, our results show differential effects of external mycelium of AM fungi on other soil microbial communities, though both AM fungi included in the study overall inhibited most microbial groups as examined using whole cell biomarker fatty acids.

They have, however, also been found to occur in plant tissues, such as roots. Thus, the use of these PLFAs as fungal biomarkers in sieved soil, which may still contain small remains of roots, has been questioned. We used data from a recent beech tree girdling experiment to calculate the contribution of roots to these biomarkers and were able to demonstrate that not more than 0.61% of 18:1 omega 9 and 18:2 omega 6,9 in sieved soil samples originated from roots (but 4% of 18:3 omega 3,6,9). Additionally, the abundance of the biomarker 18:2 omega 6,9 in the soil was found to be highly correlated to ectomycorrhizal root colonization, which further corroborates its fungal origin. PLFA biomarkers were substantially reduced in vital roots from girdled trees compared to roots of control trees (by up to 76%), indicating that the major part of PLFAs measured in roots may actually originate from ectomycorrhizal fungi growing inside the roots. We calculated, that even a near to 50% reduction in fine root biomass - as observed in the girdling treatment - accounted for only 0.8% of the measured decrease of 18:2 omega 6,9. Our results demonstrate that both 18:1 omega 9 and 18:2 omega 6,9 are suitable biomarkers for detecting fungal dynamics in soils and that especially 18:2 omega 6,9 is a reliable biomarker to study mycorrhizal dynamics in beech forests.

In general, soil compaction has a direct effect on roots, whereas light affects leaves and stems. Although plants in nature are exposed to variable levels of soil compaction and light, no study on the potential mutual interactions of these limiting factors in woody plants has to the authors' knowledge been reported to date. The aim of this work was therefore to elucidate the effects of soil compaction and light availability on growth and biomass allocation in the deciduous oak Quercus pyrenaica. To this end, a study was conducted at two light levels (viz. 3% and 100% of incident light, designated as low-light and high-light, respectively) under a wide range of soil compaction (0.02-3 MPa as penetration resistance) in a greenhouse. Total biomass was found to be positively affected by both light and soil compaction. There was marginally significant interaction between the effects of the two factors on total biomass, which was positively affected by soil compaction only under high-light conditions. Soil compaction had a strong, negative effect on the length of the main root; thus, at maximum soil compaction, such a length was roughly one-half that observed at lower compaction levels. Also, the specific root length of main root (root length to root mass ratio) was reduced by roughly one-half in highly compacted soils. These results suggest that an unfavourable combination of soil compaction and light availability may have severely adverse effects on woody plant performance in drought periods since plants with short roots can hardly access water at deep soil levels. The strength of this effect may be modulated by light availability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here we applied microsatellite markers to genotype beech trees (Fagus sylvatica, L.) and roots in subplots in an undisturbed, old-growth monospecific forest (Hainich, Germany). Roots were quantified and assigned to individuals. As a measure for territoriality, we determined root segregation. The hypothesis was tested that intraspecific root diversity was higher in the geometric centre of a triangle formed by beech trees than at positions closer to the stem of a tree. Space exploration measured as presence of an individual was correlated with stem diameter but not soil occupation. Fine root biomass. intraspecific Shannon diversity, effective numbers of genotypes and Evenness were stable and unrelated to the distance of the target tree.

Location High Arctic tundra near Barrow, Alaska, USA (71 degrees 18'N 156 degrees 40'W). Methods Above and below ground plant biomass of all species was harvested following 3-4 yr of 1-2 degrees C of experimental warming. Biomass allocation and arbuscular mycorrhizal infection were also examined in the two dominant species, Salix rotundifolia and Carex aquatilis. Results Above-ground biomass of graminoids increased in response to warming but there was no difference in total plant biomass or the ratio of above-ground to below-ground biomass for the community as a whole. Carex aquatilis increased above-ground biomass and proportionally allocated more biomass above ground in response to warming. Salix rotundifolia increased the amount of above- and below-ground biomass allocated per leaf in response to warming. Mycorrhizal infection rates showed no direct response to warming, but total abundance was estimated to have likely increased in response to warming owing to increased root biomass of S. rotundifolia. Conclusions The community as a whole was resistant to short-term warming and showed no significant changes in above- or below-ground biomass despite significant increases in above-ground biomass of graminoids. However, the patterns of biomass allocation for C. aquatilis and S. rotundifolia did change with warming. This suggests that long-term warming may result in changes in the above-ground to below-ground biomass ratio of the community.","[Hollister, Robert D.] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Biol, Allendale, MI 49401 USA; [Flaherty, Kathryn J.] Coker Coll, Dept Sci & Math, Hartsville, SC 29550 USA","Hollister, RD (reprint author), Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Biol, 1 Campus Dr, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",hollistr@gvsu.edu; kflaherty@coker.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [9714103, 0632263]; NASA Earth System Science FellowshipNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","We are indebted to Patrick Webber for his support and guidance throughout this project.

The upper Verde River, Arizona, is a relatively free-flowing river and has abundant native riparian vegetation. Tamarix is present on the upper Verde but is a minor component of the vegetation (8% of stems). This study sought to determine whether riparian vegetation characteristics differed between sites where Tamarix was present and sites where Tamarix was absent during the invasion of the upper Verde. We hypothesized that herbaceous understory and woody plant communities would differ between Tamarix present and absent sites. Our hypothesis was generally confirmed, the two types of sites were different. Tamarix present sites had greater abundance of all vegetation, native understory species, graminoids, and native trees, and a positive association with perennial native wetland plant species. Tamarix absent sites had greater abundance of exotic plants and upland adapted plants and an association with greater abiotic cover and litter. These results are contrary to other reports of Tamarix association with depauperate riparian plant communities, and suggest that Tamarix invasion of a watershed with a relatively natural flow regime and a robust native plant community follows similar establishment patterns as the native riparian plant community.","[Johnson, Tyler D.; Medina, Alvin L.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Johnson, Tyler D.; Kolb, Thomas E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Johnson, Tyler D.] EcoResults Inst, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA","Johnson, TD (reprint author), US Forest Serv, Lincoln Natl Forest, 3463 Las Palomas Rd, Alamogordo, NM 88310 USA.",tdjohnson@fs.fed.us,,,US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station Research Work Unit [4302]; Tamarix removal project; Arizona Water Protection Fund Commission (AWPFC) [wpf0342],"We thank Daniel Laughlin for guidance and comments about community data analysis.

Mycorrhizal fungi mediate the interaction between plants and soils, yet little is known about the mycorrhizal fungi of serpentine-tolerant plants. Ectomycorrhizas and hypogeous fungal sporocarps were sampled on paired serpentine and nonserpentine soils in southwestern Oregon. We hypothesized that conifers on serpentine soils would have fewer species of mycorrhizal fungi, a distinct assemblage of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and fewer hypogeous sporocarps with less species richness. Sporocarps were sampled and soil cores collected around pines on serpentine and nonserpentine soils. Conifers on serpentine and nonserpentine soils hosted overlapping communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi, as characterized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling. From soil cores, we categorized 27 species by morphotype, of which 18 were identified by DNA. Fewer hypogeous sporocarps with less taxonomic richness were collected on serpentine soils. The lack of indicator species of mycorrhizal fungi and the greater variability among samples on serpentine soils suggest that soil composition does not determine the mycorrhizal community. The sparseness of host vegetation may limit the ability of fungi to grow from tree to tree and may increase the reliance on spore dispersal, thus creating a more varied pattern of mycorrhizal communities.","[Gladish, Sandra; Frank, Jonathan; Southworth, Darlene] So Oregon Univ, Dept Biol, Ashland, OR 97520 USA","Southworth, D (reprint author), So Oregon Univ, Dept Biol, 1250 Siskiyou Blvd, Ashland, OR 97520 USA.",southworth@sou.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0516229],"This study was supported by National Science Foundation grant DEB-0516229.

It has been hypothesized that ""common mycorrhizal networks,'' wherein roots of seedlings are linked to overstory trees by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, offset some or all of the negative effects of trees on seedlings. Here we report the results of an unambiguous experimental test of this hypothesis in a monodominant Pinus radiata forest. We also tested the hypothesis that adaptive differentiation among plant populations causes local plant genotypes to respond more positively to mycorrhizal networks than nonlocal plant genotypes. Our results demonstrate large positive effects of overstory mycorrhizal networks on seedling survival, along with simultaneous negative effects of tree roots, regardless of whether plant genotypes were locally derived. Physiological and leaf-chemistry measurements suggest that seedlings connected to common mycorrhizal networks benefited from increased access to soil water. The similar magnitude of the positive and negative overstory effects on seedlings and the ubiquity of mycorrhizal networks in forests suggest that mycorrhizal networks fundamentally influence the demographic and community dynamics of forest trees.","[Booth, Michael G.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA","Booth, MG (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, POB 757000, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",mbooth@iab.alaska.edu,,,"Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS 0346770, DEB 0625120]; Department of Biology at the University of Mississippi; American Philosophical Society","We owe thanks to Holly Alpert, Tiffany Bensen, Rebecca King, Bridget Piculell, and Christopher Schwind for substantial assistance with field and laboratory work.

However, little is known about how community assembly aboveground influences soil microbial communities belowground. We hypothesized that plant establishment order can affect the community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in roots, with the strength of this effect dependent on both host plant identity and neighboring plant identity. Such priority effects of plants on AMF may act through host-specific filters of the initial species pool that limit the available pool for plants that established second. In a greenhouse experiment with four plant hosts, we found that the strength of the priority effect on AMF communities reflected both host plant characteristics and interactions between host and neighbor plant species, consistent with differential host specificity among plants. These patterns were independent of plant biomass and root colonization. Functional studies of AMF associated with a wide array of host plants will be required to further understand this potential driver of community dynamics.","[Hausmann, Natasha Teutsch] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Inst Environm Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cellular & Mol Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Hausmann, NT (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",chawkes@mail.utexas.edu,,"Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0508926]; Dolores Zohrab Liebmann Fellowship,"For comments on the manuscript, we are grateful to T.

A total of 843 fungal isolates were recovered and sequenced (Colombia, 267; Hawai'i, 393; Mexico, 109; Puerto Rico, 74) yielding 257 unique ITS genotypes (Colombia, 113; Hawaii, 126; Mexico, 32; Puerto Rico, 40). The most abundant taxa were Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Xylariaceae. Overall, 220 genotypes were detected in only one of the countries sampled; only two genotypes were found in all four countries. Endophytes were also isolated from Coffea canephora, Coffea congensis, Coffea liberica, Coffea macrocarpa, Coffea racemosa, and Coffea stenophylla in Hawai'i. The high biodiversity of fungal endophytes in coffee plants may indicate that most of these are ""accidental tourists"" with no role in the plant, in contrast to endophytes that could be defined as ""influential passengers"" and whose role in the plant has been elucidated. This study, the most comprehensive analysis of fungal endophytes associated with a single host species, demonstrates that coffee plants serve as a reservoir for a wide variety of fungal endophytes that can be isolated from various plant tissues, including the seed, and illustrates the different fungal communities encountered by C. arabica in different coffee-growing regions of the world.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Alnus-associated EM congeners were not closely related, indicating the distinct nature of Alnus EM assemblages is not due to a unique co-evolutionary history.

In both experiments, three pines were selected as host, i.e. Pinus parviflora of the subgen. Strobus, and Pinus densiflora and Pinus thunbergii of the subgen. Pinus which are widely distributed in Japan. The inoculation experiment revealed that fine roots of seedlings of all pine species were colonized by S. pictus and formed typical ectomycorrhizas. The bait experiment with intact soil of a P. parviflora forest, which included propagules of S. pictus, clarified that S. pictus could form ectomycorrhizas on the fine roots of P. parviflora seedlings, while it could not form them on the fine roots of P. densiflora and P. thunbergii. In the bait experiment with intact soil of P. densiflora or P. thunbergii forest, ectomycorrhizas of S. pictus were not observed on the fine roots of P. parviflora. These results demonstrate that the fungus has the potential to form ectomycorrhizas with Pinus subgen. Pinus, but in natural conditions it only lives symbiotically with Pinus subgen. Strobus in Japan. The fact that this fungus has ecological host specificity provides useful information to study the bio- and phylogeography of this fungus.

Stable isotope probing was used to trace autotrophically fixed 13C into phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers in Mojave Desert soils planted with the desert shrub, Larrea tridentata. Seedlings were pulse-labeled with 13CO(2) under ambient and elevated CO2 in controlled environmental growth chambers. The label was chased into the soil by extracting soil PLFAs after labeling at Days 0, 2, 10, 24, and 49. Eighteen of 29 PLFAs identified showed 13C enrichment relative to nonlabeled control soils. Patterns of PLFA enrichment varied temporally and were similar for various PLFAs found within a microbial functional group. Enrichment of PLFA 13C generally occurred within the first 2 days in general and fungal biomarkers, followed by increasingly greater enrichment in bacterial biomarkers as the study progressed (Gram-negative, Gram-positive, actinobacteria). While treatment CO2 level did not affect total PLFA-C concentrations, microbial functional group abundances and distribution responded to treatment CO2 level and these shifts persisted throughout the study. Specifically, ratios of bacterial-to-total PLFA-C decreased and fungal-to-bacterial PLFA-C increased under elevated CO2 compared with ambient conditions. Differences in the timing of 13C incorporation into lipid biomarkers coupled with changes in microbial functional groups indicate that microbial community characteristics in Mojave Desert soils have shifted in response to long-term exposure to increased atmospheric CO2.","[Jin, V.

A field experiment was conducted to examine the responses of SRA and SRH to water and nitrogen (N) addition in a temperate steppe in northern China during two hydrologically contrasting growing seasons. Water addition stimulated SRA and SRH in both years, and their increases were significantly greater in a dry year (2007) than in a wet year (2006). N addition increased SRA in 2006 but not in 2007, while it decreased SRH in both years, leading to a positive response of SRTOT in 2006 but a negative one in 2007. The different responses of SRA and SRH indicate that it will be uncertain to predict soil C storage if SRTOT is used instead of SRH to estimate variations in soil C storage. Overall, N addition is likely to enhance soil C storage, while the impacts of water addition are determined by its relative effects on carbon input (plant growth) and SRH. Antecedent water conditions played an important role in controlling responses of SRA, SRH and the consequent SRTOT to water and N addition. Our findings highlight the predominance of hydrological conditions in regulating the responses of C cycling to global change in the semiarid temperate steppe of northern China.","[Yan, Liming; Chen, Shiping; Huang, Jianhui; Lin, Guanghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Yan, Liming] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chen, SP (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",spchen@ibcas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30800141, 90511001, 30821062]; Action Plan for the Development of Western China of the Chinese Academy of Science [KZCX2-XB2-01-04]; Science and Technology Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFYBB2007008]","We thank Wenli Zhang, Haixia Miao and Ping Zhang for their help in setting up the field experimental facilities and conducting field measurements.

This study demonstrates that feedback loops between plants and insects contribute to both plant and insect diversity. Synthesis of several studies reveals that both bottom-up and top-down forces are important for plant and insect communities. 2. Feedback loops between plants and soil organisms contribute to plant and soil diversity. An analysis of multiple systems reveals that pathogens, mutualists, and a wide variety of soil fauna directly influence, and are influenced by, plant diversity. 3. The connection of plant-insect and soil-plant feedback loops leads to the maintenance of all three groups, and the maintenance of these feedback loops crucially affects insect diversity. Examples of the influence of soil community diversity on insect diversity, and the influence of insect diversity on soil community diversity, as well as feedbacks through all three trophic levels are provided. 4. Finally, means of conserving and restoring soil communities to influence the conservation and restoration of insect communities are discussed.","[Bennett, Alison] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Bennett, A (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, 839 Russell Labs,1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",alibenne@bio.indiana.edu,,,School of Natural Resources & Environment at the University of Michigan,"I thank Mark Hunter, Rachel Vannette, Sarah Breed, Susan Kabat, Elizabeth Wason, Heather Reynolds, Mike Hillstrom, Ken Keefover-Ring, Inga Mary Bennett and Erika Lucas for taking the time to review and discuss this study with me.

Location An invaded coastal dune ecosystem in Portugal and reference bradyrhizobial strains from the Iberian Peninsula and other locations. Methods Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from root nodules of plants of the Australian invasive Acacia longifolia and the European natives Cytisus grandiflorus, Cytisus scoparius and Ulex europaeus. Total DNA of each isolate was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primer BOX A1R. Subsequent PCR-sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and the nifD and nodA genes were performed for all different strains. Results The four plant species analysed were nodulated by bacteria from three different Bradyrhizobium lineages, although most of the isolates belonged to the Bradyrhizobium japonicum lineage sensu lato. Ninety-five per cent of the bradyrhizobia isolated from A. longifolia, C. grandiflorus and U. europaeus in the invaded ecosystem had nifD and nodA genes of Australian origin. Seven isolates obtained in this study define a new distinctive nifD group of Bradyrhizobium from western and Mediterranean Europe. Main conclusions These results reveal the introduction of exotic bacteria with the invasive plant species, their persistence in the new geographical area and the nodulation of native legumes by rhizobia containing exotic symbiotic genes. The disruption of native mutualisms and the mutual facilitation of the invasive spread of the introduced plant and bradyrhizobia could constitute the first report of an invasional meltdown documented for a plant-bacteria mutualism.","Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, Fac Sci & Technol, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal","Rodriguez-Echeverria, S (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, Fac Sci & Technol, POB 3046, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",susanare@ci.uc.pt,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/I-1730-2015","Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/0000-0002-2058-3229","European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [POCI/BIA-BDE/56941/2004, PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","This work was supported by the projects ROBIN (POCI/BIA-BDE/56941/2004) and MUTUALNET (PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008), both funded by the European Union and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.

This similarity has led to uncertainty regarding the distinctiveness of endolichenic fungi compared with endophytes. Here, we evaluate whether these fungi represent distinct ecological guilds or a single guild of flexible symbiotrophs capable of colonizing plants or lichens indiscriminately. Culturable fungi were sampled exhaustively from replicate sets of phylogenetically diverse plants and lichens in three microsites in a montane forest in southeastern Arizona (USA). Intensive sampling combined with a small spatial scale permitted us to decouple spatial heterogeneity from host association and to sample communities from living leaves, dead leaves, and lichen thalli to statistical completion. Characterization using data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and partial large subunit (ITS-LSU rDNA) provided a first estimation of host and substrate use for 960 isolates representing five classes and approximately 16 orders, 32 families, and 65 genera of Pezizomycotina. We found that fungal communities differ at a broad taxonomic level as a function of the phylogenetic placement of their plant or lichen hosts. Endolichenic fungal assemblages differed as a function of lichen taxonomy, rather than substrate, growth form, or photobiont. In plants, fungal communities were structured more by plant lineage than by the living vs. senescent status of the leaf. We found no evidence that endolichenic fungi are saprotrophic fungi that have been ""entrapped"" by lichen thalli. Instead, our study reveals the distinctiveness of endolichenic communities relative to those in living and dead plant tissues, with one notable exception: we identify, for the first time, an ecologically flexible group of symbionts that occurs both as endolichenic fungi and as endophytes of mosses.","[U'Ren, Jana M.; Arnold, A.

Here, we explored near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the proportion of woody fine roots in mixed samples and analyzed whether the prediction quality of NIRS models is related to the complexity of the fine-root mixture. For model calibration and validation purposes, 11 series of artificial mixed species samples containing known amounts of fine roots of up to four temperate tree species and non-woody plants were prepared. Three types of models with different calibration/validation approaches were developed and tested against external independent data for additional validation. With these models the proportion of each species in root mixtures was predicted accurately with low standard error of prediction (RMSECV/RMSEP < 6.5%) and high coefficient of determination (r(2) > 0.93) for all fine-root mixtures. In addition, NIRS models also provided satisfactory estimates for samples with low (< 15%) or no content of particular components. The predictive power of the NIRS models did not decrease substantially with increasing complexity of the root samples. The approach presented here is a promising alternative to hand sorting of fine roots, which may be influenced substantially by operator variation, and it will facilitate investigating belowground interactions between woody species.","[Lei, Pifeng; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Lei, Pifeng] Cent S Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China","Lei, PF (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",pifeng.lei@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We are grateful to Julia Sohn, Adam Benneter, Grit Techel and Zhanying Gu for assistance with sample collection.

Their root distribution in this environment, and factors that affect it, are poorly understood. Robust recommendations on effective tree spacing depend on knowledge of root systems. This study determined the effect of tree density, position between trees, and soil depth (0-90 cm) on root number, root diameter distribution, root area ratio (RAR), and cross sectional area per root for young trees on slopes. Data were collected for lateral roots using trenches. Greater than 80% of roots were < 5 mm diameter and root attributes were highest in shallow soil. Trees at 770 stems per hectare (sph) had 3-12 times more roots and 3-9 times greater RAR than those at densities of a parts per thousand currency sign 237 sph, representative of most tree-pasture systems. Mean cross sectional area per root was similar across densities. Positions close to trees had twice as many roots (46 vs. 23/m(2)) and RAR (109 vs. 52 mm(2)/m(2)) as positions midway between trees. The study provided quantitative understanding of variation in root distribution with tree density and information useful for supporting and strengthening recommendations on densities for effective erosion control.","[Douglas, Grant B.; Potter, J.

Asparagine is generally recovered in low proportions in root exudates but represent a major fraction of amino acids in root tissues, and the opposite is found for glycine. Amino acid profiles were studied in two potential sites of intense exudation, root tips and nodules, and a N-15 labelling method was used to compare influxes and effluxes of different amino acids. Metabolic inhibitors were used to test the assumption that amino acid exudation is a passive process. We observed that amino acid profiles were similar between whole roots, root tips and nodules. Influxes of asparagine and glycine were in the same range, but efflux of glycine largely exceeded efflux of asparagine. Metabolic inhibitors strongly reduced glycine influx and modified glycine efflux. It is concluded that the selectivity of amino acid exudation is not explained by the composition of putative intense sites of exudation but is explained by highly contrasted effluxes between amino acids. The effect of metabolic inhibitors shows that glycine efflux occurs not only as a simple passive leakage. These results suggest that amino acid exudation is a plant-controlled process.","[Cliquet, Jean-Bernard] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, INRA, UMR, INRA EVA 950, F-14032 Caen, France; [Lesuffleur, Fabien] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, INRA, UMR950, EVA, F-14032 Caen, France","Cliquet, JB (reprint author), Univ Caen Basse Normandie, INRA, UMR, INRA EVA 950, F-14032 Caen, France.",jean-bernard.cliquet@unicaen.fr,,,,,,46,25,26,3,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2010,333,2-Jan,,,,,191,201,,10.1007/s11104-010-0334-1,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,628BO,WOS:000280089400016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wang, W; Chen, WL; Wang, SP",,,,Wang Wei; Chen Weile; Wang Shaopeng,,,Forest soil respiration and its heterotrophic and autotrophic components: Global patterns and responses to temperature and precipitation,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Autotrophic respiration; Heterotrophic respiration; Mean annual precipitation; Mean annual temperature; Non-linear responses,FINE-ROOT DYNAMICS; CO2 EFFLUX; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; WATER-CONTENT; CARBON; SENSITIVITY; FLUX; DECOMPOSITION; ACCLIMATION; DEPENDENCE,"Quantifying global patterns of forest soil respiration (SR), its components of heteroteophic respiration (FIR) and belowground autotrophic respiration (AR), and their responses to temperature and precipitation are vital to accurately evaluate responses of the terrestrial carbon balance to future climate change. There is great uncertainty associated with responses of SR to climate change, concerning the differences in climatic controls and apparent Q(10) (the factor by which respiration increases for a 10 degrees C increase in temperature) over HR and AR. Here, we examine available information on SR, HR, AR, the contribution of HR to SR (HR/SR), and Q(10) of SR and its components from a diverse global database of forest ecosystems. The goals were to test how SR and its two components (AR and FIR) respond to temperature and precipitation changes, and to test the differences in apparent Q(10) between AR and HR. SR increased linearly with mean annual temperature (MAT), but responded non-linearly to mean annual precipitation (MAP) in naturally-regenerated forests. For every 1 degrees C increase in MAT, overall emissions from SR increased by 24.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1). When MAP was less than 813 mm, every 100 mm increase in MAP led to a release of 75.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1), but the increase rate declined to 20.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) when MAP was greater than 813 mm. MAT explained less variation in AR than that in HR. The overall emissions in AR and HR for every 1 degrees C increase in MAT, increased by 12.9 and 16.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The AR emissions for every 100 mm increase in MAP, increased by 44.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) when MAP less than 1000 mm. However, above the threshold. AR emissions stayed relatively constant. HR increased linearly by 15.0 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with every 100 mm increased in MAR The Q(10) value of SR increased with increasing depth at which soil temperature was measured up to 10 cm and was negatively correlated with HR/SR. Our synthesis suggests AR and HR differ in their responses to temperature and precipitation change. We also emphasized the importance of information on soil temperature measurement depth when applying field estimation of Q(10) values into current terrestrial ecosystem models. Q(10) values derived from field SR measurements including AR, will likely overestimate the temperature response of HR on a future warmer earth. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacteroids invading a nodule are no longer free-growing cells, instead depending on the plant cell for all resources. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the bacteroid differentiation of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, a time-course analysis of bacteroid protein profiles was studied by 2-D gel electrophoresis in soybean nodules. Using proteomic analysis, protein expressions in soybean nodule bacteroids 7, 10, 14, 28, and 49 days after inoculation (DAI) were monitored. The time points coincide with the early stage of nodule formation (7-10 DAI), the onset of nitrogen fixation (14-28 DAI), and nodule senescence (49 DAI). In this study, 275 annotated protein spots were successfully identified, and a cluster analysis of their expression was performed. A large portion of putative, upregulated proteins were observed in bacteroids at 7 or 10 DAI, and these upregulated proteins were mainly related to transcription, translation, protein folding, and degradation. In the later period (14-28 DAI) of bacteroid differentiation, a number of Nif and Fix proteins were upregulated. In addition, proteins related to the chaperonin and a synthetic enzyme of the poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate were expressed at high abundance. A number of proteins related to solute transporter were upregulated in the bacteroids and dominantly detected throughout nodule development. Changes of relative abundance of these proteins are discussed in relation to symbiosis.","[Nomura, Mika; Arunothayanan, Hatthaya; Dao, Tan Van; Tajima, Shigeyuki] Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Kagawa 7610795, Japan; [Dao, Tan Van] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ctr Resources & Environm Studies, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le, Hoa Thi-Phuong] Hanoi Univ Educ, Fac Biol Agron, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Kaneko, Takakazu; Sato, Shusei; Tabata, Satoshi] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Chiba 2920818, Japan","Nomura, M (reprint author), Kagawa Univ, Fac Agr, Kagawa 7610795, Japan.",nomura@ag.kagawa-u.ac.jp,"Sato, Shusei/A-3616-2015","Sato, Shusei/0000-0002-0293-5366","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [19580067, 19580068]","We thank Peter Lutes for critically reading the document.

In the manure plot, beef cattle manure with bark was applied at a rate of 43-44 Mg fresh matter (236-310 kg N) ha-1 year-1, and a supplement of chemical fertilizer was also added to equalize the application rate of mineral N to that in the fertilizer plots (164-184 kg N ha-1 year-1). Grass was harvested twice per year. The total mineral N supply was estimated as the sum of the N deposition, chemical fertilizer application and gross mineralization of manure (GMm), soil (GMs), and root-litter (GMl). GMm, GMs and GMl were estimated by dividing the carbon dioxide production derived from the decomposition of soil organic matter, root-litter and manure by each C : N ratio (11.1 for soil, 15.5 for root-litter and 23.5 for manure). The N uptake in aboveground biomass for each growing season was equivalent to or greater than the external mineral N supply, which is composed of N deposition, chemical fertilizer application and GMm. However, there was a positive correlation between the N uptake in aboveground biomass and the total mineral N supply. It was assumed that 58% of the total mineral N supply was taken up by the grass. The N supply rates from soil and root-litter were estimated to be 331-384 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 94-165 kg N ha-1 year-1, respectively. These results indicated that the GMs and GMl also were significant inputs in the grassland N budget. The cumulative N(2)O flux for each season showed a significant positive correlation with mineral N surplus, which was calculated as the difference between the total mineral N supply and N uptake in aboveground biomass. The emission factor of N(2)O to mineral N surplus was estimated to be 1.2%. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis suggested that the N(2)O emission factor increased with an increase in precipitation. Consequently, soil and root-litter as well as chemical fertilizer and manure were found to be major sources of mineral N supply in the grassland, and an optimum balance between mineral N supply and N uptake is required for reducing N(2)O emission.","[Shimizu, Mariko] Hokkaido Univ, Soil Sci Lab, Grad Sch Agr, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Hata, Hiroshi] Hokkaido Univ, Agroecosyst Res Stn, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan","Shimizu, M (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Soil Sci Lab, Grad Sch Agr, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",mariko-s@chem.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Hatano, Ryusuke/A-5113-2012","Hatano, Ryusuke/0000-0002-2261-1799",Racing and Livestock Association,This study was partly supported by a research grant provided by the Project entitled 'Establishment of good practices to mitigate Greenhouse Gas emissions from Japanese grasslands' funded by Racing and Livestock Association.

However, very little is known regarding possible interactions between light condition, defoliation (D) and fine root vitality (% live roots) and metabolic activity, and whether different plant strategies (compensation, trade-off and equilibrium) to defoliation depend on individual species light requirements. To explore the response of roots to such conditions, an experiment was established in which we experimentally removed 50% of leaves in 1-year-old seedlings of Sambucus nigra, Cornus sanguinea, Prunus serotina, Frangula alnus and Corylus avellana grown in 15% and full sunlight. On average, defoliation leads to a 15% reduction in fine root (< 2 mm) vitality (% live roots). However, a statistically significant reduction in root vitality after defoliation was detected only in those species that are less herbivorized in nature (48% in S. nigra and 5% in C. sanguinea). On average, shade conditions (L) resulted in 18% decline in root vitality, and the effects of defoliation were also 22% higher than for plants grown in full light. Root vitality in both treatments (D and L) was significantly correlated with their dry mass, concentration of total phenol (TPh) and carbon to nitrogen ratio, and negatively correlated with nitrogen, soluble carbohydrates, starch and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). To a large extent, root vitality and chemistry varied by species. Higher root vitality was related to higher concentrations of phenolics, more than to N and TNC concentrations. Concentrations of phenolics also differed significantly between defoliated plants and controls. However, in defoliated plants, an increase in TPh was observed only in two species, which belong to two different groups in light requirements and susceptibility to insect grazing (C. sanguinea and P. serotina). This study indicated that higher vitality of roots occurred in species that are characterized by higher insect defoliation under natural conditions. It is likely that higher root vitality of these species was related to their high level of TPh and tannins. This was especially noticeable for the reduced light treatment, which represents natural conditions under which insect defoliation is highest. Our results suggest that varied strategies of resource allocation were used by the different species in response to variations in light and defoliation.","[Karolewski, Piotr; Zadworny, Marcin; Mucha, Joanna; Napierala-Filipiak, Anna; Oleksyn, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Oleksyn, Jacek] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Karolewski, P (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",pkarolew@man.poznan.pl,"Oleksyn, Jacek/I-4539-2012","Napierala-Filipiak, Anna/0000-0003-3349-3764; Zadworny, Marcin/0000-0002-7352-5786; Mucha, Joanna/0000-0002-1290-9639; Karolewski, Piotr/0000-0003-3064-1274",,,,49,24,26,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2010,30,8,,,,,969,978,,10.1093/treephys/tpq060,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,630TU,WOS:000280298000004,20624813,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Bever, JD; Dickie, IA; Facelli, E; Facelli, JM; Klironomos, J; Moora, M; Rillig, MC; Stock, WD; Tibbett, M; Zobel, M",,,,"Bever, James D.; Dickie, Ian A.; Facelli, Evelina; Facelli, Jose M.; Klironomos, John; Moora, Mari; Rillig, Matthias C.; Stock, William D.; Tibbett, Mark; Zobel, Martin",,,Rooting theories of plant community ecology in microbial interactions,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DEPENDENT SEEDLING MORTALITY; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SOIL FEEDBACKS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON TRANSFER; PHOSPHORUS ACQUISITION; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; MAINTAIN DIVERSITY; NEGATIVE FEEDBACK,"Predominant frameworks for understanding plant ecology have an aboveground bias that neglects soil micro-organisms. This is inconsistent with recent work illustrating the importance of soil microbes in terrestrial ecology. Microbial effects have been incorporated into plant community dynamics using ideas of niche modification and plant-soil community feedbacks. Here, we expand and integrate qualitative conceptual models of plant niche and feedback to explore implications of microbial interactions for understanding plant community ecology. At the same time we review the empirical evidence for these processes. We also consider common mycorrhizal networks, and propose that these are best interpreted within the feedback framework. Finally, we apply our integrated model of niche and feedback to understanding plant coexistence, monodominance and invasion ecology.","[Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Dickie, Ian A.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Facelli, Evelina; Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Klironomos, John] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Moora, Mari; Zobel, Martin] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stock, William D.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jbever@indiana.edu,"Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Zobel, Martin/H-1336-2015; Stock, William/B-8858-2008; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013; Tibbett, Mark/C-8425-2013; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Tibbett, Mark/P-2079-2019","Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Zobel, Martin/0000-0001-7957-6704; Stock, William/0000-0003-2475-2963; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Tibbett, Mark/0000-0003-0143-2190","Australian Research Council-New Zealand Research Network for Vegetation FunctionAustralian Research Council; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0616891, DEB-0919434]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH-5 R01 GM092660]; Ecosystem Resilience OBI of the FRST of NZ; ETFEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [7371, 7366]; Center of Excellence FIBIR","This collaboration was supported by the Australian Research Council-New Zealand Research Network for Vegetation Function (Working Group 61 - Plant-Soil Microbes Feedbacks).

In this study, we focused on the widely studied symbiotic association Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium meliloti, which forms indeterminate nodules. Using two strains isolated from the same soil and displaying different nitrogen fixation phenotypes on the same fixed plant line, we analysed the existence of both partner choice and plant sanctions by performing split-root experiments. By measuring different parameters such as the nodule number, the nodule biomass per nodule and the number of viable rhizobia per nodule, we showed that M. truncatula is able to select rhizobia based on recognition signals, both before and after the nitrogen fixation step. However, no sanction mechanism, described as a decrease in rhizobia fitness inside the nodules, was detected. Consequently, even if partner choice seems to be widespread among legumes, sanction of non-effective rhizobia might not be universal.","[Gubry-Rangin, Cecile; Bena, Gilles] IRD, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Gubry-Rangin, Cecile] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Garcia, Marjorie] INRA, UMR 113, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Bena, Gilles] Univ Mohammed V Agdal Rabat, Fac Sci, LMBM, Rabat, Morocco","Gubry-Rangin, C (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Environm & Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",c.rangin@abdn.ac.uk,,"Bena, Gilles/0000-0003-3080-8441; Gubry-Rangin, Cecile/0000-0002-5937-2496",INRA Sante des Plantes et Environment; French Ministry of Education and Research; University Montpellier II,"This work was supported by a programme funded by INRA Sante des Plantes et Environment (Rhizosphere Ecology of Annual Medics programme).

However, the relative importance of drought tolerance to explain this regional variation in the species remains elusive. Here, we raise the question whether water availability constitutes a likely driver of regional variation in biomass allocation, growth and morphological traits of ten populations that cover the distribution range of P. pinaster. We carried out an experiment where seedlings of five families per population were submitted to two contrasting watering treatments. The effects of water availability and population were significant for relative diameter and height growth rate, biomass allocation and number of lateral stems and dwarf shoots. Total dry mass significantly differed between watering treatments but it did not among populations. Populations could be clustered into four main groups. Root mass fraction explained most of the variation and significantly correlated to altitude but not to aridity. The geographical pattern of genetic variation found in morphology and biomass allocation did not translate into population differences in drought tolerance or phenotypic plasticity to water availability, indicating that water availability is not a likely driver of the regional variation observed in the studied traits of P. pinaster at the seedling stage.","[Sanchez-Gomez, David] UPM, ETSI Montes, Grp Invest Genet & Fisiol Forestal, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Sanchez-Gomez, David; Aranda, Ismael] INIA UPM, Unidad Mixta Genom & Ecosifiol Forestal, Madrid, Spain; [Majada, Juan; Alia, Ricardo; Feito, Isabel] Secc Forestal, Estn Expt La Mata, SERIDA, Grado 33820, Asturias, Spain; [Alia, Ricardo; Aranda, Ismael] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr INIA, CIFOR, Dept Sistemas & Recursos Forestales, Madrid 28040, Spain; Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst UVa INIA, Madrid, Spain","Sanchez-Gomez, D (reprint author), UPM, ETSI Montes, Grp Invest Genet & Fisiol Forestal, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",david.sango@gmail.com,"Aranda, Ismael/B-7050-2008; Alia, Ricardo/B-5160-2011; Sanchez-Gomez, David/K-5653-2014","Aranda, Ismael/0000-0001-9086-7940; Alia, Ricardo/0000-0002-9426-0967; Sanchez-Gomez, David/0000-0002-0588-9713","European Project [TREESNIP-QLK3-CT2002-01973]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain;  [AGL2006-03242];  [RTA2007-00084-00-00]","This study was funded by the project RTA2007-00084-00-00, the European Project TREESNIP-QLK3-CT2002-01973 and the project AGL2006-03242.

The 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that most of the isolates belong to the Streptomyces genus. These thirty isolates were tested for their capabilities of solubilizing/mineralizing sparingly phosphate sources, N-2-fixation and/or siderophore production, typical traits of the so-called Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR). Phosphate solubilizing ability was widely exhibited by the isolated. All of them produced acid phosphatase and thirteen of them alkaline phosphatase. Ten strains grew in N-free media. Almost all strains produced siderophores, however the production level was in general very low and only the strain Thermobifida MCR24 released considerable amounts of this metabolite. Streptomyces MCR9, Thermobifida MCR24 and Streptomyces MCR26 were selected to test their interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi because they produced the highest plant growth beneficial effects among ten isolates pre-selected as promissory PGPR. The inoculation of AM fungi improved early establishment of MCR9 in clover rhizosphere, and the late establishment of MCR24. The three actinomycete strains improved AM mycelial growth in absence of the test plant, and MCR9 and MCR26 also stimulate AM fungal spore germination. Inoculation of clover plants with either of the selected actinomycetes enhanced plant growth and N acquisition. Co-inoculation of actinomycetes and Glomus mosseae produced synergic benefits on plant growth and MCR9 and MCR24 also on P acquisition. The three selected actinomycetes improve AM formation by clover plants and Glomus mosseae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a novel way to produce carbonized materials. The goal here was to test if HTC material, in our case derived from beet root chips, has adverse effects on plant growth or that of root associated symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We carried out several studies, and found that increasing concentrations of HTC material could be deleterious for plant growth of Taraxacum, starting at 10 vol% additions. Conversely, root colonization of the fungal symbiont was stimulated at an addition of 20 vol%. Soil pH changes occurring during the study could be traced to microbial reduction reactions, and these led to a pH increase of the medium despite the quite acidic nature of the HTC material itself. In separate assays, we showed that spore germination of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices was stimulated by the HTC material, suggesting that direct effects on the fungi are likely in addition to those mediated by the host plant. A third experiment with a different plant species (Trifolium repens) confirmed the major conclusions, and showed also neutral to stimulatory effect on nodulation. Our results suggest that HTC materials should be carefully tested and optimized to reduce negative effects on plant growth before applications in the field are undertaken, particularly at high addition rates.

We examined community structure in three studies in mixed upland, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forests and examined taxa involved in cellulose degradation at one upland site. We found that soil horizon was the factor by which fungal communities were most strongly structured and that predictable turnover in upland fungal species occurred through succession. Communities from consecutive summers were not significantly different, indicating that interannual variation was small in relation to differences between forest types and soil horizons, yet the community at a seasonal study site underwent significant changes within a year. In each study, mycorrhizal fungi dominated the community. Fungi rather than bacteria appeared to dominate [(13)C] cellulose degradation, with strongest growth in taxa that were not dominant members of the untreated community, including members of the genus Sebacina. Overall, our results point to considerable interannual resilience juxtaposed with narrow niche partitioning and the capacity of individual taxa in these hyperdiverse communities to respond strongly to resource inputs and changes in other abiotic environmental parameters such as temperature. Our data double the cumulative total of fungal sequences in GenBank and together achieve a better picture of fungal communities here than for any other ecosystem on earth at this time.","[Taylor, D.

RGR of the seedlings in current-year water deficit without experiencing previous-year water deficit (ID) was smaller than that of seedlings irrigated well in both years (II). Surprisingly, RGR did not differ between 2-year-water-deficited (DD) and -well-irrigated (II) treatments. There was no difference in the area-based photosynthetic rate of the late leaves, which are formed in the current-year environment, between the four water treatments, but their leaf longevity was shortened by water deficit. Area-based photosynthetic rate of the early leaves, whose buds are formed in the previous year environment, was smaller in ID than in II, but it did not differ between DD and II. The de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle was greater in ID than in DD. Leaf mass per area (leaf dry weight/leaf area) did not differ among the four water treatments. Specific root length (root total length/root dry weight) did not differ between ID and II. It was greater in DD than in II, probably resulting in increased water uptake efficiency. Photoprotective systems such as xanthophyll contents and antioxidant enzyme activities did not differ among the four treatments. Morphological responses of B. ermanii roots seem to be important as whole-plant-level responses to water deficit for maintaining RGR, in addition to leaf-level photosynthetic and phenological responses of two types of leaves.

Using a factorial experiment with transplanted seedlings, we demonstrate how direct and indirect consumer effects prevent recruitment by Quercus garryana, a keystone savanna species of northwestern North America. Foremost, intense herbivory by mostly exotic small mammals severely damaged or killed 100% of unprotected seedlings during winter. Many damaged seedlings survived but were 64% smaller in size and produced 75% fewer leaves. Herbivory by deer had no detectable impact despite being long hypothesized as a major contributor to oak decline. Indirectly, herbivory altered the outcome of moisture limitation and competition. Without small mammals, summer drought and a dense exotic grass cover associated with. re suppression significantly reduced growth but caused little mortality. With small mammals, both significantly increased mortality of herbivore-damaged seedlings. Herbivore damage also increased the likelihood of severe insect attack, possibly due to reduced investment in foliar defense by recovering seedlings. These results show that no single factor necessarily prevents seedling establishment by oaks, but that the combination of herbivory, undisturbed exotic grass swards, and summer drought creates an almost insurmountable barrier for recruitment.","[MacDougall, Andrew S.; Duwyn, Alisha; Jones, Natalie T.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","MacDougall, AS (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",amacdo02@uoguelph.ca,"MacDougall, Andrew/F-2037-2011","Jones, Natalie/0000-0001-5114-7123",Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank Collin Elder, Sandra VanVliet, Irvin Banman, Tim Ennis, Greg Baute, Liz Gillis, and the Nature Conservancy of Canada.

Interactions between aboveground C and N cycling are more clearly characterized than belowground processes. Through synthesizing data from multiple terrestrial ecosystems, we quantified the responses of belowground C cycling under N addition. We found that N addition increased litter input from aboveground (+20%) but not from fine root. N addition inhibited microbial activity as indicated by a reduction in microbial respiration (-8%) and microbial biomass carbon (-20%). Although soil respiration was not altered by N addition, dissolved organic carbon concentration was increased by 18%, suggesting C leaching loss may increase. N addition increased the C content of the organic layer (+17%) but not the mineral soil layer. Overall, our meta-analysis indicates that N addition will increase short term belowground C storage by increasing C content of organic layer. However, it is difficult to predict the response of long term C sequestration since there is no significant change in mineral soil C content.","[Liu, Lingli; Greaver, Tara L.] US EPA, Environm Media Assessment Grp, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Off Res & Dev, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA","Liu, LL (reprint author), US EPA, Environm Media Assessment Grp, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Off Res & Dev, MD B243-01, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",lingliliu@hotmail.com; greaver.tara@epa.gov,"Liu, Lingli/A-7771-2008; Liu, Lingli/Q-2867-2019","Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151; Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151",,,,53,297,340,24,431,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We analysed root spatial and biomass distribution in 48 harvested seedlings. Compared to the control, both MSP and H treatments resulted in a significantly higher root system biomass (means C: 16.4 g, H: 45.7 g, MSP: 41.4 g, MSP + H: 102.2 g). The proportion of lateral root biomass increased from 38% (C) to 62% (MSP + H), while the two remaining treatments (H, MSP) attained percentages of 48% and 51%, respectively. The treatments did not alter seedlings' allometry and root:shoot ratio significantly. However, biomass distribution of different root system parts varied among treatments, so that lateral root biomass increased relative to leaf biomass from C to MSP + H variant. Site preparation treatments (MSP, MSP + H) increased the horizontal extension of root biomass, compared to C and H variants. We conclude that mounding site preparation is an efficient method for the reforestation of pedunculate oak stands. Due to the comparative positive effects on root system development, MSP presents an alternative to herbicide treatment, particularly at sites where the use of chemicals is restricted.","[Bolte, Andreas] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Inst Forest Ecol & Forest Inventory, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Bolte, Andreas] Univ Gottingen, Burckhardt Inst, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Lof, Magnus] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Bolte, A (reprint author), Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Inst Forest Ecol & Forest Inventory, Alfred Moller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany.",andreas.bolte@vti.bund.de,"Bolte, Andreas/A-3521-2009",,"Lidellska foundation; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; Sustainable Management in Hardwood Forests","We are grateful to Ulf Johansson for the assistance at Skarhult experimental forest, Tomasz Czajkowski (Johann Heinrich v.

Despite numerous studies, questions still remain as to whether the chemical composition of OM may alter with these environmental changes. In this study, we employed molecular-level methods to investigate the composition and degradation of various OM components in the forest floor (O horizon) and mineral soil (0-15 cm) from the Duke forest free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. We measured microbial responses to elevated CO2 and N fertilization in the mineral soil using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles. Increased fresh carbon inputs into the forest floor under elevated CO2 were observed at the molecular-level by two degradation parameters of plant-derived steroids and cutin-derived compounds. The ratios of fungal to bacterial PLFAs and Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacterial PLFAs decreased in the mineral soil with N fertilization, indicating an altered soil microbial community composition. Moreover, the acid to aldehyde ratios of lignin-derived phenols increased with N fertilization, suggesting enhanced lignin degradation in the mineral soil. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of soil humic substances revealed an enrichment of leaf-derived alkyl structures with both elevated CO2 and N fertilization. We suggest that microbial decomposition of SOM constituents such as lignin and hydrolysable lipids was promoted under both elevated CO2 and N fertilization, which led to the enrichment of plant-derived recalcitrant structures (such as alkyl carbon) in the soil.","[Feng, Xiaojuan; Simpson, Andre J.; Simpson, Myrna J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Schlesinger, William H.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA","Simpson, MJ (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",myrna.simpson@utoronto.ca,"Feng, Xiaojuan/I-6142-2013","Feng, Xiaojuan/0000-0002-0443-0628; Simpson, Myrna/0000-0002-8084-411X","Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Centre for Global Change Science at the University of Toronto; Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-95ER62083]; Southeast Regional Center (SERC) of the National Institute for Global Environmental Change (NIGEC) [DE-FC02-03ER63613]","Dr. Ram Oren is greatly acknowledged for facilitating collaboration and sample collection from the Duke Forest FACE experiment.

It is known that some AMF host in their cytoplasm Gram-positive endobacteria called bacterium-like organisms (BLOs), of unknown phylogenetic origin. In this study, an extensive inventory of 28 cultured AMF, from diverse evolutionary lineages and four continents, indicated that most of the AMF species investigated possess BLOs. Analyzing the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as a phylogenetic marker revealed that BLO sequences from divergent lineages all clustered in a well-supported monophyletic clade. Unexpectedly, the cell-walled BLOs were shown to likely represent a sister clade of the Mycoplasmatales and Entomoplasmatales, within the Mollicutes, whose members are lacking cell walls and show symbiotic or parasitic lifestyles. Perhaps BLOs maintained the Gram-positive trait whereas the sister groups lost it. The intracellular location of BLOs was revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and confirmed by pyrosequencing. BLO DNA could only be amplified from AMF spores and not from spore washings. As highly divergent BLO sequences were found within individual fungal spores, amplicon libraries derived from Glomus etunicatum isolates from different geographic regions were pyrosequenced; they revealed distinct sequence compositions in different isolates. Our results show a vertically inherited, monophyletic and globally distributed lineage of endobacteria thriving in AMF cytoplasm. These bacteria split from their sister groups more than 400 Myr ago, colonizing their fungal hosts already before main AMF lineages separated. The BLO-AMF symbiosis can, therefore, be dated back at least to the time when AMF formed the ancestral symbiosis with emergent land plants.

Substantial genetic variation occurs among nuclei within a single mycelium or isolate. AMF reproduce through spores that contain varying fractions of this heterogeneous population of nuclei. It is not clear whether this genetic variation on the genome level actually contributes to the AMF phenotype. To investigate the extent to which polymorphisms in nuclear genes are transcribed, we analysed the intra-isolate genomic and cDNA sequence variation of two genes, the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rDNA) of Glomus sp. DAOM-197198 (previously known as G. intraradices) and the POL1-like sequence (PLS) of Glomus etunicatum. For both genes, we find high sequence variation at the genome and transcriptome level. Reconstruction of LSU rDNA secondary structure shows that all variants are functional. Patterns of PLS sequence polymorphism indicate that there is one functional gene copy, PLS2, which is preferentially transcribed, and one gene copy, PLS1, which is a pseudogene. This is the first study that investigates AMF intra-isolate variation at the transcriptome level. In conclusion, it is possible that, in AMF, multiple nuclear genomes contribute to a single phenotype.","[Boon, E.; Zimmerman, E.; Hijri, M.] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Lang, B.

However, research on this subject has mainly focused around conceptual models. Here we explore whether plant-soil biota feedbacks and disturbance, two major factors capable of facilitating invasive plants in introduced ranges, interact to preferentially benefit exotics compared to native plants. We investigated the influence of fire disturbance on plant-soil biota interactions for the invasive Acacia longifolia and two dominant natives (Cytisus striatus and Pinus pinaster) in Portuguese dune systems. In the first experiment, we grew exotic and native plants in soil inoculated with soil biota from unburned or recently burned soils collected in an area with small invasion intensity by A. longifolia. Soil biota effects on the exotic legume A. longifolia changed from neutral to positive after fire, whereas the opposite outcome was observed in the native legume C. striatus, and a change from negative to neutral effects after fire occurred in the native P. pinaster. Fire reduced mycorrhizal colonization in all species and rhizobial colonization in C. striatus but not in A. longifolia. In the second experiment, we grew the exotic and native plants with conspecific and heterospecific soil biota from undisturbed soils (area with low invasion intensity by A. longifolia), and from post-fire soils (area affected by a fire similar to 12 years ago and currently heavily invaded by A. longifolia). The exotic benefited more from post-fire than from undisturbed soil biota, particularly from those associated with natives. Natives did not experience detrimental effects with invasive-associated soil biota.

The sand is rich in lime, but in most places the soil is decalcified in the upper layers, and therefore this site shows a large variation in pH within short distances. We collected samples at three different soil depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) and found the pH to range from 5 to 8 in the topsoil and from 4.5 to 9.5 in the deepest layer. The abundance of saprophytic fungi and bacteria was investigated using signature phospholipid fatty acids and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) using the neutral lipid fatty acid 16:1 omega 5. The PLFA pattern of the topsoil was different from that in the other two layers, as indicated by principal component analysis. The saprotrophic fungi were associated with high pH, and bacteria with low pH in these sandy soils. No relation was found between pH and AMF in the topsoil, while a positive relation was found in the deepest soil layer. The saprophytic fungi-to-bacteria ratio was constant with depth, while the AMF-to-bacteria ratio increased with soil depth. The results showed that high soil pH favoured fungal saprophytes in sandy grasslands and that AMF are relatively more abundant than the other two groups in deeper soil layers: particularly so when the pH is high.

We also related AMF diversity to soil parameters (total N, total P. available P. extractable K, total Ca, total Mg, total Fe, total Cu, total Zn, total Mn, glomalin-related soil protein, microbial biomass C, dehydrogenase, urease and acid phosphatase activities, water-soluble carbon and carbohydrates and aggregate stability) at different doses of P. The AM fungal small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes were subjected to PCR, cloning, SSCP, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Nine fungal types were identified: six belonged to the genus Glomus and three to Acaulospora. The majority of fungal types showed high similarity to sequences of known glomalean isolates: Aca 1 to Acaulospora mellea, Aca 2 to Acaulospora rugosa, Aca 3 to Acaulospora spinosa, Glo 1 to Glomus intraradices and Glo 3 to Glomus fasciculatum. The control treatment was dominated by species belonging to the genus Acaulospora. However, when the soil was fertilised with low doses of P, the colonisation of roots increased and there was a change in the AMF diversity, the genus Glomus dominating. The AM development and the abundance of AM fungal types in roots were decreased dramatically by the fertilisation with high doses of P. without differences between the sources of P used. The available P in soil was negatively correlated with the AMF diversity. In conclusion, the application of low doses of P as rock phosphate stimulated mycorrhization and enhanced the soil quality parameters except water-soluble carbohydrates, helping to offset a loss of fertility in P-poor tropical savanna soils.

Predicting the effects of climate change on vegetation development requires understanding of the exact relation between climate, moisture availability, and plant growth. Accurate moisture measurements in naturally vegetated areas are difficult because of high spatial variability and because of the coarse, shallow soils. In this study, we evaluated the possibilities of using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to measure soil moisture availability and plant water use in a Mediterranean natural area. We found that ERT is a useful tool for measuring soil conditions, providing information on the spatial patterns within the soil and reaching depths otherwise inaccessible. In heterogeneous soils, we differentiated between lithological and moisture effects in the measurements using multitemporal data. Absolute calibration to moisture content was sometimes possible, but strongly location dependent. Based on the ERT measurements, we found that although the soils in the study area are shallow and rocky, plant roots penetrate deeply into the fractured and weathered bedrock, and vegetation subtracts water from depths down to 6 m and below. This information is important for understanding the plant-soil relations and modeling vegetation development. We conclude that ERT provides crucial information on soil moisture processes unavailable using any other currently available measurement method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While the toxicity and carcinogenicity of nitrobenzene on humans and animals have been studied, less is known about its genotoxicity to plants. In this study, the genotoxic effects of nitrobenzene were investigated with growing soybean seedlings in solution culture. Compared with the control, the growth of soybean seedlings (taproot length, longest lateral root length and lateral roots number) decreased and showed statistics difference at nitrobenzene test concentration of 50 and 100 mg/L Micronucleus, chromosomal bridge and others chromosomal aberrations were observed in soybean root tip cells exposed to nitrobenzene. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased linearly with nitrobenzene test concentration between 5 and 50 mg/L and decreased at 100 mg/L which showed significant difference between control and 25 mg/L or higher test concentration. Results of the present study suggest that nitrobenzene has genotoxicity on soybean root tip cells. The mechanism of genotoxicity of NB needs further study. It is concluded that high environmental levels of nitrobenzene in rivers, lakes and dam waters are hazardous to aquatic species and to irrigated plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

All heartwood parameters investigated, including heartwood radius (HR), heartwood formation rate (HFR), heartwood ring number (HRN), heartwood initiation age (HIA), and heartwood volume ratio (HVR), were positively correlated with tree cambial age (CA). The HR, sapwood width (SW), sapwood area (SA), heartwood and sapwood volumes were significantly related to stem diameter at breast height (DBH) or xylem diameter. There was a polynomial relationship between the sapwood ring longevity (SRL) and sapwood ring number (SRN). However, most of the allometric relationships were species-dependent. The hardwood formation patterns were different between coniferous and broadleaved tree species. A power function was suitable to scale SA from DBH, but the exponent varied from 1.32 for the larch to 2.19 for the cork-tree. Our allometry provided a practical means to assess wood development and related physiology for the temperate tree species.","[Wang, Xingchang; Wang, Chuankuan; Zhang, Quanzhi; Quan, Xiankuai] NE Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Wang, CK (reprint author), NE Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",wangck-cf@nefu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Quanzhi/A-2693-2014","Zhang, Quanzhi/0000-0001-5139-8870; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30625010]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2006BAD03A0703]; Special Research Program for Public-welfare Forestry [200804001]","This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30625010), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2006BAD03A0703), and Special Research Program for Public-welfare Forestry (No. 200804001) to C.

Seedlings and cuttings were grown under net-house conditions and the data on growth and quality parameters were recorded up to 2 years. Tea plants were found to be highly colonized by AMF (74-83%) after 1 year. The significant increase in most of the growth parameters (root/shoot length, dry weight; r/s ratio) was recorded in AMF-treated plants, which also showed better tea quality parameters than noninoculated plants. Maximum significant increases up to 31% and 100%, over control, were recorded in amino acids and total protein content, respectively. Similarly, maximum increase in total polyphenols (15%) and caffeine content (34%) over control was also significant. Enhanced sugar content (maximum 16% in total soluble sugars, maximum 45% in reducing sugars, and maximum 69% in non-reducing sugars) was recorded in AMF-inoculated plants. In most cases, better response was observed in tea plants inoculated with AMF consortia from NTR.

Species abundance, richness, and diversity were compared among sites. Significant differences were found among the three sites for sporocarp abundance and biomass but not for total ECM root tips. The more diverse sporocarp community was found at the youngest, less fertile site. Dominant species at the sporocarp and ECM morphotype levels differed across the chronosequence. The largest proportion of sporocarp species was siteexclusive, which suggests that aboveground communities depend upon soil conditions. Contrarily, 85% of ECM morphotypes were present at least at two sites. The poor correspondence between the aboveground and belowground views of the ECM fungal community may be due to differences in sampling methodology and level of identification. Inocybe and Laccaria species were abundant fruiters at all sites, and as multisite fungi, they may be tested for inoculum efficiency to be used in reforestation programs in the surroundings of Mexico City.","[Reverchon, Frederique; del Pilar Ortega-Larrocea, Maria; Manuel Pena-Ramirez, Victor; Siebe, Christina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Perez-Moreno, Jesus] Colegio Posgrad, Montecillo 56230, Mexico","Ortega-Larrocea, MD (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",mpol@geologia.unam.mx,"Reverchon, Frederique/B-1586-2012","Reverchon, Frederique/0000-0002-5864-7494; Ortega Larrocea, Maria del Pilar/0000-0002-5062-8686; Siebe, Christina/0000-0002-2636-6778","Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) of MexicoPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) [IN225703, IN230507, IN119609]; DGEP (Direccion General de Estudios de Posgrado)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","This work was supported by a grant from the Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) of Mexico (project Nos.

The cutting was found to significantly change the soil surface, resulting in the high spatial and temporal variation of the hydrothermal conditions and soil respiration. The influence of a stand's thinning on the environment and soil respiration is considered using the example of the thinning of a ripening larch stand in the Tomakomai National Forest (Hokkaido Island, Japan). The changes in the hydrothermal conditions (the temperature and moisture of the mineral soil layers and litter) and some other factors (the root and litter density and the C/N ratio) after the thinning of the stands and their influence on the soil respiration were studied. The soil respiration in the thinned forest site did not differ from that on the control plot, whereas the soil temperature was much higher in the former. The moisture of the soil mineral layers and the litter was the same. Despite the latter fact, no significant relationships between the soil respiration and its temperature and moisture were found. In the area covered with the thinned forest, the water content of the litter turned out to be the main microclimatic factor affecting the soil respiration. There, the fine roots and litter density were 18 and 15 % less, respectively. The thinning of the stand induced high variation of the soil respiration and temperature, as well as of the fine roots and the litter density. On the whole, the soil respiration in the larch forest studied in Japan was determined by the litter stock and the C to N ratio.","[Masyagina, O. V.; Prokushkin, S.

Westoby's [Plant and Soil (1998), 199, 213] Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) plant strategy scheme quantifies the strategy of a plant based on its location in a three-dimensional space defined by three functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, and seed mass. This scheme is based on aboveground traits and may neglect strategies of belowground resource capture if root functioning is not mirrored in any of the axes. How then do fine roots fit into the LHS scheme? 2. We measured 10 functional traits on 133 plant species in a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, USA. This data set was used to evaluate how well the LHS scheme accounts for the variation in above and belowground traits. 3. The three most important plant strategies were composed of multiple correlated traits, but SLA, seed mass, and height loaded on separate principle components. The first axis reflected the widely observed 'leaf economics spectrum'. Species at the high end of this spectrum had high SLA, high leaf and fine root nitrogen (N) concentration, and low leaf dry matter content. The second axis reflected variation in seed mass and fine root morphology. Plants at the positive end of this spectrum were plants with large seeds and low specific root length (SRL). The third axis reflected variation in height and phenology. Plants at the positive end of this spectrum were tall species that flower late in the growing season. 4. Leaf N concentration was positively correlated with fine root N concentration. SRL was weakly positively correlated with SLA. SRL was not correlated with fine root N concentration. Leaf litter decomposition rate was positively correlated with the leaf economics spectrum and was negatively correlated with the height and phenology spectrum. 5. Leaf traits, seed mass, and height appear to be integrating properties of species that reflect much of the variation in plant function, including root function. Fine root N concentration was positively mirrored by the leaf economics spectrum, and SRL was inversely mirrored by seed mass. The leaf and height axes play a role in controlling leaf litter decomposability, indicating that these strategy axes have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.; Moore, Margaret M.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Laughlin, Daniel C.; Leppert, Jessica J.] No Arizona Univ, Ecol Restorat Inst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Sieg, Carolyn Hull] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA","Laughlin, DC (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, POB 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Daniel.Laughlin@nau.edu,"Laughlin, Daniel/G-8855-2012",,Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [08-JV-11221633-233]; Northern Arizona University (NAU) School of Forestry; Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI); NAU Hooper Undergraduate Research Award,"We thank P.

We tested whether a variety of climate and litter quality variables could be used to develop regression models of decomposition parameters across wide ranges in litter quality and climate and whether these models changed over short to long time periods. Six genera of foliar and three genera of root litters were studied with a 10-fold range in the ratio of acid unhydrolyzable fraction (AUF, or 'lignin') to N. Litter was incubated at 27 field sites across numerous terrestrial biomes including arctic and alpine tundra, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands and warm deserts. We used three separate mathematical models of first-order (exponential) decomposition, emphasizing either the first year or the entire decade. One model included the proportion of relatively stable material as an asymptote. For short-term (first-year) decomposition, nonlinear regressions of exponential or power function form were obtained with r2 values of 0.82 and 0.64 for foliar and fine-root litter, respectively, across all biomes included. AUF and AUF : N ratio were the most explanative litter quality variables, while the combined temperature-moisture terms AET (actual evapotranspiration) and CDI (climatic decomposition index) were best for climatic effects. Regressions contained some systematic bias for grasslands and arctic and boreal sites, but not for humid tropical forests or temperate deciduous and coniferous forests. The ability of the regression approach to fit climate-driven decomposition models of the 10-year field results was dramatically reduced from the ability to capture drivers of short-term decomposition. Future work will require conceptual and methodological improvements to investigate processes controlling decadal-scale litter decomposition, including the formation of a relatively stable fraction and its subsequent decomposition.","[Currie, W.

The aim of the present paper was to quantify the response of three clones to different watering regimes and to determine which clone among the three is the best adapted to drought conditions. Methods Three hybrid poplar clones (clone DN-34, R-247 and OP-367) were used in the present experiment. The seedlings of the three clones were grown under four watering regimes: control (well watered, 100% field water capacity (FC)) and three drought treatments (drought stress I, 50% FC; drought stress II, 40% EC; drought stress III, 30% FC). Changes in morphological, physical and biochemical indicators of the three hybrid poplar clones were investigated. Important Findings Drought treatment (50%, 40% and 30% FC) decreased net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomata I conductance (gs), shoot height, total biomass and chlorophyll (Chl) content in all the three clones and it increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and free pro-line content. The highest values of the above-mentioned morphological and physiological parameters were recorded in clone OP-367 under 30% FC, followed by clone DN-34 and R-247. Relative leaf water content (RWC) and stem diameter (sd) markedly declined in clone R-247 and DN-34 under drought stress I, II and III, whereas RWC and sd declined in clone OP-367 only under drought stress II and III. Clone OP-367 had more RWC and sd than DN-34 and R-247. Only the 30% PC induced an increase in the root-to-shoot ratio (rs) and water use efficiency (WUE) in all the three clones. OP-367 was the most efficient clone in water absorption and use, for plants of the clone had the highest values of rs and WUE. Our data demonstrate that among the three clones, OP-367 was better able to maintain photosynthesis and growth and lower the damage caused by drought.","[Guo, Xiao-Yun; Zhang, Xin-Shi; Huang, Zhen-Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiao-Yun] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, XS (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",xinshiz@yahoo.com; zhenying@ibcas.ac.cn,"huang, zhenying/C-5969-2015",,State Forestry Administration of China [20030407],FUNDING State Forestry Administration of China (20030407).,,55,34,34,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,,,J PLANT ECOL-UK,J.

We combined high-frequency in situ observations of fine roots and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi with data from multiple soil sensor arrays to examine the biophysical interactions influencing soil CO2 production for one year in a mixed conifer forest. Using structural equation modeling we constructed a hypothesized model to test for causal interactions among environmental factors, biotic factors, and soil CO2 dynamics throughout the soil profile. According to our model, seasonal variation in CO2 production was significantly influenced by EM rhizomorph production, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Fine root production, on the other hand, did not appear to significantly influence soil CO2 production. The relationship between EM rhizomorph production and soil CO2 production was also supported by a zero temporal lag between these two measurements in a cross-correlation analysis. In contrast, CO2 production increased before fine root production suggesting that these two measurements were decoupled in time. Results from this study highlight the need to better understand differences in carbon allocation between plant roots and EM fungi to improve our predictions of soil carbon dynamics under global climate change.","[Hasselquist, Niles J.; Allen, Michael F.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Univ Lab, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Vargas, Rodrigo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Hasselquist, NJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Univ Lab, Bldg Room 208, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",nhass001@ucr.edu,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008","Vargas, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6829-5333",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0410408]; Center for Embedded Networked Sensing [CCR-0120778]; Kearney Foundation;  [DEB-0639235],"We thankHector Estrada, Laurel Salzman, Ayesha Sirajuddin, and William Swenson for their help acquiring minirhizotron images.

We aimed to identify mechanisms for P acquisition from soil. Plants were grown in sterilised washed river sand; eight levels of P as KH(2)PO(4) ranging from 0 to 384 mu g P g(-1) soil were applied. Plant growth under low-P conditions strongly correlated with physiological P-use efficiency and/or P-uptake efficiency. Taking all species together, at 6 mu g P g(-1) soil there was a good correlation between P uptake and both root surface area and total root length. All species had higher amounts of carboxylates in the rhizosphere under a low level of P application. Six of the 11 species increased the fraction of rhizosphere citrate in response to low P, which was accompanied by a reduction in malonate, except L. corniculatus. In addition, species showed different plasticity in response to P-application levels and different strategies in response to P deficiency. Our results show that many of the 11 species have prospects for low-input agroecosystems based on their high P-uptake and P-use efficiency.","[Pang, Jiayin; Ryan, Megan H.; Cawthray, Gregory R.; Bolland, Mike D.

However, it is not well understood how specific low molecular weight C compounds, which are frequently found in root exudates and litter leachates, influence bacterial community structure or if there are specific groups of soil bacteria that preferentially respond to these C inputs. To address these knowledge gaps, we added three simple C substrates representative of common root exudate compounds (glucose, glycine, and citric acid) to microcosms containing three distinct soils from a grassland, hardwood forest, and coniferous forest. CO(2) production was assessed over a 24 h incubation period and, at the end of the incubation, DNA was extracted from the samples for assessment of bacterial community structure via bar-coded pyrosequencing of the 165 rRNA gene. All three C substrates significantly increased CO(2) production in all soils; however, there was no relationship between the magnitude of the increase in CO(2) production and the shift in bacterial community composition. All three substrates had significant effects on overall community structure with the changes primarily driven by relative increases in beta-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citric acid additions had a particularly strong influence on bacterial communities, producing a 2-5-fold increase in the relative abundance of the beta-Proteobacteria subphylum. These results suggest that although community-level responses to substrate additions vary depending on the substrate and soil in question, there are specific bacterial taxa that preferentially respond to the substrate additions across soil types.

To reveal the effects of water table fluctuation on fine-root growth and mortality and their relation to leaf growth, we exposed P. alba L. cuttings to various fluctuating water table depths. 1-year-old rooted cuttings were grown individually in pots containing sandy soil in a greenhouse in three water table depth treatments for 45 days: constant depth at 45 cm from the soil surface, fluctuating depths between 45 and 30 cm, and fluctuating depths between 45 and 15 cm. Fine-root biomass and mortality, biomass partitioning among plant parts, and whole-tree growth responses were determined in cuttings harvested every 15 days. Fluctuation of water tables increased the mortality of fine roots at the layers near the soil surface. Fine-root mortality increased during the shallower water table depth period. At the whole-root system level, although fine-root mortality increased when the water table was shallower, fine-root biomass was similar among the treatments, suggesting that P. alba cuttings would sustains its standing fine-root biomass under fluctuating water table depth conditions. Our structural equation modeling showed the fine-root proportion affects leaf morphological changes, suggesting that there would be a parallel relationship of morphological changes between roots and leaves with fluctuating water tables.","[Imada, Shogo; Yamanaka, Norikazu; Tamai, Shigenobu] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan","Imada, S (reprint author), Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan.",s-imada@alrc.tottori-u.ac.jp,,,,,,25,7,7,3,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

The aim of this work was to study the physiological and molecular characteristics of fast-growing rhizobia strain under different osmolarity, pH and aeration conditions. In addition, the symbiotic performance of strain under greenhouse conditions has been taken into consideration. Initial values of pH 6, aeration of 367 O(2)center dot l(-1)center dot h(-1), and osmolarity of 100 mM NaCl were chosen as combined stress conditions for the cultivation of the strain. High concentration of cell suspensions was obtained after their adaptation to different stress conditions, reaching values of 10(9)cfu/ml approximately. It was established that under such conditions - cell LPSs profiles were not modified. However, the concentration of biosynthesized EPS increased under adverse conditions of growth (pH 6 and osmolarity of 50-100 mM) contrarily to what happened with the controls (pH 7 and 2 mM NaCl). Moreover, the symbiotic potential of fast-growing soybean rhizobia, obtained in adverse conditions for bacterial growth, has been evaluated. None of the rhizobia produced nodules with the American soybean cultivar under greenhouse, because these cellular suspensions did not meet the conditions required for them to be used as inoculants. On the other hand, soybean plants inoculated with the reference fast-growing strains SMH12 demonstrated good nodulation (170 nodules /pot). Even though statistic analysis did not show significant differences in data obtained from ""% dry weight"" and ""% nitrogen"", plants showed, nevertheless, a great development and high nitrogen content in all the tests in which they had been inoculated, as compared with the non-inoculated control This was produced independently of the condition in which the bacterial strain was obtained We can conclude that the tests performed with S. fredii USDA205 show a PGPR (growth promoting) effect on soybean plants instead of a nitrogen fixation symbiotic relationship, evidenced by the absence of nodulation in all of the tests.","[Pagliero, F.; Castano, R.

The studies reviewed microbial symbionts associated to exotic tree species belonging to Myrtaceae, Pinaceae, Casuarinaceae and Leguminosae. In their native areas, these trees are associated either with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi (e. g. Pinaceae) or both ECM and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (e. g. Eucalyptus), or sometimes as in Casuarina and Acacia with three coexisting symbionts nitrogen fixing bacteria, ECM and AM fungi). In their new habitats, using highly efficient mycorrhizal fungi, controlled mycorrhization experiments have pointed out the importance of root symbionts in establishment and growth of exotic tree species such exotic pines or Australian acacias. Since the challenge in sylviculture and reforestation was to determine the best compromise between symbiotic compatibility and efficiency of both partners under local soil constraints, further researches have to be encouraged to elucidate the complexity of these tree symbioses in terms of diversity, interaction and effectiveness of their symbiotic partners for their better exploitation in reforestation programmes.","[Ba, Amadou M.; Prin, Yves; Galiana, Antoine; Duponnois, Robin] IRD, LSTM, UMR CIRAD 113, INRA,UM2, Montpellier, France; [Diedhiou, Abdala G.; Duponnois, Robin] IRD, ISRA, UCAD, Lab Commun Microbiol,Ctr Rech Bel Air, Dakar, Senegal; [Ba, Amadou M.] Univ Antilles Guyane, Fac Sci Exactes & Nat, Lab Biol & Physiol Vegetales, F-97159 Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe","Duponnois, R (reprint author), IRD, LSTM, UMR CIRAD 113, INRA,UM2, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA A-82-J, Montpellier, France.",Robin.Duponnois@ird.fr,"Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016",,,,,108,11,12,1,44,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Two cultivation lineages of G. geosporum (BEG199 and BEG211) were created by sub-culturing with or without the stress of the sediment. Genetic variation was assessed on spores from both cultivation lineages in the large sub-unit rRNA gene D2 region using PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. Phenotypical and functional variation of the cultivation lineages were assessed after inoculation onto Conyza bilbaoana. The sequence diversity obtained in G. geosporum BEG:211 was significantly different from that obtained in G. geosporum BEG199. Glomus geosporum BEG199 was more effective than G. geosporum BEG211 in promoting the growth of C. bilbaoana in inert substrate and in increasing its leaf phosphorus concentration when the plant was grown in sediment. After inoculation onto C. bilbaoana, G. geosporum BEG199 colonised the roots to a greater extent, produced a significantly larger number of spores and presented a greater length of extraradical mycelium than G. geosporum BEG211. The results indicate that environmental conditions under which arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are cultivated can influence their effects in host plants. Also, AMF might quickly lose gained-tolerance to environmental stresses when maintained without the selective pressure of those stresses. This study has implications for the production of commercial inoculum of AMF and for the maintenance of AMF cultures. The results indicate that inoculum of AMF should be produced and AMF cultures should be maintained in substrates or media containing the original edaphic stresses. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The plots 100 m(2), comprised a tea garden with a few planted canopy tree species (37.2% canopy cover), a cultivated sustainable tea forest (80.2% canopy cover), an abandoned sustainable tea forest (89.8% canopy cover), and an abandoned sustainable tea forest that had suffered fire damage (72.9% canopy cover). All visible mushrooms were collected during weekly forays. Macro-characters of the fungi were annotated and photographed by digital camera and the fungi were identified to genera and morphospecies (e.g. Agaricus sp.1, Agaricus sp.2). The fresh weight of wild edible mushrooms produced in the plots was also recorded during this period. The biodiversity of macrofungi in abandoned sustainable tea forest was highest with 115 species in 47 genera, followed by cultivated sustainable tea forest with 85 species in 42 genera and fire damaged abandoned sustainable tea forest with 48 species in 25 genera, while only 19 species belonging to 15 genera were found in the tea garden. Twenty-one species belonging to nine genera with a total of 60.9 kg of edible fungi were collected throughout this study. The fresh weight of edible mushrooms was recorded with the highest fresh weight (25.3 kg) collected from the abandoned sustainable tea forest, followed by 18.2 kg in the cultivated sustainable tea forest, while in the fire damaged sustainable tea forest 16.4 kg were collected and only 1 kg was collected in the tea garden. Abandoned sustainable tea forest contained a greater shade tree biodiversity and higher canopy cover than other plots. This area has a generally higher humidity, a greater ground litter cover, a greater number of microhabitats, a greater number of trees that can form mycorrhizal associations and this probably accounts for the higher diversity of macrofungi and production of edible mushrooms. The fire damaged sustainable tea forest had lower mushroom diversity and edible mushroom production possibly due to the loss of litter and lower tree diversity. The tea garden supported a poor diversity of mushrooms and almost no edible mushrooms. Shade tea forest (Miang tea forest) is a good method to produce tea in a sustainable way as it maintains diversity of mushrooms and other organisms and could be developed as an alternative to shade coffee.","[Sysouphanthong, Phongeun; Hyde, Kevin D.] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Sch Sci, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Sysouphanthong, Phongeun; Thongkantha, Sutheera; Hyde, Kevin D.] Mushroom Res Ctr, Chaing Mai 50150, Thailand; [Zhao, Ruilin] SW Forest Univ, Key Lab Forest Disaster Warning & Control Yunnan, Fac Biol Conservat, Kunming 650224, Yunan Province, Peoples R China; [Soytong, Kasem] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Agr Technol, Dept Plant Pest Management, Bangkok 10520, Thailand; [Hyde, Kevin D.] Chinese Acad Forest, Int Fungal Res & Dev Ctr, Res Inst Insect Resources, Kunming 650224, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China","Sysouphanthong, P (reprint author), Mae Fah Luang Univ, Sch Sci, 333 Moo 1, Chiang Rai, Thailand.",phongeunsysou@gmail.com,,,,,,35,22,25,0,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Grassland communities were constructed to be either functionally diverse or functionally simple based on belowground resource use patterns of constituent species. Communities were also constructed with different numbers of species (two or five) to examine interactions between species richness, functional diversity and invasion resistance. We hypothesized that communities with more complementary belowground resource use (i.e., more species rich and more functionally diverse communities) would be less easily invaded than communities with greater degrees of belowground resource use overlap. Two contrasting invasive species were introduced: an early-season, shallow rooting annual grass, Bromus hordeaceus (soft chess), and a late-season, deep rooting annual forb, Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle). Invader responses to species richness and functional diversity treatments differed between sites. In general, the more similar the patterns of belowground resource use between residents of the plant community and the invader, the poorer the invader's performance. Complementarity or overlap of resource use among species in the constructed communities appeared to affect invader success less than complementarity or overlap of resource use between the invader and the species present in the community.","[Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Rice, Kevin J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rice, Kevin J.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Brown, CS (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Cynthia.S.Brown@ColoState.edu,"Brown, Cynthia/K-5814-2012",,California Department of Transportation [F94TL10C],"This work was funded by the California Department of Transportation Contract number F94TL10C.

Comparisons of shrubs and their site adaptability are essential for correct selection of candidates in developing restoration theory and practice. A survey of topography, soil properties and shrub composition was conducted in fifty-seven 5-m x 5-m plots in an arid valley of the upper Minjiang River, Southwest China. With cluster analysis and critical examinations based on edaphic properties, soil was classified into three groups: dry cinnamon soils (DCS), calcareous cinnamon soils (CCS) and eluvial-accumulation cinnamon soils (EACS). EACS had the highest fertility level, DCS the next and CCS the lowest level. For non-N fixers, soil moisture is the primary limiting factor, and nitrogen the next. However, N-fixers are weakly constrained by soil moisture and nitrogen, the extent of which is species-specific. N-fixers had a significantly higher cumulative relative importance value (44.4%) in CCS than in DCS (34.0%) and EACS (17.3%). The results suggest that it would be reasonable to restore non-N fixers in DCS and EACS and that N-fixers are appropriate for CCS. Compared with grass, shrubs significantly enhanced the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus and soil electric conductivity, and significantly decreased the soil C/N ratio. The median fertility level of soil dominated by N-fixers indicates that N-fixers are suitable driver candidates from grassland to non-N-fixing shrub land. Four native shrubby legumes (Indigofera amblyantha, Sorphora viciifolia, Desmodium podocarpum and Bauhinia faberivar) and one soil-conserving shrub (Ajania potaninii) are the top-priority pioneers for ecological restoration.","[Song, Cheng Jun; Ma, Ke Ming; Fu, Bo Jie; Qu, Lai Ye; Xu, Xian Li; Liu, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Jian Fei] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Ma, KM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",mkm@rcees.ac.cn,"Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009; Xu, X./B-8382-2009","Xu, X./0000-0002-6315-6083","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [40571005, 40621061]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Action Plan for Western DevelopmentChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-XB2-02-31]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 40571005), the Chinese Academy of Sciences Action Plan for Western Development (no.

This is especially true when a species or guild influences community-wide interactions via changes in the abiotic landscape. Using stable isotope analyses, we show that subterranean termites in an East African savanna strongly influence a key ecosystem process: atmospheric nitrogen fixation by a monodominant tree species and its bacterial symbionts. Specifically, we applied the N-15 natural abundance method in combination with other biogeochemical analyses to assess levels of nitrogen fixation by Acacia drepanolobium and its effects on co-occurring grasses and forbs in areas near and far from mounds and where ungulates were or were not excluded. We find that termites exert far stronger effects than do herbivores on nitrogen fixation. The percentage of nitrogen derived from fixation in Acacia drepanolobium trees is higher (55-80%) away from mounds vs. near mounds (40-50%). Mound soils have higher levels of plant available nitrogen, and Acacia drepanolobium may preferentially utilize soil-based nitrogen sources in lieu of fixed nitrogen when these sources are readily available near termite mounds. At the scale of the landscape, our models predict that termite/soil derived nitrogen sources influence >50% of the Acacia drepanolobium trees in our system. Further, the spatial extent of these effects combine with the spacing of termite mounds to create highly regular patterning in nitrogen fixation rates, resulting in marked habitat heterogeneity in an otherwise uniform landscape. In summary, we show that termite-associated effects on nitrogen processes are not only stronger than those of more apparent large herbivores in the same system, but also occur in a highly regular spatial pattern, potentially adding to their importance as drivers of community and ecosystem structure.","[Fox-Dobbs, Kena] Univ Puget Sound, Dept Geol, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA; [Fox-Dobbs, Kena; Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Brody, Alison K.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Fox-Dobbs, K (reprint author), Univ Puget Sound, Dept Geol, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA.",kena@pugetsound.edu,,"Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0519004],"We thank Simon Akwam, Gilbert Busienei, John Lemboi, Robert Pringle, Kathleen Rudolph, and Sarah Wittman for help with fieldwork.

Establishment of mycorrhized Tocoyena selloana seedlings in the mined coastal sand dunes of Northeast Brazil was tested. In greenhouse, seedlings were grown in substrates with 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20% cattle manure proportions and inoculated with Acaulospora longula, a mixture of native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or uninoculated. The seedlings responded positively to the inoculation, but growth was limited in the absence of manure, independently of inoculation, and was higher with fertilizing doses >= 10%. The seedlings transplanted to the field were grown in a substrate with 16.5% manure and inoculated with A. longula or Gigaspora albida. After 13 months, 19 AMF species were identified in the rhizosphere and the inoculated plants were more colonized than those uninoculated. Plants associated to G. albida were taller and those associated to A. longula had a tendency of higher biomass than the uninoculated ones. Even though this tendency was not statistically significant, considering the effect on height and the low cost of inoculation it may be a feasible practice to maximize environment restoration.

Eight weeks after sowing combined inoculations of fodder galega with R. galegae by. orientalis HAMBI 540 and Pseudomonas trivialis 3Re27 or Pseudomonas extremorientalis TSAU20 had increased shoot and root dry matter, as compared with inoculation with R. galegae HAMBI 540 alone. Both Pseudomonas strains produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in culture but R. galegae did not. While the cellulase producing strain P. trivialis 3Re27 was able to significantly increase nodule numbers and nitrogen content of the co-inoculated plants, the cellulase-negative P. extremorientalis TSAU20 showed no significant stimulation of nodule numbers and nitrogen content in roots. We conclude that P trivialis 3Re27 improve rhizobia legume interactions, acting as ""rhizobium helper bacteria"".

Using legumes and rhizobia from three natural populations, I studied the symbiotic fitness benefits for both partners in 108 plant maternal family by rhizobium strain combinations. Genotype-by-genotype (G x G) interactions among local genotypes and among partner populations determined, in part, the benefits of mutualism for both partners, for example, the fitness effects of particular rhizobium strains ranged from uncooperative to mutualistic depending on the plant family Correlations between plant and rhizobium fitness benefits suggest a trade off, and therefore a potential conflict, between the interests of the two partners. These results suggest that legume rhizobium mutualisms are dynamic at multiple spatial scales, and that strictly additive models of mutualism benefits may ignore dynamics potentially important to both the maintenance of genetic variation and the generation of geographic patterns in coevolutionary interactions.","[Heath, Katy D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Heath, KD (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,"NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0508305]; Center for Community Genetics; Bell Museum of Natural History (both at the University of Minnesota), and Sigma Xi","I thank my graduate advisor, P Tiffin, for guidance throughout the project as well as many insightful comments on the manuscript Thanks to D Moeller, J Lau, and M Brock for thoughtful discussions and comments, as well as two anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript I thank J Fry for providing code.

It is shown that the neglect of observed (actual) soil depths can limit land surface model performance at the sites studied. The main impact of accounting for shallower soil depths is to increase the dispersion, (i.e. the dynamic range) of sensible and latent heat fluxes when compared with simulations using a common fixed soil column depth of 2 meters. It is also shown that accounting for local soil depth variability can, moderately, improve land surface model flux estimation as compared with tower measurements. This result is directly consistent with recent studies relating the sensitivity of the timescale of soil moisture variability to plant rooting depth since this impacts the total amount of water available for evapotranspiration. Basic sensitivity analysis on additional model parameters impacted by specification of soil depth (e.g. 'deep soil temperature' and the lower boundary condition for moisture flow) is also performed.

Lower concentrations of rabdosin B (20-80 mu M) significantly promoted root growth, but its higher levels at 120-200 mu M, by contrast, had inhibitory effects. Additionally, all tested concentrations (10-40 mu M) inhibited root hair development of seedlings in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigations on the underlying mechanism revealed that the promotion effect of rabdosin B at the lower concentrations resulted from increasing the cell length in the mature region and enhancing the mitotic activity of meristematic cells in seedlings' root tips. In contrast, rabdosin B at higher concentrations inhibited root growth by affecting both cell length in the mature region and division of meristematic cells. Comet assay and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the decrease of mitotic activity of root meristematic cells was due to DNA damage induced cell cycle retardation of the G(2) phase and S phase at different times.","[Ding, Lan; Jing, Hongwei; Qi, Linlin; Li, Jing; Wang, Tao; Liu, Guoan] NW Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Qin, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, Key Lab Nat Med Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Ding, L (reprint author), NW Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 967 Anning E Rd, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",nwnudinglan@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30960464]; Chinese Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, China [208147]; Foundation of the Innovation Project Council of Northwest Normal University [NWNU-KJCXGC-03]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No-30960464), the Key (Key grant) Project of Chinese Ministry of Education (No-208147) and the Foundation of the Innovation Project Council of Northwest Normal University (NWNU-KJCXGC-03).

However, limited information is available on individual root masses, especially large trees. We excavated 121 root systems of various species (78) and sizes (up to 116 cm in dbh). and estimated both above- and below-ground biomass in a lowland primary dipterocarp forest in the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. A tree census was conducted in four research plots (each 0.2 ha) and stand-level biomass was estimated. We examined relationships between tree size parameters and masses of coarse roots (roots >= 5 mm in diameter) and derived a dbh-based allometric equation. The amounts of coarse roots that were lost during excavation were corrected. Coarse-root biomass before and after correction for lost roots was estimated to be 63.8 and 82.7 Mg ha(-1), indicating that significant amounts of roots (23%) were lost during the sampling. We also estimated the biomass of small root (<5 mm) by applying pipe-model theory. The estimate, 13.3 Mg ha(-1), was similar to another estimate of small roots, 16.4 Mg ha(-1), which was obtained directly by the soil-pit sampling method.

In this study, the respective region was analyzed in five species of Glomus (G. mosseae, G. geosporum, G. caledonium, G. clarum, G. coronatum) from the same major clade (Glomus group A), Glomus sp. ISCB 34 from the related Glomus group B and two species of Scutellospora. Results show low level of genetic polymorphism between related morphospecies. Introns homologous to those found in G. intraradices were detected as well as new ones, some of them containing putative ORFs for homing endonucleases (HEs). Introns without ORFs for HEs seem to have been inherited strictly vertically from the ancestors of Glomus groups A and B while other introns indicate occasional horizontal transfer and possibly maintenance, degeneration and loss together with their associated HE ORFs. Overall, we provide first insights into the evolutionary dynamics of introns and HEs in this ecologically important group of fungi, which was previously not analyzed in this respect.

Here, we used meta-analysis combined with pairwise techniques to examine root mass fraction (RMF; i.e., the fraction of root to total biomass) as affected by elevated CO2 and environmental stresses. Our results showed that lower soil fertility increased RMF and the magnitude was similar for ambient and elevated CO2-grown plants. Lower soil water also increased RMF, but to a greater extent at elevated than at ambient CO2. While CO2 enrichment had little effect on the magnitude of O-3-caused reduction in RMF in herbaceous species, it alleviated the adverse effect of higher O-3 on root production in woody species. These results demonstrate that CO2 has less pronounced effects on RMF than other environmental factors. Under abiotic stresses, e.g., drought and higher O-3, elevated CO2-grown plants will likely increase biomass allocation below-ground. Because of the non-uniform changes in drought and O-3 projected for different parts of the world, we conclude that elevated CO2 will have regional, but not global, effects on biomass allocation under various global change scenarios.","[Wang, Xianzhong] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Taub, Daniel R.] Southwestern Univ, Dept Biol, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA","Wang, XZ (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, 723 W Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",xzwang@iupui.edu,"Taub, Daniel R/A-2767-2008",,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Office of Professional Development,"Financial support for this project was provided in part by Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Office of Professional Development.

Here we experimentally examine growth in Cabralea canjerana and Lafoensia pacari at different densities and with and without AMF. In the density treatment pots had either six or 12 individuals. Half of each treatment was innoculated with AMF and the other half was not. The proportion of each species in each pot was also varied. The AMF did not apparently influence interspecific competitive interactions because growth was similar in both treatments. However, intra-specific competition was very strong in C. canjerana while more moderate in L. pacari and both were influenced by the presence of the AMF. The AMF-Cabralea canjerana interaction was parasitic, while AMF-L. pacari interactions were mutualistic. Thus, dependence upon AMF and intraspecific interactions that result as a consequence of that dependence varies among species and may be an important influence in community structure.","[Danieli-Silva, Aline] Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Uhlmann, Alexandre] EMBRAPA Amapa, Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agropecuaria, BR-68903419 Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Vicente-Silva, Jose] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Sturmer, Sidney Luiz] Univ Reg Blumenau, Dept Ciencias Nat, BR-89010971 Blumenau, SC, Brazil","Danieli-Silva, A (reprint author), Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, Caixa Postal 19031, BR-81531980 Curitiba, PR, Brazil.",aline.ecologia@gmail.com,"Sturmer, Sidney/O-2616-2019; Sturmer, Sidney L/B-6593-2014; Uhlmann, Alexandre/N-4319-2015",,Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB); Tutorial Education Program (PET/Biologia),"We thank the Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB) for its support, as well as its Botany, Biotechnology, Immunology and Zoology laboratories and the Chemistry Department, for their support and use of their facilities.

AMF colonization was highest during vegetative growth, with values declining during the growing season to the same level seen at plant dormancy. AMF colonization was reduced at lower depths in the sediments where anoxic conditions were observed and in plants treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl. Only small changes in diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in general and more specifically of those belonging to the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria were detected during the season or between treatments by PCR-RFLP of nifH gene fragments with DNA as template for amplification; however, greater seasonal changes were displayed when cDNA was used as template for amplification as a proxy for gene expression and thus active bacteria. DGGE analyses of nifH gene fragments representing nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria using both using DNA and cDNA as template showed highly diverse profiles that changed during the season and in response to treatment. Seasonal changes were observed for a suite of plant growth attributes and differences were observed between treatments, with higher values generally obtained on non-treated plants compared to Benomyl-treated plants. These differences were most pronounced during vegetative growth; however, differences between non-treated and Benomyl-treated plants were reduced seasonally and disappeared by the onset of senescence. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in AMF colonization on S. patens and in the community structure of nitrogen-fixing members of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria in the plant root zone. Plant growth performance changed seasonally with some effects of Benomyl-treatment.","[Welsh, Allana K.; Hahn, Dittmar] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Burke, David J.] Holden Arboretum, Kirtland, OH 44094 USA; [Hamerlynck, Erik P.] USDA ARS, SW Watershed Res Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA","Hahn, D (reprint author), Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",dh49@txstate.edu,,,"New Jersey Institute of Technology [421230]; Hudson River Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GK-12, 0742306]","These studies were supported, in part, by the New Jersey Institute of Technology under Grant No 421230, a Tibor T.

However, polyP dynamics in the presymbiotic stage are less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate polyP accumulation in Gigaspora margarita as influenced by nitrogen (N) and/or P supply during germination. Spores of G. margarita were incubated on medium with or without P or N addition. PolyP content in the fungal tissue was monitored using a polyP kinase/luciferase system, and polyP synthetic activity was determined with P-32 labeling. The results showed that both N and P were necessary for polyP accumulation in germ tubes. Nitrate increased the polyP content in germ tubes, but ammonium did not. Along with germination, polyP content decreased in spores, but increased in germ tubes. P-32 labeling indicated that polyP synthetic activity increased in germ tubes along with germination, but was negligible in spores. Our results suggest that, in the presymbiotic stage of G. margarita, uptake of environmental N and P increases polyP content in germ tubes, and that polyP synthesis occurs mainly therein, leading to polyP accumulation. The possible mechanism of transfer of polyP from spores to hyphae remains to be elucidated.","[Yao, Qing; Ohtomo, Ryo] Natl Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Nasushiobara, Tochigi 3292793, Japan; [Saito, Masanori] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Yao, Qing] S China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Ohtomo, R (reprint author), Agr Forestry & Fisheries Res Council, Chiyoda Ku, 1-2-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1998950, Japan.",rotm@affrc.go.jp,"Saito, Masanori/J-4409-2019; YAO, Qing/B-3206-2009","YAO, Qing/0000-0003-3449-6166; Saito, Masanori/0000-0003-4692-9379","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [P03518]; Natural Science Fund of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [30570060]","We thank Drs.

Screening genotypes for improved root architecture without breaking the taproots or losing lateral roots is a challenge. Due to difficulty in separating roots from field or potting soil, a rapid and effective screening method with a suitable growth medium to assess root characteristics under controlled conditions needs to be established. We describe two screening techniques ""the cone system"" and ""the tube system"" using turface:sand medium. In the cone system thirty four soybean lines including cultivars and exotic plant introduction (PI) lines were evaluated for tap root length and root biomass, 12 days after sowing. Eight replications per line were grown in a growth chamber. Significant differences among genotypes for tap root length were detected by the cone system. Validity of results from the cone system was tested by evaluating root growth 21 days after planting for eight lines in the tube system. A coefficient of determination of 0.72 indicated good agreement between the two screening systems for evaluating genotypes for rooting depth.

Ectomycorrhizas formed by the monokaryotic strains presented a sheath of hyphae around the roots and a Hartig net limited to the epidermis layer, typical of the angiosperm ectomycorrhizas. Colonization rates, a measure oldie number of ectomycorrhizas in elation to the total number of lateral root tips, varied from 23 to 62%. Some monokaryotic strains stimulated the formation of lateral roots, promoting increases of up to 109% above the control. The presence of some of the isolates in the in vitro synthesis medium stimulated the production of thicker lateral root tips. The dimensions of the lateral roots tips and ectomycorrhizas varied from one isolate to the next, indicating a variation in their capacity to provoke morphological changes in the host plant roots. The dikaryotic strain M5M11 presented higher values for lateral root yield, number of ectomycorrhizas, and colonization percentage than the corresponding monokaryotic strains, M5 and M11. This indicated the possibility of selecting compatible performing monokaryotic isolates for the yield of superior dikaryotic strains. The set of monokaryotic strains tested varied greatly in their ability to colonize E. grandis roots and cause secondary metabolism-related morphological changes in roots, providing a wealth of model systems for the study of genetic, physiological, and morphogenetic processes involved in Pisolithus-Eucalyptus ectomycorrhiza formation.","[Costa, Mauricio Dutra; Santos, Matheus Loureiro; Borges, Arnaldo Chaer] Univ Fed Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Costa, MD (reprint author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",mdcosta@ufv.br; rochacampos@yahoo.com.br; matheus.diagonal@gmail.com; chaer@ufv.br,,"Costa, Mauricio/0000-0002-0828-4437",,,,33,6,7,0,13,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

The island, Sacca San Biagio, was covered with a thick layer of municipal solid waste residues produced by an incinerator operating from 1973, to 1984. Such residues contained high levels of heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn). We characterized the AMF communities present in soils on Sacca San Biagio island by using molecular methods. Nine AM fungal sequence types were detected in the roots of three plant species, representative of the dominant flora, by using partial SSU ribosomal RNA genes. The most abundant sequence types corresponded to Glomus intraradices/Glomus fasciculatum, and to Glo18, a sequence detected so far only in plan to. Two sequences were new to science. Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), extracted from rhizosphere soil of dominant plant species, ranged from 1.6 to 2.3 mg g(-1). The occurrence of an active AM fungal community able to live in such harsh environment was evinced by the correlation between mycorrhizal colonization and GRSP content. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was established from 1988 to 1992 with bareroot seedlings artificially inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius (Pt) or naturally inoculated with mycorrhizae in the nursery. A containerized longleaf pine treatment with and without Pt inoculation was added to two sites in 1992. Effects of the Pt nursery treatment were mixed, with a decrease in survival of bareroot longleaf pine on two sites and an increase in survival on another site. The containerized longleaf pine treatment substantially increased survival, which led to greater volume compared with bareroot longleaf pine. Loblolly pine yielded more volume than longleaf pine on all sites but one, where survival was negatively affected by fire. Depth of sandy surface horizon affected mean annual height growth of both labially and longleaf pine. Height growth per year decreased with an increase in sand depth for both species. Multiple regression analysis of volume growth (ft(3)/ac per year) for both species indicated a strong relationship to depth of sandy soil and survival. After 15-19 years, loblolly pine has been more productive than longleaf pine, although longleaf pine productivity may be equal to or greater than that of labially pine on the soils with the deepest sandy surface layers over longer rotations.","[Cram, Michelle M.; Outcalt, Kenneth W.] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Zarnoch, Stanley J.] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Asheville, NC 28802 USA","Cram, MM (reprint author), US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Reg 8 Forest Heath Protect,320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",mcram@fs.fed.us,,,,,,15,3,3,0,12,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0148-4419,,,SOUTH J APPL FOR,South.

However, very little is known about the extent to which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) identity may influence RS or the underlying chemistry that may determine those rates. In order to test these relationships, we examined RS, measured as O-2 consumption, of first-order ECM root tips of Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L. saplings in relation to their ECM fungal symbionts and associated nitrogen (N), C and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations. Roots of P. sylvestris were colonized by Rhizopogon roseolus, Tuber sp. 1 and an unknown species of Pezizales. Fungal species colonizing Q. robur roots were Hebeloma sp., Tuber sp. 2 and one unidentified ECM fungus described as Tuber-like based on ECM morphology. ECM RS rates for different host species were significantly different and more than 97% of the variation in RS within a host species was explained by ECM root tip N concentrations. This may indicate that some of the variability in fine root RS-N relationships observed between and within different host species or their functional groups may be related to intraspecific host species differences in root tip N concentration among ECM fungal associates.","[Trocha, Lidia K.; Mucha, Joanna; Oleksyn, Jacek] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Reich, Peter B.; Oleksyn, Jacek] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Trocha, LK (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",lidiatrocha@gazeta.pl,"Oleksyn, Jacek/I-4539-2012","Mucha, Joanna/0000-0002-1290-9639; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",State Committee for Scientific Research (Poland)Polish State Committee for Scientific Research [PBZ-KBN-087/P04/2003]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0128958],This research has been partially supported by the grant PBZ-KBN-087/P04/2003 from the State Committee for Scientific Research (Poland) and National Science Foundation grant DEB-0128958.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that Atractiellomycetes, members of the 'rust' lineage (Pucciniomycotina), are mycobionts of orchids. The mycobionts of 103 terrestrial and epiphytic orchid individuals, sampled in the tropical mountain rainforest of Southern Ecuador, were identified by sequencing the whole ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and part of 28S rDNA. Mycorrhizae of 13 orchid individuals were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Simple septal pores and symplechosomes in the hyphal coils of mycorrhizae from four orchid individuals indicated members of Atractiellomycetes. Molecular phylogeny of sequences from mycobionts of 32 orchid individuals out of 103 samples confirmed Atractiellomycetes and the placement in Pucciniomycotina, previously known to comprise only parasitic and saprophytic fungi. Thus, our finding reveals these fungi, frequently associated to neotropical orchids, as the most basal living basidiomycetes involved in mycorrhizal associations of land plants.","[Kottke, Ingrid; Bauer, Robert; Haug, Ingeborg; Garnica, Sigisfredo] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Pablo Suarez, Juan; Herrera, Paulo; Cruz, Dario] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Ctr Biol Celular & Mol, Loja 1101608, Ecuador","Kottke, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",ingrid.kottke@uni-tuebingen.de,"Suarez, Juan Pablo/D-1839-2009; Sigisfredo, Garnica/P-6506-2014","Suarez, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-9453-5545; ",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [RU816],This work is dedicated to Prof. Dr. Franz Oberwinkler in honour of his 70th birthday.

The mechanisms that protect these organisms from extinction due to accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of sexual recombination are unclear. Glomeromycota reproduce by spores containing hundreds of nuclei, which represents a departure from the typical eukaryotic developmental pattern, where a multicellular organism is re-created from a uninucleate propagule. To understand whether the multinucleate spore makeup may have contributed to the evolutionary success of Glomeromycota, we examined the dynamics of spore nuclei in Glomus etunicatum using live three-dimensional imaging and mathematical models. We show that the spores are populated by an influx of a stream of nuclei from the surrounding mycelium rather than by divisions of a single founder nucleus. We present evidence that mechanisms of selection are likely to operate at the level of individual nuclei. On the basis of mathematical analyses of the effects that these nuclear dynamics have on the population mutation load, we postulate that the developmental patterns of sporogenesis have adaptive significance for moderating the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may have contributed to the evolutionary longevity of Glomeromycota.","[Jany, Jean-Luc; Pawlowska, Teresa E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Pawlowska, TE (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tep8@cornell.edu,,"Jany, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-9132-2555",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0538363],"We thank W.

They are of considerable environmental and economic value at the local, regional and global scale, providing many goods and services to a growing population. The forests of this region are among the fastest disappearing in the world and restoration is urgently required. This paper provides a review of the ecological constraints to restoration of lowland dipterocarp forest in Southeast Asia. It focuses on the production of planting stock, the significance of site-species matching and post-planting site maintenance. It identifies gaps in our knowledge and highlights priority areas of research. Adopting a long-term view is essential for restoring as well as conserving the dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia. An immediate strategy for the conservation and management of dwindling genetic resources of these important timber species is essential. This will provide the foundations for sourcing seed and production of planting material for longer term restoration. The importance of species-site matching, mycorrhizal fungi and post-planting maintenance for restoration are apparent. Financing is a major limiting factor to dipterocarp forest restoration. Trading in carbon, private finance and environmental markets afford considerable opportunities for restoring these forests providing their total value is recognised. Despite the wealth of ecological knowledge we already have for scientifically-informed forest restoration, without the backing of governments and corporate stakeholders, forest restoration will not gain the urgently required momentum.","ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kettle, CJ (reprint author), ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CHN G73-2,Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",chris.kettle@env.ethz.ch,"Kettle, Chris/A-6160-2011",,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Ecosystem Management ETH Zurich; Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) UKNERC Natural Environment Research Council,"C.J.K. is supported by Swiss National Science Foundation and the Professorship of Ecosystem Management ETH Zurich.

We evaluated a molecular-sequence-based approach to quantify the relative abundance of roots from different plant species in mixed samples. We extracted DNA from mixtures of roots, amplified the trnL intron by polymerase change reaction, and identified up to 60 clones from each mixture. We tested the effects of root diameter and species on sequence representation in mixtures. Species were correctly identified in our mixtures. Recovery efficiencies were low for root diameter classes >0.3 mm compared with those <0.3 mm, and species in high abundance in the mixture had relatively low recovery efficiency. American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) was quantitatively underrepresented compared with yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) and white ash (Fraxinus americana L.). Root identification by sequencing is accurate and can readily be applied to novel systems without new primer development. This technique will be attractive for documenting changes in relative abundances of species, especially as the cost of sequence-based analyses drops. However, the results of such analyses must be considered carefully, as root diameter distribution, abundances, and species can introduce quantifiable biases in the estimation of relative root abundance.","[Fisk, Melany C.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Yanai, Ruth D.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Fisk, MC (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",fiskmc@muohio.edu,"Yanai, Ruth D./O-3250-2019","Yanai, Ruth D./0000-0001-6987-2489; Fisk, Melany/0000-0003-4248-0180",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 98-10221],"We thank Kevan Minick and Sharon Santangelo for assistance in the field; Chris Lauber, Bob Bowers, Elizabeth Costello, Brittany Coyne, and Tera Ratliff for assistance in the laboratory; and Corrie Blodgett for statistical analyses.

We compared the impact of two types of disturbances that represent the most likely future conditions of currently dense ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States: (I) high-intensity fire and (2) thinning, designed to reduce fire intensity. High-severity fire had a larger impact on ecosystem carbon uptake and storage than thinning. Total ecosystem carbon was 42% lower at the intensely burned site, 10 years after burning, than at the undisturbed site. Eddy covariance measurements over two years showed that the burned site was a net annual source of carbon to the atmosphere whereas the undisturbed site was a sink. Net primary production (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency were lower at the burned site than at the undisturbed site. In contrast, thinning decreased total ecosystem carbon by 18%, and changed the site from a carbon sink to a source in the first post-treatment year. Thinning also decreased ET, reduced the limitation of drought on carbon uptake during summer, and did not change water use efficiency. Both disturbances reduced ecosystem carbon uptake by decreasing gross primary production (55% by burning, 30% by thinning) more than total ecosystem respiration (TER: 33-47% by burning, 18% by thinning), and increased the contribution of soil carbon dioxide efflux to TER. The relationship between TER and temperature was not affected by either disturbance. Efforts to accurately estimate regional carbon budgets should consider impacts on carbon dynamics of both large disturbances, such as high-intensity fire, and the partial disturbance of thinning that is often used to prevent intense burning. Our results show that thinned forests of ponderosa pine in the southwestern United States are a desirable alternative to intensively burned forests to maintain carbon stocks and primary production.","[Dore, S.; Kolb, T.

Root responses to grazing under high N inputs may facilitate these changes, but their responses are less well understood. We examined biomass, root morphology and demography, and nitrogen pool responses of Festuca campestris Rydb. seedlings grown in pots in an environmental chamber and subject to heavy fertilization with isotopically-labelled N in a NO(3)-N or NH(4)-N fertilizer treatment, and to no clipping or clipping to 4 cm twice during the experiment. Festuca campestris exhibited re-growth patterns after defoliation that reflected preferential allocation to aboveground shoots, with percent recovery of shoot biomass twice that of roots. Clipping did not increase the risk of root mortality. Instead, reduced root biomass in clipped plants resulted from slowed elongation and decreased production of new roots. Although roots with smaller diameters and at lower density had a greater risk of root mortality, clipping did not alter the mean root diameter or level of root branching. Under high N fertilization, NH(4)-N increased the amount of aboveground biomass, ameliorated the effects of clipping on root production and further reduced the risk of root mortality in clipped plants. N-form had no effect on root morphology. While total plant N uptake and the percent utilization of fertilizer were lower in clipped plants, total plant nitrogen accumulated per root biomass (g g-1) at harvest was higher in clipped plants. Our findings indicate that where defoliation is coupled with high nitrogen return, Festuca campestris recuperates by increasing nitrogen uptake, shifting production to favour recovery of aboveground biomass, and mitigating carbon losses by decreasing investment in new, actively growing roots. Because application of a more mobile form of nitrogen (NO(3)-N) did not alter root morphology, root physiological responses may be most important for re-growth when nitrogen is not limiting. Root reductions associated with grazing may have a greater impact in locations where grazer-mediated nitrogen return is spatially decoupled from defoliation.","[McInenly, Leslie E.; Merrill, Evelyn H.; Cahill, James F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Juma, Noorallah G.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","McInenly, LE (reprint author), 1115 Linden St W, Stillwater, MN 55082 USA.",mcine017@umn.edu,"Merrill, Evelyn/A-2668-2014; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015; Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015","Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X; Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516",Challenge Grants in Biodiversity Program (ACA); Parks Canada; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation - Canada; NSERC DiscoveryNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of AlbertaUniversity of Alberta,"This research was supported by the Challenge Grants in Biodiversity Program (ACA), Parks Canada, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation - Canada, NSERC Discovery Grants to J.

This study addresses the diversity, spatial distribution and host preference of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) in a neotropical rainforest site in North East Ecuador. DNA sequence analysis of both symbionts revealed relatively low richness of EcMF as compared with the richness of temperate regions that contrasts with high plant (including host) diversity. EcMF community was positively autocorrelated up to 8.5 +/- 1.0-m distance-roughly corresponding to the canopy and potentially rooting area of host individuals. Coccoloba (Polygonaceae), Guapira and Neea (Nyctaginaceae) differed by their most frequent EcMF. Two-thirds of these EcMF preferred one of the host genera, a feature uncommon in boreal forests. Scattered distribution of hosts probably accounts for the low EcMF richness. This study demonstrates that the diversity of plants and their mycorrhizal fungi is not always related and host preference among EcMF can be substantial outside the temperate zone.

We exposed the herbaceous annual Impatiens pallida, which is native to North America, to fractionated A. petiolata extracts at four developmental stages (germination, presymbiosis growth, symbiosis formation, and symbiosis growth) by using exposure levels expected to be similar to field levels. Surprisingly, we found strong direct effects on I. pallida germination and growth, but no indirect effects on I. pallida growth mediated by AMF. We also observed strong synergistic effects with a complete A. petiolata extract that inhibited I. pallida germination and presymbiosis root growth more than either a glucosinolate or flavonoid enriched fraction alone. In fact, the flavonoid enriched fraction tended to stimulate germination and presymbiosis root growth. In contrast to these strong direct effects, I. pallida plant growth during both the symbiosis formation and symbiosis growth phases was unaffected by A. petiolata extracts. We also found no inhibition of AMF colonization of roots or soils by A. petiolata extracts. We show that AMF can actually ameliorate allelopathic effects of an invasive plant, and suggest that previously observed allelopathic effects of A. petiolata may be due to direct inhibition of plant and fungal growth before symbiosis formation.","[Barto, Kathryn; Cipollini, Don] Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Friese, Carl] Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Dayton, OH 45469 USA","Barto, K (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",barto@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Morris, Kathryn/I-4701-2014; Barto, Kathryn/A-3624-2009","Morris, Kathryn/0000-0003-3548-444X; ",Environmental Protection Agency Greater Research Opportunities Fellowship [91673701],"We thank Eusondia Arnett, Steph Enright, and Cherissa Rainey for help in the lab, and Sarah Tebbens and Chris Barton for helpful discussions about fractal analysis.

Decreases in pH were observed with the solutions containing compounds having adjacent carboxyl groups (oxalic acid), carboxyl/alcoholic hydroxyl groups (glycolic acid), carboxyl/formyl groups (glyoxylic acid), and phenolic hydroxyl groups (protocatechuic acid) on the addition of 0.1 M AlCl(3). The malonic and phthalic acids, having two carboxyl groups, were also effective. These results show that the compounds were effective in forming complexes with aluminum. This finding corresponds to the fact that aluminum toxicity is reduced by formation of a complex with aluminum, except in phthalic acid. The chemical structures stated above in ozone-treated kraft lignins contribute, at least partly, to the complex with aluminum.

While induction of defense by aboveground pathogens and herbivores is well-studied, induction by belowground organisms is less explored. Here, we examine whether soil microorganisms and nematodes can induce changes in levels of the secondary metabolites aucubin and catalpol (iridoid glycosides, IG) in roots and root exudates of two full-sib families of Plantago lanceolata originating from lines selected for low and high constitutive levels of IG in leaves. Addition of soil microorganisms enhanced the shoot and root biomass, and the concentration of aucubin in roots of both Plantago lines without affecting IG levels in the rhizosphere. By contrast, nematode addition tended to reduce the root biomass and enhanced the stalk biomass, and increased the levels of aucubin and catalpol in root exudates of both Plantago lines, without affecting root IG concentrations. The Plantago lines did not differ in constitutive levels of aucubin and total IG in roots, while the concentration of catalpol was slightly higher in roots of plants originally selected for low constitutive levels of IG in leaves. Root exudates of ""high IG line"" plants contained significantly higher levels of aucubin, which might be explained by their higher root biomass. We conclude that soil microorganisms can induce an increase of aucubin concentrations in the roots, whereas nematodes (probably plant feeders) lead to an enhancement of aucubin and catalpol levels in root exudates of P. lanceolata. A potential involvement of secondary metabolites in belowground interactions between plants and soil organisms is discussed.","[Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Wurst, Susanne; Wagenaar, Roel; Biere, Arjen; van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO KNAW, Ctr Terr Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, Wageningen, Netherlands","Wurst, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",s.wurst@fu-berlin.de,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Biere, Arjen/B-8079-2008","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Biere, Arjen/0000-0002-9006-3448",EUEuropean Union (EU) [MRTN-CT-2003-505090],This study was financed by the EU funded Marie-Curie training network BIORHIZ (Biotic interactions in the rhizosphere as structuring forces for plant communities MRTN-CT-2003-505090).

We carried out a series of experiments in a 20-year-old mixed-species plantation, as well as in Manchurian walnut and larch plantations. Manchurian walnut seedlings had difficulty surviving in the Manchurian walnut plantation because their growth was inhibited by their own soil and root exudates. In sharp contrast, Manchurian walnut seedlings grew well in larch and mixed-species plantations. Larch soil and root exudates greatly stimulated the growth of Manchurian walnut seedlings in controlled conditions. In particular, larch root exudates can increase the soil microbial populations, including bacteria, actinomycetes, azotobacter and cellulose-decomposing microorganisms; larch root exudates can also increase the enzyme activities of saccharase, urease, proteinase and polyphenol oxidase. Significant results led to a rapid degradation of the root-exuded phytotoxic juglone from Manchurian walnut. Manchurian walnut root exudates contained juglone at a high concentration of 121.3 +/- 6.6 mg g(-1), while juglone concentrations in the soil beneath Manchurian walnut trees ranged from 2.9-6.2 A mu g g(-1) soil. It appears from the results that juglone may be released from Manchurian walnut roots into the soil in a sufficient quantity but rapidly degrades due to interactions with soil factors. Furthermore, juglone was more resistant toward degradation in the Manchurian walnut soil (t (1/2) = 7.36 A +/- 0.63 h) when compared to the larch soil (t (1/2) = 4.66 A +/- 0.82 h). The results suggest that larch may improve the establishment and productivity of Manchurian walnut in a mixed-species plantation through the release of root exudates.","[Yang, Lixue; Wang, Peng; Kong, Chuihua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lixue] NE Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Kong, CH (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",kongch@cau.edu.cn,"Kong, Chui-Hua/G-6002-2011; Wang, Peng/C-4029-2008","Kong, Chui-Hua/0000-0002-8405-3083; Wang, Peng/0000-0002-0629-8835","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC30671663]; Innovation Program of Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [SLYQY0608]","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC30671663) and Innovation Program of Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SLYQY0608).",,37,15,25,5,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2010,329,2-Jan,,,,,249,258,,10.1007/s11104-009-0149-0,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,568SP,WOS:000275543300019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wielbo, J; Golus, J; Marek-Kozaczuk, M; Skorupska, A",,,,"Wielbo, Jerzy; Golus, Joanna; Marek-Kozaczuk, Monika; Skorupska, Anna",,,Symbiosis-stage associated alterations in quorum sensing autoinducer molecules biosynthesis in Sinorhizobium meliloti,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sinorhizobium-alfalfa symbiosis; Quorum sensing; AHL detection,PLANT-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA; ACYL HOMOSERINE LACTONES; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ALFALFA NODULES; RHIZOBIUM; SIGNALS; IDENTIFICATION; VECTORS; STRAINS; SYSTEMS,"Sinorhizobium meliloti strains use several N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers to sense the population density during saprophytic growth.

Mediterranean plants have evolved a number of morphological and physiological adaptations that determine their ability to survive and grow, being an effective water uptake and use important factors for drought resistance. In this article, we evaluated interspecific differences in morphology, biomass allocation, and architectural traits and their relationship with water use strategies in seedlings of seven co-occurring Mediterranean species (Anthyllis cytisoides L., Genista scorpius L. DC., Myrtus communis L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Spartium junceum L. and Ulex parviflorus Pourr.). The results showed that morphological root features vary among species and they are significantly correlated with root hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange variables. Species with high specific root length (SRL) showed a low hydraulic conductance per root length (K (RRL)) but high specific hydraulic conductance (K (As)). M. communis and P. lentiscus showed the most contrasting water use patterns with respect to the other species studied. The results are not affected when considering phylogenetic relatedness. Thus, the variability observed in root hydraulic properties and leaf gas exchange suggests important mechanisms for understanding species coexistence in water-limited ecosystems.","[Hernandez, E.

Evidence from angiosperms implicates the plant hormone auxin and its polar transport, mainly established by the PIN family of auxin efflux transporters, in the patterning of embryos. Here, PaPIN1 from Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), a gene widely expressed in conifer tissues and organs, was characterized and its expression and localization patterns were determined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization during somatic embryo development and in seedlings. PaPIN1 shares the predicted structure of other PIN proteins, but its central hydrophilic loop is longer than most PINs. In phylogenetic analyses, PaPIN1 clusters with Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7, but its expression pattern also suggests similarity to PIN1. The PaPIN1 expression signal was high in the protoderm of pre-cotyledonary embryos, but not if embryos were pre-treated with the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). This, together with a high auxin immunolocalization signal in this cell layer, suggests a role of PaPIN1 during cotyledon formation. At later stages, high PaPIN1 expression was observed in differentiating procambium, running from the tip of incipient cotyledons down through the embryo axis and to the root apical meristem (RAM), although the mode of RAM specification in conifer embryos differs from that of most angiosperms. Also, the PaPIN1 in situ signal was high in seedling root tips including root cap columella cells. The results thus suggest that PaPIN1 provides an ancient function associated with auxin transport and embryo pattern formation prior to the separation of angiosperms and gymnosperms, in spite of some morphological differences.","[Palovaara, Joakim; Hallberg, Henrik; Hakman, Inger] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Nat Sci, SE-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; [Stasolla, Claudio; Luit, Bert] Univ Manitoba, Dept Plant Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Hakman, I (reprint author), Linnaeus Univ, Sch Nat Sci, SE-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",inger.hakman@lnu.se,,,Linnaeus University (former University of Kalmar); Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry,The support from the Linnaeus University (former University of Kalmar) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry is gratefully acknowledged.,,59,15,16,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2010,30,4,,,,,479,489,,10.1093/treephys/tpp126,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,578PG,WOS:000276305100005,20129931,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Kalliokoski, T; Sievanen, R; Nygren, P",,,,"Kalliokoski, Tuomo; Sievanen, Risto; Nygren, Pekka",,,Tree roots as self-similar branching structures: axis differentiation and segment tapering in coarse roots of three boreal forest tree species,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Developmental stage; Fractal root model; Mixed stand; Root architecture; Site type,ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; AGROFORESTRY; SIZE,"We applied a fractal root model to the 3D architecture of the coarse root systems of Betula pendula Roth, Picea abies (L.)

We analyzed the variability of the model parameters with respect to species, site type, and different root axes. According to our results, the cross-sectional area of root segments (i.e. second power of diameter) was a suitable variable for analyzing the values of parameters of the fractal model. The parameter values varied with generation and order of root segments; the roots thus did not follow the simple fractal branching. The variation of parameters along the root axes showed the existence of a zone of rapid tapering in all tree species. The model was, with parameter values analyzed from the data, moderately capable of accounting for the main coarse root characteristics. It was important for model predictions to take into account the tapering of root segments. We conclude that, in boreal forests, tree root systems are the output of the axis-specific morphogenetic branching rules and functional adaptation to spatial heterogeneity in the soil.","[Kalliokoski, Tuomo; Sievanen, Risto] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, Vantaa 01301, Finland; [Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Kalliokoski, T (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Unit, POB 18, Vantaa 01301, Finland.",tuomo.kalliokoski@metla.fi,,,Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [210875],We gratefully acknowledge the help of Jari Perttunen as he provided the software to read in the architectural data of roots for data analysis.

We determined percent root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in each of 18 vascular plant species. Fungi were present in all species that were assessed. In general, monocots were primarily colonized by DSE, whereas dicots were primarily colonized by AMF. Taxodium distichum was heavily colonized by AMF, as was the non-native, invasive Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera).

The first phase comprised big node bamboo (Phyllostachys nidularia Munro) only. In the second phase, bamboo co-existed with deciduous tree species and in the third phase, deciduous species existed alone. Root density at different depths and root tensile strength were determined for each species. The factor of safety (FOS) was calculated for slopes with and without vegetation for each succession phase. For phase 2, FOS was determined for different species mixtures and positions. In phase 3, simulations were performed with a single tree at the top, middle or toe of the slope. Due to its shallow root system, bamboo contributed little to slope stability. In simulations with the tree at the top or middle of the slope, FOS decreased because tree weight added a surcharge to the slope. FOS increased with the tree at the bottom of the slope. Different mixtures of species along the slope had no influence on FOS. Differences in root tensile strength between species played a small role in FOS calculations, and tree size and density were the most important factors affecting slope stability, excluding hydrological factors.

Recent riparian management practice in Australia has focussed on re-establishing or maintaining native riparian vegetation in order to control or prevent erosion as well as regenerate or preserve the complex variety of in-stream and riverside habitats. This work presents an integrated review of field and experimental studies conducted in eastern Australia that evaluate native vegetation's role in mass failure of riverbanks. Several results of these studies have general application and include the following: (1) The presence of riparian forest on riverbanks significantly reduces the likelihood of erosion by mass failure due to reinforcement of riverbank soils by tree roots and this reduced likelihood of mass failure enables a narrower channel cross-section than would otherwise be the case for many Australian coastal streams. (2) A number of Australian tree species have apparently evolved roots that seek the permanent, summer water table in order to survive prolonged dry spells, these root systems are particularly effective in mass failure mitigation due to rooting depths that are commonly greater than 5 m and are sometimes well in excess of 20 m. (3) The so-called ""Root-Area-Ratio method"" of calculating the shear strength of root-reinforced soil using root tensile strength data and Waldron's [Waldron, L.J., 1977. The shear resistance of root-permeated homogenous and stratified soil. J. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. 41, 843-849] and Wu et al.'s [Wu, T.H., McKinnell, W.P., Swanston, D.N., 1979. Strength of tree roots and landslides on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. Can. Geotech. J. 16,19-33] simple root model leads to significant overestimation of the actual root-reinforcement due to (a) breakage or pull-out of roots that taper and narrow beneath the shear plane such that individual roots do not achieve the tensile strength calculated on the basis of root diameter at the shear plane; and/or (b) the fact that the soil mass fails progressively along the length of potential shear plane rather instantaneously across the entire shear plane.

The method is analytical and allows one to relate the vertical distribution of plant roots to the local climatic and pedological conditions. The model does not require calibration and employs only data that are easily available. The model has been applied to two case studies in central Italy and proved effective for assessing both root area and average rooting depth as functions of depth. Plant rooting systems turn out to be closer to the soil surface where the soils are clay-textured and where the evaporation/precipitation ratio is large (intensive water use).

Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta-analysis with information theory-based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group and N-fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation ('plant response') than other factors. Non-N-fixing forbs and woody plants and C-4 grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N-fixing bacterial symbionts and C-3 grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P-limited rather than N-limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology.","[Hoeksema, Jason D.; Karst, Justine] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Chaudhary, V.

Our goal was to quantify plant uptake of organic and inorganic N across a broad latitudinal gradient of forest ecosystems that varied with respect to overstory taxon, edaphic characteristics, and dominant mycorrhizal association. Using C-13 and N-15, we observed in situ the cycling dynamics of NH4 (+) and glycine through various soil pools and fine roots over 14 days. Recovery of N-15 as soil N varied with respect to N form, forest type, and sampling period; however, there were similarities in the cycling dynamics of glycine and NH4 (+) among all forest types. Microbial immobilization of N-15 was immediately apparent for both treatments and represented the largest sink (similar to 25%) for N-15 among extractable soil N pools during the first 24 h. In contrast, fine roots were a relatively small sink (< 10%) for both N forms, but fine root C-13 enrichment indicated that plants in all forest types absorbed glycine intact, suggesting that plants and microbes effectively target the same labile soil N pools. Relative uptake of amino acid-N versus NH4 (+) varied significantly among sites and approximately half of this variation was explained by mycorrhizal association. Estimates of plant uptake of amino acid-N relative to NH4 (+) were 3x higher in ectomycorrhizal-dominated stands (1.6 +/- A 0.2) than arbuscular mycorrhizae-dominated stands (0.5 +/- A 0.1). We conclude that free amino acids are an important component of the N economy in all stands studied; however, in these natural environments plant uptake of organic N relative to inorganic N is explained as much by mycorrhizal association as by the availability of N forms per se.","[McFarland, Jack W.] Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Ruess, Roger W.; Kielland, Knut] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Pregitzer, Kurt] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hendrick, Ronald] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Allen, Michael] Univ Calif Riverside, Coll Nat & Agr Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","McFarland, JW (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, POB 757000, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",jwmcfarland@alaska.edu,,,"National Science Foundation's Ecosystem Studies program [DEB 966537]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0620579]; USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [PNW01-JV11261952-231]","We are very thankful to Greg Mauer for all his cheerful effort in the field.

However, modeling exercises indicate that a warmer and drier climate as predicted for parts of Central Europe may substantially alter the source/sink function of these economically important ecosystems. In a transect study with 14 mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests growing on uniform geological substrate, we analyzed the influence of a large reduction of annual precipitation (970-520 mm yr-1) on the carbon stocks in fast and slow pools, independent of the well-known aging effect. We investigated the C storage in the organic L, F, H layers, the mineral soil to 100 cm, and in the biomass (stem, leaves, fine roots), and analyzed the dependence of these pools on precipitation. Soil organic carbon decreased by about 25% from stands with > 900 mm yr-1 to those with < 600 mm yr-1; while the carbon storage in beech stems slightly increased. Reduced precipitation affected the biomass C pool in particular in the fine root fraction but much less in the leaf biomass and stem fractions. Fine root turnover increased with a precipitation reduction, even though stand fine root biomass and SOC in the organic L, F, and H layers decreased. According to regression analyses, the C storage in the organic layers was mainly controlled by the size of the fine root C pool suggesting an important role of fine root turnover for the C transfer from tree biomass to the SOC pool. We conclude that the long-term consequence of a substantial precipitation decrease would be a reduction of the mineral soil and organic layer SOC pools, mainly due to higher decomposition rates. This could turn temperate beech forests into significant carbon sources instead of sinks under global warming.","[Meier, Ina C.; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Meier, Ina C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@uni-goettingen.de,,"Meier, Ina Christin/0000-0001-6500-7519",Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt; Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Government of Canada),We wish to thank Jutta Czernitzki and Ute Schlonsog for support with laboratory analyses.

Location Northern China, in diverse grassland types spanning temperate grasslands in arid and semi-arid regions to alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We investigated above-ground and below-ground biomass in China's grasslands by conducting five consecutive sampling campaigns across the northern part of the country during 2001-05. We then documented the root : shoot ratio (R/S) and its relationship with climatic factors for China's grasslands. We further explored relationships between above-ground and below-ground biomass across different grassland types. Results Our results indicated that the overall R/S of China's grasslands was larger than the global average (6.3 vs. 3.7). The R/S for China's grasslands did not show any significant trend with either mean annual temperature or mean annual precipitation. Above-ground biomass was nearly proportional to below-ground biomass with a scaling exponent (the slope of log-log linear relationship between above-ground and below-ground biomass) of 1.02 across various grassland types. The slope did not differ significantly between temperate and alpine grasslands or between steppe and meadow. Main conclusions Our findings support the isometric theory of above-ground and below-ground biomass partitioning, and suggest that above-ground biomass scales isometrically with below-ground biomass at the community level.","[Yang, Yuanhe; Fang, Jingyun; Ma, Wenhong; Guo, Dali] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanhe; Fang, Jingyun; Ma, Wenhong; Guo, Dali] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Mohammat, Anwar] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China","Fang, JY (reprint author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jyfang@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011; Guo, Dali/G-2158-2014; Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [90711002, 30721140306, 40638039, 30700090]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (90711002, 30721140306 and 40638039 to JYF, and 30700090 to WHM).

Soybeans were dressed with standard nitrogen (SN) fertilization (15 kg N ha(-1)) and heavy nitrogen (HN) fertilization (615 kg N ha(-1)). The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in Nod(+) soybeans (66%) was smaller than that in Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans (75-76%) under SN fertilization, whereas that of Gammaproteobacteria showed the opposite pattern (23% in Nod(+) and 12-16% in Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans). Principal coordinate analysis showed that the bacterial communities of Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans were more similar to each other than to that of Nod(+) soybeans under SN fertilization. HN fertilization increased the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in all nodulation phenotypes (33-57%) and caused drastic shifts of the bacterial community. The clustering analyses identified a subset of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the species level in Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria responding to both the nodulation phenotypes and nitrogen fertilization levels. Meanwhile, the abundance of Betaproteobacteria was relatively constant in all libraries constructed under these environmental conditions. The relative abundances of two OTUs in Alphaproteobacteria (Aurantimonas sp. and Methylobacterium sp.) were especially sensitive to nodulation phenotype and were drastically decreased under HN fertilization. These results suggested that a subpopulation of proteobacteria in soybeans is controlled in a similar manner through both the regulation systems of plant-rhizobia symbiosis and the nitrogen signaling pathway in plants.

Two main theories explaining these processes have emerged; niche theory, which highlights the importance of deterministic processes, and neutral theory, which focuses on stochastic processes. We examined whether neutral or niche-based mechanisms best explain the composition and structure of communities of a functionally important soil microbe, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we surveyed AM fungi from 425 individual plants of 28 plant species along a soil pH gradient. There was evidence that both niche and neutral processes structured this community. Species abundances fitted the zero-sum multinomial distribution and there was evidence of dispersal limitation, both indicators of neutral processes. However, we found stronger support that niche differentiation based on abiotic soil factors, primarily pH, was structuring the AM fungal community. Host plant species affected AM fungal community composition negligibly compared to soil pH. We conclude that although niche partitioning was the primary mechanism regulating the composition and diversity of natural AM fungal communities, these communities are also influenced by stochastic-neutral processes. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of community-level processes acting on soil microbes; revealing a community that although influenced by stochastic processes, still responded in a predictable manner to a major abiotic niche axis, soil pH. The strong response to environmental factors of this community highlights the susceptibility of soil microbes to environmental change.

Most studies of species abundance patterns focus on conspicuous macroorganisms while microbial communities remain relatively understudied. This bias is a concern given the functional importance and high diversity of microbes. 2. We determine whether a common species abundance distribution (SAD) is observed in communities of a widespread group of soil microbes, the Glomeromycota or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we intensively sampled the AM fungal community of a woodland-grassland ecotone in Yorkshire, UK. Observed species abundances were compared to theoretical models describing SADs. We also reanalysed 32 previously published data sets in a similar manner. 3. Species abundance distributions in all the AM fungal communities fitted both lognormal and broken-stick models. However, these models consistently and significantly underpredicted the abundance of the most abundant AM fungal taxon. We found that AM fungal communities are typically dominated by a single taxon; representing on average 40% of total abundance within the community. Phylogenetic analysis of the most abundant taxa across data sets showed that the dominant AM fungal type in each community was different and not a widespread generalist. 4. We conclude that a common community structure is present in AM fungal communities from different habitats. The fit to log-normal and broken-stick models suggests the influence of niche differentiation structuring these communities. However, the consistently observed overdominance indicates that local adaptation and stochastic processes may also play important roles in structuring these communities, and we propose a mechanism to explain overdominance in AM fungal communities. 5. Synthesis. This paper applies ecological models derived from studies on larger organisms to microbial communities. Results from this study suggest that a common log-normal SAD is likely to be observed across both microbial and macro taxa. However, due to the distinctive features of microbial biology, some noticeable differences, such as heavy overdominance, may lead to unique structures in microbial communities. This research not only highlights that, to a first approximation, microbial communities follow similar processes and have similar patterns to those of macroorganisms, but also the need for large-scale microbial data sets, if we are to understand the patterns and processes regulating global biodiversity.","[Dumbrell, Alex J.; Nelson, Michaela; Helgason, Thorunn; Dytham, Calvin; Fitter, Alastair H.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Dumbrell, AJ (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",ajd121@york.ac.uk,"Helgason, Thorunn/P-6435-2019","Helgason, Thorunn/0000-0003-3639-1499",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D01090X/1],"We would like to thank Natural England and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust for permission to work at Hetchell Wood, and Naveed Aziz and Celina Whalley of the University of York Genomics Facility for technical advice and assistance.

This study aimed to isolate hitherto-uncultured bacteria from the potato rhizosphere by a combination of cultivation approaches. An agar medium low in carbon availability (oligotrophic agar medium) and either amended with potato root exudates or catalase or left unamended was used with the aim to improve the culturability of bacteria from the potato rhizosphere. The colony forming unit numbers based on colonies and microcolonies were compared with microscopically determined fluorescence-stained cell numbers. Taxonomical diversity of the colonies was compared with that of library clones made from rhizosphere DNA, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene comparisons. The oligotrophic media amended or not with catalase or rhizosphere extract recovered up to 33.6% of the total bacterial numbers, at least seven times more than the recovery observed on R2A. Four hitherto-uncultured Verrucomicrobia subdivision 1 representatives were recovered on agar, but representatives of this group were not found in the clone library. The use of oligotrophic medium and its modifications enabled the growth of colony numbers, exceeding those on classical agar media. Also, it led to the isolation of hitherto-uncultured bacteria from the potato rhizosphere. Further improvement in cultivation will certainly result in the recovery of other as-yet-unexplored bacteria from the rhizosphere, making these groups accessible for further investigation, e.g., with respect to their possible interactions with plants.","[da Rocha, Ulisses Nunes; van Overbeek, Leo S.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [da Rocha, Ulisses Nunes; van Elsas, Jan Dirk] Univ Groningen, Dept Microbial Ecol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands; [Andreote, Fernando Dini; de Azevedo, Joao Lucio] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Genet, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, Brazil","van Overbeek, LS (reprint author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",leo.vanoverbeek@wur.nl,"Andreote, Fernando Dini/B-8499-2012; Nunes da Rocha, Ulisses/M-7467-2013","Andreote, Fernando Dini/0000-0002-9883-9968; Nunes da Rocha, Ulisses/0000-0001-6972-6692","Netherlands Genomics Initiative; Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food quality [KB4]","This work was supported by the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (Ecogenomics program) and the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food quality (KB4, research program on sustainable agriculture).

To test whether this prediction is also applicable to associations of bacteria with fungi, we explored patterns of molecular evolution in two lineages of mutualistic endosymbionts of fungi: the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus microsporus (Mucormycotina) and Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum endosymbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota). We compared these two lineages with the closely related Candidatus Tremblaya princeps endosymbionts of mealybugs (Hemiptera, Coccoidea, Pseudococcidae) and to free-living Burkholderia species. To make inferences about the life histories of the endosymbionts, we relied on the empirically validated predictions of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution that a reduction of the effective population size increases the rate of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations. Our analyses showed that the slightly deleterious mutation accumulation patterns in the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus were nearly indistinguishable from those in their free-living relatives. In contrast, Ca. Glomeribacter showed unique patterns of molecular evolution that differentiated them from both the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus and from the Ca. Tremblaya endosymbionts of insects. These findings imply that reduced mixing of symbiont lineages is not a universal feature of symbioses between fungi and endocellular bacteria.","[Castillo, Dean M.; Pawlowska, Teresa E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Pawlowska, TE (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tep8@cornell.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0918880],"We thank Stephen Mondo for comments on the manuscript, Lalit Ponnala for discussions on rRNA secondary structure prediction, Dan Buckley and Chris Gaby for help with the ARB software, Ashley Egan for help with the r8s software, and James Booth and Francoise Vermeylen for statistical consultation.

The bacterivorous microfauna has been shown to increase root branching and to foster auxin producing soil bacteria. However, information on modifications of plant internal auxin content by soil bacteria and bacterivores is missing. Therefore, the effects of a rhizosphere bacterial community and a common soil amoeba (Acanthamoeba castellanii) on root branching and on auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) metabolism in Lepidium sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated. In a first experimental series, bacteria increased conjugated auxin concentrations in L. sativum shoots, but did not alter free bioactive auxin content nor root branching. In contrast, in presence of soil bacteria plus amoebae free auxin concentrations in shoots and root branching increased, demonstrating that effects of bacteria on auxin metabolism in plants were strongly modified by the bacterivorous amoebae. In a second experiment, A. thaliana reporter plants for auxin (DR5) and cytokinin (ARR5) responded similarly with increased root branching in the presence of amoebae. Surprisingly, in reporter plants cytokinin but not auxin responses were detectable, accompanied by higher soil nitrate concentrations in the presence of amoebae. Likely, increased nitrate concentrations in the rhizosphere led to an accumulation of cytokinin and interactions with free auxin in plants and finally to increased root growth in the presence of amoebae. Altogether, the results show that mutual control mechanisms exist between plant hormone metabolism and microbial signalling, and that effects on hormonal concentrations of plants by free-living bacteria are strongly influenced by bacterial grazers like amoebae.","[Bonkowski, M.] Univ Cologne, Dept Terr Ecol, Inst Zool, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Krome, K.; Rosenberg, K.; Kreuzer, K.; Scheu, S.; Bonkowski, M.] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Dickler, C.; Ullrich-Eberius, C.] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Bot, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Ludwig-Mueller, J.] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Bot, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Bonkowski, M (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Dept Terr Ecol, Inst Zool, Weyertal 119, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",bonkowski@rhizosphere.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Bonkowski, Michael/C-3700-2013","Bonkowski, Michael/0000-0003-2656-1183",Helmholtz AssociationHelmholtz Association,"The seeds of the DR5::GUS transgenic line, A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0, were kindly provided by G.

Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, a well-known non-tolerant and non-accumulator species, was used as a control. The germination rate of H. katangense was enhanced by copper and fungicide addition, suggesting that fungal pathogens, which restrain germination in normal conditions, are limiting. In hydroponic culture in the Hoagland medium, H. katangense did not grow well, in contrast to N. plumbaginifolia. Better growth was achieved by adding fungicide or higher copper concentrations. The maximal non-effective concentration (NEC) was 12 A mu M CuSO4 for H. katangense grown in hydroponics, i.e. 24 times greater than Cu concentration in the Hoagland medium. By comparison, copper concentrations greater than 0.5 A mu M had a negative effect on the growth of N. plumbaginifolia. EC50 (50% effective concentration) in hydroponics was 40 A mu M CuSO4 for H. katangense and 6 A mu M CuSO4 for N. plumbaginifolia. EC100 (100% effective concentration) was 100 A mu M CuSO4 for H. katangense and 15 A mu M CuSO4 for N. plumbaginifolia. In soil, growth was also stimulated by Cu addition up to 300 mg kg(-1) CuSO4. Surplus copper was also required for cultivating H. katangense in sterile conditions, suggesting that Cu excess may be necessary for needs other than pathogen defence. Cu accumulation in the shoot has been measured for N. plumbaginifolia and H. katangense at their respective NEC. Cu allocation in the two species showed a similar response to increasing Cu concentrations, i.e. root/shoot concentration ratio well above 1. In conclusion, H. katangense is highly tolerant to copper and has elevated copper requirement even in the absence of biotic interactions. Its accumulation pattern is typical of an excluder species.","[Chipeng, Francois K.; Hermans, Christian; Verbruggen, Nathalie] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Physiol & Genet Mol Plantes, Campus Plaine,CP242,Bld Triomphe, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Colinet, Giles] Fac Univ Sci Agron Gembloux, Unite Sol Ecol Terr, Lab Geopedol, Gembloux, Belgium; [Faucon, Michel-Pierre; Meerts, Pierre] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Ecol Vegetale & Biogeochim, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Chipeng, Francois K.; Ngongo, Michel] Univ Lubumbashi, Fac Sci Agron, Lubumbashi, DEM REP CONGO","Verbruggen, N (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Physiol & Genet Mol Plantes, Campus Plaine,CP242,Bld Triomphe, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",nverbru@ulb.ac.be,"Faucon, Michel-Pierre/H-8757-2019","Faucon, Michel-Pierre/0000-0001-5448-7932; Colinet, Gilles/0000-0002-1850-5504; Verbruggen, Nathalie/0000-0003-2296-5404",Cooperation Universitaire au Developpement (Belgium); Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [FRFC 2.4558.08],"This work is part of a ""Projet interuniversitaire cible"" (Project REMEDLU) funded by the Cooperation Universitaire au Developpement (Belgium).

A routine method was developed for the detection and characterization of the flavonoids present in soybean root exudates using HPLC-MS/MS. Then, a systematic screening of the flavonoids exuded under biotic stress, the presence of a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, and salt stress was carried out. Results obtained indicate that the presence of Chryseobacterium balustinum Aur9 or 50 mM NaCl changes qualitatively the pattern of flavonoids exuded when compared to control conditions. Thus, in the presence of C. balustinum Aur9, soybean roots did not exude quercetin and naringenin and, under salt stress, flavonoids daidzein and naringenin could not be detected. Soybean root exudates obtained under saline conditions showed a diminished capacity to induce the expression of the nodA gene in comparison to the exudates obtained in the absence of salt.

The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n = 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32% of SOM variance (n = 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The plants inoculated with P. mendocina had significantly greater shoot biomass than the control plants at both salinity levels, whereas the mycorrhizal inoculation was only effective in increasing shoot biomass at the moderate salinity level. The aggregate stability of soils inoculated with the PGPR and/or G. mosseae significantly decreased with increasing saline stress (about 29% lower than those of soils under non-saline conditions). Only the inoculated soils showed higher concentrations of sodium (Na) under severe saline stress. The severe salinity stress decreased the glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) concentration, but the highest values of GRSP were recorded in the inoculated soils. Our findings suggest that the use of AM fungi and/or a PGPR for alleviating salinity stress in lettuce plants could be limited by their detrimental effect on soil structural stability.

The influence of soil pH on the total concentration of PLFAs was not significant, while biomass estimated using substrate induced respiration decreased by about 25%. However, the PLFA composition clearly changed along the soil pH gradient. About 40% of the variation in PLFA composition along the gradient was explained by a first principal component, and the sample scores were highly correlated to pH (R(2) = 0.97). Many PLFAs responded to pH similarly in the Hoosfield arable soil compared with previous assessments in forest soils, including, e.g. monounsaturated PLFAs 16:1 omega 5, 16:1 omega 7c and 18:1 omega 7, which increased in relative concentrations with pH, and i16:0 and cy19:0, both of which decreased with pH. Some PLFAs responded differently to pH between the soil types, e.g. br18:0. We conclude that soil pH has a profound influence on the microbial PLFA composition, which must be considered in all applications of this method to detect changes in the microbial community.

Consequently, many studies have measured the responses of dune plants to sand burial. However, there remains little agreement about the mechanisms and characteristics constituting the burial response of plants. In particular, stimulation of growth has been reported as the most common plant burial response; however, stimulation has not been reported consistently among studies. Here, a literature survey showed that the depth of burial relative to the height of the plant determined whether the growth of a species was stimulated by burial. Growth stimulation was limited to shallow burial depths, while burial depths greater than the height of the plant consistently resulted in reduced growth. As studies used widely differing burial depths or units of growth measurement, the variation in reported stimulation of plant growth can be partly attributed to differences in experimental procedure. The stimulation of growth in many species was accompanied by an increase in photosynthesis over a limited period and by a shift in biomass allocation from root to shoot. Most plants demonstrated stimulated growth (up to 200%) in response to shallow burial indicating that some burial response mechanisms are general to many species. However, a few specialist dune species displayed a much greater ability to respond to burial (up to 700% stimulation of plant mass). Although allocation shifts and increased photosynthesis have been shown to be associated with dune plant burial response, there remains a need for field measurements that focus on the diversity of mechanisms underlying plant response to burial.","[Gilbert, Matthew E.; Ripley, Brad S.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Bot, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Gilbert, ME (reprint author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Bot, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",matthewgilbertsa@gmail.com,"Gilbert, Matthew/F-8324-2010","Gilbert, Matthew/0000-0002-6761-7975",National Research Foundation; Rhodes University Joint Research Council,"This work was supported by a National Research Foundation Prestigious Doctoral scholarship (MEG), and a Rhodes University Joint Research Council grant to BSR.",,34,17,17,0,14,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,FEB,2010,35,1,,,,,53,59,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.02011.x,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,547JF,WOS:000273882700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hrynkiewicz, K; Ciesielska, A; Haug, I; Baum, C",,,,"Hrynkiewicz, Katarzyna; Ciesielska, Agnieszka; Haug, Ingeborg; Baum, Christel",,,Ectomycorrhiza formation and willow growth promotion as affected by associated bacteria: role of microbial metabolites and use of C sources,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Paxillus involutus; Helper bacteria; IAA; Acid phosphatase; Siderophores; BIOLOG,PAXILLUS-INVOLUTUS; IN-VITRO; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; FLUORESCENT PSEUDOMONADS; ECTENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITIES; MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SPECIES RECOGNITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,"Biotic interactions affect the impact of potential plant growth promoting microorganisms in the rhizosphere, but their magnitude and fundamentals are often hardly known. In a pot experiment, two physiologically different strains of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus (GUL and FRA) were tested separately and in combination with associated bacteria (Sphingomonas paucimobilis 1 L, Ralstonia pickettii 16 B, Sphingomonas sp. 23 L) on their effects on the growth of willows (Salix viminalis). Both P. involutus strains significantly increased the growth of the willows compared with non-inoculated plants, but the magnitude of this effect was significantly affected by the fungal strain. The P. involutus strain GUL with higher synthesis of auxin-like substances, acid phosphatases, siderophores and faster utilisation of yeast extract in vitro increased the willow growth in situ more effectively than strain FRA. Additionally, dual inoculation with the P. involutus strains GUL and FRA in combination with the associated bacteria promoted the willow growth, especially the combination with S. paucimobilis 1 L. This bacterial strain used effectively C sources which are common components of plant root exudates, e.g. glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose as well as compounds synthesized by fungi, e.g. trehalose in vitro. We conclude that the analyses of fungal metabolites and of C source use of associated bacteria can successfully contribute to accelerate the selection of capable plant growth promoting combinations.","[Hrynkiewicz, Katarzyna; Baum, Christel] Univ Rostock, Inst Land Use, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Hrynkiewicz, Katarzyna; Ciesielska, Agnieszka] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Microbiol, PL-89100 Torun, Poland; [Haug, Ingeborg] Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Hrynkiewicz, K (reprint author), Univ Rostock, Inst Land Use, Justus von Liebig Weg 6, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",hrynk@umk.pl,"Hrynkiewicz, Katarzyna/O-3485-2015","Hrynkiewicz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6606-685X; Baum, Christel/0000-0003-1179-2149","European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [MERG-CT-2004-006315]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Germany)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [02WT0870]","This investigation was supported by a Marie Curie Reintegration Grant financed by the European Commission (MYCOHELPER, MERG-CT-2004-006315).

We selected 90 spruce trees representing 30 triplets of different crown status: healthy, stressed and declining to assess the relationship between crown and fine root status. Sequential coring and in-growth bags were applied to each triplet to investigate fine root mass and growth in the soil depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm. Fine root quantity (biomass and necromass), turnover (production over standing stock), morphological features (specific root length, root tip density) and chemical properties (Ca:Al molar ratio) were compared among the abovementioned health status categories. Living fine root biomass decreased with increasing stress, while the ratio of dead to living biomass increased. Annual fine root production decreased and specific root length increased in stressed trees when compared to healthy or declining trees, a situation which may be related to the position of trees in the canopy (healthy and declining - dominant, stressed - co-dominant). The Ca:Al ratio decreased with increasing crown damage, indicating a decreased ability to filter out aluminium. In conclusion, fine root status appears to be linked to visible crown damage and can be used as a tree health indicator.","[Lukac, M.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, NERC Ctr Populat Biol, London SL5 7PY, England; [Konopka, B.] Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Natl Forest Ctr, Dept Forest Protect & Game Management, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia; [Konopka, B.] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Protect & Game Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic","Lukac, M (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, NERC Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, London SL5 7PY, England.",m.lukac@imperial.ac.uk,"Lukac, Martin/A-4379-2013","Lukac, Martin/0000-0002-8535-6334","Ministry of Land Management in Slovak Republic; MSMTMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [2B06012]; Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV 0612-07]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [QH 81136]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [cpb010001]","The authors thank Drs M.

Shrubs in fire prone chaparral communities have evolved different life history types in response to fire. A key to understanding the evolution of life history type differences is to understand how physiological traits are linked to differences in life history type. Vascular adaptations are important for delivering an efficient and stable water supply to evergreen chaparral shrub leaves. This study tested for a link between vascular physiology and life history type in chaparral shrubs. 2. Chaparral shrub species along the south-western coast of North America survive wildfire by three different life histories. Non-sprouters are killed by fire and re-establish exclusively through germination of fire-stimulated seeds, facultative sprouters re-establish by a combination of vegetative sprouting and fire-stimulated seeds, and obligate sprouters re-establish exclusively by vegetative sprouting because their seeds do not survive fire. Non-sprouters and facultative sprouters establish seedlings in the open canopy post fire environment, whereas obligate sprouters establish seedlings in the shady understory of the mature chaparral canopy. 3. Seedlings of nine species (Rhamnaceae) representing three each of the different life history types were grown in deep containers in a common garden under treatments of sun and shade. Hydraulic conductance was measured using a high-pressure flow meter for all organs, and a vacuum technique was used to measure conductance of fine and woody roots. We predicted that non-sprouters would exhibit greater hydraulic efficiency than the sprouting species, and that facultative sprouters would be more efficient than the shade tolerant obligate sprouters. 4. Non-sprouters had the greatest hydraulic conductance per unit leaf and sapwood area at the whole seedling level, whereas facultative and obligate sprouters were not different. Comparing hydraulic conductance across major organs (from fine roots to leaves) showed that the hydraulic system was well coordinated. At the whole seedling level, the root system was more of a bottleneck than the shoot system. This pattern was consistent with high resistance extraxylary pathways in roots and differences in root architecture. 5. The greater hydraulic efficiency of the non-sprouter life history type is attributed to its post-fire pioneering habit and may partially explain the relatively high speciation in the non-sprouters. Lower hydraulic efficiency is associated with a sprouting life history and greater shade tolerance. The seedling root systems represent a hydraulic bottleneck that may place roots under especially intense selection.","[Pratt, Robert B.; Jacobsen, Anna L.] Calif State Univ, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA; [North, Gretchen B.] Occidental Coll, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA; [Ewers, Frank W.] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Biol Sci, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Davis, Stephen D.] Pepperdine Univ, Div Nat Sci, Malibu, CA 90263 USA","Pratt, RB (reprint author), Calif State Univ, Dept Biol, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",rpratt@csub.edu,"North, Gretchen/X-6099-2019","Jacobsen, Anna/0000-0001-7830-5590","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-RUI IBN-0130870, NSF-REU DBI-0452587, NSF-RUI 0517740, NSF-IOS-0845125]; Andrew Mellon Foundation","Madeleine Ewers, Will Paddock III, and Danae Evans are thanked for help in setting up the common garden.

We investigated the long-term effect of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere on microbial biomass and specific growth rates in root-free and rhizosphere soil. The experiments were conducted under two free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) systems: in Hohenheim and Braunschweig, as well as in the intensively managed forest mesocosm of the Biosphere 2 Laboratory (B2L) in Oracle, AZ. Specific microbial growth rates (mu) were determined using the substrate-induced respiration response after glucose and/or yeast extract addition to the soil. For B2L and both FACE systems, up to 58% higher mu were observed under elevated vs. ambient CO2, depending on site, plant species and N fertilization. The mu-values increased linearly with atmospheric CO2 concentration at all three sites. The effect of elevated CO2 on rhizosphere microorganisms was plant dependent and increased for: Brassica napus=Triticum aestivum < Beta vulgaris < Populus deltoides. N deficiency affected microbial growth rates directly (N limitation) and indirectly (changing the quantity of fine roots). So, 50% decrease in N fertilization caused the overall increase or decrease of microbial growth rates depending on plant species. The mu-value increase was lower for microorganisms growing on yeast extract then for those growing on glucose, i.e. the effect of elevated CO2 was smoothed on rich vs. simple substrate. So, the r/K strategies ratio can be better revealed by studying growth on simple (glucose) than on rich substrate mixtures (yeast extract). Our results clearly showed that the functional characteristics of the soil microbial community (i.e. specific growth rates) rather than total microbial biomass amount are sensitive to increased atmospheric CO2. We conclude that the more abundant available organics released by roots at elevated CO2 altered the ecological strategy of the soil microbial community specifically a shift to a higher contribution of fast-growing r-selected species was observed. These changes in functional structure of the soil microbial community may counterbalance higher C input into the soil under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.","[Blagodatskaya, Evgenia; Blagodatsky, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Blagodatskaya, Evgenia; Dorodnikov, Maxim; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Agroecosyst Res, BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Blagodatsky, S (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Chem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia.",sblag@mail.ru,"Blagodatsky, Sergey/F-2734-2010; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/L-7177-2017","Blagodatsky, Sergey/0000-0003-1428-6014; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/0000-0002-8284-4017",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"This research was supported by the European Commission (Marie Curie IIF grant for E.

Rhizobia strategies range from mutualistic nitrogen fixers to parasitic nonfixers that hoard plant resources to increase their own survival in soil. Host plants reward beneficial rhizobia with higher nodule growth rates, generating a trade-off between reproduction in nodules and subsequent survival in soil. However, hosts might not discriminate between strains in mixed infections, allowing nonfixing strains to escape sanctions. We construct an adaptive dynamics model of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation and find general situations where symbionts undergo adaptive diversification, but in most situations complete nonfixers do not evolve. Social conflict in mixed infections when symbionts face a survival-reproduction trade-off can drive the origin of some coexisting symbiont strategies, where less mutualistic strains exploit benefits generated by better mutualists.","[Friesen, M.

The statistical analyses indicate that legume plant is the key factor shaping both rhizobia genetic and symbiotic diversity. In the most cases of our results, the nodC lineages are clearly associated with rhizobial genomic species, demonstrating that nodulation genes have co-evolved with chromosomal background, though the lateral transfer of nodulation genes occurred in some cases in a minority.

This is particularly true when models are applied to describe ecohydrology and vegetation function. However, there is a paucity of such information across continental Australia. We quantified vertical and horizontal root biomass distribution in a woodland dominated by Angophora bakeri and Eucalyptus sclerophylla on the Cumberland Plains near Richmond, New South Wales. The site was characterised by a duplex (texture contrast) soil with the A horizon (to 70 cm) consisting of loamy sand and the B horizon (to > 10 m) consisting of sandy clay. The topsoil had a smaller bulk density, a smaller water holding capacity but a larger organic component and a larger hydraulic conductivity in comparison to the subsoil. Root biomass was sampled to 1.5 m depth and declined through the soil profile. Whilst total biomass in the B horizon was relatively small, its contribution to the function of the trees was highly significant. Coarse roots accounted for approximately 82% of the root mass recovered. Lateral distribution of fine roots was generally even but coarse roots were more likely to occur closer to tree stems. Variation in tree diameter explained 75% of the variation in total below-ground biomass. The trench method suggested the belowground biomass was 6.03 +/- 1.21 kg m(-2) but this method created bias towards sampling close to tree stems. We found that approximately 68% of root material was within a 2 m radius of tree stems and this made up 54% of the total number of samples but in reality, only approximately 5 to 10% of the site is within a 2 m radius of tree stems. Based on these proportions, our recalculated belowground biomass was 2.93 +/- 0.59 kg m(-2). These measurements provide valuable data for modeling of ecosystem water use and productivity.","[Macinnis-Ng, C. M. O.; Fuentes, S.; Palmer, A. R.; Taylor, D.; Whitley, R. J.; Yunusa, I.; Zeppel, M.

We examined the idea that plant-soil feedbacks can be explained by a chance effect, which is the probability of a highly productive or keystone plant species is present in the community and will influence the functions more than the number of species per se. A C-13 pulse labelling technique was applied to three plant species and a species mixture in a greenhouse experiment to examine the carbon now from plants to soil microbial communities. The C-13 label was given as CO2 to shoots of a legume (Lotus comiculatus), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), a grass (Holcus lanatus) and a mixture of the three species. Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA)was analysed in order to determine the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community. The incorporation of the stable isotope into soil microorganisms was determined through GC-IRMS analyses of the microbial PLFAs. Plant species identity did not influence the microbial biomass when determined as total carbon of microbial phospholipid fatty acids. However, the labelled carbon showed that the grass monoculture (H. lanatus) and the plant mixture allocated more C-13 into bacteria and actinomycete biomass than the other plant species. H. lanatus monocultures had also the highest amounts of C-13 allocated to AM-fungi and saprophytic fungi. The carbon allocation from plants to soil microorganisms in a plant species mixture can thus be explained by the presence of a highly productive species that influence soil functions.

The rhizosphere is often assumed to have a large carbon flux associated with root turnover and exudation. However, little has been done to quantify the amount of DOC originating from root litter. We studied decomposition of fine root and needle litter of Norway spruce (Picea abies) through a combined incubation and leaching experiment in the laboratory using five different litter types: fresh needle litter, aged needles from the litter layer, fresh and dead roots from mineral soil samples, and seven-year-old roots from a previous litterbag study. After respiration measurements, the samples were percolated with artificial throughfall water and DOC and UV absorbance were measured in the leachate. Mineralisation of dissolved organic matter in the leachate and sorption of DOC to ferrihydrite were determined as a measure of DOC ability to be stabilised by iron (hydr)oxide surfaces. The mineralisation rate and DOC production rate of root samples were always lower than that of needle samples. However, root and needle derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) were similar in terms of aromaticity, as indicated by their specific UV absorbance. and ability to be sorbed by ferrihydrite. For seven-year-old roots, a significantly higher fraction of carbon was lost as DOC (30%) than for younger roots (20%). Furthermore, DOM from old roots bound more strongly to ferrihydrite and is mineralised at a lower rate than DOC from younger roots, suggesting that roots at late stages of decomposition, although a small fraction of total litter, significantly contribute to carbon build-up in mineral soils. The slower decomposition rate of roots compared with needles must be taken into account when modelling litter decomposition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our knowledge concerning the predominant controls on the cycling of leaf litter far outweighs that for rhizodeposition even though the constituents of rhizodeposits includes a cocktail of low molecular weight organic compounds which represent a rapidly cycling source of carbon, readily available to soil microbes. We determined the mineralization dynamics of a major rhizodeposit, glucose, and its relationship to land-use, microbial community and edaphic characteristics across a landscape in the southeastern United States. The landscape consists of cultivated, pasture, pine plantation, and hardwood forest sites (n = 3). Mineralization dynamics were resolved in both winter and summer using an in situ (13)C-glucose pulse-chase approach. Mineralization rates of the labeled glucose decline exponentially across the 72 h measurement periods. This pattern and absolute mineralization rates are consistent across seasons. An information-theoretic approach reveals that land-use is a moderately strong predictor of cumulative glucose mineralization. Measures assessing the size, activity, and/or composition of the microbial community were poor predictors of glucose mineralization. The strongest predictor of glucose mineralization was soil-extractable phosphorus. It was positively related to glucose mineralization across seasons and explained 60% and 48% of variation in cumulative glucose mineralization in the summer and winter, respectively. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between soil phosphorus and glucose mineralization. Our results suggest that specific soil characteristics often related to land-use and/or land-management decisions may be strong predictors of glucose mineralization rates across a landscape. We emphasize the need for future research into the role of soil phosphorus availability and land-use history in determining soil organic carbon dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Strigolactones are released by roots into the rhizosphere, stimulating the seed germination of parasitic plants such as Striga spp. and Orobanche spp. and play a crucial role in the interaction between plants and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. By applying different concentrations of the synthetic strigolactone analogue GR24 to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti we could show that in alfalfa nodulation is positively affected by the presence of the strigolactone analogue GR24. Moreover, we could show that this increased nodulation cannot be linked with a stimulatory effect of GR24 on the growth or the expression of nod genes of S. meliloti. Putative mechanisms operating in the plant in response to the addition of GR24 and leading to increased nodule formation by rhizobia are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we partitioned soil respiration (SR) into microbial (MR) and root-rhizosphere respiration (RR) using small root exclusion treatments in a mixed mountain forest in Switzerland. In addition, fine root respiration (FRR) was determined with measurements of excised roots. RR and FRR were strongly related to each other (R(2) = 0.92, n = 7), with RR contributing about 46% and FRR about 32% to total SR. RR rates increased more strongly with temperature (Q(10) = 3.2) than MR rates (Q(10) = 2.3). Since the contribution of RR to SR was found to be higher during growing (50%) than during dormant periods (40%), we separated the 2-year data set into phenophases. During the growing period of 2007, the temperature sensitivity of RR (Q(10) = 2.51, R(2) = 0.62) was similar to that of MR (Q(10) = 2.2, R(2) = 0.57). However, during the dormant period of 2006/2007, RR was not related to soil temperature (R(2) = 0.44, n.s.), in contrast to MR (Q(10) = 7.2; R(2) = 0.92). To better understand the influence of plant activity on root respiration, we related RR and FRR rates to photosynthetic active radiation (both R(2) = 0.67, n = 7, P = 0.025), suggesting increased root respiration rates duting times with high photosynthesis. During foliage green-up in spring 2008, i.e.. from bud break to full leaf expansion, RR increased by a factor of 5. while soil temperature increased only by about 5 degrees C, leading to an extraordinary high Q(10) of 10.6; rneanwhile, the contribution of RR to SR increased from 29 to 47%. This clearly shows that root respiration and its apparcut temperature sensitivity highly depend on plant plienology and thus on canopy assimilation and carbon allocation belowground.","[Ruehr, Nadine K.; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Ruehr, NK (reprint author), ETH, Inst Plant Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",nadine.ruehr@ipw.agrl.ethz.ch,"Ruehr, Nadine K/C-6986-2011; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011","Ruehr, Nadine K/0000-0001-5989-7463; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980",Staatssekretariat fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [C04.0255],"We would like to thank Hella Ahrends for providing phenological data, Philipp Vock and his team from the forest district Wettingen for their kind cooperation, Joshua Bizozzero and Ernest Hennig for their help in the field and sample preparation, Fabienne Zeugin for analyses of resin samples, Matthias Zeeman for help with the EC data and Sophia Etzold and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Surprisingly, the processes relating to carbon allocation have been little investigated as compared to research on the processes governing carbon assimilation. The objective of this paper was thus to test the hypothesis that growth decrease related to age is accompanied by changes in carbon allocation to the benefit of storage and reproductive functions in two contrasting broad-leaved species: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). Age-related changes in carbon allocation were studied using a chronosequence approach. Chronosequences, each consisting of several even-aged stands ranging from 14 to 175 years old for beech and from 30 to 134 years old for sessile oak, were divided into five or six age classes. In this study, carbon allocations to growth, storage and reproduction were defined as the relative amount of carbon invested in biomass increment, carbohydrate increment and seed production, respectively. Tree-ring width and allometric relationships were used to assess biomass increment at the tree and stand scales. Below-ground biomass was assessed using a specific allometric relationship between root: shoot ratio and age, established from the literature review. Seasonal variations of carbohydrate concentrations were used to assess carbon allocation to storage. Reproduction effort was quantified for beech stands by collecting seed and cupule production. Age-related flagging of biomass productivity was assessed at the tree and stand scales, and carbohydrate quantities in trees increased with age for both species. Seed and cupule production increased with stand age in beech from 56 gC m(-2) year(-1) at 30 years old to 129 gC m(-2) year(-1) at 138 years old. In beech, carbon allocation to storage and reproductive functions increased with age to the detriment of carbon allocation to growth functions. In contrast, the carbon balance between growth and storage remained constant between age classes in sessile oak. The contrasting age-related changes in carbon allocation between beech and sessile oak are discussed with reference to the differences in growing environment, phenology and hydraulic properties of ring-porous and diffuse-porous species.","[Genet, H.; Breda, N.] INRA, UMR UHP 1137, Forest Ecol & Ecophysiol Unit, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Dufrene, E.] Univ Paris 11, Evolut & Systemat Ecol Lab, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France","Breda, N (reprint author), INRA, UMR UHP 1137, Forest Ecol & Ecophysiol Unit, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",breda@nancy.inra.fr,,,Forest Ecology Department of INRA; Regional Council of LorraineRegion Grand-Est; GIP ECOFORFrench National Research Agency (ANR),H.G. received a PhD student grant from the Forest Ecology Department of INRA and the Regional Council of Lorraine.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences clustered in at least 8 discrete sequence groups, all belonging to the genus Glomus. Among the Glomus spp., Glo 1 (GlGr A) and Glo 7 (GlGr 13) were the most common in all root and soil samples of the two xerophytes, accounting for 42% and 33% of all screened clones, respectively.

Normal plowing of light textured soils prevented the growth of vertical roots of spruce and birch, when soil density was over 1.6 gcm(-3). Deep plowing when compacted plough-pan turns out on soil surface provides more favourable conditions for the growth of taproots and increases their rooting depth. More favorable conditions for the root growth may significantly accelerate the growth of the above-ground part of trees.

We asked how the mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonisations of understorey crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum) are affected by proximity to mature mountain birch trees (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) along three abiotic stress gradients (pollution, elevation, seashore) in the Kola peninsula, NW Russia. Stress level affected shoot growth and reproduction in crowberry, but had no effect on root fungal colonisation. In contrast, proximity to a mountain birch tree had no effect on either growth or reproduction of crowberry, but changed all characteristics of root colonisation. The mycorrhizal coil colonisation of crowberry was on average 21% higher near a birch tree, whereas other parameters were higher outside of canopy area (hyaline hyphae: 12%; DSE hyphae: 16%; DSE sclerotia: 42%). Effects of birch tree on root fungal colonisation in crowberry did not depend on the level of abiotic stress. Although we detected a weak positive association between growth of crowberry and its mycorrhizal coil colonisation, we conclude that mycorrhizal and DSE colonisations of crowberry are primarily affected by the abiotic environment. None of the detected patterns was consistent with the patterns expected from the theories concerning stress effects on plant-plant interactions.","[Ruotsalainen, A.

Organic matter degradation rates overshadowed litter inputs as the main determinant of the soil carbon stocks. Across the three forests, rates of litter decomposition were also indicative for turnover rates of SOC. Litter and SOC decay was faster in the sub-tropical than in the warm-temperate forests. Among the latter, SOC turnover was highest in the forest producing the higher-quality litter. Microbial biomass was, as expected, correlated with SOC content. Microbial activity, in contrast, was highest at the sub-tropical forest, despite the lower SOC availability, lower fraction of labile SOC, and lower soil microbial biomass. These results may contribute to increased understanding of controls over belowground carbon cycling in deciduous forests.","[Xiao, C. W.; Sang, W. G.; Wang, R. Z.; Xie, Z. Q.; Pei, Z.

We examined biotic interactions using a common garden experiment with native, hybrid, and exotic Senecio species representing a range of experience in the UK. Introduced species had fewer aphids and pathogens and more root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi compared to natives; hybrids generally had intermediate levels of interactions. The duration of experience in the introduced range was reflected by an increasing degree of variability in enemy release. These findings support the enemy release hypothesis and indicate the potential for changes in enemy release as time and experience in the new range increase.","[Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.; Douglas, Angela E.; Fitter, Alastair H.] Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Hawkes, CV (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, 1 Univ Stn,C0930, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",chawkes@mail.utexas.edu,,"Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI0200720],"The authors would like to thank Dr. R.

Root biomass and distribution were studied in three comparable stands in the fifth growth year (2005) in a semiarid region of northwest China: (1) pure switchgrass, (2) pure milk vetch, and (3) mixed switchgrass and milk vetch in 2:1 row replacement. The measurements were carried out three times (April, September, and November) in 2005 during the vegetation period using a soil core method (9 cm). For each species, the vertical distribution of root biomass (RB) was measured in six consecutive layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-90, 90-120, and 120-150 cm deep) between rows, between plants, and at the center of the plant, respectively. Results indicated a flexible distribution strategy of switchgrass that tended to increase soil exploitation and space sequestration efficiency in soil layers. Milk vetch followed a more conservative strategy: its roots reached the same soil depth in the pure and mixed stands but showed greater root densities in shallower soil layers in the latter. Under intercropping, RB input and root/shoot ratio in switchgrass were reduced, while milk vetch put more photosynthate into root growth. The shift toward a more superficially distributed system of milk vetch in the mixture with switchgrass together with the high RB and wide vertical and horizontal distribution of switchgrass in the study indicates the greater belowground competitive ability of switchgrass in the mixture.","[Xu, Bingcheng; Li, Fengmin; Shan, Lun] NW A&F Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Li, Fengmin; Shan, Lun] NW A&F Univ, Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Fengmin] Lanzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Xu, BC (reprint author), NW A&F Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China.",bcxu@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"Li, Fengmin/K-8740-2012","Li, Fengmin/0000-0002-2144-3498; Xu, Bingcheng/0000-0002-1702-491X","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-ON412]; Second Phase Action Plan for Western China Development [KZCX2-XB2-05]; Chinese Academy of Sciences, Western ChinaChinese Academy of Sciences [2006YB01]","The authors are grateful to Dr. Qingwu Xue from Montana State University in USA for his valuable suggestions to improve earlier versions of this manuscript.

Core method of destructive root sampling was used to establish whether root morphology and biomass varied with stand age in the upper 20 cm of soil. Fine root biomass ranged from 0.78 to 3.11 Mg ha(-1), coarse root biomass ranged from 0.82 to 2.74 Mg ha(-1), whereas root necromass ranged from 1.03 Mg ha(-1) to 2.87 Mg ha(-1) in the chronosequence studied.

The results support our hypothesis that stand age has an effect on standing fine root biomass and morphology.","[Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Protect, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Kalucka, Izabela] Univ Lodz, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Dept Mycol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland","Jagodzinski, AM (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",amj@man.poznan.pl,,"Jagodzinski, Andrzej/0000-0001-6899-0985; Kalucka, Izabela/0000-0002-7264-5735",,,,50,22,23,0,18,BOGUCKI WYDAWNICTWO NAUKOWE,POZNAN,"GORNA WILDA 90, POZNAN, 61-576, POLAND",1641-1307,,,DENDROBIOLOGY,Dendrobiology,,2010,64,,,,,,19,30,,,,,12,Plant Sciences; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Forestry,714FU,WOS:000286793700003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Carrera, AL; Bertiller, MB",,,,"Carrera, Analia L.; Bertiller, Monica B.",,,"Relationships among plant litter, fine roots, and soil organic C and N across an aridity gradient in northern Patagonia, Argentina",ECOSCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,grasses; leaf litter; litter recalcitrance; plant patch; shrubs; woody litter,PERENNIAL GRASSES; MONTE DESERT; PRECIPITATION GRADIENT; NORTHEASTERN PATAGONIA; SUBTROPICAL SAVANNA; SHORTGRASS STEPPE; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; VEGETATION CHANGE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; LEAF LITTERFALL,"We analyzed the relationship between organic C and N in the upper soil and the quantity (mass) and quality (N, soluble phenolic, and lignin concentrations) of plant aboveground litter and upper fine roots at contrasting microsites (plant patch and bare soil) in 15 study sites across an aridity gradient in Patagonia. At each site, we estimated the total, grass, and shrub cover and randomly selected 10 plant patches of modal size (height and crown diameter) and species composition. We extracted an upper soil core (0-10 cm depth) and collected the aboveground litter underneath each plant patch canopy and at the contiguous bare soil. We separated the fine roots (< 2 mm in diameter) from the soil and assessed the biomass and the concentrations of organic C and N in soil and the lignin, soluble phenolic, and N in shrub and grass components of aboveground litter and in fine roots. Total plant and grass cover decreased with increasing aridity. Total litter mass did not vary across the aridity gradient, but the proportion of shrub components in litter increased and litter quality decreased with increasing aridity. The mass of fine roots was positively correlated to soil organic C and N and decreased with increasing aridity. All these trends were consistent at plant patch and bare soil microsites. We conclude that the decrease in soil organic C and N across the aridity gradient was the outcome of different above-and belowground controls resulting from the replacement of grasses by shrubs. Accordingly, the main controls of soil organic C and N could be the quality of aboveground litter and the quantity of the organic matter input to soil through fine-root turnover from belowground.","[Carrera, Analia L.] Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina","Carrera, AL (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Blvd Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",unanalia@cenpat.edu.ar,,,"National Agency for Scientific and Technological PromotionANPCyT [PICTs 08-20454, 02-02192 BID 1728/OC-AR]",This research was funded by projects PICTs 08-20454 and 02-02192 BID 1728/OC-AR of the National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion.

In this study, we examined the immediate effect of a major hurricane on aboveground forest structure, arbuscular mycorrhizae ( AM) and belowground carbon pools in experimentally thinned plots in a tropical forest. The hurricane occurred five years after a thinning treatment, when thinned plots had similar aboveground carbon stocks but different forest structure compared to control plots. Thinned plots had more large diameter (>10 cm) trees compared to the control plots, which were characterized by a higher density of small diameter (<10 cm) trees. Despite pre-hurricane differences in forest structure, there were no significant differences between treatments in changes of canopy openness or number of affected trees following the hurricane. Thinned plots had larger belowground carbon pools than the controls plots before the hurricane, and these differences remained after the hurricane despite rapid decomposition of organic matter rich in nitrogen. There were no pre-hurricane differences in AM fungal spores or total AM root colonization. The hurricane reduced AM sporulation by nearly 50% in both treatments, yet we observed a significant increase in AM root colonization after the hurricane with greater AM colonization in the thinned plots. Hurricanes have well-known visible aboveground effects, but here we showed that less visible belowground effects are influenced by forest management and may play an important role in forest recovery.","[Vargas, Rodrigo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hasselquist, Niles; Allen, Michael F.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Vargas, R (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rvargas@berkeley.edu,"Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008","Vargas, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6829-5333","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); University of California Institute for Mexico; United States awards to R.V.; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-061542, DEB 9981607, DEB-0639235]","We are grateful to El Eden Ecological Reserve for providing technical support.

We hypothesised that the trenching experiment would alter both microbial biomass and microbial community structure and that fine roots (less than 2 mm diameter) would be decomposed within one growing season. Soil CO2 efflux was measured roughly biweekly over two growing seasons. Root presence and morphology parameters, as well as the soil microbial community were measured prior to trenching, 5 and 15 months after trenching. The trenched plots emitted about 20 and 30% less CO2 than the control plots in the first and second growing season, respectively. Roots died in trenched plots, but root decay was slow. After 5 and 15 months, fine root biomass was decreased by 9% (not statistically different) and 30%, (statistically different) respectively. When we corrected for the additional trenched-plot CO2 efflux due to fine root decomposition, the autotrophic soil respiration rose to similar to 26% of the total soil respiration for the first growing season, and to similar to 44% for the second growing season. Soil microbial biomass and community structure was not altered by the end of the second growing season. We conclude that trenching can give accurate estimates of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration, if methodological side effects are accounted for, only.","[Diaz-Pines, Eugenio; Rubio, Agustin] Madrid Polytech Univ, Silvopasciculture Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Schindlbacher, Andreas; Pfeffer, Michael; Jandl, Robert; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie] Fed Off, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Schindlbacher, Andreas; Pfeffer, Michael; Jandl, Robert; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie] Res Ctr Forests, A-1131 Vienna, Austria","Diaz-Pines, E (reprint author), Madrid Polytech Univ, Silvopasciculture Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain.",ediazpines@gmail.com,"Rubio, Agustin/B-7577-2008","Rubio, Agustin/0000-0002-1021-5203; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio/0000-0001-9935-106X","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [HU2005-0023]; Austrian Exchange Office","We thank Dr. Ernst Leitgeb for providing the WinRhizo working environment, Veronika Bendl for the assistance on PLFA analysis.

The results showed that ECM fungal inoculation significantly increased the ectomycorrhizal colonization compared with non-inoculated seedlings. ECM fungal inoculations have higher soil microbial biomass carbon than that of control, ranging from 49.6 mu g C g(-1) dry soil in control to 134.02 mu g C g(-1) dry soil in treatment inoculated with Boletus luridus Schaeff ex Fr. Multivariate analyses (PCA) of BIOLOG data revealed that the application of ECM fungi significantly influenced bacterial functional diversity in the rhizosphere of P. tabulaeformis seedlings. The highest average well-color development (AWCD) and functional diversity indices were also observed in treatment inoculated with B. luridus. A wider range of sole carbon Sources were utilized by the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of inoculated seedlings.

Even if morphological features are available, molecular taxonomy is often necessary to revise taxonomic concepts and to analyze environmental DNA sequences. However, clustering approaches to delineate molecular operational taxonomic units often rely on arbitrary parameter choices. Also, distance calculation is difficult for highly alignment-ambiguous sequences. Here, we applied a recently described clustering optimization method to highly divergent planktonic foraminifera SSU rDNA sequences. We determined the distance function and the clustering setting that result in the highest agreement with morphological reference data. Alignment-free distance calculation, when adapted to the use with partly non-homologous sequences caused by distinct primer pairs, outperformed multiple sequence alignment. Clustering optimization offers new perspectives for the barcoding of species diversity and for environmental sequencing. It bridges the gap between traditional and modern taxonomic disciplines by specifically addressing the issue of how to optimally account for both genetic divergence and given species concepts.","[Goeker, Markus] German Collect Microorganisms & Cell Cultures DSM, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Grimm, Guido W.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Auch, Alexander F.] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Bioinformat Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Aurahs, Ralf; Kucera, Michal] Univ Tubingen, Inst Geosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Goker, M (reprint author), German Collect Microorganisms & Cell Cultures DSM, Inhoffenstr 7B, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany.",markus.goeker@dsmz.de,"Kucera, Michal/B-9277-2009","Kucera, Michal/0000-0002-7817-9018; Goker, Markus/0000-0002-5144-6200; Grimm, Guido/0000-0003-0674-3553",German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [KU2259/2]; Swedish Science Foundation,"This research has been supported by German Science Foundation (DFG, grant KU2259/2).

When fire is re-introduced, the forest floor is often consumed by fire and heavy overstory mortality, often delayed by months, results. We hypothesized that the delayed post-fire tree mortality is a manifestation of a cascade of physiological stresses initiated by root damage that can also magnify the impact of other kinds of damage. We investigated the physiological impact of forest floor consumption on longleaf pines (Pinus palustris Mill.) subjected to a wildfire in 2005 in a long-unburned (>50 years) forest by measuring forest floor consumption, whole tree water use, and leaf chlorophyll content. Ten of the 23 study trees died within three years post fire. Post-fire sap flux was unrelated to crown scorch, but was negatively correlated with forest floor consumption. A segmented linear regression revealed declines in sap flux until a threshold of 31% forest floor consumption, after which further consumption had no additional effect on tree water use. Trees with >30% forest floor consumption beneath their crowns were more than 20 times as likely to die as those with less consumption. Chlorophyll content in needles that flushed post fire was negatively correlated with crown scorch (R-2 = 0.60, P = 0.009) though all trees with scorch also experienced varying degrees of forest floor consumption. Our results suggest that the consumption of the forest floor with the likely concomitant loss of roots initiated a decline spiral, driven by an inability to supply sufficient water to the crown. Though we did not measure loss of stored carbohydrates in consumed roots directly, we infer that this likely effect, coupled with decreased crown photosynthetic capacity, eventually resulted in substantial overstory tree mortality.","[O'Brien, Joseph J.; Mordecai, Kathryn] US Forest Serv, Ctr Forest Disturbance Sci, Athens, GA 30601 USA; [Hiers, J.

In drained and flooded conditions, plants were subjected to five defoliation levels: 0, 10, 50, 90% removal of leaf tissue and apex removal (90% leaf tissue plus apical bud removal). Plants were harvested weekly for five weeks. In drained conditions, plant biomasses including total biomass, shoot biomass and root biomass after 50% defoliation rapidly recovered to the control plant level. They were significantly lower for the 90% defoliation and apex removal treatments compared to control plants throughout the experiment. In flooded conditions, total biomass and shoot biomass after 50% defoliation, 90% defoliation, and apex removal treatments could return to control plant levels before the end of the experiment. In 90% defoliation and apex removal treatments root to shoot biomass ratios of both drained and flooded plants were initially much higher than in control plants, but the difference disappeared rapidly. The final biomasses decreased with increased defoliation intensity in drained conditions, but no significant difference was generally found in any of the defoliation treatments in flooded conditions. The rapid regrowth of A. philoxeroides plants after defoliation may partly be responsible for its invasion success. However, defoliation capable of removing 90% of the leaf tissue may be desirable in restricting the growth of this invasive species in drained conditions.

Seven isolates were previously identified as the form-genus Rhizoctonia, a polyphyletic group known to form mycorrhizal associations with Orchidaceae. Two other isolates were included in the study: #793 isolated from Chloraea crispa, and #1325 Rhizoctonia solani, isolated from potato. After morphological and molecular characterization of the nine isolates, they were divided into three groups, Ceratobasidium sp., Tulasnella calospora and Thanatephorus cucumeris, to determine the diversity between isolates. Consensus ITS sequences were used for a blast search on the GenBank database, which confirmed the results of the morphological observations. Once the isolates were identified, an in vitro germination test was done with four plates of oatmeal agar inoculated with each fungus, plus an asymbiotic control. The germination stages of the seeds were recorded 30 days after sowing. All isolates obtained from B. fimbriata, and the isolate #793 from Chloraea crispa, promoted seed germination. However, the isolate #1325 Rhizoctonia solani, which is known as both a pathogen and an orchid symbiont, did not promote germination. This shows that B. fimbriata is associated with more than one mycorrhizal fungus in its habitat and has a broader potential specificity in vitro. The results support the hypothesis that at least one fungal isolate promotes the germination of B. fimbriata, permitting the conservation of this species in ex situ conditions.

Since its construction began, from the 15th to the 19th Century, it was successively expanded, altered and transformed according to the styles and needs of the times. Today, it is a prime example of the Valencian Cultural Heritage. To date, there have been very few interventions aimed toward the conservation and maintenance of this building. That is why it was decided to carry out a diagnostic study, involving an analysis of the building's history, architecture, construction and structure; to quantify and assess the extent of damages, as well as to identify possible ways of intervention according to the building's condition. The data-gathering techniques used include, non-destructive tests, digitized planimetric surveys, laboratory analysis of samples, thermal imaging, etc. And the data obtained allows us to conclude that the building's mortar surfaces are in good structural condition. However, the stone material used in its construction, due to its mineral composition and the effect of atmospheric agents, shows serious alterations such as those seen in some elements of the building, especially on its interesting frontispiece.","[Huesca Tortosa, J.

We compared the diversity and composition of the fungal communities colonizing dominant and important forage grasses, Bouteloua gracilis and Sporobolus cryptandrus, inhabiting the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, a semiarid grassland in New Mexico. A third sympatric plant, Yucca glauca (Agavaceae), also was analyzed. ITS rDNA from roots, collected and amplified in 2007, yielded 447 fungal sequences. Sequences obtained from all three species suggest that grasses share a core group of RAF (90% of sequences representing the orders Pleosporales, Agaricales, and Sordariales). Conversely, 57% of the fungal community within Y. glauca was dominated by a different RAF cohort. The two most common OTUs within the grasses are related to Paraphaeospheria sp. and Moniliophthora sp. (91 and 85 of 331 sequences, respectively). These same two species accounted for 58% of isolates in culture-based analysis of the same grass root tissue. The presence of these RAF in several grass species, over several years, and at several sites suggests that grasses in semiarid landscapes share a similar cohort of fungal dominants.

To simulate vegetation responses to drought we conducted, a drought experiment in the Mongolian steppe during a rainy summer growing season. A 30 x 30 m rain shelter excluded natural precipitation during the 2005-growing season, simulating a drought with a return interval of 60-80 years. We examined the effects of the drought on aboveground phytomass (AGP) of each species, total belowground phytomass (BGP), and soil water. The drought drastically reduced AGP and soil water but did not substantially affect BGP. AGP recovered quickly in the late summer of 2006, likely because BGP (which was several times AGP) was not severely damaged by the drought. However, the poorly resilient species did not recover to pre-drought levels, suggesting that the response time scales differed among species. Despite the intense drought, the large root system provided a basis for quick recovery of AGP to pre-drought levels without a shift to a drier equilibrium community. We propose new drought sensitivity and resiliency indices to measure the ecosystem's sustainability and identify species with low sensitivity (i.e., high drought tolerance) that form the baseline of AGP.

Plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been considered a factor increasing plant tolerance to herbivory. However, this positive effect could decrease with colonization density if the benefit : cost ratio of the AMF-plant association changes. We measured plant performance and tolerance to defoliation across a gradient of commercial AMF (Glomus sp.) inoculum concentration. 2. Six genetic families of Datura stramonium were grown under greenhouse conditions and subjected to five increasing levels of AMF inoculum concentration and to defoliation treatments, i.e. the presence/absence of 50% artificial damage, following a full-factorial design. 3. AMF colonization increased linearly with inoculum concentration while foliar area, root mass, flowering phenology and seed production expressed nonlinear functions. Plant genetic variation in the benefit function of AMF colonization was also detected. We show a negative interaction between AMF concentration and plant tolerance to defoliation. 4. Synthesis. The negative correlation between plant tolerance and AMF concentration suggests that defoliation can reduce AMF benefits and that natural variations in AMF can limit the evolution of optimum levels of tolerance. Moreover, genetic variation in the shape of the reaction norms to AMF in the presence/absence of defoliation suggests that plants may evolve in response to variation in densities of AMF and herbivores.","[Garrido, Etzel; Fornoni, Juan] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Strauss, Sharon Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bennett, Alison E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 839, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Garrido, E (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Ap Postal 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",egarrido@ecologia.unam.mx,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085; Garrido, Etzel/0000-0001-8971-9094",PAPIIT INPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT) [200807]; California Agricultural Experiment Station; College of Biological Sciences at UC Davis,"This study was financed by PAPIIT IN 200807 to JF and the California Agricultural Experiment Station and the College of Biological Sciences at UC Davis to SYS.

In relatively fertile ecosystems, such as the tallgrass prairie, local species diversity is largely controlled by the competitive effects of community dominants. Despite the relative importance of soil resources in shaping competitive outcomes, we have a limited understanding of the ways by which plants partition below-ground space and resources while competing, and thus, how these interactions feedback to affect local diversity. 2. We experimentally tested whether potential rooting depth affected plant species diversity and composition by seeding 36 tallgrass prairie species into replicated, bare-ground plots in which soil depth was manipulated to produce shallow- (20 cm), medium- (42 cm) and deep-soil treatments all within one soil type. Because root architecture and foraging strategies differ among species, we hypothesized that soil depth alone could affect plant richness, diversity and community composition. 3. After 3 years, richness (S) significantly increased with soil depth (P < 0.0001), but there was no significant change in species diversity (P > 0.1) or composition (multi-response permutation procedure, P > 0.2). The lack of a depth effect upon diversity resulted from the opposing effect of increasing soil depth enhancing S, but decreasing evenness. 4. Species presence among depth treatments was strongly nested, with species found in shallow soils reflecting a subset of the species found in the medium-depth treatment, and the species found within the medium-depth treatment reflecting a subset of those found in the deepest soils. 5. All depth treatments contained the same dominant grasses, thus differences in S resulted from the nested loss of forbs. Conversely, increasing soil depth added sets of new species, but the specific identity of the species present appeared interchangeable among replicates of a given depth. 6. Synthesis. Our results provide the first field-based experimental evidence that altering soil depth alters species occurrence and diversity in predictable ways in seeded tallgrass prairie. Our results have important theoretical implications for understanding the processes promoting plant co-occurrence in grasslands, and generate testable hypotheses concerning the conditions under which root-niche partitioning is probably important for maintaining local richness in grasslands. Future work is needed to elucidate the generality and mechanistic basis of our results.","[Dornbush, Mathew E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nat & Appl Sci, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA; [Wilsey, Brian J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Dornbush, ME (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nat & Appl Sci, 2420 Nicolet Dr, Green Bay, WI 54311 USA.",dornbusm@uwgb.edu,,"Wilsey, Brian J./0000-0002-0628-5006","Iowa DOT Living Roadway Trust Fund; Department of Natural & Applied Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay; Department of Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology at Iowa State University","This work was funded in part by a grant from the Iowa DOT Living Roadway Trust Fund to B.

Fly ashes obtained from the incineration of biofuel or municipal solid waste were used. A penetration resistance of similar to 1.5 MPa generally prevented root penetration, but roots of P. arundinacea could grow into the surface of layers with similar to 5 MPa penetration resistance. We examined the loosening ability of agents found in root exudates and the mineralogy of rhizosphere ash. The roots increased the weathering of the ash, including dissolution of secondary calcium minerals, possibly related to saccharide exudation.","[Neuschutz, Clara; Greger, Maria] Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bostrom, Dan] Umea Univ, Umea, Sweden","Neuschutz, C (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",neuschutz@botan.su.se,,,,,,36,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-9145,,,J PLANT INTERACT,J.

Virtually all HS in a wide range of soils are bound to mineral colloids, especially short-range ordered (SRO) Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxides because of their large specific surface area, high density of reactive sites, and surface reactivity. Soil mineral-HS complexes may anchor unstable plant constituents by various adsorptive forces and/or chemical binding. Highly degradable proteins, for example, may be protected against rapid biodegradation by their neucleophilic addition to mineralcomplexes. Besides chemical protection, mineral colloids have the ability to interact with biomolecules and microorganisms to form microaggregates. Furthermore, organic substances serve as intraicroaggregate binding agents leading to the formation of macroaggregates through biogenic aggregation processes. The vast majority (90%) of soil organic C (SOC) in surface soil is located within aggregates. Undecomposed biological materials have turnover times in terms of years. Turnover times of occluded SOC increase with decreasing aggregate size. SOC in macroaggregates has turnover times in terms of decades and the turnover times are about centennials for SOC in microaggregates. Tounover times of chemically protected SOC through binding to mineral surfaces usually approach millennia. Therefore, mineral colloids play a vital role in governing the transformation and turnover of soil organic matter and the impact on climate change.","[Huang, Pan Ming] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada","Huang, PM (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-05296-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,13,16,,10.1007/978-3-642-05297-2_4,,,4,Soil Science,Agriculture,BH0UQ,WOS:000396643500004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Johnston, PR",,,,"Johnston, Peter R.",,,Causes and consequences of changes to New Zealand's fungal biota,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Review,,,,,,non-lichenised fungi; phylogeny; biogeography; origins; indigenous; endemic,LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL DNA; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; GEOGRAPHIC SPECIATION; TRICHOSURUS-VULPECULA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PANELLUS-STYPTICUS; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; AMANITA-MUSCARIA,"This paper briefly reviews advances in knowledge of the non-lichenised fungi of New Zealand over the past 25 years. Since 1980, the number of species recorded from New Zealand has doubled, and molecular techniques have revolutionised studies on fungal phylogeny and our understanding of fungal distribution, biology and origins. The origins of New Zealand's fungi are diverse; a few appear to be ancient, whereas many have arrived in geologically more recent times following trans-oceanic dispersal. Some of these more recent arrivals have evolved subsequently to form local endemic species, while others may be part of larger populations maintained through regular, trans-oceanic gene flow. Although questions remain about which fungi truly are indigenous and which are exotic, about one-third of the fungi recorded from New Zealand are likely to have been introduced since human settlement. While most exotic species are confined to human-modified habitats, there are some exceptions. These include species with potential to have significant impacts at the landscape scale. Examples from saprobic, pathogenic, endophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi are used to discuss the factors driving the distribution and dispersal of New Zealand's fungi at both global and local scales, the impact that historical changes to New Zealand's vascular plant and animal biota have had on indigenous fungi, and the broader ecological impact of some of the exotic fungal species that have become naturalised in native habitats. The kinds of fungi present in New Zealand, and the factors driving the distribution and behaviour of those fungi, are constantly changing. These changes have occurred over a wide scale, in both time and space, which means New Zealand's indigenous fungi evolved in response to ecological pressures very different from those found in New Zealand today.","Landcare Res, Auckland 1142, New Zealand","Johnston, PR (reprint author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 92170, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",johnstonp@landcareresearch.co.nz,,,,,,107,15,16,1,16,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

In addition to withstanding drought, plants in coastal habitats often have to withstand highly saline soils, an additional ecological stress. Here we tested whether observed competitive abilities and C-water relations of two interacting shrub species from an arid coastal system were more related to differences in root architecture or salinity tolerance. We explored water sources of interacting Juniperus phoenicea Guss. and Pistacia lentiscus L. plants by conducting physiology measurements, including water relations, CO(2) exchange, photochemical efficiency, sap osmolality, and water and C isotopes. We also conducted parallel soil analyses that included electrical conductivity, humidity, and water isotopes. During drought, Pistacia shrubs relied primarily on permanent salty groundwater, while isolated Juniperus plants took up the scarce and relatively fresh water stored in upper soil layers. As drought progressed further, the physiological activity of Juniperus plants nearly stopped while Pistacia plants were only slightly affected. Juniperus plants growing with Pistacia had stem-water isotopes that matched Pistacia, unlike values for isolated Juniperus plants. This result suggests that Pistacia shrubs supplied water to nearby Juniperus plants through hydraulic lift. This lifted water, however, did not appear to benefit Juniperus plants, as their physiological performance with co-occurring Pistacia plants was poor, including lower water potentials and rates of photosynthesis than isolated plants. Juniperus was more salt sensitive than Pistacia, which withstood salinity levels similar to that of groundwater. Overall, the different abilities of the two species to use salty water appear to drive the outcome of their interaction, resulting in asymmetric competition where Juniperus is negatively affected by Pistacia. Salt also seems to mediate the interaction between the two species, negating the potential positive effects of an additional water source via hydraulic lift.","[Armas, Cristina; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Armas, C (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Gen Segura 1, Almeria 04001, Spain.",cris@eeza.csic.es; fpadilla@eeza.csic.es,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Kulik, Cristina Armas/A-1128-2012; Padilla, Francisco M./C-5204-2009","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Kulik, Cristina Armas/0000-0003-0356-8075; Padilla, Francisco M./0000-0003-1021-0258","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [CGL2004-00090, CGL2007-63718]; Spanish MEC-Fulbright; I3P-CSICConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ESF-SIBAE","We thank the Junta de Andaluci ' a Environmental Agency for permission to work in the Natural Reserve; Will Cook, Jonathan Karr and Antonio Delgado Huertas for help with isotope and ion analyses; Tracey Crocker and Maria Jose ' Jorquera for help with lab determinations and plant care, and Harriet Whitehead for comments on an earlier version.

The objective of this work was to study elevation changes of woody tissue CO(2) efflux and the relationship to climate variation, site characteristics and growth. Furthermore, we aim to provide insights into important respiration-productivity relationships of a little studied tropical vegetation type. We expected R (S) and R (R) to vary with dry and humid season conditions. We further expected R (S) to vary more than R (R) due to a more stable soil than air temperature regime. Seasonal variation in woody tissue CO(2) efflux was indeed mainly attributable to stems. At the same time, temperature played only a small role in triggering variations in R (S). At stand level, the ratio of C release (g C m(-2) ground area year(-1)) between stems and roots varied from 4:1 at 1,050 m to 1:1 at 3,050 m, indicating the increasing prevalence of root activity at high elevations. The fraction of growth respiration from total respiration varied between 10 (3,050 m) and 14% (1,050 m) for stems and between 5 (1,050 m) and 30% (3,050 m) for roots. Our results show that respiratory activity and hence productivity is not driven by low temperatures towards higher elevations in this tropical montane forest. We suggest that future studies should examine the limitation of carbohydrate supply from leaves as a driver for the changes in respiratory activity with elevation.","[Zach, Alexandra; Horna, Viviana; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Zimmermann, Reiner] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Bot, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Zach, A (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",alzac@gmx.de,,,Ministerio del Ambiente Loja-Zamora; Fundacion Cientifica San Francisco (Nature and Culture International); Estacion Cientifica San Francisco; DFG (German Science Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [402],"We thank the Ministerio del Ambiente Loja-Zamora for granting the research permit, and the Fundacion Cientifica San Francisco (Nature and Culture International) for ongoing support at the Estacion Cientifica San Francisco.

ON uptake by mycorrhizal plants is a biochemical process that involves multiple steps, including breakdown and uptake of soil ON by mycorrhizal fungi, internal transformation of ON, and transfer of N to the host plant. We present hypothetical mechanisms controlling each of these steps and outline predictions for how these mechanisms structure patterns of ON uptake by mycorrhizal plants in ecosystems. Using a synthesis of published data, we found that uptake of amino acids by mycorrhizal fungi is related to the relative abundance, N content, and carbon structure of the amino acid. We hypothesize that the bond strength and structural diversity of soil ON controls the breakdown of polymeric ON by mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, the availability of carbon resources for the mycorrhizal fungus influences the capacity for mycorrhizal fungi to assimilate amino acids and produce extracellular enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of polymeric ON.

The aim of this study was to analyze the communities of AMF and bacteria, and their relationship in the rhizosphere of Caragana korshinkii and Hippophae rhamnoides in Zhifanggou watershed. Soil samples were collected from Zhifanggou watershed. The communities of AMF and bacteria were analyzed by using nested PCR of rDNA fragments and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Diversity analysis revealed that the bacterial Shannon diversity index was higher than that of AMF, and the AMF and bacterial Shannon diversity index in the rhizosphere of H. rhamnoides was higher than that of C. korshinkii. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that host plant had a significant influence on the bacterial community structure, but no strict specificity with AMF. Correlation analysis showed that the AMF communities had a significant positive correlation with the bacterial communities, and that indicated a significant effect of AMF on bacteria.","[Tang, Ming; Chen, Hui; Feng, Ye] NW A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haoqiang; Xue, Yaoqin] NW A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhiqiang] NW A&F Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Tang, M (reprint author), NW A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tangm@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30630054, 30730073]; Team in University of China [IRT0748]","We acknowledge the financial support of the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 30630054, 30730073), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of China ( IRT0748).

In the present study, fir (Abies faxoniana) and native herbs from treeline ecotone of east Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (altitude: 3230-3300 m) were exposed to ambient CO2 or ambient +350 mu mol.mol(-1) CO2 concentration in combination with ambient or ambient +2 degrees C air temperature for two years in enclosed-top chambers. The results showed that elevated CO2, elevated temperature and the combination of elevated CO2 and temperature increased biomass, height and diameter of fir compared to the control. Elevated CO2 decreased biomass of Deyeuxia scabrescens, but increased for Fragaria orientalis and Cardamine tangutorum. Except for Fragaria orientalis, herbaceous biomass decreased by elevated temperature. The combination stimulated growth of Fragaria orientalis and Cardamine tangutorum, but suppressed for Deyeuxia scabrescens and Carex kansuensis. The results also demonstrated that elevated CO2 and temperature increased the crown size and altered the morphology of fir, with benefits for resource capture, and did not affect growth of herbs. Larger root to shoot ratio of fir contributed the enhancement of biomass, while negatively influencing the growth of some herbs. This indicates morphological changes of trees may modify their growth responses and species around them to environmental changes. The different effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the growth of species in treeline ecotone suggest that climate change may alter community composition and structure.","[Hou, Ying; Luo, Zukui; Wang, Kaiyun] E China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urbanizat & Ecol Restorat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Jenerette, G.

It grows in sunny places on sandy soils, in abandoned fields, along roadsides and in dry forests and thickets, where it enters into symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The studies on the biology, ecology and cultivation of sandy everlasting have been vigorously pursued since 2003. The aim of this work was assessing the influence of root colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi on the growth and development of H. arenarium cultivated on clayey soil. Two independent experiments (in the pots and in field) were performed. In the first one, under laboratory conditions, the effect of inoculation of soil with arbuscular fungus Glomus intraradices on the biometric features of sandy everlasting seedlings was analyzed. The second experiment was designed to show the association of the root colonisation level with the biometric features of generative shoots grown in an open field. It was demonstrated that sandy clay is an appropriate medium for growing sandy everlasting, enabling a proper development of seedlings and ensuring high inflorescence yield. The amendment of soil with inoculum resulted in a significant decrease in the mass of vegetative and generative shoot parts and made the cultivation more expensive. The inflorescence yield (Inflorescentia Helichrysi) obtained from inoculated plots was lower by 36%.","[Sawilska, Anna Katarzyna; Jendrzejczak, Ewa] Univ Technol & Life Sci, Fac Agr, Dept Bot & Ecol, PL-85789 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Kieliszewska-Rokicka, Barbara] Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Mycol & Mycorrhiza, PL-85093 Bydgoszcz, Poland","Sawilska, AK (reprint author), Univ Technol & Life Sci, Fac Agr, Dept Bot & Ecol, Prof S Kaliskiego 7,Bldg 3-1, PL-85789 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",sawilska@utp.edu.pl,,"SAWILSKA, ANNA/0000-0002-1005-186X",,,,39,1,2,0,9,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

The aim of this work was to identify the most important morphological seedling quality attributes. Nursery stock consisting of 1-year-old bareroot Fraxinus excelsior seedlings was evaluated for field performance at the end of the first growing season on a plantation site in the Po Valley, northern Italy, in relation to the objective of producing high-quality timber plantations. The approach consisted of (1) morphological characterization (i.e. stem height, root collar diameter, shoot and root architecture) of the seedlings before outplanting; (2) morphological assessment (including root excavations) of the plants after the first year of field growth; (3) relating attributes observed during phases (1) and (2); and (4) identifying those morphological characteristics that effectively predict outplanting success. The results indicate that the highest quality seedlings are best selected on the basis of initial shoot height and root system morphological type (i.e. stem heights 40-50 cm with a fasciculate root system of at least 40 cm length and rich in fine roots). Planting these seedling morphological types may dramatically improve field performance (i.e. more than 100% increase of height increment in this case), which will help to promote the development of afforestation plantations oriented towards high-quality wood production.","[Maltoni, Alberto; Mariotti, Barbara; Tani, Andrea] Univ Florence, DEISTAF, IT-50145 Florence, Italy; [Jacobs, Douglass F.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Maltoni, A (reprint author), Univ Florence, DEISTAF, Via San Bonaventura 13, IT-50145 Florence, Italy.",alberto.maltoni@unifi.it,,"Mariotti, Barbara/0000-0003-3779-2104; Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516",,,,35,8,9,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

In order to determine the extent to which conversion of rainforest to native Araucariaceae plantation influences soil fungi, we compared soil fungal communities under native rainforest and 73-74 year-old Araucaria bidwillii, Araucaria cunninghamii and Agathis robusta plantations at Gadgarra State Forest, Queensland, Australia. Following direct extraction of DNA from soil, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions was conducted. Ordination analysis of the T-RFLP data revealed significant separation of the fungal communities according to forest type along the first canonical axis, with the native rainforest samples separating from the three Araucariaceae plantations along the second axis. Overall, the most abundant ITS sequences in clone assemblages from the four forest types were Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Chitridomycota, however their relative importance varied in individual forest types. The results indicate that conversion of tropical rainforest to monoculture plantations of native trees can significantly alter soil fungal diversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi yielded from 0.88 to 564 mu g kg(-1) Au (dry weight) in 79 samples. Saprobic fungi (75 samples) from the same locations yielded significantly higher concentrations: 3-7739 mu g kg(-1) Au (dry weight), with the highest contents in Lycoperdon perlatum. These are the highest recorded concentrations of Au in naturally-occurring fungi/vascular plants. Concentrations of Au in ectomycorrhizae were approximately 4-10 times higher than those in fine roots. It appears that saprobic fungi, namely several terrestrial saprobes of the genera Agaricus and Lycoperdon, are more efficient than ectomycorrhizal fungi at taking up Au, probably assisted by other microbiota and/or by a range of naturally-occurring compounds that have yet to be identified. The present data demonstrate that macrofungi are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of Au. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since legumes spend up to 4-16% of photosynthesis on each of the rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbioses, it might be expected that positive responses in yield due to rhizobial and AM symbioses are accompanied by decreases in seed protein and lipid mass fractions due to a photosynthate (C) limitation. We performed a meta-analysis of 348 data points from published studies with 12 legume species to test whether yield, harvest index, and seed protein and lipid mass fractions are affected by symbioses. There was a significant increase in yield due to rhizobial inoculation (16% in the field; 59% in pot experiments). There were no responses of yield to AM fungi and rhizobial + AM fungi inoculations in the field (presumably because an AM fungi-free control cannot be ensured), but significant responses in pots (45% with AM fungi; 44% with rhizobial + AM fungi). Rhizobial inoculation improved seed protein mass fraction by 7% in the field; AM fungi increased this parameter by 14% in pots. There were no discernable effects of symbioses on seed lipid mass fraction. Rhizobial symbioses in the field increased harvest index (+5%), but AM fungi did not affect harvest index. In conclusion, increases in yield due to symbioses also resulted in increases in seed protein and constant lipid mass fractions, indicating that legumes are not C-limited under symbiotic conditions.

Within the European Union, policy makers are working on legislation for soil protection and management. Therefore, indicators are needed to monitor the status of the soils and these indicators reflecting the soil quality, can be integrated in working standards or soil quality metrics. Soil micro-organisms, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMP), are indicative of soil changes. These soil fungi live in symbiosis with the great majority of plants and are sensitive to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the soil. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AMF are reliable and sensitive indicators for disturbances in the soils and can be used for the development of soil quality metrics. Also, it was studied whether soil quality metrics based on AMF meet requirements to applicability by users and policy makers. Ecological criterions were set for the development of soil quality metrics for different soils. Multiple root samples containing AMF from various locations in The Netherlands were analyzed. The results of the analyses were related to the defined criterions. This resulted in two soil quality metrics, one for sandy soils and a second one for clay soils, with six different categories ranging from very bad to very good. These soil quality metrics meet the majority of requirements for applicability and are potentially useful for the development of legislations for the protection of soil quality.","Eelerwoude, NL-7470 AB Goor, Netherlands","Baar, J (reprint author), Eelerwoude, Postbus 53, NL-7470 AB Goor, Netherlands.",jbaar@eelerwoude.nl,,,Triple E,I am thankful to Screenfungi for providing the data of the mycorrhizal analyses obtained from 2007 to 2009.

The occurrence of AM fungi associated with sand dune plant species in three Mediterranean locations on the north-eastern coast of Spain was examined in one well preserved coastal sand dune and in two embrionary dunes recently protected from public access. Traditional taxonomy and molecular techniques were used to identify the AM fungal species present in these ecosystems. The species identified and isolated were: Scutellospora persica (Koske and Walker) Walker & Sanders, Glomus ambisporum Smith & Schenck, Glomus diaphanum Morton & Walker, Glomus clarum Nicolson & Schenck, Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, Glomus microaggregatum Koske, Gemma & Olexia and Gigaspora margarita Becker & Hall. Spores of Glomus were the most abundant in the direct soil extraction samples. The molecular analysis indicates that the most abundant fungi forming AM in the roots belonged to the Gigasporaceae group followed by fungi of Glomus group A and Glomus group B. The highest diversity of fungi and abundance of the AM fungal spores was found in the well preserved and undisturbed dune systems.","[Camprubi, A.; Calvet, C.; Cabot, P.; Pitet, M.; Estaun, V.] IRTA, Cabrils 08348, Barcelona, Spain","Camprubi, A (reprint author), IRTA, Ctra Cabrils,Km 2, Cabrils 08348, Barcelona, Spain.",amelia.camprubi@irta.es,"Camprubi, Amelia/J-8520-2017; Calvet, Cinta/F-1586-2017","Camprubi, Amelia/0000-0002-3385-8121; Calvet, Cinta/0000-0002-5685-019X",FEDEREuropean Union (EU); Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA)Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [RTA2007-00039],"Authors want to acknowledge the contribution of Enric Sancho (Cultidelta S.L., Tarragona), Sergi Ferrer (Urbaser) and the financial support given by FEDER and by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA), project RTA2007-00039.",,26,11,13,1,7,SPANISH NATL INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD RESEARCH & TECHNOLO,MADRID,"AUTOPISTA A-6, KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",1695-971X,,,SPAN J AGRIC RES,Span.

Its control is difficult because it can survive in field soil for several years. The application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as bioprotector agents against V dahliae is an alternative to the use of chemicals which, in addition, is more respectful with the environment. The establishment of the mutualistic association of plant roots and AMF involves a continuous cellular and molecular dialogue between both symbionts that includes the preactivation of plant defense responses that may enhance the resistance or tolerance of mycorrhizal plants to soil-borne pathogens. Some AMF can improve the resistance of Capsicum annuum L. against V dahliae. This is especially relevant for pepper cultivars (i.e. cv. Piquillo) that exhibit high susceptibility to this pathogen. Compared with non-mycorrhizal plants, mycorrhizal pepper can exhibit more balanced antioxidant metabolism in leaves along the first month after pathogen inoculation, which may contribute to delay both the development of disease symptoms and the decrease of photosynthesis in Verticillium-inoculated plants with the subsequent benefit for yield. In stems, mycorrhizal pepper show earlier and higher deposition of lignin in xylem vessels than non-mycorrhizal plants, even in absence of the pathogen. Moreover, AMF can induce new isoforms of acidic chitinases and superoxide dismutase in roots. Mycorrhizal-specific induction of these enzymatic activities together with enhanced peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in roots may also be involved in the bioprotection of Verticillium-induced wilt in pepper by AMF.","[Goicoechea, N.; Garmendia, I.; Sanchez-Diaz, M.; Aguirreolea, J.] Univ Navarra, Dept Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal, Unidad Asociada,CSIC,Fac Ciencias & Farm, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Goicoechea, N.; Garmendia, I.; Sanchez-Diaz, M.; Aguirreolea, J.] Univ Navarra, Dept Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal, Unidad Asociada,EEAD,Fac Ciencias & Farm, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Goicoechea, N.; Garmendia, I.; Sanchez-Diaz, M.; Aguirreolea, J.] Univ Navarra, Dept Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal, Unidad Asociada,ICVV,Fac Ciencias & Farm, Pamplona 31008, Spain","Goicoechea, N (reprint author), Univ Navarra, Dept Biol Vegetal, Secc Biol Vegetal, Unidad Asociada,CSIC,Fac Ciencias & Farm, Pamplona 31008, Spain.",niegoi@unav.es,"Goicoechea, Nieves/K-7847-2014; Sanchez-Diaz, Manuel/L-8181-2014; Garmendia, Idoia/H-5256-2015; Aguirreolea, Jone/L-8131-2014","Goicoechea, Nieves/0000-0003-0550-4366; Sanchez-Diaz, Manuel/0000-0003-3581-2108; ",Fundacion Universitaria de Navarra (FUNA); Gobierno VascoBasque Government,"The authors wish to thank Fundacion Universitaria de Navarra (FUNA, PIUNA) and Gobierno Vasco for supporting the work.

The positive effects of this type of symbiosis on plant's performance are well known and established. However, relatively little is known about how AM symbiosis affects plant reproduction, even though reproduction is probably the most important component of life history. This review begins with a summary of the existing data on plants with monomorphic breeding systems, as most of the research has been performed using hermaphroditic and monoecious plants. Later, the limited number of studies examining mycorrhizal effects on plants with dimorphic breeding systems is detailed. Finally, several key areas for future investigations are highlighted. These include examination of the incidence of sex-specific interactions in other plant species with dimorphic systems, the influence of AM symbiosis in seed germination and establishment in plants with different gender, or the study of the mechanisms behind the AM effects seen on plant reproduction. Evidence suggests that AM symbioses are beneficial for plants with monomorphic and dimorphic breeding systems, as AM symbioses improve both sexual and asexual reproduction. However, the effects observed strongly depend on both the plant and the AM fungus species involved. Plant interactions with AM fungi and the outcome of these interactions may further depend on the gender of the host: sex-specific patterns of root colonization and sex-specific benefits from AM symbioses have been reported in several plant species. However, the incidence and the importance of sex-specific relationships between AM fungi and plants are still largely unexplored.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Varga, S (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",sandra.varga@jyu.fi,"Varga, Sandra/B-6044-2012","Varga, Sandra/0000-0001-9799-714X",Suomen KulttuurirahastoFinnish Cultural Foundation,"I am grateful to COST Action 870 for the opportunity to write this review.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seeds were inoculated with these strains and grown in pots containing sterile sand under different levels of NaCl (0, 50, and 100 mM) in a controlled plant growth cabinet. Dry weights of root and shoot, root-to-shoot ratio (RSR), number and dry weights of nodules, chlorophyll and N content of the plant, and amounts of total and fixed N decreased progressively with increasing salinity levels. In both non-saline and saline (50 and 100 mM NaCl) conditions, inoculations with Rhizobium leguminosarum by. ciceri strains isolated from wild chickpeas significantly increased all the above parameters compared-with the uninoculated control treatment, equal to or higher than standard culture and N application. However, chickpea rhizobia exhibited diversity in their salt tolerance. The plants inoculated with DN7, TN4, and standard culture produced more shoot mass, nodule dry weight, total N, and fixed N under saline conditions, especially at 50 mM NaCl, than the plants inoculated with DN1 and TN3. These results indicated that the ability of chickpea to grow and survive in saline conditions improved when it was inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum by. ciceri strains isolated from wild chickpeas, especially DN7 and TN4.","[Elkoca, Erdal] Ataturk Univ, Dept Agron, Fac Agr, TR-25240 Erzurum, Turkey; [Ogutcu, Hatice] Ahi Evran Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci & Arts, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey; [Kasimoglu, Caner] Mecidiye Anatolian High Sch, Erzurum, Turkey","Elkoca, E (reprint author), Ataturk Univ, Dept Agron, Fac Agr, TR-25240 Erzurum, Turkey.",eelkoca@atauni.edu.tr,,,,,,50,9,11,0,14,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

The growth-inhibitory effect of allelopathy in asparagus decline field soil was confirmed by bioassay. Ten weeks after AM fungal inoculation growth of control asparagus seedlings was enhanced in CR and AC-added decline soil plots compared with healthy and non-added decline soil. Gi colonization level in the root system was comparatively higher than Gm. Moreover, maximum dry weight of shoots and roots were observed, in addition of CR with Gi-inoculated commercial soil plot, which was also more effective than AC with Gi-inoculated decline and commercial soil plots. These results reveal that allelopathy tolerance appeared in AM fungal inoculated asparagus plants by addition of coffee residue or activated charcoal, though the effect differed between the soil amendments. In violet root rot study, symptom of violet root rot appeared in all the treatments 12 weeks after H. mompa inoculation and the severity of the incidence was less in AM fungal inoculated asparagus plants than non-inoculated plants. Cultivar difference ('Welcome' and 'Mary Washington 500W') was also observed and the disease indices revealed that the incidence was remarkably low in Gi-inoculated 'Welcome' than 'Mary Washington 500W'. These results suggest that tolerance to violet root rot appeared in mycorrhizal plants, though the tolerance level differed with the cultivars.","[Nahiyan, A. S.

Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L., 'Welcome') plants inoculated with 4 AMF species were raised in decline field soil containing allelochemicals determined by bioassay and in commercial substrate. Ten weeks after AMF inoculation, conidial suspensions of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi (Foa) and Fusarium proliferatum (Fp) were inoculated to mycorrhizal plants. Dry weight of shoots and roots increased in AMF plants of both the decline soil and substrate 10 weeks after AMF inoculation, regardless of the species. Thus, plant growth promotion via symbiosis and allelopathy tolerance appeared in mycorrhizal asparagus plants. On the other hand, contents of polyphenol and ascorbic acid showed higher values in most of the AMF plants than in non-AMF plants; the effect depends on plant portions. As for disease tolerance, incidence and severity of both Foa and Fp were lower in AMF plants than in non-AMF plants, though the effect differed according to AMF species with Glomus intraradices being most effective. From these findings, it is suggested that plant growth promotion through AMF is effective for inducing tolerance to allelopathy and Fusarium diseases in asparagus plants, and contents of antioxidative substances are stimulated by the symbiosis.","[Matsubara, Y.; Okada, T.; Nahiyan, A.

This contribution summarises the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and dark-septate endophytes (DSE) in different habitats of the intermittent Lake Cerknica. Mycorrhizal colonisation of wetland plants from the following wetland habitats was analysed: (1) frequently inundated small depressions in the lakebed colonised by amphibious plants; (2) P. australis stands covering large parts of the lake area; and (3) wet meadows surrounding the lake area colonised by different Schoenus species. All of the examined amphibious species were found to be mycorrhizal, however terrestrial shoots were more mycorrhizal than aquatic shoots. In the former mycorrhizal frequency F% was up to 100% and mycorrhizal intensity M% up to 67%, while F% was up to 80% and M% up to 16% in the latter. Mycorrhizal colonisation of P australis with AM and DSE fungi was confirmed in plants growing in different soils and water regimes (17% < F% < 50%; 0.6% < M% < 3%). In the two Schoenus species, F% was up to 99% and M% was up to 14%. According to the literature this is the first detailed report on the presence of AM and DSE mycorrhiza in S. ferrugineus and S. nigricans.","[Dolinar, Natasa; Sraj, Nina; Pongrac, Paula; Regvar, Marjana; Gaberscik, Alenka] Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Gaberscik, A (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Dept Biol, Biotech Fac, Vecna Pot 111, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",alenka.gaberscik@bf.uni-lj.si,"Pongrac, Paula/H-2143-2016","Pongrac, Paula/0000-0003-0721-7555",,,,35,3,3,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-90-481-9585-5,,,,2010,,,,,,,299,308,,10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5_22,10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5,,10,"Ecology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Engineering,BFW50,WOS:000321676000022,,,,,10/31/19J,"Song, A; Li, ZJ; Zhang, J; Xue, GF; Fan, FL; Liang, YC",,,,"Song, Alin; Li, Zhaojun; Zhang, Jie; Xue, Gaofeng; Fan, Fenliang; Liang, Yongchao",,,Silicon-enhanced resistance to cadmium toxicity in Brassica chinensis L. is attributed to Si-suppressed cadmium uptake and transport and Si-enhanced antioxidant defense capacity,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antioxidant enzymes; Cadmium; Non-enzymatic antioxidants; Pakchoi; Silicon,SALT-STRESSED BARLEY; HORDEUM-VULGARE L.; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EXOGENOUS SILICON; CUCUMIS-SATIVUS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; MEDIATED ALLEVIATION; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; ABIOTIC STRESSES,"A series of hydroponics experiments were performed to investigate roles of silicon (Si) in enhancing cadmium (Cd) tolerance in two pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.) cultivars: i.e. cv. Shanghaiqing, a Cd-sensitive cultivar. and cv. Hangyoudong, a Cd-tolerant cultivar. Plants were grown under 0.5 and 5 mg Cd L-1 Cd stress without or with 1.5 mM Si. Plant growth of the Cd-tolerant cultivar was stimulated at the lower Cd level, but was decreased at the higher Cd level when plants were treated with Cd for one week. However, Plant growth was severely inhibited at both Cd levels as stress duration lasted for up to three weeks. Plant growth of the Cd-sensitive cultivar was severely inhibited at both Cd levels irrespective of Cd stress duration. Addition of Si increased shoot and root biomass of both cultivars at both Cd levels and decreased Cd uptake and root-to-shoot transport. Superoxide dismutase,catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities decreased, but malondialdehyde and H2O2 concentrations increased at the higher Cd level, which were counteracted by Si added. Ascorbic acid, glutathione and non-protein thiols concentrations increased at the higher Cd level, which were further intensified by addition of Si. The effects of Si and Cd on the antioxidant enzyme activity were further verified by isoenzyme analysis. Silicon was more effective in enhancing Cd tolerance in the Cd-tolerant cultivar than in the Cd-sensitive cultivar. It can be concluded that Si-enhanced Cd tolerance in B. chinensis is attributed mainly to Si-suppressed Cd uptake and root-to-shoot Cd transport and Si-enhanced antioxidant defense activity.

Although the evolution of traits in macro-organisms is well studied, relatively little is known about character evolution in micro-organisms. Here, we surveyed an ancient and ecologically important group of microbial plant symbionts, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and tested hypotheses about the evolution of functional and life-history traits. Variation in the extent of root and soil colonization by AM fungi is constrained to a few nodes basal to the most diverse groups within the phylum, with relatively little variation associated with recent divergences. We found no evidence for a trade-off in biomass allocated to root versus soil colonization in three published glasshouse experiments; rather these traits were positively correlated. Partial support was observed for correlated evolution between fungal colonization strategies and functional benefits of the symbiosis to host plants. The evolution of increased soil colonization was positively correlated with total plant biomass and shoot phosphorus content. Although the effect of AM fungi on infection by root pathogens was phylogenetically conserved, there was no evidence for correlated evolution between the extent of AM fungal root colonization and pathogen infection. Variability in colonization strategies evolved early in the diversification of AM fungi, and we propose that these strategies were influenced by functional interactions with host plants, resulting in an evolutionary stasis resembling trait conservatism.","[Powell, Jeff R.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Okol Pflanzen, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Parrent, Jeri L.; Hart, Miranda M.; Klironomos, John N.; Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 1A1, Canada","Powell, JR (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Okol Pflanzen, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jeffpowell2@gmail.com,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Powell, Jeff/A-5076-2010; Hart, Miranda/D-1562-2011","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Powell, Jeff/0000-0003-1091-2452; ",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,This work was supported by funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

Seedlings were cultivated on inert sand for 20 days under NaCl treatments (0, 100, 200, 400 mm NaCl). Plant response to salinity was provenance- and salt-dependent. At 100 mm NaCl, growth parameters (leaf biomass, area, number per plant and relative growth rate) were improved in plants from Jerba (originating from arid bioclimatic stage) compared with the control, while growth was reduced in those from Tabarka (from humid area). High salt levels (400 mm NaCl) decreased the plant growth in the three provenances, but plants in Tabarka were the most salt sensitive. The relative salt tolerance of plants from Jerba and Bekalta provenances was associated with low levels of malondialdehyde as well as of electrolyte leakage and endoproteolytic activity. Salt reduced leaf hydration, the decrease in water content being dose-dependent and more pronounced in Tabarka. Increase in salinity led to significant increase in leaf succulence and decrease in leaf water potential, especially in Jerba plants. The plants from the latter displayed the highest leaf levels of Na+ and Cl-, proline, soluble carbohydrates, soluble proteins, and polyphenols. Overall, the higher salt tolerance of plants from Jerba provenance, and to a lower extent of those from Bekalta, may be partly related to their better capacity for osmotic adjustment and to limit oxidative damage when salt-challenged.","[Wided, Megdiche; Nader, Ben Amor; Ahmed, Debez; Kamel, Hessini; Riadh, Ksouri; Chedly, Abdelly] Ctr Biotechnol Technopole Borj Cedria CBBC, Lab Adaptat Plantes Str Abiot, Hammam Lif 2050, Tunisia; [Ahmed, Debez] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Bot, D-30419 Hannover, Germany","Riadh, K (reprint author), Ctr Biotechnol Technopole Borj Cedria CBBC, Lab Adaptat Plantes Str Abiot, BP 901, Hammam Lif 2050, Tunisia.",physiologiste@yahoo.com,"Debez, Ahmed/AAB-4020-2019","Debez, Ahmed/0000-0002-6786-7544","Tunisian-French 'Comite Mixte de Cooperation Universitaire' (CMCU) [02FO924]; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology [LR02CB02]","This work was supported by the Tunisian-French 'Comite Mixte de Cooperation Universitaire' (CMCU) network # 02FO924 and by the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology (LR02CB02).",,44,4,4,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

However, effective use of soil microbes in revegetation requires knowledge of how microbe communities vary along environmental stress gradients, as well as how such variation relates to symbiont effectiveness. In Australia, shrubby legumes dominate many ecosystems where dryland salinity is a major issue, and improving plant establishment in saline soils is a priority of regional management agencies. In this study, strains of rhizobial bacteria were isolated from a range of Acacia spp. growing in saline and non-saline soils. Replicates of each strain were grown under several salinity levels in liquid culture and characterized for growth and salt tolerance. Genetic characterization of rhizobia showed considerable variation among strains, with salt tolerance and growth generally higher in rhizobial populations derived from more saline soils. These strains showed markedly different genetic profiles and generic affiliations to those from more temperate soils, suggesting community differentiation in relation to salt stress. The identification of novel genomic species from saline soils suggests that the diversity of rhizobia associated with Australian Acacia spp. is significantly greater than previously described. Overall, the ability of some symbiotically effective strains to tolerate high salinity is promising with regard to improving host plant re-establishment in these soils.","[Thrall, Peter H.; Broadhurst, Linda M.; Hoque, Mohamed S.; Bagnall, David J.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Thrall, PH (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",peter.thrall@csiro.au,"Broadhurst, Linda/J-6907-2012","Broadhurst, Linda/0000-0002-9853-3328",National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality [202749],"This work was supported by the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (project #202749).

We labeled sapling stands of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) with (CO2)-C-13 in four 3 in diameter chambers during a 3 week interval in September 2006 and traced the movement of this C-13 pulse through trees and soil during autumn and spring. High enrichment of C-13 in foliage was achieved (delta C-13 = 387 parts per thousand +/- 16 parts per thousand). Late-season photosynthate was strongly mobilized during leaf senescence and stored in twigs, wood, and roots. Very high C-13 enrichment of Soil CO2 emissions at this time (delta C-13 = 766 parts per thousand +/- 82 parts per thousand) indicated the role of late-season photosynthesis in supplying root metabolism after the growing season. Rhizosphere soil was weakly enriched in C-13 during fall, and increased significantly over the winter. Earthworms were highly enriched in fall, indicating that they consumed roots. In spring, C-13 was strongly mobilized to growing shoots but not to growing fine roots; apparently, fine root growth in spring was not supplied by late-season stored photosynthate. These results provide insights into the seasonal dynamics of temperate tree carbon allocation with implications for disruption of these dynamics by global warming.","[Horowitz, Michael E.; Fahey, Timothy J.; Yavitt, Joseph B.; Sherman, Ruth E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Feldpausch, Ted R.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Fahey, TJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjf5@cornell.edu,"Feldpausch, Ted/D-3436-2009","Feldpausch, Ted/0000-0002-6631-7962",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation - Ecosystem Studies Program.

We surveyed 64 forest stands across four fires that burned 41,000 ha (35%) of the Metolius Watershed in 2002 and 2003, stratifying the landscape by burn severity (overstory tree mortality), forest type (ponderosa pine [PP] and mixed-conifer [MC]), and prefire biomass. Stand-scale C combustion ranged from 13 to 35% of prefire aboveground C pools (area - weighted mean = 22%). Across the sampled landscape, total estimated pyrogenic C emissions were equivalent to 2.5% of statewide anthropogenic CO(2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes for the same 2-year period. From low- to moderate- to high-severity ponderosa pine stands, average tree basal area mortality was 14, 49, and 100%, with parallel patterns in mixed-conifer stands (29, 58, 96%). Despite this decline in live aboveground C, total net primary productivity (NPP) was only 40% lower in high- versus low-severity stands, suggesting strong compensatory effects of non-tree vegetation on C uptake. Dead wood respiratory losses were small relative to total NPP (range: 10-35%), reflecting decomposition lags in this seasonally arid system. Although soil C, soil respiration, and fine root NPP were conserved across severity classes, net ecosystem production (NEP) declined with increasing severity, driven by trends in aboveground NPP. The high variability of C responses across this study underscores the need to account for landscape patterns of burn severity, particularly in regions such as the Pacific Northwest, where non-stand-replacement fire represents a large proportion of annual burned area.","[Meigs, Garrett W.; Campbell, John L.; Martin, Jonathan G.; Law, Beverly E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Donato, Daniel C.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific SW Res Stn, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Meigs, GW (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",gmeigs@gmail.com,"Martin, Jonathan/G-4558-2010; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Meigs, Garrett/0000-0001-5942-691X","U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-06ER64318]; College of Forestry, Oregon State University","This research was supported by the Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy, Grant No. DE-FG02-06ER64318 and the College of Forestry, Oregon State University.

We hypothesized that texture might be especially important to SOM accumulation in young alluvial soils. We combined the soil component of the CENTURY ecosystem model, which uses sand, silt, and clay concentration as primary variables, with a simple simulation model of fluvial deposition, and forest production to predict changes in soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during primary succession on floodplains and terraces of the Queets River, Washington. Simulated soil C accumulated to a plateau of about 4000 g m(-2) at 110 years, closely matching observed patterns in an empirical chronosequence. Although direct fluvial OM deposition had only a small and short-lived influence on soil C, fluvial silt and clay deposition were an important influence on equilibrium C. The model underestimated soil N by about 35%, which appears to be due to failure of the model to account for N enrichment of an OM pool after its initial formation. These results suggest that basic influences on SOM retention in these young soils are not functionally different than those that apply to upland soils, but occur within highly dynamic physical contexts. Overbank deposition of silt and clay establishes a basic capacity for SOM retention. SOM, in turn, facilitates N retention. In this way, silt and clay are instrumental in propagating N forward from N-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra) stands to mature conifer forests that are frequently N-limited.","[Bechtold, J.

In this study, we examined variations of shoot and root biomass, standing and surface litter, soil respiration, and soil C content along a natural precipitation gradient from 430 to 1200 mm in the southern Great Plains, USA. Our results show that shoot biomass and soil respiration increased linearly with mean annual precipitation (MAP), whereas root biomass and soil C content remained relatively constant along the precipitation gradient. Consequently, the root/shoot ratio linearly decreased with MAP. However, patterns of standing, surface, and total litter mass followed quadratic relationships with MAP along the gradient, likely resulting from counterbalance between litter production and decomposition. Those linear/quadratic equations describing variations of ecosystem C processes with precipitation could be useful for model development, parameterization, and validation at landscape and regional scales to improve predictions of C dynamics in grasslands in response to climate change. Our results indicated that precipitation is an important driver in shaping ecosystem functioning as reflected in vegetation production, litter mass, and soil respiration in grassland ecosystems.","[Zhou, Xuhui; Talley, Melissa; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Zhou, XH (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",zxuhui14@ou.edu,"Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011; Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019","Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901","US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0078325, DEB 0444518]; Terrestrial Carbon Program at the Office of Science; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64317]","The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

While trans-CA is an autotoxin in cucumber root exudates, figleaf gourd is resistant to it. Cucumber, however, had a high rate of trans-CA uptake by the roots, leading to reduced root growth. The trans-CA treatment also resulted in an intracellular release of Ca2+ from the vacuole to the cytoplasm, and, thus, an increased [Ca2+](cyt) level accompanied by gradual loss of cell viability in cucumber roots. Taken together, these results suggest that [Ca2+](cyt) homeostatic disturbance is one of the primary triggers for trans-CA phytotoxicity in cucumber.","[Yu, Jingquan] Agr Minist China, Key Lab Hort Plants Growth Dev & Biotechnol, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jingquan; Sun, Yao; Zhang, Yun; Ding, Ju; Xia, Xiaojian; Xiao, Chunlan; Shi, Kai; Zhou, Yanhong] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Hort, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Yu, JQ (reprint author), Agr Minist China, Key Lab Hort Plants Growth Dev & Biotechnol, Kaixuan Rd 268, Hangzhou 310029, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jqyu@zju.edu.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB119000]; National Key Technology R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2008BADA6B02],We are grateful for the assistance of Dr. Hong J and Dr. Chen J in confocal and transmission electron microscopy.

Cenococcum geophilum, members of the families Clavulinaceae, Russulaceae, or Thelephoraceae or the genus Trichophaea, were indicated to be fungi forming P. thunbergii ectomycorrhizas. Among them, C. geophilum and Clavulinaceae sp. 1 were the most or second most dominant species. A species accumulation curve based on the number of samples nearly reached a plateau, with observed species richness equal to 11 species and the Jackknife2 and Chao2 richness estimators indicating 14 and 12 species, respectively. In addition, Simpson's 1/D was 3.89 and Shannon-Wiener's H' was 1.71, indicating a relatively low taxonomic diversity. There was no significant difference in the ectomycorrhizal formation rate, or the occurrence frequency and the number of ECM phylotypes between current-year and older seedlings.

The root tip cells of the 12 accessions contained 24 chromosomes followed by 64, 44 and 20 chromosomes in 9, 6 and 2 accessions, respectively. Barring C. lanatus, the accessions within each taxon had the same zygotic number. The present results strongly support the view that the wild C palaestinus (2n = 24) and the cultivated C tinctorius (2n = 24) are closely related. With few exceptions, all DNA based dendrograms support three lineages within the genus. One lineage is constituted by C. arborescens (2n = 24) alone. The present data indicates that because of unique composition of its nuclear genome vis-A-vis other Carthamus taxa, C. arborescens should be placed in a separate subgenus. The two remaining lineages, constituted by the taxa with 2n = 24, and the taxa with 2n = 20, 2n = 44 and 2n = 64, respectively should be given the rank of two taxonomic sections in the other subgenus. The present study also demonstrates that none of the present taxa with 2n = 24 have contributed to the origin of polyploid taxa. Carthamus boisserii (2n = 20) and C. glaucus ssp. anatolicus (2n = 20) are more likely to be one of the diploid progenitor of C lanatus ssp. creticus (2n = 64), C lanatus (2n = 44), C lanatus ssp. lanatus (2n = 44) and C lanatus ssp. montanus (2n = 44), and C lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n = 64), respectively. Within Lanatus species complex, constituted by C lanatus, C lanatus ssp. lanatus, C lanatus ssp. montanus, C lanatus ssp. turkestanicus and C lanatus ssp. creticus, high proportion of autapomorphic characters and low number of synapomorphies in the ITS and ETS sequences suggest a relatively recent diversification of the taxa within the species complex. Carthamus lanatus ssp. creticus (2n = 64) and C lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n = 64) within the complex deserve species rank.

A brief survey of the period before the arrival of electronic searches became available provides access to the classical literature that can help interpret today's challenges. Classical (acid hydrolysis) and modern spectrometry and spectroscopy techniques indicate that protein N is the prevalent component of organic N in soil. The presence of heterocyclic N can indicate its abiotic, partial synthesis as in fire-affected soils. Clays and pedogenic oxides can protect organic N against microbial degradation. The evidence for such protection is mostly based on in vitro studies involving pure clays, and proteins and their relevance to field conditions requires further work. The proteomic approach, with extraction and characterization of proteins stabilised by soil colloids (structural proteomics) might give further insights into this area. Functional proteomics can improve our understanding of the degradation of organic pollutants and organic debris as well as identifying the molecular colloquia between microorganisms and between soil biota and plant roots. Subdivision of organic N into sub-pools has helped to interpret mechanistic studies and modelling of N dynamics. Uncomplexed organic matter, obtained by physical fractionation procedures, is considered a labile pool. The interpretation of N mineralization measurements is affected by immobilization during microbial attack especially in high-C environments. Transfer of materials among particle size fractions and changes in microbiological properties of aggregates also can occur during fractionation procedures. Classical mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) does not always occur since microorganisms (and plants) can take up amino acid N with intracellular deamination. Protozoa, due to their grazing activities, can influence not only N mineralization but also the composition of rhizosphere-plant growth stimulating communities. Differences between N-poor and N-rich microsites, occurring in the same soil, can markedly affect the competition for N between plants and microorganisms especially the nitrifiers. The use of molecular techniques has allowed the identification of unculturable microorganisms and functional genes in the N cycle. Archeae are probably capable of oxidising NH(4)(+) to NO(3)(-) and anerobic ammonia oxidation (Ammonox) bacteria have been identified in biofilms and probably also occur in soils. The use of nitrate as an electron acceptor is encoded by specific gene clusters but nitrate reduction also occurs in dissimilatory nitrate reduction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the effects of different factors on soil communities have been usually restricted to responses to litter, despite the fact that litter and mineral soil layers are connected. Therefore, whether organisms using the litter layer respond to the same biotic and abiotic factors as organisms using the mineral soil still remains poorly known. We hypothesize that the role of biotic and abiotic factors as determinants of the distribution of faunal components of soil communities differ between litter and mineral soil assemblages in arid systems and that both levels are connected by animals moving across both levels. During two years, macroinvertebrates were sampled in litter and soil at an arid region of SE Spain, and different biotic and abiotic factors were measured. We performed structural equation model analysis to uncover the factors related to macrofaunal distribution. Our results show that abiotic factors, litter production and litter and root quality, as well as relationships among different trophic groups were key factors affecting faunal densities in our system. While abundance variations in litter assemblages were principally related to temperature and moisture, belowground faunal densities responded to resource factors. Despite differences in structuring factors at both levels, faunal interactions link both assemblages across the litter-belowground interface. The results highlight three important issues to understand soil communities and food web structure. First, abiotic factors structure soil macrofaunal food webs directly and indirectly, because of the effect of litter as habitat, and not only as food. Second, overlooking the differences found between above and belowground regulation may cause problems in the interpretation of food web structure and dynamics. Third, our models also suggest that both litter and belowground assemblages are dynamically connected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, livestock rearing is the main economic activity and is suspect of the low performance of P. australis trees through direct and indirect effects which could include the reduction in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their benefit to trees. To elucidate the role of AMF, we compare plant performance indicators, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization and AMF communities in 20 trees distributed in two areas of central Argentina which differed in livestock grazing intensity. The area with high livestock density presented more soil degradation and trees with a lower overall plant performance than the area with reduced livestock density. The AM colonization values of P. australis were considerably higher than reported for other tree species and the area with high livestock density had a lower proportion of arbuscules and higher proportion of hyphae, while vesicles and AM colonization - all structure considered together - did not differ between areas. Overall AMF spore number and of most species when considered separately was significantly higher in the area with high livestock density, suggesting a high tolerance and adaptation of AMF to livestock. We conclude that a reduction in livestock improves the performance of P. australis, that this improvement could be mediated by an increase in the proportion of arbuscules, but there does not appear to be any limitation in AM colonization or AMF spore number which could otherwise be limiting forest restoration.

Stands were six-years-old at the beginning of the study and were subjected to irrigation (no irrigation versus irrigation) and fertilization (no fertilization versus fertilization) treatments since planting. Soil respiration ranged from 2 to 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and was strongly and linearly related to soil temperature. Soil moisture and C inputs to the soil (coarse woody debris and litter mass) which may influence R-H were significantly but only weakly related to R-S. No interaction effects between irrigation and fertilization were observed for R-S and microbial variables. Irrigation increased R-S, fine root mass and microbial biomass C. In contrast, fertilization increased R-H, microbial biomass C and microbial activity but reduced fine root biomass and had no influence on R-S. Predicted annual soil C efflux ranged from 8.8 to 10.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and was lower than net primary productivity (NPP) in all stands except the non-fertilized treatment. The influence of forest management on R-S was small or insignificant relative to biomass accumulation suggesting that NPP controls the transition between a carbon source and sink in rapidly growing pine systems.

To better understand duff fire-caused mortality, we investigated tree stress and radial growth following experimental fires in a long-unburned forest on deep sands in northern Florida, USA. We burned basal fuels surrounding 80 mature Pinus palustris Mill. in a randomized experiment comparing the effects of basal burning treatments on stem vascular meristems; surficial roots; root and stem combinations; and a non-smoldering control. We examined the effects of duration of lethal temperatures (>60 degrees C) on subsequent pine radial growth and root non-structural carbohydrates (starch and sugar). Duff and mineral soil temperatures in the experimental fires consistently exceeded 60 degrees C for over an hour following ignition, with lethal temperatures of shorter duration recorded 20 cm below the mineral soil surface. Duff heating was best explained by day-of-burn Oe horizon moisture (P = 0.01), although little variation was explained (R(2) = 0.24). Post-fire changes in latewood radial increment in the year following fires was related to duration of temperatures >60 degrees C 10 cm deep in the mineral soil (P = 0.07), but explained little variability in post-fire growth (R(2) = 0.17). In contrast, changes in non-structural carbohydrate content in coarse roots (2-5 mm diameter) 120 days following burning were more strongly correlated with the duration of lethal heating 5 cm below the mineral soil surface (P = 0.02; R(2) = 0.53). Results from this study implicate the role of mineral soil heating in the post-fire decline of mature longleaf pine following restoration fires in sandy soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In water-limited systems Such as those of the Mediterranean carbon, allocation patterns strongly favour belowground accumulation, especially in large Subterranean structures called lignotubers. The resilience of these forests depends largely on the replenishment rate of these carbon reserves after disturbances. An experimental thinning, with two intensities (removal of 40% and 80% of basal area), was performed in 1992 in a holm oak forest at the Prades Experimental Complex of Catchments (NE Spain). In 2002, a second thinning was carried out in subplots within the former experimental 0.5 ha plots. Samples from the lignotubers of holm oak trees were analyzed for starch, and both mobile and immobile chemical components, in order to assess the resilience of holm oaks to repeated disturbances. our results show that after 10 years, starch stocks in the lignotubers have only recovered to half their former values. Removing 40% of the basal area instead of 80% is suggested to be the better managing option for this kind of forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In consequence, lower fine-root densities have to be expected under wheel tracks compared with other skid trail strata that experience no direct traffic. Explorative data analysis of fine-root densities below a skid trail revealed that the fundamental assumptions for linear modelling were violated. Using a generalized linear model following a Poisson distribution with a log link function for the predictor variables together with an exponential covariance function to cope with spatial autocorrelation, the formal model criteria were met. In contrast to the linear models, generalized additive models provide flexible surface estimators that enable us to model continuous response surfaces. In addition, generalized additive models allow for the calculation of confidence intervals for the estimated density surface and for the use of inferential statistics, such as comparisons between depth gradients of fine rooting at distinct transect locations or depth layers. These model characteristics improve the possibility to recognize differences and to evaluate fine-root disturbances below skid trails without integrating uncertain strata information. They also enhance the options for determining the duration of time that is necessary to restore the rooting capacity on formerly compacted soils.","[Schaeffer, Juergen; von Wilpert, Klaus; Kublin, Edgar] Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Schaffer, J (reprint author), Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",Juergen.Schaeffer@forst.bwl.de,,,,,,29,4,4,0,5,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We quantified the abundance of flowering individuals of Corallorhiza odontorhiza, a mycoheterotrophic orchid, over a 14-year period and mapped the distribution of individuals in six of the 14 years. For two seasons, we conducted intensive and extensive studies of the mycorrhizal fungi that were associated with C. odontorhiza. The annual abundance of flowering plants was statistically related to growing-season precipitation and winter temperature, and the distribution of individuals within the study plot was related to the abundance and distribution of appropriate host fungi. We used DNA sequencing to identify ectomycorrhizal root tips that hosted Tomentella fungi that could potentially support C. odontorhiza. We found that Tomentella spp. were distributed throughout the study plot and on all ectomycorrhizal tree species, including in areas that have historically supported few or no orchids. However, there were fewer ectomycorrhizal trees, total ectomycorrhizal root tips, and root tips hosting Tomentella spp. in areas with few or no orchids compared to areas with abundant orchids. Furthermore, one Tomentella taxon dominated in C. odontorhiza rhizomes but was never found except immediately adjacent to C. odontorhiza plants. This suggests that abundance of flowering C. odontorhiza reflects both the presence of ""preferred"" taxa and abundance of appropriate host fungi associated with ectomycorrhizal roots. Results of this research provide the first indication that the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi may be influenced by both the relative abundance of fungi that are sufficient to support orchid growth and by the presence of particular fungal types that are especially good at supporting orchid growth.","[McCormick, Melissa K.; Whigham, Dennis F.; O'Neill, John P.; Becker, Janie J.; Werner, Sarah] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Rasmussen, Hanne N.] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Ctr Forest Landscape & Planning, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; [Bruns, Thomas D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Taylor, D.

Here, we evaluate three diffusive sampling strategies that employ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sorbents to map the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of root-exuded thiophenes from the African marigold, Tagetes erecta. Solid phase root zone extraction (SPRE) probes constructed by inserting stainless steel wire into PDMS tubing were used to monitor thiophene concentrations at various depths beneath marigolds growing in PVC pipes. PDMS sheets were used to map the distribution of thiophenes beneath marigolds grown in thin glass boxes. Concentrations of the two major marigold thiophenes measured by these two methods were extremely variable in both space and time. Dissection and analysis of roots indicated that distribution of thiophenes in marigold roots also was quite variable. A third approach used 1 m lengths of PDMS microtubing placed in marigold soil for repeated sampling of soil without disturbance of the roots. The two ends of the tubing remained out of the soil so that solvent could be washed through the tubing to collect samples for HPLC analysis. Unlike the other two methods, initial experiments with this approach show more uniformity of response, and suggest that soil concentrations of marigold thiophenes are affected greatly even by minimal disturbance of the soil. Silicone tube microextraction gave a linear response for alpha-terthienyl when maintained in soils spiked with 0-10 ppm of this thiophene. This method, which is experimentally simple and uses inexpensive materials, should be broadly applicable to the measurement of non-polar root exudates, and thus provides a means to test hypotheses about the role of root exudates in plant-plant and other interactions.","[Mohney, Brian K.; Matz, Tricia; LaMoreaux, Jessica; Wilcox, David S.; Weidenhamer, Jeffrey D.] Ashland Univ, Dept Chem, Ashland, OH 44805 USA; [Gimsing, Anne Louise; Mayer, Philipp] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Nat Sci, Fac Life Sci, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Mayer, Philipp] Aarhus Univ, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-4000 Aarhus, Denmark","Weidenhamer, JD (reprint author), Ashland Univ, Dept Chem, Ashland, OH 44805 USA.",jweiden@ashland.edu,"Mayer, Philipp/D-8474-2011","Mayer, Philipp/0000-0001-5138-7506; Gimsing, Anne Louise/0000-0003-2240-7971",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0515826]; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [213161],"This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DEB 0515826) and from the European Commission (MODELPROBE, no. 213161).

The studies were performed as a basis for further evaluation of m-tyrosine activity in field soils containing living plant roots. Here, we examined the role of common soil amendments, including ammonium nitrate fertilizer and activated carbon, in overcoming plant growth inhibition in soils in a laboratory setting by using lettuce as a sensitive indicator of plant toxicity. The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less than 1 day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting. Rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil N amendment. Given the observed activity of m-tyrosine in soil and growth media on seedling growth, potential may exist for development of m-tyrosine as a soil applied herbicide if formulations can be stabilized under soil conditions.","[Bertin, Cecile; Harmon, Roselee; Akaogi, Mia] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Weidenhamer, Jeffrey D.] Ashland Univ, Dept Chem, Ashland, OH 44805 USA; [Weston, Leslie A.] Charles Sturt Univ, EH Graham Ctr Agr Innovat, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia","Bertin, C (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bertin.cecile@yahoo.ca; leweston@csu.edu.au,"Weston, Leslie/M-4557-2015","Weston, Leslie/0000-0002-1029-7982",,,,29,22,23,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Plant facilitation has been studied mostly in the context of plant-plant interactions, whereas multitrophic interactions including those that occur below ground have not yet received much attention. Here, I will discuss how above-ground and below-ground natural enemies and their predators influence plant facilitation and its evolution. 2. Specific above-ground and below-ground plant enemies and their predators play a major role in structuring the composition and dynamics of plant communities. In successional sequences, above-ground and below-ground multitrophic level interactions may tip the balance from competitive to facilitative states and vice versa. 3. Little is known about how above-ground and below-ground multitrophic interactions develop along resource or stress gradients and how the outcomes of above-ground-below-ground interactions depend on variations in these environmental conditions. 4. Facilitated plants need to fit into the above-ground-below-ground multitrophic communities of their facilitators. 5. Little is known also about the evolution of plant facilitation. The observed distance in phylogeny between facilitators and facilitated plants suggests that host-specific enemies may very well co-determine which species become facilitated by which facilitators. 6. Further, very little attention has been given to how plant strategies (allelopathy, accumulation of enemies, monopolization of symbionts) may be the result of selection against being facilitative. 7.Synthesis. Plant facilitation cannot be understood without considering a plant's natural enemies and also its enemies' enemies. Plant enemies can turn competitive interactions into facilitative interactions, whereas the enemies' enemies can turn facilitation back into competition. Below-ground interactions will have longer-lasting effects on facilitation than those above ground, because many organisms can persist in the soil, even when the host plants have disappeared.","[van der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","van der Putten, WH (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",w.vanderputten@nioo.knaw.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",,,,81,48,49,4,77,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Evaluating variation, or 'conditionality', in plant interactions is crucial to understanding their ecological importance and predicting where they might be at play. Much is known about conditionality for competition, facilitation and herbivory, but not for allelopathy, which likely contributes to the equivocal nature of reports on this topic. Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed) is an invasive species in North America, whose success has been attributed, at least in part, to the allelochemical root exudate (+/-)-catechin. 2. Understanding the ecological relevance of (+/-)-catechin necessitates determining how it interacts with various soil components. We found that some metals caused rapid declines in measurable (+/-)-catechin, while calcium impeded its auto-oxidation, maintaining concentrations higher than for (+/-)-catechin alone. Certain (+/-)-catechin-metal complexes were more phytotoxic than (+/-)-catechin alone, while others showed lower toxicity. 3. The variable phytotoxicity of these complexes suggests that (+/-)-catechin effects are enhanced, mitigated or otherwise affected by complexation with different metals and perhaps other soil components. 4. Synthesis. These findings serve to illustrate that the precise chemical forms, interactions and effects of catechin in the environment are highly variable and that further examination is warranted to increase our understanding of its role in invasion and allelopathy. The conditional effects observed for catechin detection and phytotoxicity likely extend to related allelopathic compounds, other root exudates and potentially other systems involving chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous environments.","[Pollock, Jarrod L.; Holben, William E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Microbial Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.; Thelen, Giles C.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Organismal Biol & Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Holben, William E.] Univ Montana, Montana Ecol Infect Dis Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Holben, WE (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Microbial Ecol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",bill.holben@mso.umt.edu,,,United States Department of Agriculture - National Research Initiative USDA-CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2003-02433]; Aldo Leopold Wilderness Center; USFS Fire Sciences Laboratory; DoD SERDP; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); University of Montana,"Funding for this project was provided by the United States Department of Agriculture - National Research Initiative USDA-CSREES Grant No. 2003-02433 (W.E.H., J.L.P., G.C.T. and R.M.C.) and by the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Center, the USFS Fire Sciences Laboratory, DoD SERDP, the National Science Foundation and the Office of Sponsored Research at the University of Montana (R.M.C. and G.C.T.).",,40,32,36,2,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Previous studies have indicated that plant identity (particularly plants that differ in root system architecture) or fungal identity (fungi from different families within the Glomeromycota) can determine the degree of protection from infection by pathogens. Here, we test the combined effects of plant and fungal identity to assess if there is a strong interaction between these two factors. We paired one of two plants (Setaria glauca, a plant with a finely branched root system and Allium cepa, which has a simple root system) with one of six different fungal species from two families within the Glomeromycota. We assessed the degree to which plant identity, fungal identity and their interaction determined infection by Fusarium oxysporum, a common plant pathogen. Our results show that the interaction between plant and fungal identity can be an important determinant of root infection by the pathogen. Infection by Fusarium was less severe in Allium (simple root system) or when Setaria (complex root system) was associated with a fungus from the family Glomeraceae. We also detected significant plant growth responses to the treatments; the fine-rooted Setaria benefited more from associating with a member of the family Glomeraceae, while Allium benefited more from associating with a member of the family Gigasporaceae. Synthesis. This study supports previous claims that plants with complex root systems are more susceptible to infection by pathogens, and that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can reduce infection in such plants - provided that the plant is colonized by a mycorrhizal fungus that can offer protection, such as the isolates of Glomus used here.","[Sikes, Benjamin A.; Cottenie, Karl; Klironomos, John N.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Sikes, BA (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",bsikes@uoguelph.ca,"Sikes, Benjamin/G-8895-2018","Sikes, Benjamin/0000-0003-0774-2624; Cottenie, Karl/0000-0001-9498-8483",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,We would like to thank A.

Dominant plant functional types (PFTs) are expected to be primary determinants of communities of other above- and below-ground organisms. Here, we report the effects of the experimental removal of different PFTs on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in a shrubland ecosystem in central Argentina. 2. On the basis of the biomass-ratio hypothesis and plant resource use strategy theory, we expected the effect of removal of PFTs on AMF colonization and spores to be proportional to the biomass removed and to be stronger when more conservative PFTs were removed. The treatments applied were: undisturbed control (no plant removed), disturbed control (mechanical disturbance), no shrub (removal of deciduous shrubs), no perennial forb (removal of perennial forbs), no graminoid (removal of graminoids) and no annual forb (removal of annual forbs). AMF colonization was assessed after 5, 17 and 29 months. Total density of AMF spores, richness and evenness of morphotaxa, and AMF functional groups were quantified after 5, 17, 29, 36 and 39 months. 3. Five months after the initial removal we found a significant reduction in total AMF colonization in all plots subjected to PFT removals and in the disturbed control plots, as compared with the undisturbed controls. This effect disappeared afterwards and no subsequent effect on total colonization and colonization by arbuscules was observed. In contrast, a significant increase in colonization by vesicles was observed in months 17 and 29, mainly in no graminoid plots. In general, treatments did not significantly affect AMF spores in the soil. On the other hand, no annual forb promoted transient (12-18 months) higher ammonia availability, and no shrub promoted lower nitrate availability in the longer term (24-28 months). 4. Synthesis. Our experiment, the first to investigate the effects of the removal of different PFTs on AMF communities in natural ecosystems, indicates that AMF communities are resilient to changes in the soil and in the functional composition of vegetation. Furthermore, it does not provide consistent evidence in support of the biomass-ratio hypothesis or differential trait-based direct or indirect effects of different PFTs on AMF in this particular system.","[Urcelay, Carlos; Diaz, Sandra; Gurvich, Diego E.; Dominguez, Laura S.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Urcelay, Carlos; Diaz, Sandra; Gurvich, Diego E.; Dominguez, Laura S.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, FCEFy N, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Chapin, F.

Our aims were to examine the biogeography of chickpea rhizobia, to search for a predominant species, and to identify the most efficient microsymbiont, considering Portugal as a case study. One hundred and ten isolates were obtained from continental Portugal and Madeira Island. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene phylogeny revealed that isolates are highly diverse, grouping with most Mesorhizobium type strains, in four main clusters (A-D). Interestingly, only 33% of the isolates grouped with Mesorhizobium ciceri (cluster B) or Mesorhizobium mediterraneum (cluster D), the formerly described specific chickpea microsymbionts. Most isolates belong to cluster A, showing higher sequence similarity with Mesorhizobium huakuii and Mesorhizobium amorphae. The association found between the province of origin and species cluster of the isolates suggests biogeography patterns: most isolates from the north, center, and south belong to clusters B, A, and D, respectively. Most of the highly efficient isolates (symbiotic effectiveness > 75%) belong to cluster B. A correlation was found between species cluster and origin soil pH of the isolates, suggesting that pH is a key environmental factor, which influences the species geographic distribution.

Mortality shortly after planting is often associated with inadequate hydration of transplants. Seedlings can be hardened to the drought conditions they may experience after transplanting by exposing them to controlled drought conditions in the nursery. Eucalyptus pilularis Sm. seedlings were drought hardened by providing nil (severe treatment) or half (mild treatment) the daily irrigation routinely received (control treatment) for up to two non-consecutive days per week during the last 4 weeks of growth in the nursery. Drought hardening reduced stem diameter, seedling leaf area, leaf area per root biomass and seedling quality measured by the Dickson quality index, but increased root:shoot ratio. Hardened seedlings had lower stomatal conductance and leaf water potential on the days they received less irrigation that the control treatment. Hardened seedlings had greater stomatal conductance and were less water stressed than seedlings experiencing drought for the first time indicating hardened seedlings had adjusted physiologically to drought. Survival after transplanting in the controlled drought environment in a glasshouse was enhanced by the hardening treatments. Non hardened seedlings that had had their upper leaves manually removed immediately prior to transplanting to reduce leaf area (top-clipped) had similar survival to hardened seedlings. Stomatal conductance and leaf water potential after transplanting were higher in hardened and top-clipped seedlings than unhardened control seedlings or vegetative cuttings. Survival in the field trial was over 95% for all treatments, possibly as rain fell within 4 days of planting and follow-up rain occurred in the subsequent weeks. Neither the hardened or top-clipped seedlings planted in the field trial had reduced growth, increased propensity to form double leaders or worse stem form than control seedlings when measured at age 3 years.","Forests NSW, Land Management & Forestry Serv, Coffs Harbour Jetty, NSW 2450, Australia","Thomas, DS (reprint author), Forests NSW, Land Management & Forestry Serv, POB J19, Coffs Harbour Jetty, NSW 2450, Australia.",danet@sf.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,29,11,12,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,NOV,2009,38,3,,,,,245,259,,10.1007/s11056-009-9144-9,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,501MN,WOS:000270386100003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Schumacher, J; Roscher, C",,,,"Schumacher, Jens; Roscher, Christiane",,,Differential effects of functional traits on aboveground biomass in semi-natural grasslands,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE; SPECIES RICHNESS; PLANT TRAITS; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; HERBACEOUS VEGETATION; COMMUNITY BIOMASS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; DISTURBANCE,"Despite increasing evidence on the importance of species functional characteristics for ecosystem processes, two major hypotheses suggest different mechanisms: the 'mass ratio hypothesis' assumes that functional traits of the dominant species determine ecosystem processes, while the 'complementarity hypothesis' predicts that resource niches may be used more completely when a community is functionally more diverse. Here, we present a method which uses two different groups of biotic predictor variables being (1) abundance-weighted mean (=aggregated) trait values and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FD(Q)) to test the competing hypotheses on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships after accounting for co-varying abiotic factors. We applied this method to data recorded on biodiversity-biomass relationships and environmental variables in 35 semi-natural temperate grasslands and used a literature-based matrix of fourteen plant functional traits to assess the explanatory power of models including different sets of predictor variables. Aboveground community biomass did not correlate with species richness. Abiotic factors, in particular soil nitrogen concentration, explained about 50% of variability in aboveground biomass. The best model incorporating functional trait diversity explained only about 30%, while the best model based on aggregated trait values explained about 54% of variability in aboveground biomass. The inclusion of all predictor variable groups in a combined model increased the predictive power to about 75%. This model comprised soil nitrogen concentration as abiotic factor, aggregated traits being indicative for species competitive dominance (rooting depth, leaf distribution, specific leaf area, perennial life cycle) and functional trait diversity in vegetative plant height, leaf area and life cycle. Our study strongly suggests that abiotic factors, trait values of the dominant species and functional trait diversity in combination may best explain differences in aboveground community biomass in natural ecosystems and that their isolated consideration may be misleading.","[Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, DE-07743 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, DE-07701 Jena, Germany","Schumacher, J (reprint author), Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, Ernst Abbe Pl 2, DE-07743 Jena, Germany.",croscher@bgc-jena.mpg.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 456],"We thank I.

Their effect is particularly relevant in the case of shallow landslides phenomena, where plants decrease the water content of the soil and increase its mechanical strength. Although such an effect is well known, its quantification is a relatively new challenge. The present work estimates the effect of some forest species on hillslope stability in terms of additional root cohesion by means of a model based on the classical Wu and Waldron approach (Wu in Alaska Geotech Rpt No 5 Dpt Civ Eng Ohio State Univ Columbus, USA, 1976; Waldron in Soil Sci Soc Am J 41:843-849, 1977). The model is able to account for root distribution with depth and non-simultaneous root breaking. Samples of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) and European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.), were taken from different locations of Lombardy (Northern Italy) to estimate root tensile strength, the Root Area Ratio and the root cohesion distribution in the soil. The results show that, in spite of its dramatic variability within the same species at the same location and among different locations, root cohesion can be coherently interpreted using the proposed method. The values herein obtained are significant for slope stabilisation, are consistent with the results of direct shear tests and back-analysis data, and can be used for the estimation of the stability of forested hillslopes in the Alps.","[Bischetti, Gian Battista; Chiaradia, Enrico Antonio; Epis, Thomas; Morlotti, Emanuele] Univ Milan, Dept Agr Engn, Milan, Italy","Bischetti, GB (reprint author), Univ Milan, Dept Agr Engn, Milan, Italy.",bischetti@unimi.it,"Bischetti, Gian Battista/Q-8636-2017","Bischetti, Gian Battista/0000-0001-5181-2314",Regione Lombardia-Agricultural Directorate,"The research activity is part of the Research Program SISIFO funded by Regione Lombardia-Agricultural Directorate.

Seedlings of S. salsa from the intertidal zone emerged more rapidly than those of the inland population under both waterlogged and drained conditions. Waterlogging and salinity had no adverse effects on seedling emergence of S. salsa from the intertidal zone, but markedly inhibited this parameter in the inland population. Waterlogging did not affect the seedling survival, shoot dry mass, and shoot height in high salinity in S. salsa from the intertidal zone, while the opposite trend was shown in the inland population. The root dry mass was higher in S. salsa from the intertidal zone as compared to the inland population, in waterlogged treatments by 1.9, 1.3, and 1.5 times in 1, 200, and 600 mM NaCl, respectively, and in drained treatments by 1.8, 2.3, and 3.0 times in 1, 200, and 600 mM NaCl, respectively. Waterlogging increased Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in high salinity, but waterlogging had no effect on Cl(-) concentration in shoots of S. salsa from the intertidal zone. In all NaCl treatments, waterlogging had no effect on concentrations of these ions in shoots of S. salsa from the saline inland site. In a field investigation, the fresh mass of shoots and roots were lower, whereas the root/shoot ratio was 1.5 times higher in S. salsa from the intertidal zone, compared with the inland population. These findings indicate that S. salsa population from the intertidal zone is more waterlogging tolerant than the inland population. S. salsa from the intertidal zone produced relatively more root biomass and this might help anchor plants against tidal action in the intertidal zone. The physiological and morphological characteristics may determine the natural distributions of the two S. salsa populations in their different saline environments.","Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China","Song, J (reprint author), Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.",songjieever@163.com,,,Foundation of Excellent Young Scientists of Shandong Province [2006BS06002]; State High Technological Research and Development Plan of China [2007AA091701],"I am thankful to Dr. Mustapha Gorai and the section editor Dr. TD Colmer, and two anonymous referees for their critical reading and revision of the manuscript.

Two rhizobial species, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense and Sinorhizobium fredii, were found as dominant groups in communities of soybean rhizobia in Xinjiang, whereas three Rhizobium genomic species, B. yuanmingense and B. japonicum, were minor groups. These genomic species showed clear correlations with eco-regions, and their symbiotic genes were identical or very similar to those of the reference strains for the corresponding species. Conclusively, the dominant soybean rhizobia S. fredii and B. liaoningense in Xinjiang might be introduced from other Chinese regions, but they have been selected as the rhizobia adapted to the saline-alkaline soils. The high pH, salinity, and phosphate concentration in soil might be the environmental factors determining the biogeography of these bacteria. It is worth mentioning that a novel Rhizobium species that may have acquired the symbiotic genes from a Bradyrhizobium lineage was identified.","[Han, Li Li; Wang, En Tao; Han, Tian Xu; Sui, Xin Hua; Chen, Wen Feng; Chen, Wen Xin] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Labs Agro Biotechnol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, En Tao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [Liu, Jie] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Engn, Dept Biol & Pharmaceut Engn, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China; [Han, Tian Xu] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Chen, WX (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Labs Agro Biotechnol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",wenxin@cau.edu.cn,"Han, Tianxu/D-7514-2016","Han, Tianxu/0000-0001-5089-9649","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30670001, 30400001]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2006CB100206, 2006AA10A213]; National Program for Basic S & T Platform Construction [2005DKA21201-2]; IPN, Mexico [SIP 20070538, SIP 20080322]","We thank Geng Tong Luo and Jian Jun Wei in Academy of Xinjiang Agricultural Settlement for providing seeds and helping to collect nodules.

The selection pressures that herbivores exert on plants and vice versa might vary geographically, leading eventually to population differentiation and local adaptation. In order to test whether there was reciprocal population differentiation among plants and belowground herbivores, we performed a cross-inoculation experiment using combinations of species and populations of root-feeders belonging to the genus Pratylenchus and the dune grass Ammophila arenaria from different geographic origins. Plant and herbivore responses in terms of growth and multiplication, respectively, were assessed at the end of the experiment. The 16 plant-herbivore combinations tested showed a high variation in the outcome of the interaction and revealed population differentiation in the responses of both, the host plant and the root-herbivores. The outcome in plant and herbivore performance was strongly case-dependent and for the sympatric combinations tested, support for local adaptation was not found. Nonetheless, the variation in plant-herbivore responses to experimental conditions highlights the plasticity of the interaction and may be pointing at spatial structuring in belowground plant-herbivore interactions.","[de la Pena, Eduardo; Bonte, Dries] Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Moens, Maurice] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Moens, Maurice] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Crop Protect, Ghent, Belgium","de la Pena, E (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Grp, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",eduardo.delapena@ugent.be,"de la Pena, Eduardo/B-8037-2015","de la Pena, Eduardo/0000-0002-6057-6664; Bonte, Dries/0000-0002-3320-7505",EUEuropean Union (EU) [HPRN-CT-2002-00210],"Eduardo de la Pena and Dries Bonte are both postdoctoral fellows of the Flemish Science Foundation (FWO).

The model has been validated against both eddy-covariance and growth data under contrasting environmental conditions. Forest growth was found to be reduced by low temperatures (-50%) and water stress (-37%) at the opposite extremes of the natural range of the species. Application of a functional model made it possible to partition growth reductions between individual processes. Gross primary production was severely affected by low temperatures and short vegetative periods at the northern extreme of the specific range (-53%), and by low air and soil humidity at the southern limit (-26%). The ratio between net and gross primary production was found to be rather constant across the temperate region, only increasing in the boreal zone in response to low temperatures (+20%). Under dry conditions, on the contrary, a substantial proportion of the reduction in aboveground productivity was attributed to the need to allocate increasing amounts of resources to fine root production and maintenance (+16%).

In particular, more precise information on size and dynamics of the root system is needed. In six natural forest stands at pre-montane elevation (c. 1000 m a.s.l.) on Sulawesi (Indonesia), we determined above-ground biomass and the distribution of fine (d < 2 mm) and coarse roots (d > 2 mm), estimated above- and below-ground net production, and compared the results to literature data from other pre-montane paleo- and neotropical forests. The mean total biomass of the stands was 303 Mg ha(-1) (or 128 Mg C ha(-1)), with the largest biomass fraction being recorded for the above-ground components (286 Mg ha(-1)) and 11.2 and 5 6 Mg ha(-1) of coarse and fine root biomass (down to 300 cm in the soil profile), resulting in a remarkably high shoot:root ratio of c. 17 Fine root density in the soil profile showed an exponential decrease with soil depth that was closely related to the concentrations of base cations, soil pH and in particular of total P and N. The above-ground biomass of these stands was found to be much higher than that of pre-montane forests in the Neotropics, on average, but lower compared to other pre-montane forests in the Paleotropics, in particular when compared with dipterocarp forests in Malesia. The total above- and below-ground net primary production was estimated at 15.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (or 6.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) with 14% of this stand total being invested below-ground and 86% representing above-ground net primary production. Leaf production was found to exceed net primary production of stem wood. The estimated above-ground production was high in relation to the mean calculated for pre-montane forests on a global scale, but it was markedly lower compared to data on dipterocarp forests in South-east Asia. We conclude that the studied forest plots on Sulawesi follow the general trend of higher biomasses and productivity found for paleotropical pre-montane forest compared to necitropical ones. However, biomass stocks and productivity appear to be lower in these Fagaceae-rich forests on Sulawesi than in dipterocarp forests of Malesia. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Soil respiration rates did not differ significantly between non-gap sites (1290 +/- 210 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1)) but were double those in gap sites (640 +/- 130 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1)). Post hoc analyses found that an increase in soil temperature and a decrease in litterfall and fine root biomass explained 72% of the difference between gap and non-gap sites. The significant decrease of soil respiration rates in gaps, irrespective of day or night time, suggests that autotrophic respiration may be an important contributor to total soil respiration in logged forests We conclude that biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange models in tropical systems should incorporate gap frequency and that future research in tropical forest should emphasize the contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration.

The goal of this study was to evaluate early growth and root/shoot development of different planting materials in typical heavy clay soils of northwestern Quebec. Using one-year-old bareroot hybrid poplar dormant stock, four planting materials were compared: (1) regular bareroot stock, (2) rootstock (stem pruned before planting), (3) whips (roots pruned before planting), and (4) cuttings (30 cm stem sections taken from the basal portion of bareroot trees, i.e. roots and shoot pruned). Rooted stock types (bareroot and rootstock) produced, on average, 1.2 times larger trees than unrooted stock types (cuttings and whips). However, shoot-pruned stock types (rootstocks and cuttings) reached similar heights and basal diameters as unpruned stock types (bareroots and whips), during the first growing season. Shoot pruning reduced leaf carbon isotopic ratios, suggesting that unpruned stock types were water-stressed during the first growing season. The stress was most likely caused by early leaf development while root growth occurred later in the summer. We conclude that shoot pruning bareroot stock is a useful management option to reduce planting stress without compromising early growth rates of hybrid poplars. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Participants were provided with the model and with both synthetic net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and leaf area index(LAI) data, generated from the model with added noise, and observed NEE and LAI data from two eddy covariance sites. Participants endeavoured to estimate model parameters and states consistent with the model for all cases over the two years for which data were provided, and generate predictions for one additional year without observations. Nine participants contributed results using Metropolis algorithms, Kalman filters and a genetic algorithm. For the synthetic data case, parameter estimates compared well with the true values. The results of the analyses indicated that parameters linked directly to gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration, such as those related to foliage allocation and turnover, or temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration, were best constrained and characterised. Poorly estimated parameters were those related to the allocation to and turnover of fine root/wood pools. Estimates of confidence intervals varied among algorithms, but several algorithms successfully located the true values of annual fluxes from synthetic experiments within relatively narrow 90% confidence intervals, achieving >80% success rate and mean NEE confidence intervals < 110 gC m(-2) year(-1) for the synthetic case. Annual C flux estimates generated by participants generally agreed with gap-filling approaches using half-hourly data. The estimation of ecosystem respiration and GPP through MDF agreed well with outputs from partitioning studies using half-hourly data. Confidence limits on annual NEE increased by an average of 88% in the prediction year compared to the previous year, when data were available. Confidence intervals on annual NEE increased by 30% when observed data were used instead of synthetic data, reflecting and quantifying the addition of model error. Finally, our analyses indicated that incorporating additional constraints, using data on C pools (wood, soil and fine roots) would help to reduce uncertainties for model parameters poorly served by eddy covariance data.

Five soil types and three water regimes were used for the experiment Liquidambar and Platanus, the native species, germinated significantly more quickly and were more sensitive to soil type than were the exotics, Ailanthus and Paulownia. Platanus grew tallest, and along with Paulownia, accumulated the greatest total biomass. Ailanthus alone exhibited a high root/shoot ratio in all soil types.

B.S.P. and exotic Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv. (cogongrass) was investigated using litter bags over the course of a 12 month period. The above and belowground biomass of the invasive I. cylindrica always decomposed faster than that of the native A. glomeratus. Also, belowground biomass of both species decomposed at a consistently faster rate when placed within an invaded area consisting of a monotypic stand of I. cylindrica as opposed to within a native plant assemblage. However, there was no similar such trend observed in the aboveground plant material. The microbial communities associated with the invaded sites often differed from those found in the native vegetation and provide a possible causal mechanism by which to explain the observed differences in decomposition rates. The microbial communities differed not only compositionally, as indicated by ordination analyses, but also functionally with respect to enzymatic activity essential to the decomposition process. This study supports the growing consensus that invasive plant species alter normal ecological processes and highlights a possible mechanism (alteration of microbial assemblages) by which I. cylindrica may alter an ecosystem process (decomposition).","[Holly, D.

A theoretical model previously developed by the authors for the rate of tree root water uptake together with an associated numerical simulation is used to study the effects of a wide range of soil, tree, and atmospheric parameters on partially saturated ground. The influence of different parameters on the maximum initial rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. Field measurements taken from previously published literature are compared with numerical predictions for validation. The rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at wilting point, the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density are studied in detail. The analysis shows that the rate of potential transpiration increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, while the potential transpiration rate has an insignificant effect on the distribution of soil suction. Root density distribution factors affect the size of the influence zone. Suction at the wilting point increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, whereas the saturation permeability decreases the maximum soil matric suction generated. The analysis confirms that the most sensitive parameters, including the coefficients of the tree root system, the transpiration rate, the permeability of the soil and its suction at the wilting point should be measured or estimated accurately for an acceptable prediction of ground conditions in the vicinity of trees.

The results indicated that lower concentration of Cd (1 mu M) had no obviously influence on the root growth during 24-48 h treatment, but higher concentrations (5-50 mu M) inhibited significantly after 48 and 72 h. The mitotic index decreased with increasing of Cd concentration and duration of treatment except for the group exposed to 1 mu M Cd.

This theory was mainly based on the increase in enzymatic activity during periods of low photosynthate supply from tree hosts and emergence of the theory has led to a question about the overall influence of saprotrophy by ECM fungi on soil carbon turnover. However, I argue here that there is still not enough evidence to confirm this proposed function. My argument is based on inference from several lines of observation and concern over several aspects of the past studies. First, ECM fungi mainly inhabit deeper soil horizons, in which the availability of carbon compounds with positive energetic value is low. Second, the ability of ECM fungi to produce ligninolytic enzymes and cellulases is much weaker than that of saprotrophic basidiomycetes. This is most apparent in the low copy abundance of corresponding genes in the sequenced genomes of ECM species Laccaria bicolor and Amanita bisporigenes compared to the saprotrophic species Galerina marginata. I offer alternative hypotheses to explain the past observations of increased enzyme activity during starvation periods. These include, the induction of autolytic processes in ECM fungal mycelia or an attack on the host tissues to support escape from a dying root and to allow for a search for new hosts.","ASCR, Inst Microbiol, Lab Environm Microbiol, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic","Baldrian, P (reprint author), ASCR, Inst Microbiol, Lab Environm Microbiol, Vvi Videnska 1083, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic.",baldrian@biomed.cas.cz,"Baldrian, Petr/A-9170-2009","Baldrian, Petr/0000-0002-8983-2721",,,,33,88,92,0,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2009,161,4,,,,,657,660,,10.1007/s00442-009-1433-7,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,495AE,WOS:000269860700001,19685081,,,,10/31/19J,"Winkler, JB; Fleischmann, F; Gayler, S; Scherb, H; Matyssek, R; Grams, TEE",,,,"Winkler, J.

Twenty specific host - mycorrhiza combinations were pot-grown outdoors under low-N conditions. Foliar concentrations of total phenolics and salicylic acid were decreased by mycorrhizas in S. schwerinii x S. viminalis and S. x dasyclados genotypes, but increased in S. viminalis. Mycorrhiza effects on host biomass production were positive, indifferent or negative, depending on the specific host-mycorrhiza combination. The host plant genotype influenced mainly the direction of mycorrhizal effects on foliar chemistry, whereas the magnitude of mycorrhizal effects varied mostly among the fungal genotypes.

We examined long-term (13 years) effects of annual fire and mowing on fine (< 2 mm) roots and soil C and N content in a native tallgrass prairie at Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas, USA. Using 90 cm deep soil cores, we determined that fire and mowing independently and interactively influenced the quantity and depth distribution of fine root biomass, root C and N concentration, and soil C and N content. Annual burning increased total fine root biomass by 48% and total C storage in roots by 47% compared to unburned unmowed plots, and resulted in a deeper distribution of roots. There was a significant interaction of fire and mowing, whereby mowing reduced root biomass and root C storage by similar to 30% in annually burned plots, but did not affect total root biomass in unburned plots. Mowing also resulted in shallower distribution of roots regardless of fire treatment. Root N concentration was reduced by 15-25% in plots that were burned, mowed, or both. Mowing effects on soil C and N were restricted to surface soils (0-10 cm), where mowing reduced soil C concentrations by similar to 20% and N concentrations by 17% regardless of burning treatment. In contrast, burning alone did not significantly influence soil C and N concentrations. In general, root biomass, root C and N mass, and soil C and N concentrations declined with depth, and most responses to burning and mowing exhibited significant interactions with depth. Different long-term fire and mowing regimes can significantly alter belowground root biomass and C and N dynamics in grasslands, and in particular at depths in the profile that are not typically sampled.","[Kitchen, Duane J.] Rockford Coll, Dept Biol, Rockford, IL 61108 USA; [Blair, John M.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Callaham, Mac A., Jr.] US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, USDA, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Kitchen, DJ (reprint author), Rockford Coll, Dept Biol, 5050 E State St, Rockford, IL 61108 USA.",dkitchen@rockford.edu,"Blair, John M/I-4082-2014","Blair, John M/0000-0003-0072-0721",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Division of Biology,"Support for this research was provided by the NSF-supported Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program, and by the Division of Biology at Kansas State University.

Here we focused on the effects of variability in both amount and frequency of water supply on juvenile root and leaf functional traits and growth of seven Mediterranean shrub species occurring in arid SE Spain, Anthyllis cytisoides, Atriplex halimus, Ephedra fragilis, Genista umbellata, Lycium intricatum, Retama sphaerocarpa, and Salsola oppositifolia. In a 14-month greenhouse experiment we manipulated water supply expecting that reduced water amount and pulses of watering of different magnitude affected functional traits and seedling growth, even if the amount of water provided was the same. Different watering patterns altered soil drying dynamics, with reduced supply of water amount and frequent watering becoming the driest treatment. We found that roots of all species responded to alterations in water supply by changing biomass allocation patterns (i.e., higher root-to-shoot mass [R:S] ratio in droughted plants), and by altering fine roots diameter, measured in terms of specific root length. Indeed, differences in growth rate among species were significantly linked to fine roots diameter and biomass allocation, which relates to uptake capacity of roots. However, relative growth rate and leaf traits such as specific leaf area were insensitive, likely because prolonged droughts over longer periods of time seem necessary to constraint growth in all these arid shrubs.","[Padilla, Francisco M.; Miranda, Juan D.; Jorquera, Maria J.; Pugnaire, Francisco I.] CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria 04001, Spain","Padilla, FM (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, C Gen Segura 1, Almeria 04001, Spain.",fpadilla@eeza.csic.es,"Padilla, Francisco M./C-5204-2009; Miranda, Juande/C-4485-2011; Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008","Padilla, Francisco M./0000-0003-1021-0258; Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827","The Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [CGL2004-00090/CLI]; FMP","We thank an anonymous referee for comments on an earlier draft, and vivero de Rodalquilar (Junta de Andalucia) for seed donation.

Although there is accumulating knowledge about AMF diversity in different ecosystems, the effect of forest management on diversity and functional characteristics of AMF communities has not been addressed. Here we used, soil inoculum representing three different AM fungal communities (from a young forest stand, an old forest stand and an arable field) in a greenhouse experiment to investigate their effect on the growth of three plant species with contrasting local distributions - Geum rivale, Trifolium pratense and Hypericum maculatum. AM fungal communities in plant roots were analysed using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. The effect of natural AMF communities from the old and young forest on the growth of studied plant species was similar. However, the AMF community from the contrasting arable ecosystems increased H. maculatum root and shoot biomass compared with forest inocula and T pratense root biomass compared to sterile control. According to ordination analysis AMF inocula from old and young forest resulted in similar root AMF communities whilst plants grown with AM fungi from arable field hosted a different AMF community from those grown with old forest inocula. AMF richness in plant roots was not related to the origin of AMF inoculum. G. rivale hosted a significantly different AM fungal community to that of T pratense and H. maculatum. We conclude that although the composition of AM fungal communities in intensively managed stands differed from that of old stands, the ecosystem can still offer the 'symbiotic service' necessary for the restoration of a characteristic old growth understorey plant community.

Based on the sequences of the ITS regions, we divided the sequences of the S. fredii strains into two groups, type A and type B. A dot-matrix analysis indicated that the region flanked by tRNA-Ile and tRNA-Ala is longer in type A than in type B, whereas type B sequences possess longer regions upstream of tRNA-Ile and downstream of tRNA-Ala than those of the type A sequence. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of polymerase chain reaction product (PCR-RFLP) of the ITS region in the cloned plasmids as templates could reconstruct the PCR-RFLP pattern from the total DNA as a template. The results of Southern hybridization using the insert sequence between tRNA-Ile and tRNA-Ala in type A as a probe indicated differences in the copy numbers of the type A ITS regions among the strains tested. These results indicated that S. fredii strains possess the type A and type B sequences of the ITS regions at ratios of 3:0, 2:1, 1:2 or 0:3.

The addition of root exudates (containing BNI activity that is expressed in Allylthiourea unit (ATU) was standardized in a bioassay against a synthetic inhibitor of nitrification, allylthiourea, and their function in soil was compared to inhibition caused by the synthetic nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide.

Nitrification was also similarly inhibited in rhizosphere soils of Cambisol where B. humidicola was grown for 6 months. Root exudates did not inhibit other soil microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria, total cultivable bacteria and fluorescent pseudomonads. Root exudates, when added to pure cultures of Nitrosomonas europaea, inhibited their growth, but did not inhibit the growth of several plant growth promoting microorganisms, Azospirillum lipoferum, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Azotobacter chroococcum.

Statistical analysis revealed significant effect of litter treatment on some growth parameters of seedlings: seedling height, needle dry weight and total seedling weight. The survival rate of seedlings was significantly highest for oak litter, intermediate for pine litter, and lowest for control soil. Pine seedlings were colonized by indigenous ecto- and ectendomycorrhizal symbionts. Seven mycorrhizal species (Suillus luteus, S. variegatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, Tuber sp., Tomentella sp., Cenorococcum geophilum, Amphinema byssoides) were distinguished on the roots of pine seedlings as well as one ectomycorrhizal symbiont not identified to species level. In total, 6 mycorrhizal types were found in control soil, 5 in pine litter, and 8 in oak litter. Suilloid (S. luteus and S. variegatus) and Wilcoxina mycorrhizae were dominant on tested seedlings, irrespective of litter addition. Seedlings grown in untreated nursery soil were 34% colonized by W. mikolae, while suilloid mycorrhizae were dominant after litter treatment (81% in pine litter and 63% in oak litter).

In a temperate broad-leaved forest with a mosaic of species-poor and species-rich stands, we tested two hypotheses related to putative below-ground 'overyielding' in more diverse forests, (1) that species mixture results in a partial spatial segregation of the fine root systems of different species, and (2) that stand fine root biomass increases with tree species diversity. We investigated 12 stands either with one, three, or five dominant tree species (4 replicate stands each) under similar soil and climate conditions for stand fine root biomass and spatial root segregation in vertical and horizontal direction in the soil. Fine roots of different tree species were identified using a morphological key based on differences in colour, periderm surface structure, and branching patterns. In species-poor and species-rich stands, and in all tree species present, fine root density (biomass per soil volume) decreased exponentially with soil depth at very similar rates. Stand fine root biomass in the densely rooted upper soil (0-40 cm depth) was not significantly different between stands with 1, 3 or 5 dominant tree species. We conclude that 'below-ground overyielding' in terms of higher fine root biomasses in species-rich stands as compared to monospecific ones does not occur in these broad-leaved forests which most likely results from a missing complementarity in vertical rooting patterns of the present tree species.","[Meinen, Catharina; Leuschner, Christoph; Hertel, Dietrich] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Ryan, Nicholas T.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Leuschner, C (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",cleusch@gwdg.de,,,DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG); DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"This study is part of the postgraduate studies program Graduiertenkolleg 1086 ""The role of biodiversity for bio-geochemical cycles and biotic interactions in temperate deciduous forests''.

Moreover, an increasing frequency of large-scale forest dieback in these forests may change the SOC stock and its spatial distribution. Univariate and multivariate geostatistics were applied to elucidate the spatial variability of SOC stocks of different landscape units under a high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L) forest in central Europe and its relation to topographic parameters, soil-specific factors, and the impact of recent and past stand composition. We studied four high-elevation sites: Three are stocked with unmanaged Norway spruce (P. abies L) forest, but differ in their positions on hillslope, topographic parameters, and soil type. At an adjacent site the spruce forest had been destroyed by bark-beetle (Ips typographus) infestation 25 years ago (dieback site). The fallen logs remained at the site and the site was not reforested. Soil samples were taken from the forest floor and the mineral soil. Fine root biomass and SOC stocks were significantly negatively spatially correlated at the spruce sites, but spatially independent at the dieback site due to the homogeneous distribution of grass roots at this site. For none of the sites with healthy Norway spruce forest, forest floor thickness or the magnitude of the SOC stocks at a given sampling point was related to its distance to the nearest tree. This is attributed to an overwhelming impact of small-scale topography (<= 5 m) on the SOC stock distribution. In contrast, at the dieback site the SOC stocks in the forest floor and the topsoil horizon showed a significant negative spatial correlation with the distance to the nearest fallen log. The spatial variability of the SOC stocks in the mineral soil increased with increasing stone content and curvature heterogeneity. Clay content and SOC stocks were spatially positively correlated at each site, demonstrating the importance of soil texture on SOC distribution. Our results indicate that topographic parameters dominate the distribution of topsoil and subsoil SOC stocks at stand scale at the investigated sites. In contrast, tree distribution is only of minor importance at these sites with a distinctive patchy topographic structure. Particularly in sloped terrain, fallen logs have the potential to change the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in the forest floor, but also in the mineral topsoil considerably, and within a period of a few decades.

As a policing strategy stabilising intraspecific cooperation, host sanctions against non-N(2) fixing, cheating symbionts have been proposed to stabilise mutualism in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Mechanism of penalisations would include decreased nodular rhizobial viability and/or early nodule senescence. We tested these potential mechanisms of penalisations in split-root experiments using two soybean varieties and two rhizobial strains, a cooperative, normal N(2)-fixing strain and an isogenic non-fixing derivative. We found no differences in the number of viable rhizobia recovered from nodules and no differential expression of a nodular senescence molecular marker. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of plant sanctions acting against cheating rhizobia in our experimental conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the current study, actinomycetes were isolated from casts of the two endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Octolasion tyrtaeum) and an epigeic (Dendrobaena octaedra) earthworm to determine the nature of naturally existing actinomycete community in earthworm casts. Earthworms were kept in soil free compartmented chambers containing leaf litter colonized with actinomycetes antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi and actinomycetes not antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi to infer feeding preferences of earthworms. The actinomycete population dynamics of the casts of the earthworms fed with single antagonistic actinomycete species and soil supplemented with these casts were investigated in order to understand the impacts of both endogeic and epigeic earthworms on the dispersal of actinomycetes antagonistic to the decomposer fungi. According to the current study, the cast actinomycete communities of epigeic (i.e. D. octaedra) and endogeic earthworms (i.e. A. caliginosa, O. tyrtaeum) consisted of frequently isolated actinomycetes of the forest floor. All the cast actinomycetes were Streptomyces species and most of them were found to be antagonistic to the common litter and wood decomposer fungi. All the casts had higher actinomycete counts than those in the surrounding soil. When leaf litter inoculated with antagonistic and non-antagonistic actinomycetes was supplied as the food choices for the earthworms, they preferentially consumed some of the highly antagonistic actinomycetes as well as some weakly antagonistic actinomycetes but the order of preference depended on the earthworm species. Many of the actinomycetes antagonistic to litter decomposer fungi survived gut passage but analysis of earthworm casts did not show any increase in actinomycete numbers during gut passage. The actinomycetes in earthworm casts were able to successfully spread into surrounding soil thereby increasing the existing community size of actinomycetes in natural soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Soil microfauna in 0-10 cm soil under a sheep-grazed pasture on a sand was assessed quarterly in FACE rings that were either at ambient CO(2) or had been exposed to 475 mu l l(-1) CO(2) for some 9 years. Although the area had been subject to a severe drought and microfaunal populations were lower than previously found, the effects of elevated CO(2) on microfaunal populations were broadly similar to those at 4 years. Average populations of the root-feeding L. elongatus increased from 67,000 to 233,000 m(-2) (3.48x) compared with a 4.26x increase after 4 years; microbial-feeding nematodes increased slightly, while predacious nematodes showed a 2.0x increase. A pot experiment showed an additive effect of elevated CO(2) and L. elongatus abundance in reducing specific root length. That similar effects have been found 4 and 9 years after CO(2) enrichment commenced suggests they are real, and emphasises the difference to other sites around the world where much lower responses to elevated CO(2) have been found. This, in part, reflects the unique combination of soil, plant and soil biological conditions at each site and confirms the strong effect of soil type and vegetation on soil biological processes. Just as the effects of global climate change on a given region are idiosyncratic, so it seems are the effects of elevated CO(2) on soil and ecosystem processes. In part, this reflects our limited understanding of below-ground processes.","[Yeates, Gregor W.] Landcare Res, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Newton, Paul C.

For C. falcata, mycorrhization was significantly different among individuals, ranging from 14 to 63%, and no significant difference among C. erecta individuals was detected (57-68%). Mycorrhization among three growth directions of roots and between orchid species was not significantly different. The spatial distribution of mycorrhizas in both orchids showed significant differences, being most frequent at an apical position. Based on DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, we inferred that the families Thelephoraceae and Sebacinaceae were mycobionts for C. falcata and Thelephoraceae for C. erecta.

The role of soil biota has been proposed as important. However, the role of mutualists has received much less attention than that of pathogens. Here we report that lack of adequate ectomycorrhizal fungi hinders invasion by exotic Pinaceae on Isla Victoria, Argentina, by reducing both the probability of establishment and growth of invading individuals. More than one hundred exotic tree species were introduced to this island ca. 80 years ago, but invasive trees are found in high densities only in areas adjacent to plantations. With a series of greenhouse and field experiments we found lower mycorrhizal colonization levels and few fungal species far from original plantings, and key fungal mutualists are confined to areas near plantations, probably owing to dispersal limitations. Low inoculum levels far from the plantations are retarding the invasion. Our experiments indicate that positive interactions belowground can play a key but underappreciated role in invasion dynamics.","[Nunez, Martin A.; Simberloff, Daniel] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Horton, Thomas R.] SUNY ESF, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Nunez, MA (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",nunezm@gmail.com,"Nunez, Martin/B-2735-2010","Horton, Tom/0000-0002-2112-9618; Nunez, Martin/0000-0003-0324-5479",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); DDIG [DEB 0709644]; Sigma Xi; University of Tennessee Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"We thank Jed Cappellazzi, Ariel Cowan, and Lindsay Miller for the molecular work; R.

Annual TBCA increased in response to elevated CO2, enriched N, and increasing diversity. TBCA was positively related to standing root biomass. After removing the influence of root biomass, the effect of elevated CO2 remained positive, suggesting additional drivers of TBCA apart from those that maintain high root biomass. Removing root biomass effects resulted in the effects of N and diversity becoming neutral or negative (depending on year), suggesting that the positive effects of diversity and N on TBCA were related to treatment-driven differences in root biomass. Greater litter production in high diversity, elevated CO2, and enhanced N treatments increased annual ecosystem C loss in fire years and C gain in non-fire years, resulting in overall neutral C storage rates. Our results suggest that frequently burned grasslands are unlikely to exhibit enhanced C sequestration with increasing atmospheric CO2 levels or N deposition.","[Adair, E.

It is therefore desirable to use a proper sampling design which integrates spatial heterogeneity at field level. Thus, the objectives were: (1) to study the spatial heterogeneity of biological and chemical soil variables, and (2) with obtained maps of spatial variability to test different sampling strategies to assess the usefulness of this 'new' soil map unit. 63 soil samples were collected according to a 10 m x 10 m grid on a 0.48 ha plot. On each of these samples, 10 variables were measured: soil water content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (N), C/N, soil microbial biomass (SMB), labile soil organic matter (LOM), mineralisable C (C(min)) and N (N(min)), inverse of specific respiratory activity (1/SRA = SEM/C(min)). The spatial heterogeneity of each variable was charted with geostatistics. The biological variables exhibited spatial variability of the same order of magnitude as physicochemical parameters. From the maps, zones with different levels of organic matter, microbial biomass and specific respiratory activity were identified. The spatial patterns of SMB and SRA were related to CEC (positively for SMB and negatively for SRA), pointing out the effects of soil protection on microbial biomass and availability of organic substrates. The definition of these zones for a pool of variables (OC, N, SMB, LOM, CEC) is useful at 3 levels: (1) to record the initial values of the measured variables for each plot, (2) to integrate these zones as blocks in experimental design for future experiments, and (3) to focus analysis of specific biological mechanisms such as activity of micro-organisms.

Depending on grazing intensity, grasslands tend towards two contrasting systems that differ in terms of species diversity and soil carbon (C) storage. To date, effects of grazing on C cycling have mainly been studied in grasslands subject to constant grazing regimes, whereas little is known for grasslands experiencing a change in grazing intensity. Analysing the transition between C-storing and C-releasing grasslands under low- and high-grazing regimes, respectively, will help to identify key plant-soil interactions for C cycling. 2. The transition was studied in a mesocosm experiment with grassland monoliths submitted to a change in grazing after 14 years of constant high and low grazing. Plant-soil interactions were analysed by following the dynamics of plant and microbial communities, roots and soil organic matter fractions over 2 years. After disturbance change, mesocosms were continuously exposed to C-13-labelled CO2, which allowed us to trace both the incorporation of new litter C produced by a modified plant community in soil and the fate of old unlabelled litter C. 3. Changing disturbance intensity led to a cascade of events. After shift to high disturbance, photosynthesis decreased followed by a decline in root biomass and a change in plant community structure 1.5 months later. Those changes led to a decrease of soil fungi, a proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and accelerated decomposition of old particulate organic C (< 6 months). At last, accelerated decomposition released plant available nitrogen and decreased soil C storage. Our results indicate that intensified grazing triggers proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and subsequent faster decomposition by reducing roots adapted to low disturbance. 4. Synthesis. Plant communities exert control on microbial communities and decomposition through the activity of their living roots: slow-growing plants adapted to low disturbance reduce Gram(+) bacteria, decomposition of low and high quality litter, nitrogen availability and, thus, ingress of fast-growing plants. Our results indicate that grazing impacts on soil carbon storage by altering plant roots and their control on the soil microbial community and decomposition, and that these processes will foster decomposition and soil C loss in more productive and disturbed grassland systems.","[Klumpp, Katja; Fontaine, Sebastien; Soussana, Jean-Francois] INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res UR874, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Attard, Eleonore; Le Roux, Xavier] Univ Lyon 1, INRA, CNRS, UMR 5557, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Gleixner, Gerd] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany","Fontaine, S (reprint author), INRA, Grassland Ecosyst Res UR874, 234 Av Brezet, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France.",fontaine@clermont.inra.fr,"Soussana, Jean-Francois/M-2814-2017; Soussana, Jean-Francois/P-2094-2016; Gleixner, Gerd/O-4215-2019; Gleixner, Gerd/M-8519-2017; Soussana, Jean-Francois/E-2543-2012","Soussana, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1932-6583; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; ",Patrick Pichon [UR 874]; Claire Commenaux [UMR5557]; Marie Curie Individual FellowshipEuropean Union (EU) [EVK2-CT2002-50026]; PhD Scholarship (INRA - Region Poitou Charentes)Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine; European FP5 'GREENGRASS' [EVK2-CT2001-00105]; ANR BIOMOSFrench National Research Agency (ANR),"We thank Patrick Pichon (UR 874), Claire Commenaux (UMR5557), Emanuelle Personeni, and Christiane Kramer for their technical and scientific contributions.

In England, the loss of lowland heathland, a habitat of global conservation importance, is primarily due to the invasion of birch and pine. This encroachment has been researched in depth from a plant perspective but little is known about the role of mycorrhizal fungi. In lowland heathlands the resident dwarf shrubs form ericoid mycorrhizas whereas invading trees form ectomycorrhizas. Therefore, tree encroachment into heathlands can be regarded as the replacement of a resident mycorrhizal community by an invading one. 2. This study examined how fungi form mycorrhizas with Betula and Pinus in lowland heathlands. We addressed the question of whether there are mycorrhizal fungi that mediate invasion using a molecular ecology approach to compare the mycorrhizal inoculum potential of soil at three levels of invasion (uninvaded heathland, invaded heathland and woodland) and the fungi forming mycorrhizas on tree seedlings and trees across diverse sites. 3. We show that in lowland heathlands: (i) seedlings have severely limited access to ectomycorrhizal fungi relative to woodlands, (ii) there are few keystone spore-dispersed ectomycorrhizal fungi that can mediate tree invasion, (iii) tree seedlings can remain non-mycorrhizal for at least one year when no inoculum is present, even near saplings, and (iv) mycorrhizal seedlings achieve greater biomass than non-mycorrhizal seedlings. Within uninvaded heathland we detected only Rhizopogon luteolus, Suillus variegatus, S. bovinus (Pinus symbionts) and Laccaria proxima (primarily a Betula symbiont). 4.Synthesis. Overall, ectomycorrhizal inoculum in lowland heathlands is rare; most tree seedlings growing in heathland soil are not mycorrhizal due to limited spore dispersal, poorly developed spore banks and weak common mycorrhizal networks. These seedlings can persist awaiting mycorrhization to boost their growth.","[Collier, Fay A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Richmond TW9 3DS, England; Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, England","Collier, FA (reprint author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Richmond TW9 3DS, England.",f.collier04@imperial.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C510291/1],"We thank the Natural Environment Research Council (grant NE/C510291/1 to M.I.B.) and the eight anonymous referees of the application for their comments, Rose Strickland-Constable, Richard Waterman and Ellen Fry for assistance in the field, Peter Manning and David Read for comments on a draft of this manuscript, Drs.

We used a repeated measures natural experiment in five subpopulations to investigate secondary sexual dimorphism in Carica papaya including interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Male and female plants did not differ in size or growth rate, but male plants flowered earlier than female plants. We observed different patterns of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in male and female plants of C. papaya. These differences between the sexes preceded the flowering of most female plants. Female plants were sensitive to changes in soil fertility and adjusted the extent of their root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi accordingly.

Allelopathy, one type of direct plant competition, has received relatively little research, particularly in aquatic and wetland systems, even though allelopathy can be a potent mechanism through which plant communities are structured. Typha angustifolia (narrow-leaved cattail) is an invasive exotic plant in North America that often forms monocultures in disturbed wetlands and is more invasive than native members of its genus. We tested whether T. angustifolia was allelopathic and whether it produced different biochemicals than a native congener by growing it with the native bulrush Bolboschoenus fluviatilis (river bulrush) in soil with and without activated carbon and by qualitatively and quantitatively comparing soluble phenolics produced in the roots of T. angustifolia and the native Typha latifolia (broad-leaved cattail). T. angustifolia had a strong allelopathic effect on B. fluviatilis, reducing the longest leaf length and root, shoot, and total biomass of B. fluviatilis. When the allelopathy of T. angustifolia was ameliorated by activated carbon, however, longest leaf length, ramet number, root biomass, shoot biomass, and total biomass of T. angustifolia were greatly reduced due to resource competition with B. fluviatilis. Furthermore, T. angustifolia produced different, but not more, soluble phenolics than T. latifolia suggesting that the identity of the phenolics is different between the two species rather than the concentrations. The allelopathic effects of T. angustifolia on a North American native wetland plant and its production of root biochemicals that appear to differ from those produced by a native congener are consistent with the possibility that T. angustifolia may use a novel allelochemical in its invasion of North American wetlands.","[Jarchow, Meghann E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Jarchow, Meghann E.; Cook, Bradley J.] Minnesota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mankato, MN 56001 USA","Jarchow, ME (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mjarchow@iastate.edu,,,"Minnesota State University, Mankato; Department of Biological Sciences","This research was supported by the Minnesota State University, Mankato, Department of Biological Sciences.

The roots of all the species examined were colonised with AM fungi in the field, with the percentage of colonisation varying among species from approximately 40% to 90%. In a subsequent pot experiment, plants of all the species were either left non-inoculated or were inoculated with a mixture of three native AM fungi isolated from the site of plant origin (Glomus mosseae, G. intraradices and G. microaggregatum). AM fungi increased phosphorus uptake in all the plant species; however, plant growth response to inoculation varied widely from negative to positive.

In addition to well-understood mechanisms by which Cheatgrass gains competitive advantage, recent studies have shown that Cheatgrass may also change the associated soil microbial community to impact native perennial plants and promote the persistence of Cheatgrass. Furthermore, reducing plant-available N represents a tool for initiating conditions that accelerate successional change from annual- to perennial-dominated communities. At a montane, mixed shrub-grassland Cheatgrass-dominated site in Colorado, we applied sucrose to reduce available N, and we added soil from a native plant community in order to reestablish the microbial community. This approach tested the idea that intact native soil microbial communities may enhance the beneficial effect of reducing soil N availability in a restoration setting. By the end of the experiment, reduced N availability decreased Cheatgrass by 9.8%, non-native annual/biennial plant cover by 15.0%, and increased relative perennial plant cover by 13.4%; soil inoculation reduced Cheatgrass by 7.6% and increased perennial abundance by 11.3%. Soil inoculum additions and reduced N availability both contributed toward restoring a perennial-dominated community and demonstrates that addition of native soil inoculum may be a useful tool for restoration efforts.","[Rowe, Helen I.] Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Paschke, Mark W.] Colorado State Univ, Forest Rangeland & Watershed Stewardship Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Rowe, HI (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, 915 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ivy@purdue.edu,"Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013","Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905; Rowe, Helen/0000-0002-1545-7658",Park Service; Rocky Mountain National Park,We thank the Park Service for their cooperation and support.

Epidendrum secundum is a widely distributed orchid in campo de altitude (high elevation grassy vegetation) regions of the State Park of Serra do Brigadeiro (PESB), Minas Gerais, Brazil, and little is known about the mycorrhizal relationships of this species in the park. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphological diversity of Rhizoctonia-like mycorrhizal fungi isolated from four E. secundum populations growing in three regions of a campo de altitude, in the region of Totem Deitado Mountain, PESB. Twenty-six fungal isolates were obtained, all belonging to Epulorhiza. The quantitative and qualitative morphological characteristics revealed, in general, low variability among the fungi isolated from the same orchid population and among isolates from the same region, but high variability among the fungi isolated from the populations from different regions. Based on these morphological characteristics, the isolates were separated into four groups. The first consisted of the fungi from populations I and II from region A, the second of isolates from population III from region B, the third of isolate M61 from population II from region C, and the fourth of a single isolate obtained from population IV from region C. The morphological variability observed indicates the existence of diversity of Epulorhiza spp. associated with E. secundum in PESB.","[Pereira, Marlon Correa; Costa, Mauricio Dutra; Megumi Kasuya, Maria Catarina] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, BR-38810000 Rio Paranaiba, MG, Brazil; [Pereira, Olinto Liparini] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Fitopatol, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Rocha, Rodrigo Barros] Embrapa Rondonia, BR-78900970 Porto Velho, RO, Brazil","Pereira, MC (reprint author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Microbiol, Campus Rio Paranaiba,BR 354,Km 310,Caixa Postal 2, BR-38810000 Rio Paranaiba, MG, Brazil.",marlon.pereira@ufv.br; oliparini@yahoo.com.br; mdcosta@ufv.br; rodrigo@cpafro.embrapa.br; mkasuya@ufv.br,"Pereira, Olinto/G-5405-2013; Pereira, Marlon/H-1669-2014; Rocha, Rodrigo/K-6699-2013; Rocha, Rodrigo/J-2055-2014; Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/E-1123-2013","Pereira, Olinto/0000-0002-0274-4623; Rocha, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5275-5315; Costa, Mauricio/0000-0002-0828-4437; Kasuya, Maria Catarina Megumi/0000-0002-9539-9370",,,,39,14,16,0,8,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

The objective of this study was to verify the diversity of diazotrophic bacteria that nodulate cowpea in soils of the lower half of the Sao Francisco River Valley by morphological and genotypic characterization. Seven soil samples (A1, A2, A3, A4, C1, C2 and MC) were collected to capture bacteria associated to five cowpea cultivars (IPA 206, BRS Pujante, BRS Marataoa, Canapu Roxo, and Sempre Verde), in a 5x7 factorial design with three replications. Thirty days after plant emergence, the nodules were collected and the bacteria isolated and analyzed in relation to their growth characteristics in YMA medium. The 581 isolates were grouped in 49 morphologic groups. Of this total, 62.3 % formed colonies in up to three days, 33.4 % grew from the 6(th) day on, and 4.3 % began to grow 4 to 5 days after incubation. Regarding the formation of acids and alkalis, 63 % acidified the medium, 12 % made it alkaline and 25 % maintained the medium at neutral pH. The highest diversity was observed in the A3 sample and in isolates associated with the cultivars Canapu Roxo and BRS Pujante. Thirty-eight representative isolates were chosen for the genotypic characterization, clustered in four groups based on the restriction analysis of 16s rDNA. This grouping was strongly correlated with the sampling site; 13 rhizobium isolates had an electrophoretic profile distinct from the standard rhizobium strains used in this study.","[Leite, Jakson; Passos, Samuel Ribeiro] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Agron & Ciencia Solo, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Seido, Sirando Lima] Univ Estado Bahia, Dept Tecnol & Ciencias Sociais, BR-48900000 Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [Xavier, Gustavo Ribeiro; Rumjanek, Norma Gouvea] Embrapa Agrobiol, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil","Leite, J (reprint author), Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Agron & Ciencia Solo, Rod BR 465,Km 7, BR-23890000 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil.",leitejk@yahoo.com.br; siroseido@hotmail.com; passos.samuel@gmail.com; ustavo@cnpab.embrapa.br; norma@cnpab.embrapa.br; lmvmartins@uneb.br,"Libardoni, Bruno G/P-3873-2014; Leite, Jakson/G-9935-2017; Passos, Samuel R/G-8812-2012","Leite, Jakson/0000-0003-2019-8037; ",MCT /National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Departamento de Ciencia e Tecnologia/Ministerio da Saude (DECIT /MS); Fund of Biotechnology (CT-BIOTECNOLOGIA); Fund of Health (CT-SAUDE),"The authors wish to thank the MCT/National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Departamento de Ciencia e Tecnologia/Ministerio da Saude (DECIT /MS), Fund of Biotechnology (CT-BIOTECNOLOGIA) and Fund of Health (CT-SAUDE) for funding the project in the scope of the Rede Nordeste de Biotecnologia (RENORBIO), the CNPq for the scholarships in Technological and Industrial Initiation and award for Excellence in Research and they are grateful to Dr Robert Boddey for reading the manuscript.",,35,19,22,0,10,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

They represent an extreme environment with high salinity and drought that severely influence the growth of organisms. In the present study. diversity of plant halophytes and their mycorrhizal status were screened at eight different locations, which were mostly dikes and salt ponds, and which were deliberately selected for their distinct properties (e.g. soil salinity ranging from 105 to 2627 mu S cm(-1), vegetation type and management practice of the salterns). Twelve different halophytic plant species were recorded, of which eleven are designated as vulnerable. With few exceptions, they were found at the abandoned (Fontanigge) and sustained (Lera) locations of the Secovlje salterns, distributed according to their tolerance to the salinity and waterlogging. The highest diversity of halophytes was listed at Fontanigge, in the abandoned, periodically flooded and gradually overgrown salt ponds. All of the examined species were colonised with either arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and/or dark septate endophytes (DSEs). High levels of colonisation were however detected only for species belonging to the Asteraceae and Plantaginaceae families. Higher root colonisation frequencies were generally seen for plants growing in the abandoned parts, when compared to the managed parts, whereas there was little correlation of the colonisation parameters with physicochemical parameters of rhizospheric soil properties. Molecular analysis by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of roots of halophytic plant species with confirmed AMF colonisation (arbuscules present) revealed the occurrence of at least six different AMF species, related to Glomus geosporum, Glomus caledonium and Glomus intraradices, and to different Glomus sp. clades and the Diversispora clade. This is to the best of our knowledge the first report of AMF and DSE mycorrhizal status of most of the halophyte plant species examined and of the brother scale identification of AMF species based on molecular analyses of roots of diverse halophytes from high saline environments.

The WMCC of the dominant trees was negatively correlated to mean annual increment of biomass (MAI), suggesting that planting fast-growing tree species for C sequestration in afforestation and reforestation practices sacrifice some C gain from increasing MAI due to decreasing [C].

The tree layer was measured in 2004 in 13 stands afforested with 2-year-old seedlings during 1968 to 1994. Three stands (afforested in 1990, 1983, and 1968) were selected for detailed analysis of the carbon sequestration. Soil profiles were sampled in these stands in 2005. Radiocarbon analysis combined with a simple model of litter production was used to differentiate between plant-derived recent carbon and carbon stemming from fragments of oil shale. Total carbon accumulated since afforestation in vegetation, forest floor, and A horizon was 7.8 t.ha(-1) in the stand established in 1990, 34.5 t.ha(-1) in that established in 1983, and 133.4 t.ha(-1) in that established in 1968. Most of the sequestered carbon was allocated to tree stems; their portion increasing with age from 28% to 51%. The portion of recent soil organic carbon increased from 5% to 23%, which shows that soils contribute significantly to carbon accumulation during early forest succession on degraded land.","[Karu, Helen; Szava-Kovats, Robert; Kull, Olevi] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Karu, Helen; Pensa, Margus] Tallinn Univ, NE Estonian Dept, Inst Ecol, EE-41537 Johvi, Estonia","Karu, H (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",helen.karu@ut.ee,,,"Estonian Science FoundationEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [5764]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [0282119s02, 0182732s06]","The authors thank Aarne Luud, Riina Vaht, Elga Rull, Ene Rull, Olaf Raim, Pille Mand, Eve Eensalu, and Ingmar Tulva for their help during field sampling.

Both positive and negative effects of mycorrhizal colonization of the host plant on performance and density of insect herbivores have been reported in previous studies. We have conducted a meta-analysis of 34 published and unpublished studies on this topic in order to find out the sources of variation in mycorrhizae effects on insect herbivores. Effects of mycorrhizae on chewing insects depended upon the parameter measured and the degree of herbivore feeding specialization. Density and consumption of chewing insects were higher on mycorrhizal plants, but this did not lead to greater plant damage, presumably because herbivore survival tended to be lower on mycorrhizal plants. Mono-and oligophagous chewers benefited from mycorrhizal colonization of their host plants, whereas performance of polyphagous chewers was reduced on mycorrhizal plants. Among sucking insects, phloem feeders benefited from mycorrhizal infection, but performance of mesophyll feeders was lower on mycorrhizal plants. The type of mycorrhiza was not important for chewing insects, but performance of sucking insects was increased more by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) than by ectomycorrhizae (ECM). Among AM inoculation studies, the most commonly used fungal species, Glomus intraradices, tended to have a negative effect on chewer performance, whereas all other fungal species tended to have a positive effect. There was no significant difference in results between studies using inoculation and fungicides, field and laboratory studies, and published and unpublished studies. Mycorrhizal status of the host plant thus influences insect herbivore performance, but the magnitude and direction of the effect depend upon the feeding mode and diet breadth of the insect and the identity of fungi.","[Koricheva, Julia; Gange, Alan C.; Jones, Tara] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Koricheva, J (reprint author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",julia.koricheva@rhul.ac.uk,"Koricheva, Julia/G-6754-2011","Koricheva, Julia/0000-0002-9033-0171",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council,"We are grateful to the Natural Environment Research Council for funding experimental work and to Marcel Goverde, Stefan Hempel, Anne Kempel, Abby Kula, Robert Laird, and Stuart Wooley for providing additional or unpublished data from their studies.",,58,169,177,2,166,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2009,90,8,,,,,2088,2097,,10.1890/08-1555.1,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,474OE,WOS:000268293000008,19739371,,,,10/31/19J,"Kennedy, PG; Peay, KG; Bruns, TD",,,,"Kennedy, Peter G.; Peay, Kabir G.; Bruns, Thomas D.",,,Root tip competition among ectomycorrhizal fungi: Are priority effects a rule or an exception?,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,competition; fungi; mycorrhiza; Pinus muricata; priority effects; Rhizopogon spp.,REAL-TIME PCR; PINUS-MURICATA FOREST; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; SOIL; BIODIVERSITY; SPECIFICITY; COEXISTENCE; SUCCESSION; DIVERSITY,"Competition for root colonization among ectomycorrhizal fungi is well documented, but the mechanisms determining competitive outcomes are not clearly understood. In a previous study, we observed that timing of colonization (i.e., a priority effect) had a significant effect on the outcome of competition between two ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi in the genus Rhizopogon. In this study, we explicitly tested the role of priority effects in competition among EM fungi by experimentally manipulating the timing of colonization of four Rhizopogon species on Pinus muricata seedlings. In a first experiment, we set up 12 two-species combinations, in which seedlings were first inoculated from spores with one species, grown for three months, and then inoculated with an equal density of spores of a second species and grown for an additional three months. Root tip occupation in the two-species treatments was determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of rDNA. In a second experiment, we further examined competitive interactions between two Rhizopogon species using split-root P. muricata seedlings. One side of the root system was pre-colonized by one species, and spores of the second species were added to the other side of the root system in all same and different species pair-wise combinations. We found that for three of the four species (R. occidentalis, R. salebrosus, R. vulgaris), the outcome of competition in the first experiment depended strongly on the timing of colonization, with the first colonizing species always being the competitive dominant. For R. evadens, however, initial colonization did not prevent significant subsequent colonization by R. occidentalis and R. vulgaris. This appeared to be caused by the lower colonization of R. evadens compared to the three other species. In the second experiment, we observed that the portion of the split root system that was initially uncolonized remained receptive to colonization when spores were added. The amount of colonization of R. occidentalis and R. salebrosus on the side of the root system to which they were added was not significantly influenced by species identity on the other side of the seedling. In combination, these results confirm that priority effects do play a major role in dynamics of EM root tip colonization, at least in the early colonization of seedlings, and that the proportion of the root system occupied by a species appears to be a key factor determining competitive success.","[Kennedy, Peter G.] Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97219 USA; [Peay, Kabir G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci & Policy Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bruns, Thomas D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Kennedy, PG (reprint author), Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97219 USA.",pkennedy@lclark.edu,,"Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412","National Parks Ecological Research Fellowship; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0236096, DEB0742696]","The authors thank Point Reyes National Seashore for use of their land; N.

Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O-3) affect host plant carbon gain and allocation, which may in turn influence ectomycorrhizal sporocarp production if the carbon available to the ectomycorrhizal fungus is dependant upon the quantity of carbon assimilated by the host. We measured sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi over 4 years at the Aspen FACE (free air CO2 enrichment) site, which corresponded to stand ages seven to 10 years. Total mean sporocarp biomass was greatest under elevated CO2, regardless of O-3 concentration, while it was generally lowest under elevated O-3 with ambient CO2. Community composition differed significantly among the treatments, with less difference in the final year of the study. Whether this convergence was due to succession or environmental factors is uncertain. CO2 and O-3 affect ectomycorrhizal sporocarp productivity and community composition, with likely effects on dispersal, colonization and sporocarp-dependent food webs.","[Andrew, Carrie] Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Lilleskov, Erik A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, No Res Stn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Andrew, C (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",cjandrew@mtu.edu,,,,,,45,36,38,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We hypothesized that changes in plant available N and exploitation of deep sources of inorganic N in soils have sustained greater growth at elevated CO2. We employed a suite of assays performed in the sixth and 11th year of a CO2 enrichment experiment designed to assess soil N dynamics and N availability in the entire soil profile. In the 11th year, we found no differences in gross N flux, but significantly greater microbial respiration (P <= 0.01) at elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 lowered extractable inorganic N concentrations (P=0.096) considering the whole soil profile (0-190 cm). Conversely, potential net N mineralization, although not significant in considering the entire profile (P=0.460), tended to be greater at elevated CO2. Ion-exchange resins placed in the soil profile for approximately 1 year revealed that potential N availability at the water table was almost 3 x greater than found elsewhere in the profile, and we found direct evidence using a 15 N tracer study that plants took up N from the water table. Increased microbial respiration and shorter mean residence times of inorganic N at shallower depths suggests that enhanced SOM decomposition may promote a sustained supply of inorganic N at elevated CO2. Deep soil N availability at the water table is considerable, and provides a readily available source of N for plant uptake. Increased plant growth at elevated CO2 in this ecosystem may be sustained through greater inorganic N supply from shallow soils and N uptake from deep soil.","[McKinley, Duncan C.; Romero, Julio C.; Drake, Bert G.; Megonigal, James P.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Megonigal, JP (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",megonigalp@si.edu,"Hungate, Bruce/F-8991-2011","Hungate, Bruce/0000-0002-7337-1887; Megonigal, Patrick/0000-0002-2018-7883",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0445324],"This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DEB-0445324).

However, both herbivore selectivity and the plant's ability to tolerate or resist herbivory may depend on the density of herbivores. In an alpine ecosystem with a long history of grazing, plants are expected to respond to both enhanced and reduced grazing pressures, and the interaction between plant traits and changes in species abundance are expected to differ between the two types of alteration of grazing regime. To understand the mechanisms behind species response, we investigated the relationship between sheep selectivity (measured in situ), plant traits and experimentally derived measures of change in species abundance as a response to the enhancement (from low to high density) or cessation (from low to zero density) of sheep grazing pressure over a six-year time period for 22 abundant herb species in an alpine habitat in south Norway. Sheep selected large, late-flowering herbs with a low leaf C/N ratio. Species that increased in abundance in response to enhanced grazing pressure were generally small and had high root/shoot ratios, thus exhibiting traits that reflect both resistance (through avoidance) and tolerance (through regrowth capacity) strategies. The abundance of selected species remained stable during the study period, and also under the enhanced grazing pressure treatment. There was, however, a tendency for selected species to respond positively to cessation of grazing, although overall responses to cessation of grazing were much less pronounced than responses to enhanced grazing. Avoidance through short stature (probably associated with increased light availability through the removal of tall competitors) as well as a certain amount of regrowth capacity appear to be the main mechanisms behind a positive response to enhanced grazing pressure in this study. The plant trait perspective clearly improves our insight into the mechanisms behind observed changes in species abundance when the disturbance regime is altered.","[Evju, Marianne; Halvorsen, Rune] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Dept Bot, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Austrheim, Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Museum Nat Hist & Archaeol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway","Evju, M (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Dept Bot, POB 1172, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",marianne.evju@nhm.uio.no,,"Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [153601/432, 134361/720, 165846/S30]","This study was funded by the Research Council of Norway (Project 153601/432, 134361/720 and 165846/S30).

The vast majority of studies in forests have focused on above-ground responses to differences in tree species diversity, while systematic analyses of the effects of biodiversity on root systems are virtually non-existent. By investigating the fine root systems in 12 temperate deciduous forest stands in Central Europe, we tested the hypotheses that (1) stand fine root biomass increases with tree diversity, and (2) 'below-ground overyielding' of species-rich stands in terms of fine root biomass is the consequence of spatial niche segregation of the roots of different species. The selected stands represent a gradient in tree species diversity on similar bedrock from almost pure beech forests to medium-diverse forests built by beech, ash, and lime, and highly-diverse stands dominated by beech, ash, lime, maple, and hornbeam. We investigated fine root biomass and necromass at 24 profiles per stand and analyzed species differences in fine root morphology by microscopic analysis. Fine root biomass ranged from 440 to 480 g m(-2) in the species-poor to species-rich stands, with 63-77% being concentrated in the upper 20 cm of the soil. In contradiction to our two hypotheses, the differences in tree species diversity affected neither stand fine root biomass nor vertical root distribution patterns. Fine root morphology showed marked distinctions between species, but these root morphological differences did not lead to significant differences in fine root surface area or root tip number on a stand area basis. Moreover, differences in species composition of the stands did not alter fine root morphology of the species. We conclude that 'below-ground overyielding' in terms of fine root biomass does not occur in the species-rich stands, which is most likely caused by the absence of significant spatial segregation of the root systems of these late-successional species.","[Meinen, Catharina; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albert von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hertel, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albert von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",dhertel@gwdg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DGF)German Research Foundation (DFG); Research Training Group,"This study was funded by the German Research Foundation (DGF) in the context of the Research Training Group 1086 'The role of biodiversity for biogeochemical cycles and biotic interactions in temperate deciduous forests'.

More recently it has been suggested that plant population dynamics may be linked with the development of the below-ground community. The biologically active soil zone where root-root and root-microbe communications occur is named ""Rhizosphere"" where root exudates play active roles in regulating rhizosphere interactions. Root exudation can regulate the soil microbial community, withstand herbivory, facilitate beneficial symbioses, modify the chemical and physical soil properties and inhibit the growth of competing plant species. In this review, we explore the current knowledge assessing the importance of root exudates in plant interactions, in communications between parasitic plants and their hosts and how some soil microbial components could regulate plant species coexistence and change relationships between plants. This review will be focussed on several well documented biological processes regulating plant-plant communications such as exotic plant species invasions, negative root-root communication (allelopathy) and parasitic plant / host plant interactions and how some soil microbial components can interfere with signal traffic between roots. The reported data show that the overall effect of one plant to another results from multiple interacting mechanisms where soil microbiota can be considered as a key component.","[Sanon, A.; Duponnois, R.] IRD, Lab Commun Microbiol, ISRA, UCAD,Ctr Rech Bel Air, Dakar, Senegal; [Sanon, A.] Univ Cheick Anta Diop, Dept Biol Vegetale, Dakar, Senegal; [Andrianjaka, Z.

Many plant species exude/emit compounds into the surrounding environment with minor consequences in their native habitat due to a long coevolutionary history. However, upon introduction to ecosystems na < ve to these compounds, unpredictable interactions can manifest. The majority of the putative allelochemicals studied have been root exudates, despite the large number of plant species that emit volatile organic compounds. We quantified the concentrations and ecological consequences of volatile monoterpenes from the North American invasive perennial Artemisia vulgaris. Ambient monoterpene-mixing ratios inside an A. vulgaris canopy were 0.02-4.15 ppbv in May and 0.01-0.05 ppbv in August, but were negligible (below instrument detection limit of 0.01 ppbv) 10 m away. Foliar disturbance increased total monoterpene concentration to a maximum of 27 ppbv. However, this level remains 1,000-fold lower than that shown to be phytotoxic to sensitive species in laboratory assays. In contrast, soil monoterpene concentrations were > 74-fold higher inside [a parts per thousand currency sign35 +/- A 11 ng g(-1) (SDW)] and 19-fold higher at the edge [9 +/- A 3 ng g(-1) (SDW)], compared to outside the A. vulgaris stand [0.48 +/- A 0.05 ng g(-1) (SDW)]. A common native competitor species, Solidago canadensis, grown in pots and resident soil in situ yielded up to 50% less aboveground biomass inside as compared to outside the A. vulgaris stand. Activated carbon had no effect on greenhouse-grown S. canadensis performance when grown with A. vulgaris, suggesting root-derived exudates are not responsible for field observations. Results from this study suggest that A. vulgaris-derived monoterpenes have little direct activity in their volatile gaseous state, but are concentrated in the soil matrix within and bordering the A. vulgaris stand, thereby reducing interspecific performance and potentially fostering the subsequent local invasion of this species.","[Barney, Jacob N.; Whitlow, Thomas H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sparks, Jed P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Greenberg, Jim; Guenther, Alex] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","Barney, JN (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, 1 Shields Ave,Mailstop 4, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jbarney@ucdavis.edu,"Barney, Jacob/C-2412-2008; Guenther, Alex B/B-1617-2008","Barney, Jacob/0000-0003-2949-5003; Guenther, Alex B/0000-0001-6283-8288",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),JB would like to thank the IGERT Biogeochemistry and Biocomplexity program for funding this project.
