The 48-yr-old forest is dominated by Populus tremuloides (Trembling aspen), the 122-yr-old forest by a mixture of P. tremuloides, Abies balsamea (balsam fir) and Picea glauca (white spruce), and the 232-yr-old forest by Thuja occidentalis (eastern white cedar) and A. balsamea, with some P. tremuloides. 40 root-ingrowth bags were installed in different locations in and around each gap (at gap center, 1 to 2 m either side of gap edge and in adjacent control plots). Half of the ingrowth bags were harvested after one year following gap creation, the other half after two years. Roots were sorted into different species grouping. Fine-root production was statistically (P < 0.05) larger in the youngest forest compared to the two older ones after one year, but not after two years. The individual species or groups of species increased, decreased or showed no change in fine-root production in gaps, but overall we did not observe a major shift in species proportion between gap and control plots after two years. Some herbs and also Taxus canadensis seemed to benefit in terms of fine-root growth from such small openings after two years. No statistical differences (P > 0.10) in total fine-root production were found among locations within and outside gaps in either year. However, there was a clear tendency for fine-root production to be smaller in gap center than in the other locations for the two younger successional forests the first year after gap creation. We conclude that small above-ground gaps (i.e. < 100 m(2)) do not produce a significant and long-lasting below-ground gap in terms of total fine-root production in the successional forests investigated.","Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Finnish Res Inst, Joensuu Res Stn, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Messier, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, CP 8888 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",messier.christian@uqam.ca,,,,,,40,13,13,2,15,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Yet nodules have never been observed on species of Cladrastis, and there are conflicting reports of the capacity of species in the genus Styphnolobium to nodulate. Our objectives were to evaluate Styphnolobium japonicum (formerly Sophora japonica) and Cladrastis kentukea for the capacity to nodulate and to characterize any isolated rhizobia. N-deficient plants were inoculated with rhizobia chosen for their low host specificity or for their symbiotic potential with indigenous and introduced trees and shrubs of Sophora species in Hawaii, Japan and China. Soil samples from the root zones of mature S. japonicum, C. kentukea and other woody legumes, introduced or indigenous to Hawaii, Japan, China and the continental USA, also were used as inocula. Inoculation did not elicit nodulation of C. kentukea or S. japonicum, despite that N concentrations of shoots of S. japonicum (1.6%) and C. kentukea (1.5%) fell below the highest shoot N percentage that previously was associated with well-nodulated plants of Maackia amurensis (1.8%). In addition to these analyses, rhizobia were isolated from nodules on the roots of a tree reported to us as S. japonicum. Nine of the 10 isolates selected as representatives of similarity groups were capable of nodulating M. amurensis, which led to the identification of the putative S. japonicum as Maackia floribunda. We also found that broad-range Bradyrhizobium USDA 6, USDA 3384 and USDA 3456 induce nodules on R. pseudoacacia and M, amurensis, which were used as control species during inoculation trials with S. japonicum and C. kentukea. Our conclusion that S. japonicum and C. kentukea lack the capacity to nodulate is based on the most thorough analysis of the nodulation capacity of these species to date. Previous reports of nodulation of S. japonicum may have been due to inaccurate plant or nodule identification.","Iowa State Univ, Inderdept Plant Physiol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ, Dept Bot, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Iowa State Univ, Dept Hort, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Foster, CM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Inderdept Plant Physiol Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",cmfoster@iastate.edu,,,,,,40,3,4,1,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,1998,205,2,,,,,103,111,,10.1023/A:1004309414388,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,168WK,WOS:000078716000002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fang, C; Moncrieff, JB; Gholz, HL; Clark, KL",,,,"Fang, C; Moncrieff, JB; Gholz, HL; Clark, KL",,,Soil CO2 efflux and its spatial variation in a Florida slash pine plantation,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,multiple regression model; slash pine plantation; soil respiration; spatial variability of CO2 efflux,ROOT RESPIRATION; NORTH FLORIDA; FOREST; EVOLUTION; ELLIOTTII; FLOOR; FLUX; FERTILIZATION; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS,"The efflux of CO2 from the soil surface can vary markedly in magnitude both in time and space and its correct determination is crucial in many ecological studies. In this paper, we report results of field measurements, using an open-top dynamic chamber, of soil CO2 efflux in a mature Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var.elliottii) plantation. The daily average efflux was 0.217 mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) in the autumn and 0.087 mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) in the winter. Soil temperature, which accounts for most of the temporal variability in CO2 efflux, is by far the most influential factor controlling soil respiration rate and its temporal variation. The CO2 efflux in the slash pine plantation is highly spatially variable and effluxes from the soil under palmetto is significantly higher than that from the open floor. The CO2 efflux generally increases with increase in soil fine root biomass, litter and humus amount on the forest floor but is inversely related to the amount of organic matter in the mineral soil. The spatial variation in CO2 efflux can be well characterised by a simple multiple regression model incorporating live and dead biomass and soil total porosity as predictor variables. Understorey plants, mostly Serenoa repens, are an important component of the C cycle and the major contributor to the spatial heterogeneity of soil CO2 efflux. The influence of understorey plants on soil respiration is probably via two approaches: increasing litterfall and root metabolism, both consequently stimulating microbial activity in the mineral soil.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Ecol & Resource Management, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Fang, C (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Ecol & Resource Management, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,35,174,247,1,37,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,1998,205,2,,,,,135,146,,10.1023/A:1004304309827,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,168WK,WOS:000078716000005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ahlich, K; Rigling, D; Holdenrieder, O; Sieber, TN",,,,"Ahlich, K; Rigling, D; Holdenrieder, O; Sieber, TN",,,Dark septate hyphomycetes in Swiss conifer forest soils surveyed using Norway-spruce seedlings as bait,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PHIALOCEPHALA-FORTINII; ROOTS; FUNGI; ASSOCIATIONS,"Soil samples were collected under Norway-spruce trees (Picea abies (L.)

Surface-sterilized Norway-spruce seeds were sown into these pots and the seedlings were reared in a growth cabinet for 4 months. The root systems of nine seedlings per site were surface-sterilized and one 23 mm long segment of each of two root-diameter classes (class 1: dia < 1 mm, class 2: dia 1-2 mm) was aseptically excised from each root system and plated out on 2% (w/v) malt-extract agar to isolate fungi. Dark septate hyphomycetes (DSH) could be isolated from the soil samples of all except two sites. The frequency of seedling roots colonized by DSH ranged from 11-100%, the average being 76%. Colonization of root diameter class 2 was significantly higher than the one of class 1. No site-dependent pattern of colonization could be recognized except for the soil pH value. The frequency of DSH was correlated with the pH value of the collection sites and reached the maximum between pH values 3.5 and 4.5. The health status of the seedlings as measured by needle color, presence or absence of needle tip chlorosis, the number of living seedlings per pot and the dry weight was not correlated with the colonization of the roots by DSH. About 49% of the DSH sporulating after 1 y of incubation at 4 degrees C in the dark were identified as Phialocepllala fortinii. Advantages and disadvantages of the baiting technique are discussed.

The helm oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest at the Prades Experimental Complex of Catchments (PECC, NE Spain) was managed by clear-cutting until the 1950s. As a result of this practice, the forest has a high density (13000 stems ha(-1)) that is causing growth stagnation and intense competition for water. A thinning experiment was conducted to release resources, reduce stem competition and improve forest productivity Minirhizotrons were installed in two plots in each of the thinned and control stands and fine root dynamics quantified to a soil depth of 60 cm over a 2-year period (June 1994-May 1996). Soil water content was higher and soil water penetrated deeper in the soil (30-50 cm) in the thinned plots than in the control plots. In the control plots, soil temperature did not vary substantially with depth (mean = 11.65 degrees C), whereas soil temperature was higher in shallow horizons compared with deep horizons in the thinned plots. Mean soil temperature was one degree higher in the thinned plots than in the control plots (12.9 versus 11.9 degrees C). There were always more roots in the top 20 cm of soil in thinned plots than in control plots. In the thinned plots, more than 50% of root density (root no, cm(-2)) was located in the top 20 cm of soil, whereas root density never reached 50% in the 0-20 cm soil layer of the control plots. Roots longevity varied from 35 to 471 days, and there were significant differences between soil depths. Root longevity was greater in the control plots than in the thinned plots.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain","Lopez, B (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Avgda Diagonal 645, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain.",,"Sabate, Santiago/I-3395-2016","Sabate, Santiago/0000-0003-1854-0761",,,,33,57,61,1,18,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG-SEP,1998,18,9-Aug,,,,,601,606,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,113XY,WOS:000075580200015,12651348,,,,10/31/19J,"Tzfira, T; Vinocur, B; Altman, A; Vainstein, A",,,,"Tzfira, T; Vinocur, B; Altman, A; Vainstein, A",,,"rol-transgenic Populus tremula: root development, root-borne bud regeneration and in vitro propagation efficiency",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Populus tremula; rol Genes; root formation; transgenic plants,AGROBACTERIUM-RHIZOGENES; ASPEN PLANTS; RI-PLASMID; T-DNA; TRANSFORMATION; GENES; TOBACCO; PROMOTERS; SURFACE; GROWTH,"The potential use of the rol genes from Agrobacterium rhizogenes to improve the root system horticultural characteristics was evaluated in transgenic aspen (Populus tremula) plants, harboring the rol genes under their native promoters. Southern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the presence and expression of A. rhizogenes rolC and rolB genes in four different phenotypically selected transgenic clones. Several of the observed phenotypic modifications were related to rol-gene expression and included, in particular, modified root systems. All in vitro-cultured rol-transgenic plants exhibited extensive root formation in a hormone-free medium, as well as a larger root surface area and mass, as compared to a uidA (beta-glucuronidase-encoding)-transgenic aspen line and control (non-transformed) plants. Adventitiuus root formation in stem segments of rol-transgenic plants exhibited very rapid kinetics, resulting in a much shorter rooting time for rol-transgenic stem segments (e.g. 10 days for 80% rooting in rol-transgenic lines T-26 and T-27, as compared to Inure than 18 days for control nontransformed or uidA-transgenic aspen plants). rol-Transgenic plants maintained the capacity for 100% rooting throughout the year, versus 70-80% rooting in non-transformed plants during the winter. The four rol-transgenic lines exhibited differences in root development; in two of them enhanced root development was accompanied by increased shoot fresh weight. The root:shoot fresh weight ratio was always higher in rol-transgenic lines than in non-transformed plants. In the T-27 rol-transgenic line, the propagation coefficient of shoot-bud regeneration in liquid root culture was almost three times higher than in non-transformed plants. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on quantitative phenotypic alterations in rol-transgenic woody plants.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Kennedy Leigh Ctr Hort Res, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Otto Warburg Ctr Biotechnol Agr, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Altman, A (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Kennedy Leigh Ctr Hort Res, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",altman@agri.huji.ac.il,,,,,,39,13,15,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Twelve representative canopy gaps distributed across 600 ha of a naturally regenerated uneven-aged longleaf pine forest in the sandhills of north central Florida were examined to determine which aboveground and belowground factors are responsible for development of this seedling exclusionary zone. Within 12 m of adult trees growing along the gap edge, significantly fewer longleaf pine seedlings were present, The canopy of overstory trees, however, extended only 4-5 m into the gap. The relatively open structure of the longleaf pine canopy (57% cover) allowed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to be evenly distributed upon the forest floor across each canopy gap. Thus, light avail-ability was not related to pine seedling clustering near gap centers, Significantly greater forest litter mass beneath adult trees (5 Mg ha(-1)) could result in fires more intense than would be supported by the litter mass near gap centers (2.5 Mg ha(-1)). However, litter mass was significantly elevated only within 4 m of the gap edge. The fine root biomass within 12 m of the gap edge (3-4.5 Mg ha(-1)) was two to six times that measured near the gap center and most closely coincided with the width of the seedling exclusionary zone along the margin of each gap. Thus, while the canopy of adjacent adult trees may indirectly influence seedling mortality through deposition of needle litter and greater fire intensity within 4 m of the gap edge, the root systems of these adults also appear to directly compete with seedlings within 12-16 m of the gap edge for limited site resources, To effectively regenerate and sustain longleaf pine wiregrass ecosystems, caution should be used in prescribing single-tree selection harvest methods so as not to create gap openings so small (< 30 m diameter) that intraspecific competition from adult toes totally excludes seedlings. Group selection methods may prove more effective in creating canopy gaps of sizes suitable (greater than or equal to 40 m diameter) for ensuring that intraspecific competition from adults is maintained at a level which allows for survival and growth of seedlings. Shelterwood and deferment methods may also prove useful where more open canopy conditions are desired. However, the pine seedlings' need for light cannot be used as an appropriate rationale for application of clearcutting methods.

Grazed shrubs exhibited lower values of individual leaf area and weight, and a higher number of leaves per shoot. This means that a grazed shrub's photosynthetic area is divided into more numerous, although smaller, units. In grazed shrubs, 60 % of the total biomass was invested in below-ground parts, while in ungrazed shrubs, the highest proportion of the biomass (50 %) was allocated to woody tissues. The root structure of Q. coccifera shrubs was characterized by high biomass allocation to coarse roots (65 %) and low allocation to fine ones (7 %). The allocation to coarse roots was significantly increased in grazed shrubs. The temporal variations in above- and below-ground biomass appeared to be grazing independent. Above- and below-ground plant biomass increase during the period from late spring to September, the most severe period for the Mediterranean ecosystem. The intrinsic features of Q. coccifera, coupled with features induced by grazing, probably favor its dominance in areas degraded by grazing.

These Pythium strains were isolated from the roots of two of the plant species, Danthonia spicata and Panicum sphaerocarpon, used in a previous experiment on the consequences of changes in the soil community on plant growth. In this previous experiment, Danthonia and Panicum changed the soil community in a manner that reduced their growth relative to that of a third plant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum. In the current experiments, we found that inoculation with Pythium reduced overall plant mass and root:shoot ratios, but Danthonia and Panicum were more susceptible to the presence of Pythium than the other two plant species, Anthoxanthum and Plantago lanceolata. In addition, Pythium accumulates at different rates on different plant species, with a greater than tenfold higher population observed in association with Panicum compared to Anthoxanthum. The results of these experiments suggest that the accumulation of species-specific soil pathogens could account for the previous observation of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community. As negative feedback may act to maintain plant species diversity within a community, these results suggest that soil pathogens may themselves contribute to the maintenance of plant species diversity.","Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,38,167,177,1,102,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1595,1601,,10.2307/176779,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Nadelhoffer, KJ; Raich, JW; Aber, JD",,,,"Nadelhoffer, KJ; Raich, JW; Aber, JD",,,A global trend in belowground carbon allocation: Comment,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PINE PINUS-ELLIOTTII; FINE ROOT PRODUCTION; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; SIMULATION APPROACH; WESTERN WASHINGTON; TURNOVER; STAND,,"Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Iowa State Univ, Dept Bot, Ames, IA 50011 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Nadelhoffer, KJ (reprint author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,27,19,23,0,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1998,79,5,,,,,1822,1825,,10.2307/176802,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101CX,WOS:000074853000033,,,,,10/31/19J,"Van Tuinen, D; Jacquot, E; Zhao, B; Gollotte, A; Gianinazzi-Pearson, V",,,,"Van Tuinen, D; Jacquot, E; Zhao, B; Gollotte, A; Gianinazzi-Pearson, V",,,Characterization of root colonization profiles by a microcosm community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using 25S rDNA-targeted nested PCR,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,25S rDNA; arbuscular mycorrhiza; fungal detection; nested PCR; root community; specific primers; symbiosis,POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY; INFECTION; SEQUENCE; GLOMUS; PLANT,"The aim of the present work was to study colonization patterns in roots by different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi developing from a mixed community in soil. As different fungi cannot be distinguished with certainty in planta on the basis of fungal structures, taxon-discriminating molecular probes were developed. The 5' end of the large ribosomal subunit containing the variable domains D1 and D2 was amplified by PCR from Glomus mosseae (BEG12), G. intraradices (LPA8), Gignspora rosea (BEG9) and Scutellospora castanea (BEG1) using newly designed eukaryote-specific primers. Sequences of the amplification products showed high interspecies variability and PCR taxon-discriminating primers were designed to distinguish between each of these four fungi. A nested PCR, using universal eukaryotic primers for the first amplification and taxon-discriminating primers for the second, was performed on individual trypan blue-stained mycorrhizal root fragments of onion and leek, and root colonization by four fungi inoculated together in a microcosm experiment Tvas estimated. More than one fungus was detected in the majority of root fragments and all four fungi frequently co-existed within the same root fragment. Root colonization by G. mosseae and G. intraradices was similar from individual and mixed inoculum, whilst the frequency of S. castanea and Gig. rosea increased in the presence of the two Glomus species, suggesting that synergistic interactions may exist between some arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","INRA, Lab Phytoparasitol, CNRS, Ctr Microbiol Sol & Environm, F-21034 Dijon, France; Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; Scottish Agr Coll, Land Resources Dept, Aberdeen AB2 9TQ, Scotland","Van Tuinen, D (reprint author), INRA, Lab Phytoparasitol, CNRS, Ctr Microbiol Sol & Environm, BV 1540, F-21034 Dijon, France.",,,,,,,34,269,280,2,68,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Forty ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were selected from a wide range of latitudes (from 16 degrees N to 63 degrees N) to investigate genetic variation in plant size and relative growth rate (RGR) along a latitudinal gradient. Plants were grown in a greenhouse for 31 days, during which period three consecutive harvests were performed. Plants from high latitudes tended to have smaller plant size in terms of seed size, cotyledon width, rosette size, number of rosette leaves, size (leaf area) of the largest leaves, total leaf area, and total dry weight per plant than those from low latitudes. The mean (ISE) RGR across ecotypes was 0.229 (+/- 0.0013) day(-1). There was, however, significant ecotypic variation, with RGR being negatively correlated with latitude. The two main components of RGR, leaf area ratio (LAR) and unit leaf rate (ULR), were also correlated with latitude: LAR increased with increasing latitude while ULR decreased with increasing latitude. It was also found that RGR tended to be negatively correlated with LAR, specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) but to be positively correlated with mean area per leaf (MAL) and ULR. The variation in RGR among ecotypes was relatively small compared with that in the other traits. RGR may be a conservative trait, whose variation is constrained by the trade-off between its physiological (i.e. ULR) and morphological(i.e. LAR) components.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan","Hara, T (reprint author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",t-hara@orange.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp,"Hara, Toshihiko/D-8016-2012; Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666",,,,46,128,146,1,59,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1998,115,3,,,,,293,301,,10.1007/s004420050519,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101PM,WOS:000074877400001,28308418,,,,10/31/19J,"Ludwig, W; Amann, R; Martinez-Romero, E; Schonhuber, W; Bauer, S; Neef, A; Schleifer, KH",,,,"Ludwig, W; Amann, R; Martinez-Romero, E; Schonhuber, W; Bauer, S; Neef, A; Schleifer, KH",,,rRNA based identification and detection systems for rhizobia and other bacteria,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,hybridization; in situ identification; phylogeny; probe design; rhizobia; rRNA,16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; TARGETED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; COMPARATIVE SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; SP-NOV; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; GEN-NOV,"Ribosomal ribonucleic acids are excellent marker molecules for the elucidation of bacterial phylogeny; they also provide useful target sites for identification and detection with nucleic acid probes.

First, a probe was isolated from Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii strain P3 by removing those Sau3A restriction fragments from a P3 DNA digest which cross hybridized with pooled DNA from seven other strains of the same biovar. The remaining restriction fragments hybridized to DNA from strain P3 but not to DNA from any of the seven other strains. In a similar experiment another DNA probe, specific for the Rhizobium leguminosarum by. phaseoli and Rhizobium tropici group, was generated by removing sequences from R. leguminosarum by phaseoli strain Kim 5s with pooled subtracter DNA from eight other Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Agrobacterium species. The same subtraction hybridization technique was also used to isolate symbiotic genes from a Rhizobium species. Results from a 1:1 subtractive DNA hybridization of the broad host range Rhizobium sp NGR234 against highly homologous S. fredii USDA257, combined with those from competitive RNA hybridizations to cosmid digests of the NGR234 symbiotic plasmid, allowed the identification of several NGR234 loci which were flavonoid-inducible and not present in S. fredii USDA257.

Treatments involved a 33% decrease (DRY), 33% increase (WET), and ambient (AMB) levels of throughfall to the forest floor, begun in July, 1993. Video images of roots appearing on minirhizotron faces installed on both upper and lower slopes were recorded biweekly to a depth of 90 cm from April through October of 1994 and of 1996. Comparisons were made between treatments in amounts of new root elongation, root mortality, and calculated net root production. Minirhizotron observations during 1994 growing season, immediately following winter 1994 installation, revealed a strong effect of installation disturbance and were therefore not considered valid reflections of the response of the stand to the treatments. The 1996 data, on the other hand, exhibited absence of installation biases inherent in 1994 data because of a longer period since treatment initiation (2 2/3 yr vs. 8 mths), and favorable root growth conditions in all treatments during a greater portion of the year. The 1996 data were, therefore, considered realistic measures of below ground treatment responses. During 1996, net root production at 0-30 cm depth, at the upper slope positions, was significantly greater in DRY than in WET and AMB. Net root production was also greater at the lower slope position, but not significantly so. Treatment differences were the result of gross root production, as patterns of mortality did not differ across treatments. Nor were there significant treatment differences at depths below 30 cm. Whether trees in DRY produced more roots to replace root biomass lost during a previous drought year, or whether a new root:shoot ratio was beginning to develop in response to treatments, will require observations from the response of the stand in future years to be determined.","Tennessee Valley Author, Atmospher Sci & Environm Assessments, Norris, TN 37828 USA","Joslin, JD (reprint author), Tennessee Valley Author, Atmospher Sci & Environm Assessments, 17 Ridgeway Rd, Norris, TN 37828 USA.",jdjoslin@tva.gov,,,,,,32,39,46,0,19,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,1998,204,2,,,,,165,174,,10.1023/A:1004352008490,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,170JZ,WOS:000078803700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Shishido, M; Chanway, CP",,,,"Shishido, M; Chanway, CP",,,Storage effects on indigenous soil microbial communities and PGPR efficacy,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROMOTING BACILLUS STRAINS; SPRUCE SEEDLING GROWTH; C SOURCE UTILIZATION; MYCORRHIZAL INFECTION; RHIZOSPHERE BACTERIA; PATTERNS; PINE; IDENTIFICATION; COLONIZATION; SPECIFICITY,"We tested the hypothesis that storage-induced changes in the composition of soil microbial communities altered the efficacy of three Bacillus and three Pseudomonas plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains on spruce seedlings. Forest soils were collected from near Mackenzie, Salmon Arm and Williams Lake, B.C. Soil microbial population sizes were evaluated using dilution plating. Carbon substrate utilization patterns were determined on fresh forest soils and after 32 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C and -10 degrees C using the Biolog system. Small aliquots of fresh and stored soils comprising <2% of seedling growth medium were also used in PGPR assays. The population sizes of viable soil microorganisms, particularly bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, declined 10-1000 fold during soil storage at both temperatures. Differences in substrate utilization patterns-between soils and after storage treatments were also detected by Shannon's diversity index (H'), principal component analysis and cluster analysis of BIOLOG data. The three fresh soils formed a distinct cluster when plotted on ordination axes or by Euclidean distance. Williams Lake and Salmon Arm soils maintained a greater degree of substrate utilization diversity when stored frozen, but the opposite was true for Mackenzie soil. In general, the six PGPR strains had similar effects on spruce seedling growth within soil x storage treatments. Pseudomonas root colonization did not differ significantly between strains (Bacillus colonization was not evaluated), forest soils and storage treatments, but PGPR efficacy depended on the origin and treatment of forest soil. For example, spruce growth promotion was greatest in fresh Williams Lake and Salmon Arm soil, but PGPR efficacy in Mackenzie soil was greatest after storage at -10 degrees C. Our results support the hypothesis that storage-induced changes in soil microflora contribute to variability in PGPR efficacy, but we were unable to identify specific characteristics of these forest soils that related directly to plant growth response variability.

Thereafter, some of the plants were destructively harvested, Undisturbed root systems of the remaining plants were incubated in situ (IRS) for comparison with a disturbed incubation of the dried and ground roots (DRS) in their original soils. At the start of the incubation, elevated CO2 had increased total C-14-labeled soil C input by 44 and 27% at LN and HN, respectively, compared with input at ambient CO2, After incubation for 230 d, 40% of C-14 soil content was mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 in the disturbed system and 52% in the intact system. Native soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition of the DRS was lower than the SOM decomposition of the IRS, The formation of C-14-labeled soil microbial biomass (C-14-SMB) in the soil with DRS was 130% higher than in the soil with the IRS. Elevated CO2 decreased the decomposition of roots and root-derived products by 10% and increased the size of the C-14-SMB by 28% for both IRS and DRS, whereas the decomposition of SOM was not affected by CO2 at either LN or HN, After plant growth and in situ incubation, the C-14-labeled C in the soil solution showed a highly positive correlation with the amount of C-14-SMB, The ratio between C-14-labeled microorganisms and total (CO2)-C-14 evolved was not affected by elevated CO2, It seems that micrroorganisms adapt to changing soil C input under elevated CO2 and there is no effect on their turnover and behavior.","DLO, Dept Soil Ecol, AB, Res Inst Agrobiol & Soil Fertil, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","van Ginkel, JH (reprint author), DLO, Dept Soil Ecol, AB, Res Inst Agrobiol & Soil Fertil, POB 14, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,47,38,39,2,14,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Modelled surface flux density (f(m)) at the base of the tree was consistently greater than surface flux density (f(o)) measured 0.35 m away with an average ratio of f(m) to f(o) of 2.5 (R-2 = 0.83). This was explained by decreasing root length density (L-v) with radial distance from the tree stem. An exponential function for decrease of L-v and the surface flux density of CO2 with increasing radial distance from the tree stem and an analytical expression of the total CO2 flux from the soil around a growing tree root system were derived. Length scales for both the decrease in root length density and CO2 flux with radial distance were similar. An expression to estimate the radial distance from the tree stem, that gives an average plot value of CO2 surface flux density was also derived. (C)1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

All 12 plant species sampled in the forest were arbuscular mycorrhizal. The percent root infection and spore production were closely related to the phenology of the plants. Most tree species and all herbaceous species had the highest infection in the summer rainy season, bur two species, Opuntia excelsa and Jacquinia pungens, had highest infection in the dry season. Unusually high rainfall during the dry season was associated with increased infection bur not increased spore production. Spore density was low for all species at all sample times, except at the beginning of the July 1993 rainy season in, when we observed up to 28 spores/g soil. The percent cover of shrubs or herbs did nor increase in gaps after two years, and we observed no colonizing seedlings. No plane species with cover higher than 2.7 percent occurred exclusively in gaps or forest. The percent mycorrhizal infection did nor differ significantly between gaps and forest. Spore counts were as high in the gaps as in the forest in two of the three gaps but lower in the third gap. The lack of significant response of plants in these gaps after two years differed from the rapid response in tropical rainforests. it is likely related to the small size of the gaps and to light infiltration to the forest floor. Pastures were dominated by two species of exotic grasses and one species of mycorrhizal fungus, whereas forests had lj fungal species. The slow regrowth of vegetation in gaps was not limited by mycorrhiza fungi, since they were still abundant after the treefalls, bur recovery in pastures could be affected by low fungal diversity and dominance of grasses.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92527 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92521 USA; San Diego State Univ, Soil Ecol Restorat Grp, San Diego, CA 92521 USA; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Estac Biol Chamela, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Allen, EB (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92527 USA.",,,,,,,62,58,71,0,19,ASSOC TROPICAL BIOLOGY INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",6-Jun,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JUN,1998,30,2,,,,,261,274,,10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00060.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZW924,WOS:000074462000011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Annesi, T; Motta, E",,,,"Annesi, T; Motta, E",,,Hebeloma inoculation on Norway spruce seedlings in solarized and infested soil,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST PATHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DOUGLAS-FIR SEEDLINGS; PAXILLUS-INVOLUTUS; PURE CULTURE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; MYCORRHIZAE; PYTHIUM; FOREST; FUNGUS; GROWTH,"The effect of inoculation of Hebeloma sp. on the growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings was studied, in a controlled environment, with soil samples naturally infested by Pythium spp., Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani, and with samples of soil in which the pathogens had been controlled by solarization.

To test several hypotheses about acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis and respiration to differing light conditions, we investigated the interspecific relationships between leaf and root metabolism, chemistry and morphology in high and low light conditions for young seedlings of nine boreal tree species that differ in relative growth rate (RGR). 2. Light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(sat)), whole-plat nitrogen (N) uptake rates, leaf and root respiration and morphology, and RGR all varied in parallel among the nine species when grown in both 5% and 25% of full sunlight. RGR, A(sat), leaf and root respiration (R-d), and N uptake rate per unit root mass or length differed significantly among species, ranking (from high to low): Populus, Betula and Larix SPP (all deciduous) and then to five evergreen conifers (Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp,), which were generally comparable in these measures. 3, A(sat), leaf and root R-d and N uptake rates were all correlated (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9) with species traits, such as seed mass, leaf life span and shade-tolerance rankings. Mass-based A(sat) was greater in conifer seedlings raised in low than high light. In contrast, area-based A(sat) was higher for plants grown in high than low light, especially in the deciduous species. Once adjusted for differences in plant mass, leaf or root respiration rates did not differ for plants grown in low vs high light. 4, Interspecific variation in RGR was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with rates of photosynthesis, respiration and N uptake. Leaf photosynthesis and respiration rates were correlated to specific leaf area and leaf N concentrations (r approximate to 0.9). Root respiraristi rates, N uptake rates, specific root length (root length per root dry mass) and root N concentrations were all highly correlated with each other (r approximate to 0.8 to 0.9). These data suggest a close coupling of tissue-level metabolism, chemistry and structure with whole-plant performance and species ecophysiological and life-history traits.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Reich, PB (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 1530 N Cleveland Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,"Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016","Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,34,330,363,5,133,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Quantities comparable to the carbon cost of the symbiosis for an individual plant may be transferred. 2, We measured C transfer between linked plants of the grass Cynodon dactylon (C-4, delta(13)C approximate to - 14 parts per thousand) and the herb Plantago lanceolata (C-3, delta(13)C similar to - 28 parts per thousand). To test the hypothesis that the carbon transferred between plants remained in fungal structures at all times, plants were grown for two harvests; at the first harvest they were clipped to ground level, so that shoot re-growth required the transport of carbon from the roots. We also tested the influence of the direction of growth of the fungus, to determine whether C was transported out of or into a newly colonized root, and of growing plants in elevated CO2, to increase the availability of carbon compounds in the roots. 3, Large amounts of C were transferred between linked plants, more so into Plantago than into Cynodon roots. Transfer occurred whether root systems were separated by a 20 mu m mesh, that excluded roots but not hyphae, or a 0.45 mu m mesh, intended to act as a barrier to hyphae as well. We believe that the high root densities achieved in the experiment allowed hyphae to cross the finer mesh between the two dense root mars. 4. Clipping the plants did not result in any movement of C from roots to shoots, thus confining the prediction that all C transferred remains in fungal structures. 5, The direction of growth of the fungus did not affect the direction of transfer, nor did the CO2 concentration in which the plants were grown. 6, The amount of C transferred was a positive correlate of the frequency of vesicles in the roots but a negative correlate of the frequency of hyphae, if C were moving into developing colonization Units, thus effectively giving the plant a 'free' symbiosis, the correlation with internal hyphae should be positive. The positive correlation with vesicles suggests that C is moving into fungal storage structures. 7. We propose a mycocentric view of the phenomenon of interplant C transfer, in which the fungal colonies within roots are seen as parts of an extended mycelium between which the fungus moves resources depending on the dynamics of its own growth. We do not believe that the transfer has an impact on plant C budgets or fitness, but that it may be a major element in the understanding of fungal C budgets.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO1 5YW, N Yorkshire, England; Scottish Crop Res Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Fitter, AH (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO1 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Robinson, David/C-2112-2009","Robinson, David/0000-0003-3504-5981",,,,19,97,111,2,62,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

[Matt.] Liebl.; Lappwald and Sprakensehl sites) were investigated, and soil texture, bulk density, duration of waterlogging periods and the water available in the mineral soil were determined. For Neuenburg and Sprakensehl, the available soil water was related to leaf water parameters determined in a separate investigation. At the clayey and hydromorphic sites of Neuenburg and Lappwald, the measurements were performed in each one healthy and one damaged part of the site, which differed in the number of oaks with crown damage. In the damaged stand of Neuenburg, the clay content of the subsoil was higher than in the healthy stand, and the soil water availability was reduced especially in dry periods. Compared to healthy oaks of the healthy stand, the density of finest plus fine roots as well as the biomasses of finest roots were lower beneath damaged oaks of the damaged stand. With decreasing relative available soil water (actually available water in relation to water available at the saturation state), the relative leaf water content decreased in damaged, but not in healthy oaks. At Lappwald, similar differences in soil water availability between the healthy and the damaged stand were found, but had no effect on the distribution or biomass of the roots. At the sandy site (Sprakensehl), the available soil water decreased drastically during a dry period, and predawn leaf water potentials of both healthy and damaged oaks declined with decreasing relative available soil water. However, the damaged oaks were not inferior to the healthy ones with respect to root density and biomass. It is concluded that, in the damaged stand of Neuenburg, the high clay content of the subsoil, which results in prolonged periods of waterlogging, in sharp changes from waterlogging to drought and decreased water availability in dry periods, is the reason for the reduced biomass and density of roots of the pedunculate oak. Thus, in northwestern Germany, unfavourable soil water relations are considered as a factor contributing to crown damage of pedunculate oak at hydromorphic sites, but not to damage of sessile oak.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Pflanzenwissensch, Abt Okol & Okosyst Forsch, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Niedersachsische Forstliche Versuchsanstalt, Abt Waldschutz, D-37079 Gottingen, Germany","Thomas, FM (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Pflanzenwissensch, Abt Okol & Okosyst Forsch, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",,"Thomas, Frank/H-8418-2019",,,,,26,30,30,0,27,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1998,203,1,,,,,145,158,,10.1023/A:1004305410905,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,138DE,WOS:000076955500015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Claassen, VP; Marler, M",,,,"Claassen, VP; Marler, M",,,Annual and perennial grass growth on nitrogen-depleted decomposed granite,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REPLACEMENT; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; AMMONIA,"Decomposed granite (DG) is often difficult to revegetate because of its low nitrogen (N) content and poor physical properties.

This study evaluates the effect of N availability on two potential DG revegetation species: an invasive, exotic annual grass (Bromus mollis) and a native perennial grass (Elymus glaucus). Plants in 10-L pots filled with DG were irrigated with all essential elements except N, which was provided in treatments ranging from zero to 1000 mu M NO3-N. Shoot biomass and root distribution were measured in monocultures and in mixtures of annual and perennial plants, both when the two species were seeded simultaneously and when the perennials were seeded 50 days prior to the annuals. At the higher N treatments, growth of annuals exceeded that of perennials. At solution N concentrations lower then the 50-100 mu M treatments, however, growth of the perennial grasses equaled or exceeded that of the annuals. When seeded simultaneously, both species showed reduced biomass in mixtures to an extent similar to that when each species grew alone. When the perennials were already established, the biomass of annuals was reduced proportionately more than that of perennials, even at the highest N treatment. At low and medium N treatments, root placement of the perennial was deeper than that of the annual. At high N treatments, however, root distribution of both species was similar, and the deep rooting characteristic of the perennial was no longer observed.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Claassen, VP (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,16,30,34,1,15,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

We examined competition in an old field with low diversity to test whether this shift occurred along a productivity gradient without species turnover. Forty plots received one of four nitrogen treatments (0, 5, or 15 g added N m(-2) yr(-1) or 400 g m(-2) yr(-1) of sawdust added to immobilize N) annually for 5 yr. All N levels were dominated by the perennial grasses Agropyron cristatum and Bromus inermis. Transplants of Agropyron were grown with all neighbors, roots of neighbors, or no neighbors present to measure total, root, and shoot competition. Transplant growth was 22%-165% higher in subplots without neighbors present, which indicates that competition occurred. Competition from neighbor roots was primarily responsible for suppression of transplant growth over the entire productivity gradient. In contrast to previous field experiments that found either an increase in total competition intensity or a shift from root to shoot competition with increasing productivity, we found neither. Increases in total competition intensity or shifts from root to shoot competition found along other gradients may be caused by changes in species composition and not by increased resources or neighbor biomass. These results suggest that different competitive mechanisms may operate in low-diversity vegetation than in more diverse natural vegetation.","Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; Saskatchewan Conservat Data Ctr, Regina, SK S4S 5W6, Canada","Peltzer, DA (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",Peltzer@leroy.cc.uregina.ca,"Peltzer, Duane A/A-9463-2009; Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011","Peltzer, Duane A/0000-0001-7724-3738; ",,,,79,79,83,0,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5801 S ELLIS AVENUE, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The mycorrhizal treatments were nursery inoculation with Pisolithus arhizus and forest soil addition to the planting holes. The soil preparation treatments were terracing (mechanical and manual) and the addition of an organic amendment (urban solid refuse). One year after planting, the study revealed significant differences in mycorrhization levels, frequency of mycorrhizal species, fine root production and growth between the inoculated seedlings and the noninoculated controls. Inoculation with P. arhizus gave better pine growth and mycorrhization rates than the addition of forest soil. Both mycorrhization treatments were particularly effective in combination with mechanical terracing, The organic amendment had no apparent negative influence on the mycorrhization level of the seedlings and significantly improved pine growth, The beneficial effects of mycorrhization treatments on P. halepensis growth persisted 2 yr after pi anti ng, The increase in growth of the seedlings due to the treatments could be attributed to the change in soil conditions (increased fertility and soil aeration) and probably to a mycorrhization effect on water relations, although it has not been clearly demonstrated.","CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Murcia 30080, Spain","Roldan, A (reprint author), CSIC, Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Apdo 4195, Murcia 30080, Spain.",aroldan@naturs.cebas.csic.es,"Querejeta, Jose I/B-6297-2008; Albaladejo, Juan/G-4184-2011; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013; Castillo, Victor/B-1597-2009","Querejeta, Jose I/0000-0002-9547-0974; Castillo, Victor/0000-0003-2723-4918; Roldan, Antonio/0000-0002-2610-7784; Albaladejo, Juan/0000-0002-9603-3864",,,,50,55,58,0,7,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0015-749X,,,FOREST SCI,For.

Information is needed on the survival of these introduced strains in forests and their impact on indigenous biodiversity. Dissemination and persistence of an American strain, L. bicolor S238N, were studied 10 years after outplanting in a Douglas fir plantation located at Saint-Brisson (Morvan, France). About 430 Laccaria spp. sporophores were collected over 3 years. Inheritance of nuclear ribosomal DNA, as well as RAPD markers, was characterized in L. bicolor S238N, using a haploid progeny set of 91 monokaryons. More than 50 markers were identified (19 heterozygous and 33 homozygous or cytoplasmic markers), which unambiguously confirmed that the introduced strain was still present in the inoculated plots. Neither selfing (P < 0.0008) nor introgression with indigenous strains was detected although in vitro interfertility between the American strain and indigenous L. bicolor was identified. No ingress of the introduced genet into adjacent uninoculated plots colonized by various local Laccaria genets was detected. It is proposed that the spatial distributions identified have developed through mycelial propagation of the introduced strain and intraspecific competition with native genets. Although longer-term data is still lacking, the stability of the inoculant strain and the limited disturbance to indigenous populations described support large-scale nursery production of this host-fungal combination.","INRA, Ctr Rech Nancy, Equipe Microbiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Selosse, MA (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Rech Nancy, Equipe Microbiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",,,,,,,47,67,69,0,6,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The morphology of seven culture isolates originating from the smooth mycorrhiza-like root tips of two different spruce trees was congruent with the morphology of axenic culture isolates obtained from ascospores of G. carbonaria. DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 from these root-derived cultures and the ascosporic G. carbonaria culture isolates were found to be identical, further supporting the conclusion that the isolates were conspecific. The extensive ascocarp and ascospore formation of G. carbonaria which succeeds a forest fire may be explained in terms of a fungal escape from a moribund tree associate.

Although the ecology of this region has been extensively studied, there is little information on how increasing atmospheric CO2 will affect it. This growth chamber study investigated gas exchange, water relations, growth, and biomass and carbohydrate partitioning in B. gracilis and P. gracilis grown under present ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations of 350 mu l l(-1) and 700 mu l l(-1), respectively, and two deficit irrigation regimes. The experiment was conducted in soil-packed columns planted to either species over a 2-month period under summer-like conditions and with no fertilizer additions. Our objective was to better under stand how these species and the functional groups they represent will respond in future CO2-enriched environments. Leaf CO2 assimilation (A(n)), transpiration use efficiency (TUE, or A(n)/transpiration), plant growth, and whole-plant water use efficiency (WUE, or plant biomass production/water evapotranspired) of both species were greater at elevated CO2, although responses were more pronounced for P. smithii. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis, TUE, and growth in both species through higher soil water content (SWC) and leaf water potentials (Psi) and stimulation of photosynthesis. Consumptive water use was greater and TUE less for P. smithii than B. gracilis during early growth when soil water was more available. Declining SWC with time was associated with a steadily increased sequestering of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNCs), storage carbohydrates (primarily fructans for P. Smithii) and biomass in belowground organs of P. smithii, but not B. gracilis. The root:shoot ratio of P. smithii also increased at elevated CO2 while the root:shoot ratio of B. gracilis was unresponsive to CO2. These partitioning responses may be the consequence of different ontogenetic strategies of a cool-season and warm-season grass entering a warm, dry summer period; the cool-season P. smithii responds by sequestering TNCs belowground in preparation for summer dormancy, while resource partitioning of the warm-season B. gracilis remains unaltered. One consequence of greater partitioning of resources into P. smithii belowground organs in the present study was maintenance of higher Psi and A(n) rates. This, along with differences in photosynthetic pathway, may have accounted for the greater responsiveness of P. smithii to CO2 enrichment compared to B. gracilis.","USDA ARS, Crops Res Lab, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; US Salin Lab, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Front Range Community Coll, Dept Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA","Morgan, JA (reprint author), USDA ARS, Crops Res Lab, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",,,,,,,38,42,45,1,22,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1998,114,4,,,,,483,493,,10.1007/s004420050472,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZR339,WOS:000073964200005,28307897,,,,10/31/19J,"Kleinschmidt, R; Hentschke, I; Rothe, GM",,,,"Kleinschmidt, R; Hentschke, I; Rothe, GM",,,Effect of season and soil treatments on carbohydrate concentrations in Norway spruce (Picea abies) mycorrhizae,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbohydrates; liming; mycorrhiza; roots; seasonal variation; soil acidification,ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; METABOLISM; SUCROSE; ROOTS,"We studied effects of season and soil treatments (watering, acidification, liming and combinations of these treatments) on soluble carbohydrates of mycorrhizal roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Two different fungicides, copper oxychloride and propiconazole, with different modes of actions, were used. Propiconazole treatment reduced mycorrhizal infection in both years while copper oxychloride treatment and ozone exposure slightly stimulated mycorrhizal infection after the first year. Different mycorrhizal morphotypes showed different kinds of responses to the two fungicides. Light brown morphotype appeared to be the most sensitive one to propiconazole treatment. After the second year, ectendomycorrhizas disappeared in propiconazole treatment while in control treatment ectendomycorrhizas formed the majority of the light brown morphotype. The root biomass was not affected by fungicide treatments, but ozone exposure increased the total amount of short roots and the fresh weight of propiconazole treated roots. No significant differences in the concentrations of ergosterol, starch and total phenolics in pine roots between treatments were found. However, ergosterol concentration correlated positively with the mycorrhizal infection level. Both fungicides reduced the soil respiration compared to controls. At the ultrastructural level, both fungicides caused increased transparency and gradual granulation and degeneration of cytoplasm in the fungal symbiont of mycorrhizal short roots. Slightly elevated ozone did not have harmful effects on root ultrastructure. These results suggest that fungicides have deleterious effects on the quantity and quality of mycorrhizas in Scots pine roots and also side-effects on non-target soil fungi. Some of these deleterious effects were noticeable only at the ultrastructural level.","Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland","Manninen, AM (reprint author), Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, POB 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",Anne-Marja.Manninen@uku.fi,,,,,,45,26,29,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

The amount of salt-extractable cations was measured, as well as the chemical composition of equilibrium soil extracts obtained from sequential batch experiments. A model of coupled equilibria which included solubility of sparingly soluble salts, multiple cation exchange and inorganic complexation was used to describe the observed soil chemical changes. Fire caused large increases in the salt-extractable and soluble cations in the surface (0-2.5 cm) soil in ashbeds, but this decreased with time after fire. The model adequately described the temporal changes in the sorption of Na, K, Mg and Ca from the batch experiments using surface soil. The concentration of Ca measured in the equilibrium extracts indicated that sparingly soluble Ca compounds in the ash were controlling the solubility of Ca until at least 4 yrs after slash fire. Changes in the concentration of Ca and Mg could be described by including solubility product principles in the model. The modelling results suggested that the nature of sparingly soluble salts in the ash changed from a relatively soluble magnesian calcite 1 day after the fire to an insoluble magnesian calcite (or calcite) after 4 yrs. Soil organic C increased after the fire, but this was not reflected in any change in the cation exchange capacity of the soil. It is suggested that the measured increase in organic C was mainly due to the progressive inclusion of more decomposing fine root fragments in the sieved (< 5 mm) soil with time after intense heating of soil under the ashbeds. This fraction of organic matter although increasing total soil C content, added little to active exchange sites.

Frost hardiness was determined by several methods and the recovery as survival of the seedlings. The highest frost hardiness was achieved in the distal parts of needles (-21 to -27 degrees C) and in the proximal parts of needles (-18 to -250C), followed by woody roots (-7 to -9 degrees C), the 1-year-old and current stem (-8 degrees C), and the fine roots (-5 degrees C), all at the end of H2. Hardening of needles was induced by SD, but the stem and woody roots started to harden later, as a response to low temperature. As a result of frost treatment during LD and SD, potential plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity of roots decreased as electrolyte leakage increased and extracellular resistance decreased, but this relationship was lost during H1 and H2. The present study demonstrates the lack of hardening capacity in the fine roots of Scots pine seedlings at nonfreezing temperatures and the increased mortality of the young seedlings having frost damage on roots.","Finnish Forest Res Inst, Suonenjoki Res Stn, FIN-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland; Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Ryyppo, A (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Suonenjoki Res Stn, Juntintie 40, FIN-77600 Suonenjoki, Finland.",Aija.Ryyppo@Metla.Fi; Tapani.Repo@Forest.Joensuu.Fi; Elina.Vapaavuori@Metla.Fi,,,,,,46,42,56,0,5,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Odontites vulgaris attached to the legume and E. minima attached to the grass produced more leaves and flowers and accumulated more biomass than unattached parasites. In contrast, the biomass of O. vulgaris grown with the grass and that of E. minima grown with the legume as host did not differ from that of unattached parasites. Odontites vulgaris attached to the grass were taller and invested relatively more biomass into stems and less into leaves than parasites without a host or with the legume as host. In contrast, reproductive allocation was highest and root allocation lowest in O. vulgaris attached to the legume. Euphrasia minima attached to a host invested more into reproduction than unattached parasites. The two hemiparasites differed in their effects on the hosts. While E. minima had no negative effects on host growth, O. vulgaris reduced the biomass of both host species and also reduced total productivity per pot (parasite + host).

If mycorrhizal formation could be enhanced by co-inoculation with bacteria which promote rapid root colonisation by specific ectomycorrhizal fungi, as demonstrated by certain bacteria in the Douglas fir-laccaria bicolor association, this would be of advantage to the eucalypt forest industry. Two bacterial isolates with a demonstrated Mycorrhization Helper Bacteria (MHB) effect on ectomycorrhiza formation between Pseudotsuga menziesii and Laccaria bicolor (S238), and seven Western Australian bacterial isolates from Laccaria fraterna sporocarps or ectomycorrhizas were tested in isolation for their effect on ectomycorrhizal development by three Laccaria spp. with Eucalyptus diversicolor seedlings. Mycorrhizal formation by L. fraterna (E710) as measured by percentage infected root tips, increased significantly (p < 0.05) by up to 296% in treatments coinoculated with MHB isolates from France (Pseudomonas fluorescens Bbc6 or Bacillus subtilis MB3), or indigenous isolates (Bacillus sp. Elf28 or a pseudomonad Elf29). In treatments coinoculated with L. laccata (E766) and the MHB isolate I! fluorescens (Bbc6) mycorrhizal development was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05). A significant Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) effect was observed where the mean shoot d.w. of seedlings inoculated only with an unidentified bacterium (Elf21), was 49% greater than the mean of uninoculated controls (-fungus, -bacterium). Mean shoot d.w. of seedlings coinoculated with L. bicolor (S-238), which did not form ectomycorrhizas with E. diversicolor; and an unidentified bacterium (Slf14) or Bacillus sp. (Elf28) were significantly higher than uninoculated seedlings or seedlings inoculated with L. bicolor (S-238) alone. This is the first time that an MHB effect has been demonstrated in a eucalypt-ectomycorrhizal fungus association. These organisms have the potential to improve ectomycorrhizal development on eucalypts under nursery conditions and this is particularly important for fast growing eucalypt species where the retention time of seedlings in the nursery is of short duration (2-3 months).","Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA 6150, Australia","Dell, B (reprint author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",,,"Dell, Bernard/0000-0001-8623-6425",,,,36,36,44,1,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,1998,201,2,,,,,241,249,,10.1023/A:1004329626763,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,114AW,WOS:000075587800009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Makkonen, K; Helmisaari, HS",,,,"Makkonen, K; Helmisaari, HS",,,Seasonal and yearly variations of fine-root biomass and necromass in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) stand,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass; fine-root; Pinus; Scots pine; seasonal variation,ABIES-AMABILIS STANDS; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; ORGANIC-MATTER; YOUNG; PRODUCTIVITY; WASHINGTON; DYNAMICS; GROWTH,"Seasonal variations of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), dwarf shrub and grass fine-root biomass and necromass were studied in a pole stage Scots pine stand in eastern Finland during three successive growing seasons.

A. caven was specific for effectivity since the amount of N-2 which was fixed markedly depended on the strain. The relative efficiency (RE) of 6 out of the 11 strains used was higher than 0.80, suggesting they had an active uptake hydrogenase. Ac5, a strain isolated from A. caven, exhibited the highest N-2-fixing ability and highest NE (nodule efficiency) when inoculated on its host and also had the highest RE. Shoot dry weight and acetylene reducing activity (ARA) were significantly correlated with the amount of N-2 fixed (determined by the total nitrogen difference method); indicating that any of these methods could be used for screening the strains according to their ability to fix N-2. The relative efficiency was not correlated with any of these parameters.

Forest floor disturbance was kept to a minimum during and following clear-cutting. One and two years after clear-cutting and wood chip application, aspen roots in uncut, clear-cut, and clear-cut plus application of a 5 cm or 10 cm layer of wood chips were examined for their ectomycorrhizal (EM) status while roots of the grass, Calamagrostis canadensis, were assessed for their AM status. There was extensive mortality of aspen roots during the first 2 years after cutting although many roots persisted for 1 year and small pockets of regenerating roots were detected after 2 years. Percent mycorrhizal colonization of aspen roots was 90-100% in all treatments over the term of the study indicating that the inoculum potential of the EM fungi was maintained for 2 years post-harvest. Cenococcum geophilum, Cortinarius spp., Russula spp. and Tomentella spp. were abundant on roots from all treatments. Clear-cutting and wood chip application did not seem to reduce the regeneration potential of these fungi over the short-term. In addition to the aforementioned genera, Piloderma byssinum occurred frequently in the unharvested plots, Mycelium radicis atrovirens was common in plots which had received 5 cm of wood chips while Hebeloma was abundant in plots spread with 10 cm of wood chips. With the exception of the 10 cm wood chip treatment, the majority of aspen mycorrhizae were formed by fungi which produce microscopic, resupinate or hypogeous fruitbodies rather than large fleshy fruitbodies. AM colonization of C. canadensis roots was inhibited by the application of 10 cm of wood chips but was unaffected by harvesting and the application of 5 cm of wood chips. Short-term effects of clear-cutting and wood chip treatment on the colonizing abilities of EM and AM fungi appeared to be minimal; long-term impacts require further monitoring.

Whereas A. caven bore many nodules in all soil types observed, Prosopis nigra and P. affinis were always poorly nodulated. Seedlings of E. crista-galli bore aerial nodules at the base of their stem when grown in waterlogged conditions. The morphology, structure and nitrogenase activity (ARA) of the aerial nodules were similar to root nodules. Nodulation ability of Geoffroea decorticans was not confirmed. The species belonging to the Caesalpinoideae sub-family did not nodulate and were unable to do so even when they were inoculated with a mixture of rhizobia strains, thus confirming previous observations. Nodule morphology was described according to Corby's classification. Anatomical studies showed the presence of spaces in the inner zone of A. caven nodules. E. crista-galli and Enterolobium contortisiliquum nodules exhibited several infected zones, probably related to the coralloid morphology of the nodules. The acetylene-reducing activity of the nodules of the different species was generally low. Rhizobial strains were isolated from the most active nodules for future investigations.

A mycorrhiza-specific band was found when the phosphatase was stained under alkaline conditions. To clarify the origin of this phosphatase, the phosphatase extracted from intraradical hyphae was also compared with the phosphatase from mycorrhizal roots by electrophoresis. The intraradical hyphae was isolated from mycorrhizal roots by enzyme digestion followed by Percoll gradient centrifugation. The soluble protein was extracted from the hyphae by ultra-sonication after treatment with chitinase. A phosphatase in the hyphal soluble protein showed a similar, but slightly higher, relative mobility on the gel, compared with the mycorrhiza-specific phosphatase from roots. By adding the hyphal extract to the root extract, the relative mobility of the mycorrhiza-specific phosphatase was slightly changed and became identical to that of the phosphatase in the hyphae.

This corresponds to the evolutionary principle that vegetation has adapted to make best use of its local environment. We demonstrate this method with a simple coupled biosphere/soil hydrology model and find that deep rooted vegetation is predicted in most parts of the tropics. Even with a simple model like the one we use, it is possible to reproduce biome averages of observations fairly well. By using the optimized rooting depths global Annual Net Primary Production (and transpiration) increases substantially compared to a standard rooting depth of one meter, especially in tropical regions that have a dry season. The decreased river discharge due to the enhanced evaporation complies better with observations. We also found that the optimization process is primarily driven by the water deficit/surplus during the dry/wet season for humid and arid regions, respectively. Climate variability further enhances rooting depth estimates. In a sensitivity analysis where we simulate changes in the water use efficiency of the vegetation we find that vegetation with an optimized rooting depth is less vulnerable to variations in the forcing. We see the main application of this method in the modelling communities of land surface schemes of General Circulation Models and of global Terrestrial Biosphere Models. We conclude that in these models, the increased soil water storage is likely to have a significant impact on the simulated climate and the carbon budget, respectively. Also, effects of land use change like tropical deforestation are likely to be larger than previously thought.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Kleidon, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",,"Kleidon, Axel/O-7843-2014; Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016","Kleidon, Axel/0000-0002-3798-0730; Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113",,,,30,81,82,1,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Love]; 'Hycrest', a cultivar of hybrid crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult. X A. cristatum (L.) Gaert.]; and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Greenhouse-grown seedlings were clipped once or twice at 3 intensities of defoliation (0, 50, and 70 %). The topology (pathlength-slope index), geometry (link length and root diameter), and morphology (total root length and specific root length) of roots of the 3 grasses were evaluated 28, 35, and 42 days after planting. Root topology (Peslope index) did not vary among defoliation treatments but did vary among species across harvests. Root branching of the grazing-tolerant Hycrest decreased through time, while root branching of the grazing-sensitive Whitmar increased through time. Cheatgrass maintained a highly branched root system throughout the experiment. Specific root length in Hycrest and Whitmar decreased through time, indicating that roots became coarser with age. Similar to its topological response, cheatgrass did not exhibit changes in specific root length through time. There were apparent tradeoffs between link lengths of the main axis and lateral roots of the seminal root, which may lead to important changes in root branching density, root production costs, and probably root function.","Utah State Univ, Dept Rangeland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Forage & Range Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Arredondo, JT (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Dept Rangeland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",,"Arredondo Moreno, Jose/A-9972-2015","Arredondo Moreno, Jose/0000-0003-1969-9942",,,,49,13,14,0,9,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

Our taxonomic sample is highly biased toward known ectomycorrhizal (EM) taxa, but also includes some related saprobic species. This gene fragment can be amplified directly from mycorrhizae, sequenced, and used to determine the family or subfamily of many unknown mycorrhizal basidiomycetes. The method is robust to minor sequencing errors, minor misalignments, and method of phylogenetic analysis. Evolutionary inferences are limited by the small size and conservative nature of the gene fragment. Nevertheless two interesting patterns emerge: (i) the switch between ectomycorrhizae and saprobic lifestyles appears to have happened convergently several and perhaps many times; and (ii) at least five independent lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi are characterized by very short branch lengths. We estimate that two of these groups radiated in the mid-Tertiary, and we speculate that these radiations may have been caused by the expanding geographical range of their host trees during this period.

These results suggest that tree species or groups of species with varied N-use efficiencies altered soil N transformation rates in a predictable manner.","Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Agr Sci Para, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","Smith, CK (reprint author), Univ Laval, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"DeAssis OLIVEIRA, Francisco/H-9994-2012","DeAssis OLIVEIRA, Francisco/0000-0002-4720-3492",,,,49,22,28,1,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,1998,200,2,,,,,193,204,,10.1023/A:1004348116786,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,101BK,WOS:000074849600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Palmborg, C; Nordgren, A; Baath, E",,,,"Palmborg, C; Nordgren, A; Baath, E",,,Multivariate modelling of soil microbial variables in forest soil contaminated by heavy metals using wet chemical analyses and pyrolysis GC/MS,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; FATTY-ACID COMPOSITION; PINE NEEDLE LITTER; ORGANIC-MATTER; LEAF-LITTER; DECOMPOSITION RATES; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; ROOT BIOMASS; FINE-ROOT; QUALITY,"Microbial activity, biomass and community patterns were measured in the forest soils surrounding a large smelter emitting heavy metals and sulphur in northern Sweden. The chemical background to the high variation of the microbial variables in mor samples with a content of Cu + Zn between 100 and 1000 mu g g(-1) organic matter was investigated. Soil respiration rate was modelled using different combinations of wet chemistry data and pyrolysis. A combination of carbohydrate data, humus fractionation data and physicochemical data explained 86% of the variance in soil respiration rate. Pyrolysis data explained less variance and was more difficult to interpret. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns in the soils were also analysed. A multivariate (MVP-PLS) model of basal respiration rate, substrate induced respiration (SIR), lag time after glucose addition and the scores from the first component of a principal components analysis (PCA) of 33 phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAcompl) was made. The explained variance for basal respiration rate was 75%, for SIR 85%, for lag time 52% and for PLFAcompl 82%. Respiration rate and SIR were negatively correlated to the amount of soil organic matter in the mor layer (SOM m(-2)), nitrogen content and humic acids and positively correlated to glucans and humins. The content of base cations and pH were positively correlated to respiration rate and SIR and negatively correlated to lag time. The phospholipid fatty acid patterns (PLFAcompl) showed that fungal fatty acid patterns dominated in shallow mor layers with higher cellulose content, while gram-positive bacteria were more abundant in thicker mor layers with more humic acids and a higher nitrogen content. The variation in the microbial variables was partitioned into a heavy metal dependent and an organic matter quality dependent part, which increased the correlation between heavy metals and the microbial variables.

In an attempt to develop a more rational approach to the selection of giants and bacteria, a laboratory model system was constructed using an acidic, fresh Ultisol from an old-field. The objective of the study was to evaluate this system by determining the effect of low-level liming of the son to pH(w) 4.62, 4.76, 4.83, and 4.95, and rhizobial inoculation, on the establishment and functioning of the Trifolium repens, L./Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii symbiosis. The soil, as taken from the field, was low in pH(w) (4.65) and base saturation (45%), relatively high in Al (2.4 cmol kg(1)), and essentially devoid of naturalized rhizobia. For the symbiotically-grown (inoculated) plants, beneficial effects of liming to only pH(w) 4.83 on shoot mass, shoot N uptake, nodule number, and ARA, but not root mass and length, were detected as early as 3 weeks. Near-linear responses to soil pH increases were found for shoot mass, shoot N uptake, nodule number, and acetylene reduction activity at 5 and, with the exception of ARA, 7 weeks. Root mass, but not length, also responded positively to liming at these later times. Soil pH and basic cation-and aluminum-associated properties were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) correlated with shoot mass and shoot N uptake. Although correlations (r) improved with time, they never exceeded 0.80, even at 7 weeks. Asymbiotically grown (NH(4)NO(3)-treated) plants gave similar shoot responses, but at different times, indicating dissimilar growth rate responses compared with the symbiotically grown plants. Rhizobial inoculum levels altered the outcome of the symbiosis significantly, indicative of a rhizobial survival limitation. Taken together, these results suggest that both partners of the symbiosis, plants and rhizobia, were affected adversely by the stressful chemical composition of the soil. More importantly these results demonstrate the utility of the model system for studying the early (3 weeks or less) effects of low-level liming on the development of the white clover symbiosis in a near-natural, acidic Ultisol.","USDA ARS, NAA, Appalachian Soil & Water Conservat Res Lab, Beaver, WV 25813 USA","Staley, TE (reprint author), USDA ARS, NAA, Appalachian Soil & Water Conservat Res Lab, POB 400, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",tstaley@asrr.arsusda.gov,,,,,,34,5,5,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,MAR,1998,163,3,,,,,230,240,,10.1097/00010694-199803000-00008,,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,ZE442,WOS:000072793000008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Futamata, H; Sakai, M; Ozawa, H; Urashima, Y; Sueguchi, T; Matsuguchi, T",,,,"Futamata, H; Sakai, M; Ozawa, H; Urashima, Y; Sueguchi, T; Matsuguchi, T",,,Chemotactic response to amino acids of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from spinach roots grown in soils with different salinity levels,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,amino acids; chemotaxis; fluorescent pseudomonads; root exudates; soil salinity,RHIZOBACTERIA; COLONIZATION; POPULATIONS; RHIZOSPHERE; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA; INVITRO,"Chemotactic response to amino acids of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from spinach roots grown in a low-salinity soil (LR-group) and its corresponding high-salinity soil (HR-group) was investigated. Furthermore, the amount and composition of amino acids in the root exudate under low-and high-salinity conditions mere investigated. All the isolates examined showed a chemotactic response exclusively to the amino acid fraction, while most of them did not respond to the sugar and the organic acid fractions. Based on these results, the chemotactic response to 20 amino acids of randomly selected 48 isolates, of which 12 isolates each belongs to the LR- and HR-groups of both Pseudomonas putida and P. fluorescens, was investigated. The results showed that the spectrum of chemotaxis to 20 amino acids of the H-group of each species was markedly different from that of the corresponding L-group. Also, the amino acid composition of the root exudate in the high-salinity culture solution significantly differed from that in the low-salinity culture solution. The total amount of amino acids from the high-salinity solution was 2.83 mu mol g(-1) fresh roots, which was as small as 42% of that from the low-salinity culture solution. These results indicated that high salinity of soil may exert an effect on root colonization by fluorescent pseudomonads not only directly through the effect in the bacterial chemotaxis but also indirectly through the modification of the root exudation of amino acids qualitatively and quantitatively.","Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Chem, Lab Soil Microbiol & Biochem, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Futamata, H (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Chem, Lab Soil Microbiol & Biochem, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",,,,,,,21,13,14,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Soil beneath mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees was treated with. (NH4)(2)SO4 granules at application rates of 0, 250, 500, and 1000 kg/ha in May of each year between 1993 and 1994 at Dorset and between 1993 and 1995 at Loring. The fertilizer treatments did not cause visual symptoms of forest decline. At Dorset, SO4 and cation concentrations in soil leachate increased, but no difference in soil pH between treatments was found. An increase in foliar N was recorded at Dorset in treated plots, although there were no other differences in foliar or tree ring chemistry between treatments. At Loring, a decrease in soil pH and an increase in SO4 in soil leachate were found in treated plots. Mycorrhizal infection and litter decomposition were also reduced in plots treated with (NH4)(2)SO4. Fertilizer application at Loring led to increases in foliar concentrations of N, Mg, Mn, and Cd, along with increases in concentrations of trace metals (As, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in tree rings formed during fertilizer application. Significant positive correlations (p < 0.05) were found between wood (rings formed between 1993 and 1995) and foliage (mean of 1993-1995 values) for Mg, Mn, and Al. Deliberate acidification of surface soil resulted in changes in wood and foliar chemistry, although it remains to be established whether acidification of surface soil is responsible for the reported decline in sugar maple.","Trent Univ, Environm Resource Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Hutchinson, TC (reprint author), Trent Univ, Environm Resource Studies Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",,,,,,,61,25,25,1,29,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

A 'clean rain' manipulation study and a drought/rewetting experiment are run side by side in a 60-year-old Norway Spruce (picea abies KARST.) stand. The results are presented in an integrated, interdisciplinary manner and comprise soil water chemistry, root growth, and aboveground stand response. In the clean rain experiment with strong input reduction of S and N a temporal response sequence of soil water chemistry --> root growth --> above-ground reaction occurs. Nitrate leaching is efficiently turned down to very low levels on rather short-term (1-2 yr after start of manipulation). In the drought/rewetting experiment the effects of induced drought stress are strongest and quickest on the above-ground parameters of the spruce stand. Growth and photosynthetic capacity are reduced, while fine root growth reacts indifferently. It may be concluded from the results that: in spruce forests on acid soil atmospheric element input largely controls soil solution chemistry and output; N saturation may be reversed in such ecosystem types by strict air pollution control measures and that spruce forests exhibit a time-lagged response to a changing chemical environment, but rapid responses to drought stress.

The objectives of this research were to study the spatial and temporal variation in soil respiration in a temperate forested landscape and to evaluate temperature and soil water functions as predictors of soil respiration. Soil CO2 auxes were measured with chambers throughout an annual cycle in six study areas at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts that include soil drainage classes from well drained to very poorly drained. The mean annual estimate of soil CO2 efflux was 7.2 Mg ha(-1), but ranged from 5.3 in the swamp site to 8.5 in a well-drained site, indicating that landscape heterogeneity is related to soil drainage class. An exponential function relating CO2 fluxes to soil temperature accounted for 80% of the seasonal variation in fluxes across all sites (Q(10) = 3.9), but the Q(10) ranged from 3.4 to 5.6 for the individual study sites. A significant drought in 1995 caused rapid declines in soil respiration rates in August and September in five of the six sites (a swamp site was the exception). This decline in CO2 fluxes correlated exponentially with decreasing soil matric potential, indicating a mechanistic effect of drought stress. At moderate to high water contents, however, soil water content was negatively correlated with soil temperature, which precluded distinguishing between the effects of these two confounded factors on CO2 flux. Occurrence of high Q(10) values and variation in Q(10) values among sites may be related to: (i) confounding effects of high soil water content; (ii) seasonal and diel patterns in root respiration and turnover of fine roots that are linked to above ground phenology and metabolism; and (iii) variation in the depth where CO2 is produced. The Q(10) function can yield reasonably good predictions of annual fluxes of CO2, but it is a simplification that masks responses of root and microbial processes to variation in temperature and water content throughout the soil.","Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Davidson, EA (reprint author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, POB 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,"Davidson, Eric A/K-4984-2013; yang, lixia/D-7815-2011","Davidson, Eric A/0000-0002-8525-8697; ",,,,44,1173,1479,35,653,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Owing to the difficulty of finding terrestrial ecosystems without mycorrhizas, their influence on plant community dynamics is not easy to discern, This study utilized unreclaimed taconite mine tailings as a mycorrhiza-free ecosystem to gain insights about the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizas and soil organic matter on the growth of Salsola kali (an early successional colonist of taconite tailings) and Panicum virgatum (a late successional grass planted during reclamation). 2. To assess relative mycorrhizal responsiveness, Panicum and Salsola were grown in taconite tailings along an experimental phosphorus gradient with and without mycorrhizal fungal inoculum isolated from reclaimed taconite tailings. At low phosphorus concentrations, mycorrhizal inoculum enhanced the growth (height and dry mass) of Panicum, but it decreased growth at the two highest phosphorous concentrations. At no phosphorus level did mycorrhizal inoculum enhance the growth of Salsola but it decreased growth at the highest phosphorus concentrations. 3. In field plots, mycorrhizal inoculum and organic soil amendment (composted papermill sludge) enhanced the growth of Panicum and decreased the growth of Salsola. 4. In this experiment, mycorrhizal inoculum enhanced the growth of the late successional grass but, during reclamation operations, manipulating edaphic conditions to favour mycotrophy may be more cost-effective than large-scale inoculation. The results of this study suggest that mycotrophy is favoured by increasing soil organic matter and avoiding heavy fertilization.","No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Educ, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Johnson, NC (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Educ, POB 5694, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,,,,,,44,56,58,0,34,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Soil cores of four soil depths (humic layer, 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) were taken over 2 years (August 1991 and August 1992) from six plots with different treatments (control, normal irrigation, acid irrigation solely or in combination with liming) and living short roots selected and analysed for calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and aluminium (Al). On the acid irrigated plot, the Ca and Mg contents of roots were decreased in 1991, but by 1992, 2 years after the irrigation had been terminated, no difference could be found. The Al content of the roots was not increased by acid irrigation but rose with increasing soil depth, regardless of treatment. Liming increased root contents of Ca and Mg and reduced contents of Mn and Al. This effect was especially distinct in the humic layer and decreased with increasing soil depth. Even though the molar Ca/Al-ratio in the roots in the mineral soil was generally low (0.09-0.52), no evidence of Al toxicity could be found.

X. badius-P. abies and R. ochroleuca-P. abies displayed the most active fungal tissues and proportion increased on the acidic plots while Tuber puberulum-P. abies and Piceirhiza nigra were the most active types and occurred in higher proportion after liming. Thus, the overall activities of the mycorrhizas were only slightly changed by the treatments. In addition to the mycorrhizal effect acidification reduced while liming enhanced the meristematic activity of the short root tips. The same tendency was found by studying root production on the same plots (Hahn and Marschner, 1998). Although nearly 3000 mycorrhizal tips were studied, the data are still limited, allowing no statistical validation. This is, however, the first investigation connecting overall activity of the mycorrhizal tissues with the proportion of the mycorrhizal types as influenced both by alterations of the forest soil caused by acid rain and liming. The results are interesting and reasonable but further investments are necessary to validate the general conclusions.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Xiamen Univ, Dept Biol, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China","Kottke, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Systemat Bot Mycol & Bot Garden,Morgenstelle 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,"Qiu, Y/G-3403-2010",,,,,26,28,33,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1998,199,1,,,,,99,109,,10.1023/A:1004243207414,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,ZL559,WOS:000073446500011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Qian, XM; El-Ashker, A; Kottke, I; Oberwinkler, F",,,,"Qian, XM; El-Ashker, A; Kottke, I; Oberwinkler, F",,,Studies of pathogenic and antagonistic microfungal populations and their potential interactions in the mycorrhizoplane of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

The rhizoplane is constituted by the mycorrhizal sheath and a high diversity of microfungi, some of which are known to behave antagonistically against pathogens. Disturbance of the balance between pathogens and antagonists by soil acidification may endanger the health of tree roots. Liming may stabilize the interactions. The microfungal populations connected to the mycorrhizoplane of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) were, therefore, investigated on experimental Norway spruce plots that had been treated with acidified water or were limed. Beech presented the original forest and was left untreated. Eight microfungal species known as either pathogenic or antagonistic, Trichoderma viride, T. hamatum, T. polysporum, Cylindrocarpon destructans, Sesquicillium candelabrum, Mycelium radicis atrovirens, Tolyplocladium geodes and Oidiodendron maius, were isolated from the mycorrhizoplanes and their abundance in the five different plots compared. Acidification enhanced the frequency of Mycelium radicis atrovirens and Oidiodendron maius but reduced Trichoderma viride. Liming promoted Sesquicillium candelabrum and Cylindrocarpon destructans. Detailed analysis of the population patterns indicated that changes in the frequency of a particular fungal species may not only be caused by shift of chemical soil factors but also by antagonistic interactions between the microfungi, thus reducing pathogenic attacks on rootlets.","Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; El Azhar Univ Gaza, Cairo, Egypt; Xiamen Univ, Dept Biol, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China","Kottke, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, Systemat Bot Mycol & Bot Garden,Morgenstelle 1, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,"Qiu, Y/G-3403-2010",,,,,46,4,6,1,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1998,199,1,,,,,111,116,,10.1023/A:1004276121413,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,ZL559,WOS:000073446500012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Handley, BA; Hedges, AJ; Beringer, JE",,,,"Handley, BA; Hedges, AJ; Beringer, JE",,,Importance of host plants for detecting the population diversity of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae in soil,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENZYME POLYMORPHISM; DNA PROFILES; BV TRIFOLII; IDENTIFICATION; NODULATION; STRAINS; MELILOTI; GENETICS; CLOVER; PLASMIDS,"Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae was isolated over 3 y from legumes nodulated with dilutions of soils from arable fields and uncultivated roadside verge sites, and from nodules of resident host legumes when present at these sites.

Although theoretical concepts of allocation exist, they include many parameters that cannot be quantified. Therefore, many growth models use descriptive keys that represent the proportions of dry matter or carbohydrates assigned to each plant component. I have developed a model to describe the dynamic partitioning of dry matter in individual trees, and used it to investigate the effects of growth conditions on the partitioning pattern in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The model estimates the fractions of total available dry matter that should go to certain plant parts, based on the concept of structural balances. Both mechanistic and allometric relationships between tree components are used to model conditions for the dynamic distribution of dry matter. The model was to used to estimate the effects of dominance position, site conditions, and thinning on growth partitioning. The fractions of the annual current increment of total dry matter gradually changed with tree age, but the changes were relatively small, especially after age 20. Compared with beech, Douglas-fir invested more dry matter in foliage, especially at the cost of the branch and stem components. Trees of average basal area invested more dry matter in branches and less in stem than suppressed trees, and their estimated increase in stem diameter over time generally fitted the yield table data well. Stem diameter development was underestimated at higher ages only in the case of a Douglas-fir tree of average basal area on a poor site. Over time, the proportion of standing biomass in foliage and fine root fractions showed a gradual decline, whereas there was a gradual increase in the proportion of standing biomass in the stem fraction. These age-related changes were attributed to different loss rates among components. Analysis of the effects of thinning revealed that a discontinuous reduction in stem number results in a slow decrease in partitioning to the stem. The most obvious response to thinning consisted in a sharp decrease in partitioning to fine roots and foliage, and an increased investment in branches. Stem diameter growth appeared relatively constant in response to thinning, indicating that it will increase almost linearly with time. I conclude that the model is able to reproduce the development of an individual tree over time, both in terms of stem diameter and biomass. The model is thus suitable for simulating the effects of competition for resources on growth and development of forest stands.","Wageningen Univ Agr, Dept Forestry, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands","Bartelink, HH (reprint author), Wageningen Univ Agr, Dept Forestry, POB 342, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,40,70,74,0,21,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,1998,18,2,,,,,91,101,,,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,YY614,WOS:000072165900003,12651393,,,,10/31/19J,"Nicoll, BC; Coutts, MP",,,,"Nicoll, BC; Coutts, MP",,,Timing of root dormancy and tolerance to root waterlogging in clonal Sitka spruce,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Picea sitchensis; windthrow; waterlogging; clonal; root development,LODGEPOLE PINE; TREE ROOTS; STABILITY; SURVIVAL; GROWTH; GLEYS; SOIL,"Actively growing root tips of Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plants are highly susceptible to damage if waterlogged, but they are known to have some tolerance after they stop growing in the autumn. This paper describes the selection of clones on the basis of root dormancy timing and the corresponding responses of their roots to overwinter waterlogging. Sitka spruce transplants of Alaska, Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI), and Washington provenances were screened for early or late root dormancy over 2 successive years. Cuttings were propagated from the selected plants and after growing on for 2 years, they were planted in transparent acrylic tubes within outdoor 'root observation chambers'. Extension of main roots and the timing of onset of root dormancy was recorded on the clonal plants. The tubes were flooded in November and maintained with a water table 280 mm below the soil surface until March of the next year. Waterlogging caused most main root tips to die back, but within 2 months of draining regeneration occurred on the main roots below the waterlogging level. This regeneration was most commonly the growth of existing lateral tips or production of new lateral roots. Roots of early-dormant Washington plants died back on average 129 mm less than late-dormant Washington plants, and early-dormant Alaska plants had 173 mm less dieback than late-dormant Alaska plants. Differences between the clones of the QCI provenance were not significant. The 40% and 52% increases in survival depth of roots in early-dormant Washington and Alaska clones respectively indicates a potential for improving the rooting depth of Sitka spruce on seasonally waterlogged soils by planting clones selected on the basis of root dormancy.","Forestry Commiss Roslin, No Res Stn, Res Agcy, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland","Nicoll, BC (reprint author), Forestry Commiss Roslin, No Res Stn, Res Agcy, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland.",B.Nicoll@forestry.gov.uk,"Nicoll, Bruce/D-4858-2011","Nicoll, Bruce/0000-0002-5891-0555",,,,17,11,12,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Thus, in a given mixture species A was grown in two configurations: three individuals in centre position of the pot together with nine plants of species B in border position and vice versa. Effect competitive abilities as well as response competitive abilities of the species were significantly related to canopy height and plant biomass. The species with lower rosette growth form and smaller biomasses were weaker competitors than the species possessing elevated canopies along with higher biomasses, whereas total leaf area was not significantly correlated with competitive ability between species. Species differences in competitive ability were stronger between the plants grown in the central position than between those grown in the border position. Furthermore, interactions between species-specific traits and configuration could be observed. indicating the importance of species proportions and arrangement patterns for evaluation of competitive outcome in the field. The degree of complete transitivity of the competitive network of the six ruderal species, which was significantly higher than expected under the null model in our experimental design, also seemed to depend on species proportions in mixture. Shifts in root:shoot ratio of the centre plants when faced with competition by the bolder plants were in the direction of higher shoot allocation for the weak; competitors with rosette growth form irrespective of the neighbour species. except for Bunias orientalis, which showed a more plastic response. The stronger competitors showed higher root allocation (Urtica dioica) or were hardly affected at all. Consistent with the results of our experiment, the weaker competitors occur at rather frequently disturbed and therefore transient field sites whereas the stronger competitors predominate at infrequently disturbed sires during several phases of succession.

The effects of slug herbivory were compared in experimental plants at two densities in two types of culture: pure and mixed with Arabidopsis thaliana. All the plant parts of P. annua showed significantly greater biomass in mixed than in pure stands, and in low compared to high density stands. Slug herbivory consistently reduced the biomass of reproductive organs and the percentage of total biomass allocated to reproduction, whereas density had no effect on allocation. In mixed stands, the proportion of biomass allocated to reproductive organs and leaves was greater and lesser, respectively than in pure stands. There were significant interactions between herbivory and culture for root biomass and for the percentage of biomass allocated to root and shoots, and between herbivory, culture and density for shoot, stem, leaf and total biomass. Slug herbivory reduced root biomass in pure stands, whereas it did the opposite in mixed stands. The root:shoot ratio did not vary between mixed and pure stands in the absence of slugs, while when slugs were present pure stands had lower root/shoot ratio than mixed stands. Except for reproductive structures, all the plant parts showed greater biomass in grazed than in ungrazed low density mixed stands, whereas the general trend in high and low density pure stands, and in high density mixed stands was that herbivory decreased biomass. The study indicates that the competitive ability of plants is conditioned by a variety of factors. Plant density, the identity of competitors, and occurrence of herbivory an all relevant factors, the particular combination of which will alter competitive interactions.

Fine roots usually have a relatively wide carbon (C)/N ratio and if fine root carbon is available to micro-organisms they will immobilize N. In this study nitrogen and carbon in microbial biomass were compared between incubated soil and surrounding soil at the end of field incubation periods. It was hypothesized that immobilization of N would result in higher microbial N in incubated soil when compared to the surrounding soil. Incubations were carried out in steel tubes at sites of different fine root density. No net immobilization of N occurred during incubations. There were no significant increases of microbial N in incubated soil suggesting that immobilization of N in microbial biomass did not occur. A comparison of K2SO4-extractable organic N concentrations between incubated and surrounding soil also indicated that immobilization of N into extractable metabolites was unlikely. However, under herbaceous vegetation significantly lower microbial N concentrations were measured in incubated soil compared to the surrounding soils. This may suggest a decrease in microbial biomass during incubations due to cessation of C input from fine roots. If the reduction in microbial biomass leads to the mineralization of microbial tissue, net N mineralization using the in situ incubation technique may be overestimated.","Australian Natl Univ, Dept Forestry, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Bauhus, J (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Dept Forestry, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",,,,18,4,4,0,1,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Infiltration control in a monocover system relies on the storage of moisture within the cover soil during the rainy season, and on the subsequent release by evapotranspiration of the stored moisture during the dry season. The study described here provides a rational basis for selection of parameters that govern the design of monocover systems, such as the thickness of the soil cover layer and the rooting depth of the vegetation. An evaluation of the components of the water balance is performed using unsaturated flow modeling of a generic monocover system for weather conditions typical of southern California. Next, an evaluation of the sensitivity of parameters that govern the percolation through the cover system is described. The parametric evaluation indicates that a monocover with a thickness as small as 600 mm in the semi-arid climate of southern California satisfies stringent percolation design criteria.","GeoSyntec Consultants, Huntington Beach, CA 92647 USA","Zornberg, JG (reprint author), GeoSyntec Consultants, Huntington Beach, CA 92647 USA.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"SCHIPHOLWEG 107C, PO BOX 447, 2316 XC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-5809-006-X,,,,1998,,,,,,,169,174,,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Geological",Engineering,BL87P,WOS:000077024100028,,,,,10/31/19B,"Lee, RW; Jones, SA; Kuniansky, EL; Harvey, GJ; Eberts, SM",,"Wickramanayake, GB; Hinchee, RE",,"Lee, RW; Jones, SA; Kuniansky, EL; Harvey, GJ; Eberts, SM",,,Phreatophyte influence on reductive dechlorination in a shallow aquifer containing TCE,"FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMEDIATION OF CHLORINATED AND RECALCITRANT COMPOUNDS, VOL 4: BIOREMEDIATION AND PHYTOREMEDIATION",,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds,"MAY 18-21, 1998","MONTEREY, CA",,,,,"A field demonstration designed to remediate aerobic shallow ground water (less than 12 ft (3.7 m) deep) containing trichloroethene (TCE) using eastern cottonwood trees (phreatophytes) began in April 1996 at the Naval Air Station, Fort Worth, Tex. Eighteen months after planting the trees, chemical data from ground water indicated concentrations of dissolved oxygen decreased slightly beneath the trees. Changes in concentrations of TCE and its degradation products since 1996 were not measurable, indicating that tree roots had not yet affected ground-water geochemical conditions sufficiently to promote microbially mediated reductive dechlorination. However, TCE is degrading in shallow ground water beneath a mature 19-year old cottonwood tree about 200 ft (61 m) southwest of the cottonwood plantings. A microbially mediated iron-reducing environment capable of degrading TCE has developed from low molecular weight organic acids entering the aquifer from decaying roots or root exudates of the mature cottonwood tree. As the planted cottonwood trees establish more mature root systems, associated microbial activity should flourish, creating reducing environments in the shallow aquifer that could promote reductive dechlorination of the dissolved TCE, similar to the ground-water environment beneath the mature cottonwood tree.","US Geol Survey, Austin, TX USA","Lee, RW (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Austin, TX USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,BATTELLE PRESS,COLUMBUS,"505 KING AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43201 USA",,,1-57477-059-4,,,,1998,,,,,,,263,268,,,,,6,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Microbiology; Toxicology",Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Chemistry; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology; Toxicology,BL54T,WOS:000075848500042,,,,,10/31/19B,"Dvorak, V; Oplustilova, M",,"Mohren, GMJ; Kramer, K; Sabate, S",,"Dvorak, V; Oplustilova, M",,,Respiration of woody tissues of Norway spruce in elevated CO2 concentration,IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON TREE PHYSIOLOGY AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,FORESTRY SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Conference on Impacts of Global Change on Tree Physiology and Forest Ecosystems,"NOV 26-29, 1996","WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,long term influence of elevated CO2; respiration; Norway spruce,,"Eight open top chambers (OTCs) were constructed around trees in situ in 1992 with one tree per chamber in a Norway spruce stand (Picea abies (L.)

The respiration was measured using a closed IRGA system with several types of cuvettes attached to the trees, and CO2 efflux was related to tissue temperature. The measurements were carried out during the growing season and also after and before the active growing period, to assess the maintenance respiration. Stem respiration was found to be significantly lower in the elevated treatment in comparison to ambient in terms of total annual respiration related to sapwood volume and respiration related to dry stem wood mass. The respiration rate of branches was larger compared to stem respiration and the same differences between treatments occurred. High intensities of CO2 efflux from coarse roots suggested that coarse roots have a very important role in tree carbon budget, but for coarse roots, no differences between treatments were found.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Landscape Ecol, Dept Ecol Physiol Forest Trees, Brno 60300, Czech Republic","Dvorak, V (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Landscape Ecol, Dept Ecol Physiol Forest Trees, Kvetna 8, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-4921-0,FOR SCI,,,1998,52,,,,,,47,51,,,,,5,Ecology; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BL25D,WOS:000074895800006,,,,,10/31/19B,"Muller, M; Zellnig, G; Tausz, M; Wonisch, A; de Kok, L; Soja, G; Grill, D",,"Mohren, GMJ; Kramer, K; Sabate, S",,"Muller, M; Zellnig, G; Tausz, M; Wonisch, A; de Kok, L; Soja, G; Grill, D",,,"Structural changes and physiological stress responses of spruce trees to SO2, O-3 and elevated levels of CO2",IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON TREE PHYSIOLOGY AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,FORESTRY SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Conference on Impacts of Global Change on Tree Physiology and Forest Ecosystems,"NOV 26-29, 1996","WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,Picea abies; chromosomal aberrations; antioxidants; pigments; cell ultrastructure; CO2; SO2; O-3,,"The present study compares the effects of air pollutants (SO2, O-3) and/or increased levels of CO2 on different physiological stress parameters, chromosomal structures and cell ultrastructure of spruce trees.

The physiology of root cell extension is briefly reviewed and concluded to be the result of the interaction between turgor pressure and cell-wall properties. The longitudinal and radial heterogeneity of growing root cell walls are considered. Environmental alteration in turgor and cell-wall properties are characterised and it is argued that the younger expanding cells respond more rapidly and to a greater degree than the more mature cells, often resulting in asymmetric alteration of the growth profile along the root growing zone. The biochemical causes of these changes in growth are briefly discussed. The role of solute import in maintaining the driving force of turgor is emphasised. The complex interplay between sink and source turgor pressure, the resistance of the pathway and extension growth is considered. Changes in growth and solute import to root tips is discussed in the framework of the pressure gradient between the source and sink. It is concluded that solute flux can often be correlated with the pressure gradient between source and sink but changes in the resistance of the pathway are additionally implicated.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Biol Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Pritchard, J (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Biol Sci, POB 363, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,BACKHUYS PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 321, 2300 AH LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-73348-96-X,,,,1998,,,,,,,21,39,,,,,19,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BL66U,WOS:000076263300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Huante, P; Rincon, E",,,,"Huante, P; Rincon, E",,,Responses to light changes in tropical deciduous woody seedlings with contrasting growth rates,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Review,,,,,,tropical deciduous forest; growth analysis; biomass allocation; light transfers; plasticity,PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; LEAF LIFE-SPAN; ALOCASIA-MACRORRHIZA; TREE SEEDLINGS; RAIN-FOREST; SEED SIZE; SHADE-TOLERANCE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACCLIMATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY,"We evaluated the responses in growth, biomass allocation, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, to changes in light in woody seedlings from the tropical deciduous forest in Mexico, which shows a highly seasonal rain pattern. We studied ten species, which differed by 30-fold in relative growth rate (RGR). We analyzed plant growth in two contrasting light levels during 52 days and two transfers: from high to low (HL) and from low to high (LH) light intensity, and the respective controls in high (HH) and low (LL) light for another 52 days. The photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance were measured at the day of the transfer between light conditions and at the end of the experiment. Species with high RGR showed the largest changes in RGR in response to contrasting light conditions (HH/LL ratio), and species with low RGR showed low responses. The fast-growing species were the most plastic, followed by species with intermediate growth rates, with the slow-growing species being the least plastic. Fast-growing species achieved higher maximum photosynthetic capacities (A(max)) and stomatal conductance and higher response to light than slow-growing species. Species with high RGR showed a low RGR HH/LH ratio, suggesting a large response of L plants when transfered to H. The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35-75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpinia eriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendron mexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Huante, P (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,140,58,66,1,39,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1998,113,1,,,,,53,66,,,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YL928,WOS:000071009200006,28307294,,,,10/31/19J,"Lussenhop, J; Treonis, A; Curtis, PS; Teeri, JA; Vogel, CS",,,,"Lussenhop, J; Treonis, A; Curtis, PS; Teeri, JA; Vogel, CS",,,Response of soil biota to elevated atmospheric CO2 in poplar model systems,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,atmospheric CO2; roots; arbuscular mycorrhizas; microbial biomass; microarthropods,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL INFECTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; MATTER CONTENTS; NITROGEN; POPULATIONS; RHIZOSPHERE; ENRICHMENT; GROWTH; ROOTS,"We tested the hypotheses that increased belowground allocation of carbon by hybrid poplar saplings grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 would increase mass or turnover of soil biota in bulk but not in rhizosphere soil. Hybrid poplar saplings (Populus x euramericana cv. Eugenei) were grown for 5 months in open-bottom root boxes at the University of Michigan Biological Station in northern, lower Michigan. The experimental design was a randomized-block design with factorial combinations of high or low soil N and ambient (34 Pa) or elevated (69 Pa) CO2 in five blocks. Rhizosphere microbial biomass carbon was 1.7 times greater in high-than in low-N soil, and did not respond to elevated CO2. The density of protozoa did not respond to soil N but increased marginally (P < 0.06) under elevated CO2. Only in high-N soil did arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and microarthropods respond to CO2. In high-N soil, arbuscular mycorrhizal root mass was twice as great, and extramatrical hyphae were 11% longer in elevated than in ambient CO2 treatments. Microarthropod density and activity were determined in situ using minirhizotrons. Microarthropod density did not change in response to elevated CO2, but in high-N soil, microarthropods were more strongly associated with fine roots under elevated than ambient treatments. Overall, in contrast to the hypotheses, the strongest response to elevated atmospheric CO2 was in the rhizosphere where (1) unchanged microbial biomass and greater numbers of protozoa (P < 0.06) suggested faster bacterial turnover, (2) arbuscular mycorrhizal root length increased, and (3) the number of microarthropods observed on fine roots rose.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Sci Biol, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lussenhop, J (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Sci Biol, 845 W Taylor,Room 3262 SES, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",luss@uic.edu,,,,,,32,60,67,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1998,113,2,,,,,247,251,,10.1007/s004420050375,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YT907,WOS:000071658500013,28308204,,,,10/31/19S,"Spaink, HP",,"Romeo, JT; Downum, KR; Verpoorte, R",,"Spaink, HP",,,Flavonoids as regulators of plant development - New insights from studies of plant-rhizobia interactions,PHYTOCHEMICAL SIGNALS AND PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,RECENT ADVANCES IN PHYTOCHEMISTRY,,English,Proceedings Paper,Joint Meeting of the Phytochemical-Society-of-North-America / Phytochemical-Society-of-Europe,"APR 20-23, 1997","NOORDWIJKERHOUT, NETHERLANDS","Phytochem Soc N Amer, Phytochem S Europe",,,,,"Leiden State Univ, Inst Mol Plant Sci, NL-2333 AL Leiden, Netherlands","Spaink, HP (reprint author), Leiden State Univ, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Wassenaarseweg 64, NL-2333 AL Leiden, Netherlands.",,"Spaink, Herman P./S-3586-2017","Spaink, Herman P./0000-0003-4128-9501",,,,0,6,6,0,0,PLENUM PRESS DIV PLENUM PUBLISHING CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0079-9920,,0-306-45917-5,RECENT ADV PHYTOCHEM,,,1998,32,,,,,,167,177,,,,,11,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences; Ecology; Microbiology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,BL44K,WOS:000075541900009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Reader, RJ",,,,"Reader, RJ",,,Relationship between species relative abundance and plant traits for an infertile habitat,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,community structure; plant frequency; soil fertility,COMPETITIVE ABILITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PRAIRIE GRASSES; ALLOCATION; ECOLOGY,"This study tested whether differences in species abundance at an infertile site could be explained by differences in the species' plant traits. Nine traits were chosen for the analysis based on results of previous studies conducted across soil fertility gradients. The traits were measured for each of seven herbaceous species whose abundance ranged from 5% to 100% of locations occupied in a ridgetop habitat. Using linear regression, significant relationships were found between species relative abundance and each of five traits. In these relationships, a trait explained between 69% and 88% of interspecific variation in abundance. Relatively abundant species had a slower growth rate, smaller shoot mass, higher root to shoot ratio, slower loss of leaf tissue to herbivores and higher infection of roots by mycorrhizal fungi than less abundant species. Using three of these five traits (i.e. shoot mass, mycorrhizal infection and loss of leaf tissue to herbivores) as independent variables in a multiple regression equation explained 99% of interspecific variation in abundance. The latter result indicates that species relative abundance can be explained for a single habitat by choosing traits found to be related to species abundance in previous gradient studies. However, not every trait chosen was significantly related to species abundance. Therefore, a large number of traits may have to be chosen initially to ensure that some subset of these traits can explain species relative abundance.","Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Reader, RJ (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,26,29,29,1,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JAN,1998,134,1,,,,,43,51,,10.1023/A:1009700100343,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,YX090,WOS:000072005400004,,,,,10/31/19B,"Grantz, DA; Zhang, X; Carlson, T",,"DeKok, LJ; Stulen, I",,"Grantz, DA; Zhang, X; Carlson, T",,,Effects of ozone on root-shoot integration in cotton,RESPONSES OF PLANT METABOLISM TO AIR POLLUTION AND GLOBAL CHANGE,,,English,Proceedings Paper,4th International Symposium on Responses of Plant Metabolism to Air Pollution and Global Change,"APR 01-05, 1997","EGMOND AAN ZEE, NETHERLANDS",,,,,,"Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Parlier, CA 93648 USA","Grantz, DA (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Parlier, CA 93648 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,BACKHUYS PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 321, 2300 AH LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-73348-95-1,,,,1998,,,,,,,313,314,,,,,2,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BL66X,WOS:000076264500033,,,,,10/31/19S,"Rajchenberg, M; Barroetavena, C; Cwielong, PP; Rossini, M; Cabral, D; Sivori, A",,"Delatour, C; Marcais, B; Guillaumin, JJ; LungEscarmant, B",,"Rajchenberg, M; Barroetavena, C; Cwielong, PP; Rossini, M; Cabral, D; Sivori, A",,,"Fungal species associated with the decline of Austrocedrus chilensis in Patagonia, Argentina: preliminary results",ROOT AND BUTT ROTS OF FOREST TREES,COLLOQUES DE L INRA,,English,Proceedings Paper,9th International Conference on Root and Butt Rots,"SEP 01-07, 1997","CARCANS MAUBUISSON, FRANCE","Inst Natl Rech Agronom, Int Union Forest Res Org, Conseil Reg Aquitaine, Dept Sante Forets, Off Natl Forets",,,PYTHIUM,"The decline of the native Austrocedrus chilensis (Cupressaceae) was investigated.

The fragment can be classified within the fungal peroxidase family to the same subfamily as the peroxidase genes of T. versicolor. When the gene fragment was used as a probe in Southern analysis of different IS- groups of H. annosum, P- and S-groups were clearly distinguished revealing sequence polymorphism between the groups.

Tissue samples were analysed for carbon (C), N, nonpolar extractives (fats, waxes, and oils=FWO), non-structural carbohydrates (total sugars and starch), and structural carbohydrates (cellulose, lignin, and tannins). Increased dry weights of each tissue were observed under elevated CO2 and with high N; however, main effects of CO2 were significant only on belowground tissues. The high N fertility tended to result in increased partitioning of biomass aboveground, resulting in significantly lower root to shoot ratios. Elevated CO2 did not affect biomass allocation among tissues. Both atmospheric CO2 and N fertility tended to affect concentration of C compounds in belowground, more than aboveground, tissues. Elevated CO2 resulted in lower concentrations of starch, cellulose, and lignin, but increased concentrations of FWO in root tissues. High N fertility increased the concentration of starch, cellulose, and tannins, but resulted in lower concentrations of lignin and FWO in roots. Differences between CO2 concentrations tended to occur only with high N fertility. Atmospheric CO2 did not affect allocation patterns for any compound; however the high N treatment tended to result in a lower percentage of sugars, cellulose, and lignin belowground.","USDA ARS, Kimberly, ID 83341 USA","Entry, JA (reprint author), USDA ARS, 3793 North 3600 West, Kimberly, ID 83341 USA.",,,,,,,59,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-5230-0,DEV PLANT SOIL SCI,,,1998,82,,,,,,3,18,,,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Forestry,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Forestry,BN28F,WOS:000081418500001,,,,,10/31/19B,"Mergel, A; Timchenko, A; Kudeyarov, V",,"Box, JE",,"Mergel, A; Timchenko, A; Kudeyarov, V",,,Role of plant root exudates in soil carbon and nitrogen transformation,"ROOT DEMOGRAPHICS AND THEIR EFFICIENCIES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, GRASSLANDS AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS",DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,5th Symposium of the International-Society-of-Root-Research,"JUL 14-18, 1996","CLEMSON UNIV, CLEMSON, SC","Int Soc Root Res, USDA, Agr Res Serv, USDA, Foreign Agr Serv, Off Int Cooperat & Dev, USDA Cooperative States Res, Educ & Extens Serv, Soil Sci Soc Amer",CLEMSON UNIV,immobilisation; microbial biomass; mineralization; N-15 fertiliser; organic carbon; protease and urease activity,ORGANIC-MATTER; DECOMPOSITION,Plant root exudates were shown to accelerate the processes of C and N transformation in the soil.

It was shown that thioorganophosphorous compounds, at a concentration of 10(-2) M, depressed main root branching but not main root growth. A directed synthesis of thiophosphates and thiophosphonates containing amino acid residues (alanine, valine, isovaline, and phenylalanine) was performed. These compounds inhibited root branching at a lower concentration of 10(-3) M, evidently due to their better penetration into root tissues. Anatomical examinations showed that lateral root primordia, performed in the embryonic cucumber roots, resumed their growth in treated seedlings. This fact, along with the resistance of main root growth to the action of tested gametocides, argues against a cytostatic nature of these compounds. Thiophosphonates were more effective in root branching retardation than thiophosphates. The compounds containing phenylalanine residue were more active than those containing valine and alanine. Plant growth process sensitivity to tested inhibitors was as follows. Root branching was most sensitive, main root growth was most resistant, and hypocotyl growth was intermediate in its sensitivity. The after-effects of tested compounds were evaluated. The possibility of application of thioorganophosphorous compounds as a tool for investigating plant axis branching is discussed.","Russian Acad Sci, Kurnakov Inst Gen & Inorgan Chem, Moscow, Russia","Litinskaya, T (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Kurnakov Inst Gen & Inorgan Chem, Moscow, Russia.",,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,0-7923-5230-0,DEV PLANT SOIL SCI,,,1998,82,,,,,,555,564,,,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Forestry,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Forestry,BN28F,WOS:000081418500047,,,,,10/31/19B,"Weinbrecht, JS; McCarty, LB; Kane, ME; Miller, GL; Best, GR",,"Box, JE",,"Weinbrecht, JS; McCarty, LB; Kane, ME; Miller, GL; Best, GR",,,St. Augustinegrass root growth response following plant growth retardant application,"ROOT DEMOGRAPHICS AND THEIR EFFICIENCIES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, GRASSLANDS AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS",DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,5th Symposium of the International-Society-of-Root-Research,"JUL 14-18, 1996","CLEMSON UNIV, CLEMSON, SC","Int Soc Root Res, USDA, Agr Res Serv, USDA, Foreign Agr Serv, Off Int Cooperat & Dev, USDA Cooperative States Res, Educ & Extens Serv, Soil Sci Soc Amer",CLEMSON UNIV,plant growth retardants; root length density; St. Augustinegrass,TALL FESCUE; BERMUDAGRASS CYNODON; TIFWAY BERMUDAGRASS; REGULATORS; FLURPRIMIDOL; FREQUENCY; LENGTH,"St. Augustinegrass [(Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.)

Root/shoot ratio and foliage quantity (total leaf area, leaf dry weight)/sapwood basal area ratios in 5-month-old seedlings had adjusted to water stress. The highest root/shoot ratio and foliage quantity/sapwood basal area ratios were observed in the origin from northern Australia. In addition, root/shoot ratio and foliage quantity/sapwood basal area ratios had been associated with intrinsically the driest quarter rainfall of the natural habitats. The results suggest that there is genetic variation in term of drought adaptation mechanisms among the origins relating to their natural habitats, and the northern origin employs an adaptive strategy in response to water deficit at the initial phase of seedling growth and establishment.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Trop Silviculture Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Li, C (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Trop Silviculture Unit, POB 28,Koetilantie 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,"Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013",,,,,17,5,9,0,5,SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",0037-5349,,,SILVAE GENET,Silvae Genet.,,1998,47,3-Feb,,,,,132,136,,,,,5,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,127MW,WOS:000076355900013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, QH; Zak, JC",,,,"Zhang, QH; Zak, JC",,,Effects of water and nitrogen amendment on soil microbial biomass and fine root production in a semi-arid environment in West Texas,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DOUGLAS-FIR GROWTH; CHLOROFORM FUMIGATION; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; EXTRACTION METHOD; FERTILIZATION; MINERALIZATION; FOREST; CARBON; TEMPERATURE; GRASSLAND,"Primary production in semi-arid and arid environments can be water limited and nitrogen regulated. We examined short-term (hourly) and relatively long-term (monthly) responses of soil microbial biomass, soil N mineralization dynamics, fine root production and ectomycorrhizal colonization rates to a single water and N addition in the sand shinnery-oak ecosystem in West Texas. Microbial biomass C and N exhibited rapid response to water and N addition. However, over the short term, water decreased microbial biomass C. A low addition of nitrogen (5 g m(-2)) had a short-term positive effect on microbial biomass, but no long-term effect. The addition of 50 g N m(-2) significantly increased microbial biomass C, N mineralization rates, and root growth over 4 months. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was decreased at the high rates of N addition. The results indicate that in this semi-arid environment, below-ground processes in the sand shinnery-oak ecosystem are strongly limited by N availability, while water regulates the period of activity.

The integration of ecophysiology and biogeochemistry holds promise for working across levels of ecological organization and for increasing our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. In this chapter, ecophysiology is integrated with biogeochemistry using the C cycle of terrestrial ecosystems as a primary example. The fixation, redistribution, and loss of C from terrestrial ecosystems are largely controlled by the physiological activities of plants and soil microorganisms; however, there are several key gaps in our understanding of plant and microbial ecophysiology that limit our ability to predict the response of the terrestrial C cycle to a changing climate. The most significant gap in our understanding lies belowground and centers on the physiological links among the allocation of C to the production and maintenance of fine roots, the longevity of these structures, and the extent to which the metabolism and longevity of plant roots influence substrate availability for microbial activity in soil. In this chapter, we identify how a physiologically based understanding of fine-root production, maintenance, and longevity can be used to understand ecosystem-level patterns of C allocation. We then explore the extent to which the amount, timing, and biochemistry of root-associated C inputs influence the composition and function of microbial communities in soil. Understanding the ecophysiological links between plant roots and soil microorganisms lies at the heart of understanding the belowground C budget of terrestrial ecosystems.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012",,,,,0,27,31,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,0-387-98476-3,,,,1998,,,,,,,372,403,,,,,32,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BL70E,WOS:000076391800015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Selosse, MA; Le Tacon, F",,,,"Selosse, MA; Le Tacon, F",,,The land flora: a phototroph-fungus partnership?,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; GEOSIPHON-PYRIFORME; INFECTION; PLANTS; ASSOCIATIONS; SYMBIOSIS; ENDOPHYTE; ORIGINS; LICHENS,"Numerous mutualistic associations between phototrophs and fungi exist in the extant land biota.

The primacy of timber as the dominant objective is giving way to broader objectives such as sustaining the function and dynamics of ecosystems, maintaining ecosystem diversity and resilience or protecting sensitive species, while providing for a variety of ecosystem services of value to humanity, Protection and production of more diverse forest values demands consideration of the fine-scale variability found within forest stands and an understanding of the spatial and temporal response of forest ecosystems to manipulation, Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been used little by foresters for predicting ecosystem response to partial cutting. We review the gap dynamics literature paying special attention to papers that use gap size or position as predictive variables for responses indicative of silvicultural success or maintenance of ecosystem function. Like canopy gaps created by natural tree death or windthrow, gaps are also generated by silvicultural systems which remove dominant trees. Results from the Date Creek silvicultural systems study in northwestern British Columbia presented hen demonstrate the utility of a gap-based approach for understanding ecosystem responses to toe cutting. We propose a gap-based approach for study of stand response to silvicultural manipulation that: (1) aids development of cutting prescriptions that maintain functional mature or old-growth conditions; (2) refines and extends our understanding of how biological structures, organisms and ecosystem processes are affected by fine-scale variation within stands; and (3) leads to development of novel silvicultural systems that meet timber production objectives without compromising ecosystem management principles.

Within each Solardome, four plant blocks were allocated different wet deposition treatments which provided a North Wales maritime rain with the equivalent of 0, 20, 40 or 60 kg N per hectare per year without changes in hydrogen ion concentration. Progressive senescence of leaves in the gaseous pollution treatments correlated well with leaf dry weight data, showing increasing injury with time. Growth analysis was performed after 11, 13 and 15 weeks exposure to pollutants. Gaseous pollution treatments resulted in substantial reductions in leaf areas and dry weights of A. capillaris in both the 20 ppb SO2 + 20 ppb NO2 and the 40 ppb SO2 + 40 ppb NO2 treatments compared with the plants exposed to charcoal filtered air and the 10 ppb SO2 + 10 ppb NO2 treatment. Adverse effects of the gaseous pollution treatments were greater on shoots than roots. Additions of wet nitrogen caused reductions in the numbers of tillers and leaf areas of A. capillaris is compared with plants with zero nitrogen application. There were no effects of wet nitrogen treatments on total plant dry weights but all nitrogen additions above zero application resulted in a reduction in root dry weights at the final harvest which was reflected in a decrease in root/shoot ratio in the 60 N treatment.

Replicate populations of crowded, regenerating stands of Betula alleghaniensis were grown in ambient and elevated (700 p.p.m.) atmospheric CO2 concentrations in monoliths of forest soil. Early in the second year the seedlings were harvested and detailed measurements of individual plant root architectural parameters and ectomycorrhizal colonization were made. 2. Comparing the average responses of individual plants within the populations, elevated CO2 had no significant effects on architectural parameters that improve a plant's ability to forage for and acquire soil resources. In contrast, the intensity and magnitude of mycorrhizal colonization, and whole plant C/N ratios were significantly enhanced with elevated CO2. 3. The allometric scaling relationship between total plant biomass and root biomass was not affected by CO2, suggesting that relative allocation between roots and shoots was not affected. However, the allometric scaling relationships between root architectural parameters and plant biomass, and between fine root biomass and woody root biomass were significantly altered by elevated CO2. For all of these relationships, elevated CO2 reduced the 'size bias' of architectural components in relation to plant size within the populations; in elevated CO2 root architectural size (e.g. root length) per unit biomass was more similar between the smallest and largest individuals within the population than was the case for ambient CO2. 4. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the average individual seedling biomass and architectural growth responses within populations of plants exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels may be unresponsive, but that mycorrhizal responses and interactions among plants within populations may be altered significantly. These findings have important implications for how we make predictions about plant growth responses to elevated CO2 in natural ecosystems. Significant increases in mycorrhizal infection rates and architecture-biomass allometries suggest that below-ground competitive interactions within plant populations may be reduced in elevated CO2. Alterations in competitive interactions may lead to shifts in productivity and plant population structure.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Biol Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Berntson, GM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Biol Labs, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,74,21,23,1,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

To evaluate the potential for plant compensation, we followed the progression of ozone effects, with particular emphasis on the development of new roots. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl, ex Laws.) seedlings were exposed to ozone for 2 years. Following removal of the seedlings from ozone, root growth was assessed to characterize the carry-over effects on new root production, and carbohydrate concentrations were measured to determine if allocation strategies differed among ozone treatments. Four months after removal from ozone, dormant seedlings had significantly lower starch concentrations in stems, coarse roots and fine roots than control seedlings. Following root flushing, starch concentrations in all seedlings decreased, with ozone-treated seedlings containing significantly less starch, sucrose, fructose, glucose and total monosaccharides than control seedlings. There was some evidence that stem starch was mobilized to compensate partially for the lower concentrations of root starch in ozone-treated seedlings; however, there was significantly less new root production in seedlings previously exposed to ozone for 2 years than in control seedlings. Early senescence of older needle age classes, perhaps resulting in inadequate available photosynthate, may be responsible for the reduction in new root production during the year following exposure to ozone. Stored carbohydrate reserves? which were depleted in seedlings previously exposed to ozone, were insufficient to compensate for the ozone-induced reduction in canopy photosynthate. We conclude that there are carry-over effects of ozone exposure on ponderosa pine seedlings, including an enhanced potential for seedling susceptibility to other stresses even in respite years when ozone concentrations are low.","MANTECH ENVIRONM RES SERV CORP,CORVALLIS,OR 97333; DYNAMAC CORP,CORVALLIS,OR 97333","Andersen, CP (reprint author), US EPA,ENVIRONM RES LAB,200 SW 35TH ST,CORVALLIS,OR 97333, USA.",,,,,,,28,45,49,0,6,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,1997,17,12,,,,,805,811,,,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,YG017,WOS:A1997YG01700007,14759890,,,,10/31/19J,"Mun, HT; Whitford, WG",,,,"Mun, HT; Whitford, WG",,,Changes in mass and chemistry of plant roots during long-term decomposition on a Chihuahuan Desert watershed,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,decomposition; Chihuahuan Desert; lignin; mass loss; nitrogen immobilization,LITTER DECOMPOSITION; FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL-MOISTURE; BURIED LITTER; FINE ROOTS; MICROARTHROPODS; PATTERNS; LIGNIN,"We studied the spatial and temporal patterns of decomposition of roots of a desert sub-shrub, a herbaceous annual, and four species of perennial grasses at several locations on nitrogen fertilized and unfertilized transects on a Chihuahuan Desert watershed for 3.5 years. There were few significant differences between the decomposition rates of roots on the NH4NO3 fertilized and unfertilized transects. Decomposition of all roots followed a two-phase pattern: early rapid mass loss followed by a long period of low mass loss. Rates of decomposition were negatively correlated with the initial lignin content of the roots (r=0.90). Mass loss rates of the roots of the herbaceous annual, Baileya multiradiata, were significantly higher than those of the grasses and the shrub, probably as a result of subterranean termites feeding on B. multiradiata root material. The only location where mass loss rates were significantly different was the dry lake bed, where mass loss rates were lower than those recorded on the upper watershed. The spatial differences in mass loss rates in the dry lake were attributable to the high clay content of the soils, which reduced water availability, and to the absence of termites. Non-polar substances in decomposing roots decreased rapidly during the first year, then decreased at a low but fairly constant rate. Water-soluble compounds decreased rapidly (50-60% of initial concentration) during the first 3-6 months. Lignin concentrations of roots of perennial grasses were higher than those of herbaceous annual plants and woody shrubs. Lignin concentrations increased in all species during decomposition.

Vegetation cover on plots adjacent to treated and untreated stumps was evaluated to determine fumigant effects on vascular plants and moss. Ninety-eight vascular plant species were recorded during the course of the study. Only those species with 40% or greater frequency (14) and mosses were included in the analysis of individual species cover. We found that Trientalis latifolia Hook. may be sensitive and act as an early indicator of chloropicrin effects in the clearcut habitat of this study. Three years following application to stumps, chloropicrin had little or no effect on other surrounding vegetation. The general lack of interaction effects between distance of plot to stump and fumigation treatment leads to the conclusion that the chloropicrin largely stayed in the stumps during the first 3 years following treatment. Effects attributed to harvest methods, study layout, and pretreatment conditions were detected. Species rick?ess decreased with distance from the former stand edge. Higher mean species richness in the control plots was significantly correlated with distance to former stand edge. The results also demonstrate the potential magnitude and legacy of edge effects in forest stands and the need to account for those effects in study design.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Pacific NW Res Stn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Luoma, DL (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Peavy Hall 154, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,35,3,3,0,1,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We hypothesized that both aboveground competition (within canopy patches), and below-ground competition (between canopy patches), would be important structuring processes in these communities. We investigated the spatial pattern of trees in a Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma woodland in New Mexico using Ripley's K-function. We found strong aggregation of trees at scales of 2 to 4 m, which indicates the scale of canopy patches. Canopy patches were composed of individuals of both species. Crown centers of both species were always less aggregated than stem centers at scales less than canopy patch size, indicating morphological plasticity of competing crowns. In the smallest size classes of both species, aggregation was most intense, and occurred over a larger range of scales; aggregation decreased with increasing size as is consistent with density-dependent mortality from intraspecific competition. Within canopy patches, younger trees were associated with older trees of the other species. At scales larger than canopy patches, younger trees showed repulsion from older conspecifics, indicating below-ground competition. Hence, intraspecific competition was stronger than interspecific competition, probably because the species differ in rooting depth. Woodland dynamics depend on the scale and composition of canopy patches, aggregated seed deposition and facilitation, above- and below-ground competition, and temporal changes in the spatial scale of interactions. This woodland is intermediate in a grassland-forest continuum (a gradient of increasing woody canopy cover) and hence we expected, and were able to detect, the effects of both above-and below-ground competition.","Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Environm Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA","Martens, SN (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Breshears, David D./B-9318-2009","Breshears, David D./0000-0001-6601-0058",,,,66,69,73,3,24,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

A solution of 99.6% enriched N-15-NO3-, at a concentration similar to that of background throughfall, was applied to forest plots established along a gradient of soil texture to simulate and track the fate of throughfall NO3- deposition. The tracer solution was applied to replicate plots during both the spring and fall to examine seasonal differences in ecosystem retention. N-15 enrichment was subsequently measured in litter, O2 horizon, 0-15 cm mineral soil, fine roots, microbial biomass in the O2 horizon and mineral soil, and lysimeter leachate over a 6 month period following each application. The O2 horizon contained the largest fraction of N-15 in all sites immediately following the spring application (19-45%) but was less important following the fall application (10-25%). The mineral soil N pool generally contained the largest fraction of applied N-15 (7-28%) in all sites at the end of both 6-month sampling periods. Microbial uptake of applied N-15 provided an initial barrier against leaching loss as well as a mechanism for its long-term incorporation into soil organic matter. Microbial processing was less important in the most coarsely textured site, perhaps as a result of lower substrate availability and smaller microbial pool sizes. The highest cumulative leaching losses of applied N-15 were observed in the coarse sand site (40, 51%) followed by the fine sand (13, 43%) and loamy sand (4, 19%) sites for the spring and fall applications, respectively. More than 90% of all N-15 captured in lysimeters occurred within two days following the applications, and 25-43% of all N-15 captured in lysimeters after 2 days was in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) indicating that it had been assimilated by microbes prior to leaching.","BOSTON UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOSTON,MA 02215",,,,"Lajtha, Kate/0000-0002-6430-4818",,,,42,49,53,1,14,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1997,112,3,,,,,393,402,,10.1007/s004420050325,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YF421,WOS:A1997YF42100015,28307489,,,,10/31/19J,"Spek, LY",,,,"Spek, LY",,,Generation and visualization of root-like structures in a three-dimensional space,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,branching pattern; recursive model; root architecture; three-dimensional structure; visualization,FRACTAL BRANCHING MODELS; ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; SIMULATION; PREDICTOR; DIAMETER; TREES; FLOW; SIZE,"In his Notebooks Leonardo da Vinci describes his diameter squared rule for the branching of above-ground tree parts.

An algorithm in this recursive program calculates the orientation of the branches in a three-dimensional space. From these data three-dimensional root-like structures are visualized by a computer program (PLUTON) designed to draw three-dimensional molecular structures. The visualization shows that starting from a relatively simple, symmetrical structure of dichotomous branching, more complex, asymmetrical root-like structures arise even if only a few parameter values are changed. The introduction of randomness into parameter values produces structures that differ considerably in their architecture. An extra force has been added in order to influence the orientation of new branches in space and to increase the flexibility of the structure formation.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands","Spek, LY (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,,,,,28,11,14,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,1997,197,1,,,,,9,18,,10.1023/A:1004236626479,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,YP813,WOS:000071317700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Knight, B; Zhao, FJ; McGrath, SP; Shen, ZG",,,,"Knight, B; Zhao, FJ; McGrath, SP; Shen, ZG",,,Zinc and cadmium uptake by the hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens in contaminated soils and its effects on the concentration and chemical speciation of metals in soil solution,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,contaminated soil; soil solution; speciation; Thlaspi caerulescens; zinc,ACCUMULATION; BRASSICACEAE; NICKEL; ZN,"The hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens J & C Presl. was grown in seven different soils collected from around Europe that had been contaminated with heavy metals by industrial activity or the disposal of sewage sludge to land. Zinc accumulation factors (shoot concentration/initial soil solution concentration) ranged from 3500-85 000 with a mean value of around 36 000. This compares with mean accumulation factors of 636, 66 and 122 for Cd, Ca and Mg, respectively. The concentration of Zn in the shoots was much greater than in the roots. The total removal of Zn and Cd ranged from 8 to 30 and from 0.02 to 0.5 mg kg(-1) soil, respectively. The Zn concentration in shoots of T. caerulescens correlated, using a curvilinear relationship, with the initial Zn concentration in soil solution (R(2) = total Zn 0.78; Zn(2+) 0.80). There was no relationship between the uptake of Zn and the total Zn concentration in the soil. In most soils, solution pH increased only slightly after growth of T. caerulescens, indicating that acidification was not the mechanism used to mobilise Zn in the soil. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations generally increased but characterisation of the component organic compounds was not attempted. The concentrations of Zn and Cd in soil solution decreased considerably after growth of T. caerulescens. The percentages of Zn and Cd in soil solution present as free ions also decreased. However, the decrease of Zn in soil solution after growth accounted for only about 1% of the total Zn uptake by T. caerulescens. This was much lower than for Cd, Ca and Mg. The results suggest that either T. caerulescens was highly efficient at mobilising Zn which was not soluble initially, or the soils used had large buffering capacities to replenish soil solution Zn within a short time. This work highlights the need to investigate the role of root exudates on the mobilisation of Zn and Cd in soils by the hyperaccumulator T. caerulescens.","IACR Rothamsted, Dept Soil Sci, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; Nanjing Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Knight, B (reprint author), IACR Rothamsted, Dept Soil Sci, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",steve.mcgrath@bbsrc.ac.uk,"Zhao, Fang-Jie/A-8339-2008; McGrath, Steve P/B-5127-2008; Zhao, Fang-Jie/A-8339-2008","Zhao, Fang-Jie/0000-0002-0164-169X; McGrath, Steve P/0000-0003-0952-8947; Zhao, Fang-Jie/0000-0002-1252-1079",,,,20,164,195,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,NOV,1997,197,1,,,,,71,78,,10.1023/A:1004255323909,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,YP813,WOS:000071317700009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ibekwe, AM; Angle, JS; Chaney, RL; vanBerkum, P",,,,"Ibekwe, AM; Angle, JS; Chaney, RL; vanBerkum, P",,,Differentiation of clover Rhizobium isolated from biosolids-amended soils with varying pH,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; PAST APPLICATIONS; DNA-SEQUENCES; HEAVY-METALS; TRIFOLII; POPULATIONS; MELILOTI; GENOMES,"Metal contamination may alter the diversity of microbes residing in soil, The genetic structure and phenotypic characteristics of clover Rhizobium isolated from contaminated and control soils were compared.

Plant water status, indicated by shoot water potential and leaf stomatal conductance, improved with increasing size from seedling to the mature tree. Improved water status indicated that root systems were becoming more extensive and accessing a greater soil volume with age. Stump coppice had higher dawn water potentials, stomatal conductances and transpiration rates than other stages. The improved water relations of stump coppice are likely to be a consequence of taking over all or part of the large root system of the parent tree with the benefits of both access to a larger soil volume and a higher root/shoot ratio than in other stages. Ground coppice had higher stomatal conductances than the larger saplings. This may be evidence of higher root/shoot ratios roots in ground coppice (which are subject to recurrent destruction of the crowns of ground coppice by low intensity fires and other agents) than in the taller, less frequently damaged saplings.

They have now been analyzed in canopy leachates, snow, and soil solutions collected from the three layers of the podsolic soil: OA, E, and B. Leachates were characterized by high tanning capacity and by p-hydroxyacetophenone (found at 10(-6) M) also detected as the major (10(-7) M) monomeric compound in snow. At least 10 phenolic monomers, including vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and protocatechuic acids were identified in capillary waters extracted from the OA layer with their sum reaching 2 x 10(-6) M. These monomers were only a small part (1%) of the total phenolics. In soil solutions, significant decreases in phenolic concentrations with depth were observed between the E and B layers, with qualitative modifications of the phenolic pattern. Spruce leachates and soil solutions exhibited high temporal variability, resulting in transitory allelopathic potential towards both aerial and subterranean parts of spruce seedlings. The occurrence of various and soluble phenolic compounds in the whole forest system, including p-hydroxyacetophenone, which persist from green needles to soil solutions, suggests that they could be involved in complex and interactive processes occurring during organic matter accumulation on the coniferous forest floor.","SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, IATE PEDOL, CH-1015 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Gallet, C (reprint author), DEPT LIFE SCI, LAB ALTITUDE ECOSYST DYNAM, F-73376 LE BOURGET DU LAC, FRANCE.",,,,,,,39,73,78,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

These species represent the main forage base for many mammalian herbivores. In a long-term study employing large, permanent exclosures, we measured the impact of winter browsing by moose and snowshoe hares on carbon flux in riparian willow/alder communities. We found that browsing-induced changes in leaf litter chemistry increased the rate of litter decomposition both in the laboratory and under field conditions, and increased the pool of mineralizable carbon in litter. The aboveground input of higher-quality litter-carbon following browsing may explain the increased respiration potentials of soils sampled outside the exclosures. Moreover, winter browsing tends to reduce the production of fine roots and appears to decrease fine root longevity. Thus, the net effect of moose browsing on aboveground and belowground processes in these early successional stands is to accelerate carbon turnover. These results demonstrate that the effects of mammalian herbivory on element cycling in taiga is a two-stage process, involving intraspecific as well as interspecific responses at different time scales.

On three occasions over a period of eight weeks root-collar diameter, shoot height, leaf and stem weight, shoot/root ratios and root system morphology were measured on cuttings and seedlings. Seedlings were taller than cuttings throughout the experiment, but both plant types had similar height growth rates. Diameter growth rates were lower in cuttings than seedlings, and there were differences in both height and diameter growth rates between families. Root system configuration differed between the plant types. Seedlings had strongly gravitropic tap-roots, with two types of primary roots from which secondary roots emerged. Cuttings had no tap roots, and the main structural components of their root systems were adventitious roots formed during propagation. Cuttings did not develop further structural roots during the experiment, whereas seedlings continued to develop primary roots. Individual primary roots of cuttings were longer and had larger mid-point diameters than those of seedlings, but the total length of primary roots was greater in seedlings. Seedlings also had a greater number and total length of secondary roots.

Initial diameter, shoot length and number of FOLR were positively and significantly correlated with second-year height and diameter. These relationships were strongest for diameter, but this variable explained less than 25% of the total variation in growth. Of the three indicators, diameter was also the best predictor of several physical characteristics of root systems two years after planting. Initial diameter was significantly correlated with root volume, root area and lateral root, taproot and total root dry mass. Weaker relationships existed between initial shoot length and number of FOLR and second-year root system features.

Sixty-six percent of the Brazilian genotypes formed effective nodules with both Sinorhizobium species. However, when 20 Fix(+) genotypes were inoculated with a mixture of B. elkanii and S. fredii, at a ratio of 1:1, most or all nodules were occupied by B. elkanii.

Aboveground biomass was estimated from allometric equations relating stem and branch diameters of individual trees to their biomass. Biomass production was calculated from annual increments in tree diameters and measurements of litterfall. Maintenance and construction respiration were calculated for each component using equations given by Ryan (1991a). Total belowground C flux was estimated from measurements of annual soil CO2 efflux less the C content of annual litterfall (assuming forest floor and soil C were at approximate steady state for the year that soil CO2 efflux was measured). The total C content of the standing biomass of the unfertilized stand was 138 t ha(-1), with approximately 80% aboveground and 20% belowground. Forest floor C was 8.5 t ha(-1). Soil C content (0-1 m) was 369 t ha(-1) representing 70% of the total C pool in the ecosystem. Total gross annual C flux aboveground (biomass increment plus litterfall plus respiration) was 11.9 t ha(-1) and gross flux belowground (coarse root increment plus fine root production plus root respiration) was 5.1 t ha(-1). Total annual soil efflux was 7.1 t ha(-1), of which 2.5 t ha(-1) (35%) was contributed by litter decomposition. The short-term effect of changing the availability of P compared with C on allocation to aboveground versus belowground processes was estimated by comparing fertilized and unfertilized stands during the year after treatment. In the P-fertilized stand annual wood biomass increment increased by 30%, there was no evidence of change in canopy biomass, and belowground C allocation decreased by 19% relative to the unfertilized stand. Total annual C flux was 16.97 and 16.75 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and the ratio of below-to aboveground C allocation was 0.43 and 0.35 in the unfertilized and P-fertilized stands, respectively. Therefore, the major response of the forest stand to increased soil P availability appeared to be a shift in C allocation; with little change in total productivity. These results emphasise that both growth rate and allocation need to be estimated to predict changes in fluxes and storage of C in forests that may occur in response to disturbance or climate change.","UNIV NEW S WALES,DEPT BIOL SCI,KENSINGTON,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA","Keith, H (reprint author), CSIRO FORESTRY & FOREST PROD,POB E4008,KINGSTON,ACT 2604,AUSTRALIA.",,"Raison, Robert/E-5431-2011; Brilhante, Jackson/F-5783-2016",,,,,77,56,58,1,27,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,1997,196,1,,,,,81,99,,10.1023/A:1004286030345,,,19,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,YL665,WOS:A1997YL66500009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Nagtzaam, MPM; Bollen, GJ",,,,"Nagtzaam, MPM; Bollen, GJ",,,Colonization of roots of eggplant and potato by Talaromyces flavus from coated seed,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VERTICILLIUM-DAHLIAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; RHIZOSPHERE COMPETENCE; GROWTH; FIELD; WILT; TRICHODERMA; GLIOCLADIUM; BIOCONTROL; NEMATODE,"Talaromyces flavus (Klocker) Stolk and Samson, a fungus that has potential for biocontrol of Verticillium dahliae, colonized potato and eggplant roots.

In the tests for nodulation of A. cicer by these bacterial isolates, five were found to form hypertrophic structures, while only two formed true nodules. These true nodules were formed in a sterilized soil system. This system might be able to act as a DNA donor to provide residual DNA to other microbes in the soil. The rhizobial isolates were thought to have lost genetic material crucial to nodulation during the isolation process. This hypothesis was supported by an experiment in which isolate B2 was able to nodulate A. cicer in vermiculite culture after being mixed with heat-killed rhizobia, Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii and R. loti. The nodulation would not occur in vermiculite culture system without the heat-killed rhizobia. Based on the biochemical data, the B2 and 9462L, which formed true nodules with A. cicer, were closely related. The rhizobia type cultures that nodulate A. cicer include Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii, R. leguminosarum by. viceae, and R. loti. All of these rhizobia were from different cross-inoculation groups. The B2 and 9462L isolates could only nodulate Medicago sativa, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Melilotus officinalis, but not these species within the genus from which they were isolated: Astragalus. The traditional cross-inoculation group concept obviously does not fit well in the classification of rhizobia associated with Astragalus. The rhizobia isolated from A. cicer can be quite different, and the rhizobia able to renodulate A. cicer also quite diverse.","UNIV WYOMING,DEPT PLANT SOIL & INSECT SCI,LARAMIE,WY 82071; USDA ARS,HIGH PLAINS GRASSLANDS RES STN,CHEYENNE,WY 82009",,,,,,,,19,6,6,1,3,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Open-top field chambers permitted creation of atmospheres with 700 mu L L-1, 525 mu L L-1, or ambient CO2 concentrations. Seedlings were reared from seed in field soil with a total N concentration of approximately 900 mu g g(-1) or in soil amended with sufficient (NH4)(2)SO4 to increase total N by 100 mu g g(-1) or 200 mu g g(-1). The 525 mu L L-1 CO2 treatment within the intermediate N treatment was excluded from the study. Following each of three consecutive growing seasons, whole seedlings of each combination of CO2 and N treatment were harvested to permit assessment of shoot and root growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization. In the second and third growing seasons, drought cycles were imposed by withholding irrigation during which predawn and midday xylem water potential and soil water potential were measured. The first harvest revealed that shoot weight and coarse and fine root weights were increased by growth in elevated CO2. Shoot and root volume and weights were increased by CO2 enrichment at the second harvest, but growth stimulation by the 525 mu L L-1 CO2 concentration exceeded that in 700 mu L L-1 CO2 during the first two growing seasons. At the third harvest, above-and below-ground growth increases were largely confined to the 700 mu L L-1 CO2 treatment, an effect accentuated by high soil N but evident in all N treatments. Ectomycorrhizal formation was reduced by elevated CO2 after one growing season, but thereafter was not significantly affected by CO2 and was unaffected by soil N throughout the study. Results of the xylem water potential measurements were variable, as water potentials in seedlings grown in elevated CO2 were intermittently higher on some measurement days but lower on others than that of seedlings grown in the ambient atmosphere. These results suggest that elevated CO2 exerts stimulatory effects on shoot and root growth of juvenile ponderosa pine under held conditions which are somewhat dependent on N availability, but that temporal variation may periodically result in a greater response to a moderate rise in atmospheric CO2 than to a doubling of the current ambient concentration.","UNIV NEVADA,DESERT RES INST,CTR BIOL SCI,RENO,NV 89506","Walker, RF (reprint author), UNIV NEVADA,DEPT ENVIRONM & RESOURCE SCI,RENO,NV 89512, USA.",,,,,,,31,33,36,3,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,1997,195,1,,,,,25,36,,10.1023/A:1004290719824,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,YE363,WOS:A1997YE36300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Steele, SJ; Gower, ST; Vogel, JG; Norman, JM",,,,"Steele, SJ; Gower, ST; Vogel, JG; Norman, JM",,,"Root mass, net primary production and turnover in aspen, jack pine and black spruce forests in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,boreal forests; BOREAS; carbon balance; detritus production; fine roots; root turnover; soil carbon,BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION; FINE ROOTS; LENGTH DENSITY; BOREAL FOREST; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOMASS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; MINIRHIZOTRONS; SOIL,"Root biomass, net primary production and turnover were studied in aspen, jack pine and black spruce forests in two contrasting climates. The climate of the Southern Study Area (SSA) near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan is warmer and drier in the summer and milder in the winter than the Northern Study Area (NSA) near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. Ingrowth soil cores and minirhizotrons were used to quantify fine root net primary production (NPPFR) Average daily fine root growth (m m(-2) day(-1)) was positively correlated with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (r(2) = 0.83-0.93) for all three species, with black spruce showing the strongest temperature effect. At both study areas, fine root biomass (measured from soil cores) and fine root length (measured from minirhizotrons) were less for jack pine than for the other two species. Except for the aspen stands, estimates of NPPFR from minirhizotrons were significantly greater than estimates from ingrowth cores. The core method underestimated NPPFR because it does not account for simultaneous fine root growth and mortality. Minirhizotron NPPFR estimates ranged from 59 g m(-2) year(-1) for aspen stands at SSA to 235 g m(-2) year(-1) for black spruce at NSA. The ratio of NPPFR to total detritus production (aboveground litterfall + NPPFR) was greater for evergreen forests than for deciduous forests, suggesting that carbon allocation patterns differ between boreal evergreen and deciduous forests. In all stands, NPPFR consistently exceeded annual fine root turnover and the differences were larger for stands in the NSA than for stands in the SSA, whereas the difference between study areas was only significant for black spruce. The imbalance between NPPFR and fine root turnover is sufficient to explain the net accumulation of carbon in boreal forest soils.","KEMP NAT RESOURCES STN,WOODRUFF,WI 54568; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT SOIL SCI,MADISON,WI 53706","Steele, SJ (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT FOREST ECOL & MANAGEMENT,1630 LINDEN DR,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,56,300,356,2,88,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG-SEP,1997,17,9-Aug,,,,,577,587,,,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,YK381,WOS:A1997YK38100010,14759831,,,,10/31/19J,"Liste, HH; Hoflich, G; Kohn, S",,,,"Liste, HH; Hoflich, G; Kohn, S",,,Survival of inoculated rhizosphere bacteria and their influence on native bacterial populations in the rhizosphere of alfalfa,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE,,,German,Article,,,,,,,ENGINEERED MICROORGANISMS; PSEUDOMONAS-FLUORESCENS; SOIL; PLANT; GROWTH; COLONIZATION; STIMULATION; NODULATION; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY,"The survival of inoculated bacteria and their influence on native bacterial populations in the rhizosphere of alfalfa were investigated in a greenhouse experiment.

Annual species had a similar overall root system morphology, but varied in characteristics such as rooting depth and root/shoot ratio. Seedlings of perennial species generally had higher root/shoot ratios than did annuals. Mature perennials had extensive root systems with high root/shoot ratios and most species were clonal. Species typical of later successional stages had more extensive and deeper root systems than did species of earlier stages, a factor that may influence compositional change. Some species that persist throughout succession may do so because their root systems are flexible, changing in origin and distribution. Differences in root systems among species are consistent with their successional roles and habitat affinities, and thus, are important in understanding species replacement during secondary succession.","UNIV WASHINGTON,COLL FOREST RESOURCES,DIV ECOSYST SCI & CONSERVAT,SEATTLE,WA 98195","Antos, JA (reprint author), UNIV VICTORIA,DEPT BIOL,VICTORIA,BC V8W 3N5,CANADA.",,,,,,,44,13,13,0,9,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The branching root systems of two temperate tree species, Acer saccharum Marsh. and Fraxinus americana L., and two perennial herbs from horizontal rhizomes, Hydrophyllum canadense L. and Viola pubescens Ait., were quantified by dissecting entire root systems collected from the understory of an A. saccharum-Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. forest. The root systems of each species grew according to a simple branching process. with laterals emerging from the main roots some distance behind the tip. Root systems normally consisted of only 4-6 branches (orders). Root diameter. length, and number of branches declined with increasing order and there were significant differences among species. Specific root length increased with order in all species. Nitrogen concentration increased with order in the trees, but remained constant in the perennial herbs. More than 75% of the cumulative root length of tree seedling root systems was accounted for by short (2-10 mm) lateral roots almost always <0.3 mm in diameter. Simple assumptions suggest that many tree roots normally considered part of the dynamic fine-root pool all roots < 2.0 mm in diameter) are too large to exhibit rapid rates of production and mortality. The smallest tree roots may be the least expensive to construct but the most expensive to maintain based on an increase in N concentration with order.","MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIV,DEPT FORESTRY,MISSISSIPPI STATE,MS 39762; TALL TIMBERS RES STN,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32312; UNIV GEORGIA,SCH FOREST RESOURCES,ATHENS,GA 30602","Pregitzer, KS (reprint author), MICHIGAN TECHNOL UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & WOOD PROD,1400 TOWNSEND AVE,HOUGHTON,MI 49931, USA.",,,,,,,40,137,195,5,57,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1997,111,3,,,,,302,308,,10.1007/s004420050239,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XP311,WOS:A1997XP31100002,28308123,,,,10/31/19J,"Hirsch, AM; Fang, Y; Asad, S; Kapulnik, Y",,,,"Hirsch, AM; Fang, Y; Asad, S; Kapulnik, Y",,,The role of phytohormones in plant-microbe symbioses,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Meeting on Opportunities for Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Rice and Other Non-Legumes,"OCT 13-15, 1996","NATL INST BIOTECHNOL & GENET ENGN, FALSALABAD, PAKISTAN","Frontier Project Nitrogen Fixat Rice, 2nd Working Grp",NATL INST BIOTECHNOL & GENET ENGN,auxin; cytokinin; ethylene; plant hormones; plant-microbe symbiosis,VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; AUXIN TRANSPORT INHIBITORS; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; ROOT-NODULES; HOST-PLANT; NODULATION SIGNALS; ALFALFA ROOTS; CYTOKININ PRODUCTION; MEDICAGO-SATIVA; CELL-DIVISION,"Plant hormones, especially auxin, cytokinin, and ethylene, have long been implicated in nodule development.

The effects of earthworms (Aporrectodea trapezoides) at three densities, on the initiation of mycorrhizal colonization of roots of Trifolium subterraneum L. were examined in Experiment 1. An increasing density of earthworms was associated with a decrease in proportional colonization of the roots by mycorrhizal fungi, with a significant difference between the treatment with no earthworms and that with three earthworms per pot (equivalent to 500 earthworms m(-2)). Experiment 2 was established to examine the effect of earthworms on the lateral spread of VA mycorrhizal Fungi from localized inoculum through a sward of T. subterraneum. A reduction in colonization was again observed at 14 and 21 days (Experiment 2A) or 14 and 28 days (Experiment 2B) but was not evident at a later harvest. The effects of earthworms on the infectivity of an established fungal hyphal network was examined in Experiment 3. The mean proportional colonization was consistently lower in the earthworm treatment compared to the no-earthworm treatment, except in the 1-3-cm section of soil, but none of the differences was statistically significant. We obtained no evidence that earthworms increase the rate of spread of mycorrhizal fungi between plants. Our results indicate that earthworms reduce the infectivity of the soil, with respect to VA mycorrhizal colonization of roots. However, the reduction may only be transient. Possible mechanisms for this effect include grazing on or disturbance of the hyphal network in soil.

Inhibition of respiration has been reported as a short-term response of plant tissue to elevated measurement [CO2]. We sought to determine if measurement [CO2] affected root respiration in samples from mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) forests and to assess possible errors associated with root respiration measurements made at [CO2]s lower than that typical of the soil atmosphere. Root respiration was measured as both CO2 production and O-2 consumption on excised fine roots (less than or equal to 1.0 mm) at [CO2]s ranging from 350 to > 20,000 mu l l(-1). Root respiration was significantly affected by the [CO2] at which measurements were made for both CO2 production and O-2 consumption. Root respiration was most sensitive to [CO2] near and below normal soil concentrations (< 1500 mu l l(-1)). Respiration rates changed little at [CO2]s above 3000 mu l l(-1) and were essentially constant above 6000 mu l l(-1) CO2. These findings call into question estimates of root respiration made at or near atmospheric [CO2], suggesting that they overestimate actual rates in the soil. Our results indicate that sugar maple root respiration at atmospheric [CO2] (350 mu l l(-1)) is about 139% of that at soil [CO2]. Although the causal mechanism remains unknown, the increase in root respiration at low measurement [CO2] is significant and should be accounted for when estimating or modeling root respiration. Until the direct effect of [CO2] on root respiration is fully understood, we recommend making measurements at a [CO2] representative of, or higher than, soil [CO2]. In all cases, the [CO2] at which measurements are made and the [CO2] typical of the soil atmosphere should be reported.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","Burton, AJ (reprint author), MICHIGAN TECHNOL UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & WOOD PROD,HOUGHTON,MI 49931, USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997",,,,43,69,83,0,10,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,1997,17,7,,,,,421,427,,,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,XK345,WOS:A1997XK34500001,14759833,,,,10/31/19J,"Brown, TN; Kulasiri, D; Gaunt, RE",,,,"Brown, TN; Kulasiri, D; Gaunt, RE",,,A root-morphology based simulation for plant soil microbial ecosystem modelling,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,three-dimensional tree root architecture; morphology; spatial soil fungal; microbial ecosystem simulation model,DOUGLAS-FIR SEEDLINGS; FUSARIUM-OXYSPORUM; SYSTEMS; GROWTH,"A simulation model is presented that produces and manipulates computer representations of plant root microbial ecosystems. The root system is described as a collection of nodes. A node records a position in three-dimensional space and may represent the origin of another root, a bend, or some change in the root's microbial status. Disease lesions, closely associated microbial populations such as mycorrhizal fungi, and free soil microbial populations may also be represented. A multi-dimensional matrix structure provides a useful conceptual framework for the numerous stochastic functions required by the model. Procedures for building the node-based root map, and for simulating root growth and microbial interaction, are presented in terms of such a matrix, in conjunction with the necessary manipulations of the node lists which represent the root system. This paper assesses the practicality of the approach described, which appears to be feasible and potentially useful. The model is considered as a step towards a generic framework for modelling root-architecture and the spatial structure of associated microbial ecosystems. The model has been successfully applied to a simulation of a Pinus radiata/Armillaria spp. pathosystem.

Thirty-one bacteria species from 14 different genera were recovered from within the foliage, roots and nodules of red clover plants cv. AC Charlie. Genera diversity and species number were greatest in foliage tissues. Pantoea agglomerans (59.6%) was the most frequent species recovered in foliage tissues, Agrobacterium rhizogenes A in the tap root (49.2%) and Rhizobium leguminosarum BV phaseoli and R. loti B in the nodules (27.2% each). Recovery of Rhizobium species was not restricted to the nodules, and species of this genus were systemic throughout the plant. Clover root nodules were host to 12 bacteria species other than rhizobia, of which 8 were specific to this tissue. Using non-selective media, R. leguminosarum BV trifolii constituted only 8.8% of all the root nodule bacteria recovered. In root bacterization experiments, species of nodule bacteria promoted growth of red clover more often when applied in combination with R. leguminosarum BV trifolii than when applied singly. However, Bacillus megaterium, Bordetella avium and Curtobacterium luteum consistently promoted growth either individually or in combination with R. leguminosarum BV trifolii. Nodulation was promoted when R. leguminosarum BV trifolii was coinoculated with Bacillus insolitus, B. brevis or A. rhizogenes A. Single isolate applications of Rhizobium species to roots always led to the depression of clover growth, but mixtures of R. leguminosarum BV trifolii and R. leguminosarum BV phaseoli resulted in growth promotion. The latter is considered further evidence of the beneficial allelopathic side effect of strain competition for the same ecological niche.","AGR & AGRI FOOD CANADA,CHARLOTTETOWN RES STN,CHARLOTTETOWN,PE C1A 7M8,CANADA; NOVA SCOTIA AGR COLL,DEPT PLANT SCI,TRURO,NS B2N 5E3,CANADA","Sturz, AV (reprint author), PRINCE EDWARD ISL DEPT AGR & FORESTRY,POB 1600,CHARLOTTETOWN,PE C1A 7N3,CANADA.",,,,,,,43,159,197,1,38,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The sites vary from non-waterlogged to strongly seasonally waterlogged. We found that seasonal waterlogging in compacted soils is a main stress factor that strongly influences the root distribution of both species. However, roots of grand fir were more tolerant, expanded to greater depths (in general more than 20 cm), and attained higher densities (more than 30%) than roots of Norway spruce. The roots of grand fir even penetrated into the compact Sd-horizon of pseudogleys, whereas the Sw-horizon (seasonally waterlogged horizon) prevented deeper rooting of spruce and contributed to its plate-shaped root system. In addition, a study on the dynamics of fine root biomass and chemistry from waterlogged and non waterlogged periods was carried out by core sampling in a 25-year-old grand fir stand. During the waterlogged period, the fine roots had considerably greater dead (5558 kg ha (-1)) than live biomass (3594 kg ha(-1)). At the beginning of the non-waterlogged period, the total biomass of live fine roots increased by 50%, and the dead fine roots decreased by 27%. The influence of waterlogging on the vitality of the fine roots is recognizable in their chemical composition: under waterlogged condition, live fine roots contained distinctly less K, Mg and Zn, but more Mn, than during the non-waterlogged period.

Competition from Pteridium aquilinum,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ground vegetation; light shading; woodland management,FAR-RED RATIO; TREE SEEDLINGS; BRACKEN; GROWTH; QUANTITY; QUALITY; SHADE; OAK,"1. In upland, semi-natural oakwoods, the natural regeneration of oak Quercus petraea and Q. robur is frequently lacking. This threatens the long-term persistence of a habitat of considerable conservation importance. 2. In the absence of excessive grazing pressure, large openings in the woodland canopy can provide suitable sites for regeneration, but these are often dominated by dense stands of bracken Pteridium aquilinum, which is thought to restrict woody growth severely. 3. In this paper we describe experiments carried out in a semi-natural oakwood in north-eastern Scotland, which tested the hypothesis that shading by a Pteridium canopy in summer and smothering by the dying fronds in winter exert a detrimental effect on the growth of oak seedlings. 4. Two separate types of Pteridium stand were selected: the first, and more dense, growing in relatively large gaps in the oak canopy, the second and less dense growing in smaller gaps. In the large gaps, three treatments were used: Pteridium cut continuously all year, cut in winter only, and uncut all year; in the small gaps only the first and second treatments were used. The effects of a Pteridium canopy on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during the growing season were also measured. 5. The presence of a Pteridium canopy during the growing season reduced PAR to 5.9% of full sunlight in the larger canopy gaps, and to 11.4% in the small gaps. Over two growing seasons, significant reductions in accumulated oak seedling biomass were recorded in both large and small canopy gaps. Significant increases in specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and a decrease in root:shoot ratio were also recorded. 6. Smothering by dying Pteridium fronds in winter significantly reduced seedling biomass, but had no effect on biomass partitioning or seedling morphology. 7. These results suggest that effective control of dense Pteridium stands is necessary to promote the successful regeneration of oak. However, this should be done in conjunction with measures to ensure the continued supply of early successional woodland habitats.","UNIV ABERDEEN,DEPT PLANT & SOIL SCI,ABERDEEN AB9 2UD,SCOTLAND",,,,,,,,41,46,52,1,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

But current guidelines in many jurisdictions do not allow for the installation of trees or shrubs above landfill clay caps, although these plants have many environmental, functional, and aesthetic advantages, including a rapid start to community succession. Typical closure procedures for capped landfills include only a grass cover to control moisture infiltration and impede soil erosion. The main concern that limits the application of a woody cover to a closed landfill is that roots may penetrate and weaken the clay cap. As part of a comprehensive experimental program on woodland restoration, we installed 22 tree and shrub species on Staten Island, New York (the Fresh Kills Sanitary Landfill). We found no evidence that roots of the transplanted woody plants penetrate caps used on these landfills. Root growth requirements and dynamics stop penetration of these materials. Anoxic and acidic conditions were found in the sandy subsoil above the cap, as indicated by corrosion patterns on steel test rods. Also, the intensity of mycorrhizal infection on the experimental plants was high in the surface soil and decreased progressively with increasing soil depth. The potential vertical rooting depth during this time period was greater than that occurring over the clay cap. This was shown from data collected on a nearby control site, where seven of the species were installed on an engineered soil lacking a clay barrier layer, and roots of all seven species penetrated deeper than on the landfill. The engineered landfill soils are poor growth media for roots, and below ground constraints that limit restoration on these sites must be addressed.","SUNY ALBANY,DEPT BIOL SCI,ALBANY,NY 12222; SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONM RES CTR,EDGEWATER,MD 21037; SACRED HEART UNIV,FAC SCI MATH & COMP SCI,FAIRFIELD,CT 06432","Handel, SN (reprint author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & NAT RESOURCES,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903, USA.",,,,,,,22,28,33,0,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Irrigation treatments were imposed after seedling establishment (i.e., 19 weeks after planting). Seedlings were harvested at 4, 8, 12, and 20 months. Elevated CO2 increased biomass production only in the high-N treatment, and the relative growth enhancement was greater for the root system than for the shoot system. In water-stressed trees, elevated CO2 increased root biomass only at the final harvest. Root:shoot ratios were usually increased by both the elevated CO2 and low-N treatments. In the elevated CO2 treatment, water-stressed trees had a higher root:shoot ratio than well-watered trees as a result of a drought-induced increase in the proportion of plant biomass in roots. Well-watered seedlings consistently grew larger than water-stressed seedlings only in the high-N treatment. We conclude that available soil N was the controlling resource for the growth response to elevated CO2 in this study. Although some growth enhancement was observed in water-stressed trees in the elevated CO2 treatment, this response was contingent on available soil N.","AUBURN UNIV,SCH FORESTRY,AUBURN,AL 36849; JOSEPH W JONES ECOL RES CTR,NEWTON,GA 31770; LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATL LAB,HLTH & ECOL ASSESSMENT DIV,LIVERMORE,CA 94550; LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATL LAB,GLOBAL CLIMATE RES DIV,LIVERMORE,CA 94550","Prior, SA (reprint author), USDA ARS,NATL SOIL DYNAM LAB,POB 3439,AUBURN,AL 36831, USA.",,"Amthor, Jeffrey/F-2696-2016; Amthor, Jeffrey/L-6089-2016","Amthor, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1410-6100; Amthor, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8601-403X; Prior, Stephen Arthur/0000-0003-1750-6326",,,,41,51,53,0,19,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,1997,17,6,,,,,397,405,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,XC799,WOS:A1997XC79900006,14759848,,,,10/31/19J,"Jentschke, G; Fritz, E; Marschner, P; Rapp, C; Wolters, V; Godbold, DL",,,,"Jentschke, G; Fritz, E; Marschner, P; Rapp, C; Wolters, V; Godbold, DL",,,Mycorrhizal colonization and lead distribution in root tissues of Norway spruce seedlings,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREST; ALUMINUM; CD,"Non-inoculated spruce seedlings (Picea abies Karst.) and spruce seedlings colonized with Lactarius rufus Fr., Pisolithus tinctorius Coker & Couch or Paxillus involutus Fr. were grown for 35 or 37 weeks in a system on two types of natural forest humus differing in Pb content. Using X-ray microanalysis, the distribution and content of Pb in the tissues of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root tips were compared. No significant difference in the Pb contents of root cortex cell walls of non-mycorrhizal and seedlings colonized by Lactarius rufus, Pisolithus, or indigenous mycorrhizal fungi (mainly Tylospara sp.) was found. However, in root tips of seedlings colonized by Paxillus involutus, due to a higher binding capacity for cations, the Pb content in cell walls of the root cortex were higher than in non-mycorrhizal roots. Pb contents in cell walls of the cortex of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots were 3 times higher in plants growing in humus with a high Pb content than in plants growing in humus with a low Pb content. It is concluded that increasing contents of Pb in the organic matter may lead to an increased loading of the apoplast with Pb.

Surprisingly, whilst low additions of ammonium to the sediment porewater (10 to 50 mu M) inhibited 50% of acetylene reduction activity, approximately 30% of this activity persisted in the presence of 1 mM ammonium chloride; this indicating that in at least a proportion of the N-fixing community, nitrogenase activity was not regulated in the short term by the availability of alternative nitrogen sources.",,"Welsh, DT (reprint author), UNIV BORDEAUX 1,CTR OCEANOG & BIOL MARINE,LAB OCEANOG BIOL,CNRS URA 197,2 RUE PROF JOLYET,F-33120 ARCACHON,FRANCE.",,"Welsh, David/A-1227-2009","Welsh, David/0000-0002-0228-0611",,,,27,43,45,0,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0948-3055,,,AQUAT MICROB ECOL,Aquat.

In a 9-yr experiment, we examined how the pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus) affects and is affected by the ectomycorrhizal mutualists found on the roots of scale-resistant and -susceptible pinyon pines (Pinus edulis). Three major results emerged. First, removal experiments demonstrated that scales negatively affected ectomycorrhiza. Second, although ectomycorrhiza could either positively or negatively influence scale performance by improving plant vigor or increasing plant investment in antiherbivore defenses, we found no ectomycorrhizal effect on scale mortality when we experimentally enhanced levels of ectomycorrhiza. This represented the first test of whether ectomycorrhiza promote plant resistance and contrasted with studies showing that arbuscular mycorrhiza negatively affected herbivores. Third, pinyon resistance to scales mediated the asymmetrical interaction between fungal mutualists and scale herbivores. High scale densities suppressed ectomycorrhizal colonization, but only on trees susceptible to scales. Similarities between mycorrhiza-herbivore interactions and competitive interactions among herbivores suggest broader generalities in the way aboveground herbivores interact with belowground plant associates. However, because mycorrhiza are mutualists, mycorrhiza-herbivore interactions do not fit within traditional competition paradigms.

The general objectives of the soil research were: (1) to compare soil properties between the two production systems (conventional and transitional organic); (2) relate observed differences to soil processes and management practices; and (3) determine the relative usefulness of each of the measured parameters as soil quality indicators. Bulk density and water holding capacity were useful indicators of changes in soil physical characteristics. Because treatment differences in bulk density were detected, biological and chemical data were expressed volumetrically to more closely approximate in-field values. EC, Ca, and Mg readings were used as an indication of the absence of significant salinity problems in both production systems. Soil pH in surface soils was mildly acidic, and values were slightly higher in the organic production system plots. Potentially mineralizable nitrogen and biomass carbon (C) were more sensitive indicators of system change than total N or organic C. Because microbial respiration was higher from organic plots on some sample dates, C loss via CO2 was evaluated against C inputs in the two systems. It was concluded that in both production systems, C inputs appear to outweigh C loss via microbial respiration, and therefore the potential for net organic matter loss is minimal. No significant treatment differences were seen in the respiratory ratio, or in the ratio of biomass C to total organic C. Increased colonization by mycorrhizal fungi seemed to provide an explanation for higher tissue P levels in the organic trees, and thus was an indicator of increased soil biological function in the organically managed plots. Soil invertebrates did not seem to be sensitive indicators of short-term responses to management changes in the current study, as no significant differences were seen during 1990-1991, the first 2 years of transition to organic management in the organic treatment plots. However, earthworm abundance and biomass increased significantly during 1992 in the organic plots, and seemed to provide an indication of long-term response to changes in weed, pest, and soil fertility management. Pitfall trap arthropods were too variable in abundance and diversity to discern any significant treatment effects with the sampling scheme used, and therefore these parameters were not useful indicators of soil quality changes.

A 70-yr-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) stand and a 50-yr-old mixed hardwood stand received control, low nitrogen (50 kg . ha(-1). yr(-1)), high nitrogen (150 kg . ha(-1). yr(-1)), and low nitrogen plus sulfur treatments, with additions occurring in six equal doses over the growing season as NH4NO3 and Na2SO4. Foliar N concentrations increased up to 25% in the hardwood stand and 67% in the pines, and there was no apparent decrease of N retranslocation due to fertilization, Wood production increased in the hardwood stand in response to fertilization but decreased in the pine stand. Fine-root nitrogen concentrations increased with N additions, and fine roots were a significant sink for added nitrogen. Nitrate leaching losses increased continuously over the 6-yr period in the treated pine stands but remained insignificant in the hardwoods, Annual net N mineralization increased substantially in response to treatments in both stands but declined in the pine high-N plot by the end of year six. Net nitrification increased from 17% of net mineralization in 1988 to 51% in 1993 for the pine high-N plot. Only a slight increase in net nitrification was measured in the hardwood stand, and only in 1993. Extractable NH4 was consistently higher in treated plots than in controls in both stands, where extractable NO3 was higher than controls only in the treated pine plots, Soil extracts yielded <1.5 kg/ha of NO3-N for all plots in the hardwood stand throughout the experiment. Effluxes of N2O were consistently greater in the pine high-N plot than in the pine control plot, but there were no observed large-scale increases in N2O emissions immediately following fertilizer application. Calculated nitrogen budgets for the first 6 yr showed extremely high N retention (85-99%). Of the retained N, 50-83% appears to be in the long-term, recalcitrant soil pool. The relative importance of biotic and abiotic mechanisms of N incorporation into soils remains uncertain. Size, kinetics, and uptake capacity of this soil pool are critical and largely unknown factors determining ecosystem response to increased N loading and may be related to land-use history.","ALLEGHENY COLL, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI, MEADVILLE, PA 16335 USA; MARINE BIOL LAB, CTR ECOSYST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA","Magill, AH (reprint author), UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, COMPLEX SYST RES CTR, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA.",,,,,,,62,282,335,4,123,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Intact monoliths of Polytrichum moss, mineral soil and undisturbed litter were collected from the forest floor of a mixed conifer stand in Central Ontario. Half of the litter seedbeds were later burned with a propane torch. Replicates of the four seedbeds (n = 24) were placed in a greenhouse and hand sown with white spruce seed. Percent effective seedling emergence was significantly higher on mineral soil than on the other three seedbeds but did not differ among moss, liner and burned litter. Seedling survival under a watering regime representative of the seedbed collection site did not differ among seedbeds. Survival of a short drought stress treatment, however, was significantly improved in mineral soil and moss as compared with the litter and burned liner seedbeds. Differential survival was related in part to the biomass of herbaceous and woody competition that developed from the seed bank and rhizomes present in the four seedbeds. Above- and below-ground biomass of competition on the litter and burned litter seedbeds were significantly higher and ten times that of mineral soil and moss seedbeds. This difference in biomass of competition was associated with lower average daily soil water potentials in the two litter seedbeds. Seedlings growing in mineral soil, and to a lesser extent burned litter, generally exhibited larger shoot, root and total dry mass and produced more robust shoots of higher mechanical strength (i.e. shoot dry mass/shoot length). Seedlings grown on moss were taller with smaller epicotyls and stem diameters, indicative of an etiolation response associated with steep light gradients in this seedbed. Seedlings grown in mineral soil and mass had higher root/shoot ratios and showed trends toward greater total root length and root branching. The ecological relationship between white spruce and Polytrichum mosses and the comparative value of Polytrichum seedbed in silvicultural systems to promote natural regeneration of white spruce are discussed.",,"Parker, WC (reprint author), ONTARIO FOREST RES INST,BOX 969,1235 QUEEN ST E,SAULT ST MARIE,ON P6A 5N5,CANADA.",,,,,,,40,31,34,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Some wildfires and severe prescribed burns can have similar consequences, Such organic matter reductions can have important implications for soil chemical, biological and physical properties. A number of studies have linked substantial reduction in mycorrhizae development and tree growth to high levels of soil disturbance, or removal of organic horizons, Timber harvesting also removes a large percentage of coarse woody debris, which has unknown ramifications on soil productivity. Current woody residue guidelines in this region recommend leaving <10 to 125 Mg ha(-1) on site to replace woody materials lost during harvesting operations. Large amounts of soil nitrogen (>500 hg ha(-1)) can also be lost from timber harvesting and site preparation, especially when using prescribed flue. The time required to replace this lost nitrogen may range from <10 to >275 yr, and depends on the severity of site treatments, presence or absence of nitrogen fixing plants, and amounts of atmospheric deposition. Maintaining adequate amounts of organic matter on some forest sites in the Inland Northwest may temporarily increase the risk of wildfire or favor the activity of certain insects or disease fungi. However, carefully planned prescribed burns and mechanical site preparation can be practiced on most sites with relatively low impacts on soil organic levels, while accomplishing Vie important forest management objectives of fuel reduction, seedbed preparation, and reducing competing vegetation, Organic matter management will be the most difficult on very dry sites, with their historically low soil organic and nitrogen content, and high fire potential, The maintenance of adequate soil organic matter levels is critical for sustaining forest health and productivity under the variable moisture and temperature conditions of this region, Thus, soil organic components will become more important in the future as ecosystem management systems are developed for western forests.","US FOREST SERV, INTERMT RES STN, USDA, MOSCOW, ID USA","Jurgensen, MF (reprint author), MICHIGAN TECHNOL UNIV, SCH FORESTRY & WOOD PROD, HOUGHTON, MI 49931 USA.",,,,,,,220,159,166,1,56,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0015-749X,,,FOREST SCI,For.

Water availability to plants is limited by precipitation, but the distribution of soil water and period over which it is available in these ecosystems are influenced by the transpiration rates of grasses, We discuss implications of recent and projected increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration for transpiration, soil water availability, and the balance of grasses and shrubs, An increase in CO2 concentration often reduces potential transpiration/leaf area by reducing stomatal conductance. On grasslands where effects of stomatal closure on transpiration are not negated by an increase in leaf temperature and leaf area, rising CO2 concentration should slow the depletion of soil water by grasses and potentially favor shrubs and other species that might otherwise succumb to water stress.

The species originates in China and has been naturalized in the neighboring countries. It was introduced in 1746 into Japan because of the economic value of the young sprouts and culm woods. It escaped from the planted areas and expanded by invading the original vegetation. In order to clarify the basic ecological characteristics of the species, carbon fixation and cycling were determined in a stand of Phyllostachys pubescens. The standing culm density and average DBH in 1991 were 7100 ha(-1) and 11.3 cm, respectively. The above-ground biomass was 116.5 t ha(-1) for culms, 15.5 t ha(-1) for branches, 5.9 t ha(-1) for leaves and 137.9 t ha(-1) in total. The total above-ground biomass was one of the largest among the world's bamboo communities. The biomasses of rhizomes and fine roots were 16.7 t ha(-1) and 27.9 t ha(-1), respectively. Annual soil respiration was 52.3 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1), the highest among those determined in Japan. The gross production was high: 32.8 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Allocation of the products to its root system was also high: 34% to gross production and 46% to the fluxes out of the leaves into other compartments of the ecosystem. This resulted in the reduced above-ground net production of 18.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1), which fell within the average range of productivity of forests under similar climate conditions.

Sharp decreases in plant stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, hydraulic conductance and leaf growth were observed during DD treatment. No significant differences in plant leaf water potential and stomatal conductance were detected between the WW and WD treatments. Nevertheless, the WD treatment resulted in inhibition of leaf expansion and stimulation of root elongation only in the well-watered compartment. Abscisic acid concentrations did not change in leaves, root tips, or xylem sap of WD-compared to WW-treated plants. Increased concentrations of ABA were observed in xylem sap from DD-treated plant roots, but the total flux of ABA to shoots was reduced compared to that in WW-treated plants, because of decreases in transpiration flux. Similar plant responses to the WD and RE treatments indicate that the responses observed in the WD-treated plants were probably not triggered by a positive signal originating from drying roots.","INRA,LAB AMELIORAT ARBRES FORESTIERS,UNITE PHYSIOL DEV,F-45160 OLIVET,FRANCE","Fort, C (reprint author), INRA,EQUIPE BIOCLIMATOL & ECOPHYSIOL,UNITE ECOPHYSIOL FORESTIERE,F-54280 CHAMPENOUX,FRANCE.",,,,,,,44,62,67,1,10,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,1997,17,5,,,,,281,289,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,WX396,WOS:A1997WX39600001,14759851,,,,10/31/19J,"Bigras, FJ",,,,"Bigras, FJ",,,Root cold tolerance of black spruce seedlings: Viability tests in relation to survival and regrowth,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,electrolyte leakage; phenolic leakage; Picea mariana; water loss; water potential,INJURY,"Root systems of 6-month-old, cold-hardened, container-grown black spruce seedlings (Picea mariana (Mill.)

Both varieties were exposed to five simulated O-3 exposures (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x ambient levels). Simulated growth of var. ponderosa was reduced more than that in var. scopulorum at all O-3 exposures. In var. ponderosa 1xO(3) over 3 years caused reductions in biomass of fine-root (-117%), branch (-20%), and total nonstructural carbohydrate (60%) relative to growth in the absence of O-3. At 1xO(3) var. scopulorum displayed far less reductions in fine-root biomass (-10%) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (-5%). At 3 x O-3, total biomass increment in var. ponderosa and var. scopulorum was depressed 48% and 32%, respectively. The resistance to O-3 of var. scopulorum relative to var. ponderosa is attributed to lower stomatal conductance and greater carbon allocation to belowground tree compartments.

We describe a new model of plant growth that is general, deterministic, non-stationary and mechanistic in nature. Its purpose is to investigate the extent to which the morphology and function of the whole plant can be determined by resource acquisition and utilization on the part of its components. 2. The model is a two-dimensional section, showing the plant in its above- and below-ground environments. The whole plant is represented by a branching structure made up from standard 'modules'. The behaviour of the complete plant is determined exclusively by a rule set that acts only at the level of the individual module. 3. At the level of the whole plant, the model displays a classic S-shaped growth curve, plasticity in root-shoot allocation, and foraging in heterogeneous environments. 4. At the level of the plant population, the model exhibits self-thinning along a -2/1 self-thinning line. This accords with the behaviour expected of a two-dimensional system and also adds weight to the 'geometric' interpretation of the -3/2 self-thinning Line commonly seen in crowded populations of real plants. 5. An imposed 'mutation' in one of the modular rules allows us to produce a modified plant type that displays active foraging. In a set of simulations involving a model community containing both the modified and standard plant types, the modified type predominates in resource-rich environments, and vice versa. 6. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of modular rule-based methods from which whole-plant behaviour can arise as an emergent property. The model suggests that active foraging carries a cost that cannot satisfactorily be borne at low levels of resource availability. It also implies that competition for resources, both above and below ground is in the form of a 'contest' (rather than a 'scramble'). The success of the modular model highlights the primacy of resource acquisition and utilization in determining the ecological status of the plant.",,"Colasanti, RL (reprint author), UNIV SHEFFIELD, DEPT ANIM & PLANT SCI, NERC UNIT COMPARAT PLANT ECOL, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,50,22,23,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The addition of phosphorus did not significantly increase the growth of either nonmycorrhizal or mycorrhizal P. vulgaris. 3 The three AMF isolates differed significantly in their effects on size of the two plant species. The AMF isolates also differed in their effects on stolen branching and stolen length and here the effects were not the same in the two plant species, The differential effects of AMF isolates on clonal growth traits were consistently independent of the level of AMF colonization throughout the experiment, indicating that the effects were not due to different rates of colonization. Some of the AMF isolate effects on stolen branching in P. vulgaris is were also independent of the effects of AMF isolates on plant size. These results suggest that different AMF in a natural community have the potential to influence the growth, number of ramets and distribution of ramets in Prunella populations. 4 The strong differential effects of AMF isolates on clonal growth traits of P. vulgaris occurred in a homogeneous environment. Plasticity in such traits has previously been considered important for efficient resource foraging in a heterogeneous environment. Our results, however, indicate that different AMF in a community could strongly influence resource foraging strategies in clonal plants irrespective of environmental heterogeneity. The results also suggest that increasing the availability of phosphorus would be unlikely to alter these effects. 5 Our results point strongly to the potential importance of AMF diversity as a determinant of plant population structure in ecosystems.","UNIV BASEL,INST BOT,ABT PFLANZENPHYSIOL,CH-4056 BASEL,SWITZERLAND",,,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; Boller, Thomas/G-3500-2012","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Boller, Thomas/0000-0001-6768-7503",,,,38,150,159,2,46,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The experiment was performed in a pine forest area at an altitude of 3200 m above sea level. The grass and the root-feeder species were native and dominant in the understory and in the macroarthropod root-feeder communities, respectively. Plants were established in pots in the field and were subjected to the following treatments in a factorial design: simulated defoliation (three levels) and BGH (with or without root-feeder larvae) with ten replicates per treatment. Plants were defoliated three times at 2-month intervals. The interaction between defoliation and root herbivory was significant for all components of plant biomass. In every case, light defoliation with BGH decreased live aboveground, root and total plant biomass, and the number of live tillers by more than 50% with respect to the same defoliation level without root-feeders. Plants apparently did not compensate for the carbon drain by root-feeders when a high proportion of older leaves were not removed by defoliation. Plants under heavy defoliation were not affected by the presence of root-feeders and showed a greater live/dead above-ground biomass ratio than lightly defoliated and control plants. Defoliation and BGH did not change tiller and root N concentrations but root herbivores did decrease live-tiller N content in lightly defoliated plants. Root-feeders but not defoliation decreased the root/shoot ratio by 40% and the live/dead above-ground biomass ratio by 45% through increased tiller mortality. Survivorship and final biomass of Phyllophaga sp. larvae were not affected by defoliation treatments during the 6-month study period.","UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO,CTR ECOL,MEXICO CITY 04510,DF,MEXICO",,,"Moron-Rios, Alejandro/E-6395-2013; Moron-Rios, Alejandro/N-5754-2016","Moron-Rios, Alejandro/0000-0001-8790-0383; Moron-Rios, Alejandro/0000-0001-8790-0383",,,,43,17,17,0,9,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1997,110,2,,,,,237,242,,10.1007/s004420050156,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WW157,WOS:A1997WW15700013,28307431,,,,10/31/19J,"Simard, SW; Durall, DM; Jones, MD",,,,"Simard, SW; Durall, DM; Jones, MD",,,Carbon allocation and carbon transfer between Betula papyrifera and Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings using a C-13 pulse-labeling method,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Betula papyrifera (paper birch); C-13 pulse-labeling; carbon allocation; carbon transfer; Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir),PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; BIRCH; GROWTH; HYPHAE; CO2,"Here we describe a simple method for pulse-labeling tree seedlings with (CO2(gas)-C-13), and then apply the method in two related experiments: (i) comparison of carbon allocation patterns between Betula papyrifera Marsh. and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France, and (ii) measurement of one-way belowground carbon transfer from B. papyrifera to Fl menziesii. Intraspecific carbon allocation patterns and interspecific carbon transfer both influence resource allocation, and consequently development, in mixed communities of B. papyrifera and P. menziesii. In preparation for the two experiments, we first identified the appropriate (CO2(gas)-C-13) pulse-chase regime for labeling seedlings: a range of pulse (100-mL and 200-mL 99 atom% (CO2(gas)-C-13)) and chase (0, 3 and 6 d) treatments were applied to one year-old B. papyrifera and P. menziesii seedlings. The amount of (CO2)-C-13 fixed immediately after 1.5 h exposure was greatest for both B. papyrifera (40.8 mg excess C-13) and P. menziesii (22.9 mg excess C-13) with the 200-mL pulse, but higher C-13 loss and high sample variability resulted in little difference in excess C-13 content between pulse treatments after 3 d for either species. The average excess C-13 root/shoot ratio of B. papyrifera and P. menziesii changed from 0.00 immediately following the pulse to 0.61 and 0.87 three and six days later, which reflected translocation of 75% of fixed isotope out of foliage within 3 d following the pulse and continued enrichment in fine roots over 6 d. Based on these results, the 100-mL CO2(gas) and 6-d chase were considered appropriate for the carbon allocation and belowground transfer experiments. In the carbon allocation experiment, we found after 6 d that B. papyrifera allocated 49% (average 9.5 mg) and P. menziesii 41% (average 5.8 mg) of fixed isotope to roots, of which over 55% occurred in fine roots in both species. Species differences in isotope allocation patterns paralleled differences in tissue biomass distribution. The greater pulse labeling efficiency of B. papyrifera compared to P. menziesii was associated with its two-fold and 13-fold greater leaf and whole seedling net photosynthetic rates, respectively, 53% greater biomass, and 35% greater root/shoot ratio. For the carbon transfer experiment, B. papyrifera and P. menziesii were grown together in laboratory rootboxes, with their roots intimately mingled. A pulse of 100 mL (CO2(gas)-C-13) was applied to paper birch and one-way transfer to neighboring P. menziesii was measured after 6 d. Of the excess C-13 fixed by B. papyrifera, 4.7% was transferred to neighboring P. menziesii, which distributed the isotope evenly between roots and shoots. Of the isotope received by P. menziesii, we estimated that 93% was taken up through belowground pathways, and the remaining 7% taken up by foliage as (CO2(gas)-C-13) respired by B. papyrifera shoots. These two experiments indicate that B. papyrifera fixes more total carbon and allocates a greater proportion to its root system than does Il menziesii, giving it a competitive edge in resource gathering; however, below-ground carbon sharing is of sufficient magnitude that it may help ensure co-existence of the two species in mixed communities.","OKANAGAN UNIV COLL, DEPT BIOL, KELOWNA, BC V1V 1V7, CANADA","Simard, SW (reprint author), BRITISH COLUMBIA MINIST FORESTS, 515 COLUMBIA ST, KAMLOOPS, BC V2C 2T7, CANADA.",,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184",,,,48,47,61,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,1997,191,1,,,,,41,55,,10.1023/A:1004205727882,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XP697,WOS:A1997XP69700005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Redecker, D; vonBerswordtWallrabe, P; Beck, DP; Werner, D",,,,"Redecker, D; vonBerswordtWallrabe, P; Beck, DP; Werner, D",,,Influence of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on stable isotopes of nitrogen in Phaseolus vulgaris,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; legume-rhizobia; symbiosis; N-15 natural abundance; Phaseolus vulgaris; Rhizobium spp.; Glomus spp.; inoculation,FIELD CONDITIONS; GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; SOIL; VALUES,"The interactions between Phaseolus vulgaris, Rhizobium spp. strains nodulating P. vulgaris, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were assessed under greenhouse conditions in a nonsterilized Typic Haplustalf soil from Cauca, Colombia.

An examination of the biomass distribution coefficients demonstrated that there were temporal changes and clonal differences in the activity of biomass sinks within a tree. Again, hybrid clones had contrasting patterns in the first year: clone 11-11 apportioned more biomass into leaves and branches, whereas clone 44-136 apportioned more biomass into roots, which contributed to rapid leaf and stem growth early in the second growing season. Our results suggest that clonal differences in total biomass, in allocation to different tree components, and in harvest index have important implications for future ideotype-based breeding programs with Populus.","UNIV WASHINGTON, COLL FOREST RESOURCES, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Hinckley, Thomas M/F-9249-2010; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","Hinckley, Thomas M/0000-0002-2821-6044; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358",,,,39,90,94,0,11,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Inhibition of ion uptake by cinnamic acid, a main component of root exudates, was both concentration- and pH-dependent. With decreasing pH, the inhibitory effect on the ion uptake increased. With benzoic and cinnamic acids, the substitution of hydrophilic group(s) on the benzene ring alleviated the inhibition of ion uptake. Aromatic acids enhanced ion leakage. The potency was in proportion, but not equal, to the extent of uptake inhibition. The lipophilicity was a valuable index for evaluating the allelopathic potential of aromatic acids.","SHIMANE UNIV, FAC LIFE & RESOURCE SCI, MATSUE, SHIMANE 690, JAPAN","Yu, JQ (reprint author), ZHEJIANG AGR UNIV, DEPT HORT, HANGZHOU 310029, PEOPLES R CHINA.",,,,,,,19,155,255,2,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

The two species responded similarly to the 37 sediment types; there was a strong correlation between the find biomass of M. spicatum and the find biomass of P. pectinatus for a given sediment type. Our results indicated that in these sediments, organic matter and density were not effective predictors of macrophyte growth. Root:shoot ratios of both P. pectinatus and M. spicatum were inversely related to the final biomass, and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations of M. spicatum shoots were inversely related to root:shoot ratios. This suggests that plants were responding to sediment infertility by allocating proportionately more growth to root formation. Tissue analysis indicated that M. spicatum growth was phosphorus limited on some sediments, and this may have been a result of reduced phosphorus availability due to binding with calcium.","LUND UNIV,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN",,,,"Weisner, Stefan/0000-0002-5181-0391",,,,35,4,5,0,7,OIKOS PUBL INC,LA CROSSE,"PO BOX 2558, LA CROSSE, WI 54601",0270-5060,,,J FRESHWATER ECOL,J.

We measured the effects winter browsing by moose (Alces alces) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) had on mycorrhizal infection and fine root biomass of willow (Salix spp.) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). We found that protection from winter browsing increased ectomycorrhizal infection by 10% in the top 5 cm of the soil profile, by 23% at 5-10 cm, and by 42% at the 10-15 cm depth. Mammal browsing in taiga forests is now recognized as a major cause of the shift from palatable deciduous species such as willow and balsam poplar to less palatable species such as alder and spruce. We suggest that browsing-induced reduction in ectomycorrhizal infection of salicaceous species plays a central role in this shift in plant community composition.","UNIV ALASKA,INST ARCTIC BIOL,FAIRBANKS,AK 99775",,,,,,,,29,45,45,1,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1997,110,1,,,,,94,98,,10.1007/s004420050137,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WP452,WOS:A1997WP45200012,28307473,,,,10/31/19J,"Wilkinson, DM",,,,"Wilkinson, DM",,,The role of seed dispersal in the evolution of mycorrhizae,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; PLANTS,The fungi in mycorrhizal associations often show a lack of specificity and are acquired by horizontal rather than vertical transmission.

We carried out a study of the seasonal dynamics of gross root production and death to determine how elevated CO2 affected the dynamics of net and gross root production through a full growing season. We quantified gross root production and root loss from sequential, in situ images of fine roots of Betula papyrifera in ambient (375 ppm.) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2 atmospheres from 2 weeks following germination through leaf senescence. We found that elevated CO2 led to increases in the magnitude of cumulative gross production (Sigma P) and cumulative gross loss (Sigma L) of roots. However, the effect of elevated CO2 on these processes was seasonally dependent. Elevated CO2 led to greater levels of enhancement in Sigma P early in the growing season, prior to maximum standing root length (NP). In contrast, elevated CO2 led to greater levels of enhancement in Sigma L in the last half of the growing season, after maximum NP had been reached. This difference in the timing of when elevated CO2 affects Sigma P and Sigma L led to a transitory, early enhancement in NP. By the end of the growing season, there was no significant effect of elevated CO2 on NP, and Sigma P was 87% greater than NP for ambient CO2 and 117% greater in elevated CO2. We conclude that static assessments of belowground productivity may greatly underestimate gross fine root productivity and turnover and this bias can be exaggerated with elevated CO2.","HARVARD UNIV, DEPT ORGANISM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, BIOL LABS, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",,,,,,,,28,18,26,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,1997,190,2,,,,,211,216,,10.1023/A:1004222131516,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XP119,WOS:A1997XP11900004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Doube, BM; Schmidt, O; Killham, K; Correll, R",,,,"Doube, BM; Schmidt, O; Killham, K; Correll, R",,,Influence of mineral soil on the palatability of organic matter for lumbricid earthworms: A simple food preference study,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,5th International Symposium on Earthworm Ecology (ISEE 5),"JUL 05-09, 1994","COLUMBUS, OH",,,,APORRECTODEA-TRAPEZOIDES LUMBRICIDAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TERRESTRIS L; PROPAGULES; CULTURE; GROWTH; ROOTS,"The food-preference behaviour of earthworms was examined in order to develop earthworm feeds which might act as a microbial carrier in earthworm-mediated dispersal of beneficial microorganisms in soil. A circular choice chamber containing 18 feeding stations was used to assess the food-type preference of four earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. longa, Lumbricus rubellus, L. terrestris). Representatives of each species were presented with four types of organic matter (cow dung, sheep dung, decomposed leaf litter, sewage sludge) either alone or mixed 1 to 4 (on a dry weight basis) with a sandy loam soil; soil alone was also tested in the same chamber. The nine types of potential food were each inoculated with Pseudomonas corrugata 2140R lux8 at a rate of 10(7) cfu (colony forming units) g(-1) wet wt of material. All earthworm species showed a strong preference for pure mineral soil over pure organic matter. Also, mineral-organic mixtures were clearly preferred to pure organic sources, with I:af litter + soil being the preferred mixture for all four earthworm species tested. In addition, cow dung + soil and sewage sludge + soil were acceptable to all species except A. caliginosa. Inoculation of the food stuffs with Pseudomonas corrugata 2140R lux8 did not deter the earthworms from feeding and earthworm casts contained from 10(7) to 10(9) cfu g(-1) wet wt. The choice chamber method offers a simple, rapid and inexpensive test for studying food preferences of earthworms for various applications.

'Regal') from biosolids-induced heavy metal toxicity is of great concern because of their symbiotic association and capacity for N-2 fixation, A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the effects of heavy metals from biosolids on the population and N-2 fixing potential of Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii under two pH regimes. In 1994, soils (Typic Paleudults) were collected from plots that had previously received 224 Mg ha(-1) heat-treated and 100 Mg ha(-1) Nu-Earth biosolids (applied in 1976 and 1978, respectively). Six soil treatments were used for the study: a control with low and high pH and two biosolids treatments, each with low and high pH. Soil pH and biosolids application significantly affected uptake of metals with phytotoxicity observed in the low pH soil amended with biosolids. The number of Rhizobium was significantly reduced in all low pH treatments. This resulted in no or ineffective nodulation by plants grown in these treatments. High numbers of Rhizobium were found in all high pH treatments, irrespective of metal content. Heat-treated biosolids-amended soil had higher numbers of Rhizobium than the control, but Nu-Earth biosolids-amended soil had lower numbers than the control. Nitrogen fixation, as measured by acetylene reduction activity, was greater in all high pH treatments compared with low pH treatments, When soil pH from the acidic plots was adjusted above 6.0, most of the isolates remained ineffective. Shoot yield and the number of Rhizobium did not show any significant increase with the increase in soil pH. Adjustment of high pH soil to low soil pH significantly reduced the number of Rhizobium irrespective of whether biosolids were applied. In conclusion, few significant effects of biosolids-borne heavy metals on plants, N-2 fixation, and on numbers of Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii were observed at concentrations of metals studied, as long as soil PH was maintained near 6.0. Where reductions in rhizobial number and plant parameters were observed, the decrease was primarily attributed to low soil pH and to a lesser extent heavy metal toxicity from biosolids.","UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT AGRON, COLLEGE PK, MD 20742 USA; USDA ARS, BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR, ENVIRONM CHEM LAB, BELTSVILLE, MD 20705 USA; USDA ARS, SOYBEAN & ALFALFA RES LAB, BELTSVILLE, MD 20705 USA",,,,"Ibekwe, Abasiofiok/0000-0003-3352-759X",,,,33,26,30,2,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

Functional soil volume decreases with drier climatic conditions while the substantiated rooting density, i.e., rooting density within the functional soil volume, remains constant. Substantiated rooting density differs from mean root density, which is defined as root biomass averaged over the entire rooting volume. This approach reflects the biological reality that, as a fraction of fine roots cease to function, the soil volume they inhabit can be considered to be non-functional. Thus functional soil volume becomes increasingly porous, and this porosity can be represented in terms of a volumetric power index. Hydrological equilibrium theory (Grier and Running, 1977; Eagleson, 1982; Nemani and Running, 1989; Pierce et al., 1993) implies that climate, functional soil volume, and total leaf area for a community of plants are in equilibrium. By expressing the dynamic characteristic of functional soil volume in terms of changing leaf area measurements, i.e., that soil rooting volume expressed as a function of leaf area by a scaling exponent, the relationship between transpiration and leaf area based on hydrologic equilibrium theory is established (Hatton and Wu, 1995). Using measurements of plant transpiration rate, parameter values relating these variables can be obtained from nonlinear fitting procedures. Four data sets from Wycanna, old are use to illustrate the procedure of describing fine root dynamics.

Nondefoliated plants served as controls. Root growth was estimated by root length density measurements obtained through destructive harvesting, and by using a root periscope to monitor changes in the number of roots intercepting glass tubes buried in the soil. The root periscope allowed registration of the angle of each root interception, which made it possible to measure the root system dynamics (root appearance and disappearance). The effects of defoliating S. tenuis and P. napostaense at different phenological stages on root growth varied with the methodology used. Root growth of both species was not reduced by defoliation when it was estimated from root length density determinations. However, it:was lower (p < 0.05) on plants which were defoliated late compared to those not defoliated during the growing season when it was estimated using the root periscope. Lack of agreement in the results obtained by the two methods could be associated with various problems inherent in the use of the root periscope. This instrument was, however, useful in providing a rapid evaluation of root system dynamics (through root appearance and disappearance) in both species. A greater cumulative root appearance and disappearance, for example, occurred after plants were defoliated early rather than late in the growing season. This may have contributed, at least in part, to the overcompensation in forage production which was observed on plants defoliated at the vegetative stage during 2 consecutive years of study.

We conducted a shaded greenhouse experiment during two summers using stonemint dittany (Cunila origanoides (L.) Britton) as an indicator species. We used a modified stair-step bioassay with donor pots producing two levels of recycled leachates from hardwood seedlings root exudates, foliage washes, and decaying leaves. At the lower density, each donor pot had three hardwood seedlings and three applications 300 cm(2) of mature leaves of the same species to the litter layer (LAI = 1.5). At the higher density, we doubled the number of seedlings and surface area of mature leaves in the litter layer (LAI=3.0). Donor species tested for 1 or 2 years included sand-only, sugar maple, white oak, flowering dogwood, pawpaw, and black walnut. Dittany stem height ranged from 38 cm when exposed to leachates from white oak seedlings to 49 cm when exposed to leachates from sand-only donor pots. Dittany stem dry weights sh-owed no differences in either year in response to leachates produced by different hardwood seedlings or at the two donor densities. Most dittany stems produced nearly 2,000 flowers during a 10 week period which began with completion of axillary shoot elongation. No differences in date of flower initiation or cumulative flower production were found in response to any of the hardwood leachates. We conclude that allelopathic interference of dittany by hardwoods, if it occurs at all, may require more stressful conditions than were created in this study and that the absence of dittany in oak-hickory stands after the invasion by sugar maple or pawpaw results primarily from competition for light and other resources.","Univ Missouri, US Forest Serv, N Cent Forest Expt Stn, USDA, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Van Sambeek, JW (reprint author), Univ Missouri, US Forest Serv, N Cent Forest Expt Stn, USDA, 1-26 Agr Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV, N CENT RES STN",ST PAUL,"1992 FOLWELL AVENUE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA",0363-616X,,,US FOR SERV T R NC,,,1997,188,,,,,,294,303,,,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,BK52U,WOS:000072439000044,,,,,10/31/19J,"Meier, M; Saurer, M; Haldemann, C; Fuhrer, J",,,,"Meier, M; Saurer, M; Haldemann, C; Fuhrer, J",,,Effect of elevated CO2 on the carbon balance of a grass-clover mixture,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon balance; elevated CO2; C-13; exudation; Dactylis glomerata; Trifolium pratense,,"Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of elevated CO2 (780 mu mol mol(-1)) on the C-balance and carbon release from the roots of a mixture of Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium pratense.

We analysed the trends in the piezometric heads and salinity concentrations over the period of record. We also modelled the hillslope profile using finite element analysis to determine the water flow mechanisms and to see how a change in vegetation in the upland area would affect the waterlogging and salinity. Piezometric levels under the trees decreased for the first 5 years after planting and then stabilised until 1991 when they started gradually decreasing again. The non-treed area between the plantation blocks remained unaffected until about 1991, when the levels there also started to decrease quite significantly, probably because of the trees. The trees therefore appear to have been effective and beneficial in the short to medium term. However, the salinity of the groundwater under the trees has increased significantly in the last 5 years, particularly where the tree density is highest. The continued flow of saline groundwater to the trees is believed to be increasing the salinity. It could not be expected that plantations of this type will maintain hearth and be able to control the excess water in such an hydrologic setting in the long term. Tree plantations on discharge areas are a short to medium term management strategy, not a solution, and the only way to control salinity in the long term is to plant vegetation species in the recharge areas that use all of the water that falls there. Modelling showed that only a small surplus of water over winter, in the order of 50 mm/year, caused the increased recharge and consequent salinisation. The modelling results also show that the surplus could be managed with an effective vegetation species (e.g. lucerne) with a rooting depth of about 1.5 m that would be able to transpire at least until early to mid summer.","WESTERN AUSTRALIA DEPT AGR,ALBANY,WA,AUSTRALIA; WESTERN AUSTRALIA DEPT AGR,BUNBURY,WA 6230,AUSTRALIA","Stolte, WJ (reprint author), UNIV SASKATCHEWAN,SASKATOON,SK S7N 5A9,CANADA.",,"McFarlane, Don/A-7256-2013","McFarlane, Don/0000-0002-3828-4964",,,,17,24,24,0,0,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",Apr-73,,,AUST J SOIL RES,Aust.

However, different osmotic treatments might exert the same effect on MGT while inducing a different amount of nuclei to enter the synthetic phase. The activation and progress in DNA synthesis during priming, therefore, appear to be strongly influenced by the osmotic conditions and length of the treatment. Osmoconditioning of controlled deteriorated seeds exerted various effects on seed germination, depending on seed deterioration. Under the same treatment, the amount of priming-induced DNA synthesis was lower than in unaged seeds or it was not induced at all. Osmotic treatments considerably lowered seed tolerance to adverse storage conditions as compared with untreated seeds.

Percentages of total mycorrhizal colonization for 2- and 3-year-old seedlings were very high (range of means: 88-93%). In August, it was possible to distinguish six mycorrhizal types: four ascomycetes (Tuber sp., an E-strain fungus, Phialophora finlandia Wang & Wilcox, and an unidentified ''red type'') and two basidiomycetes (Hebeloma sp, and Thelephora terrestris Ehrh.:Fr.). Ascomycetes were the dominant colonizers (69.8% of the root tips), while basidiomycetes colonized 24.4% of the root tips. E-strain, a common colonizer in nurseries and disturbed sites, was the dominant mycorrhiza former, occupying 50.9% of the root tips examined. Frequencies of root rot were consistently higher among 3-year-old seedlings (range of means: 14.8-30.5%) than among 2 year olds (range of means: 7.4-9.2%).

In contrast, bacterial numbers, microbial activity (measured as fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity), and the amount of extractable carbon (C) in the rhizosphere of perennial ryegrass were independent of the amount of soil recovered from the roots. The missing rhizosphere effect in perennial ryegrass soils can be explained by the high rooting density of ryegrass, whereas the low rooting density of white clover results in gradients of microbial numbers and activities in soils. Results of these studies indicate that it is important to express microbial parameters on root length and soil weight bases, especially for less densely rooted soils.","CAS,INST SOIL BIOL,CZ-37005 CESKE BUDEJOVICE,CZECH REPUBLIC; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT SOIL WATER & CLIMATE,ST PAUL,MN 55108; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT MICROBIOL,ST PAUL,MN 55108","Schortemeyer, M (reprint author), AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV,RES SCH BIOL SCI,ENVIRONM BIOL GRP,CANBERRA,ACT 2601,AUSTRALIA.",,"Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016","Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781",,,,17,7,14,0,12,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Concomitant measurements of several soil and site environmental variables were also made. We then used regression models to quantify the relationships between these environmental variables and fine root demography. Generally, environmental factors had a moderate effect on broad, inherent phenological patterns of root activity and abundance. For example, both shallow fine root length density and potential evapotranspiration reached their maximum in mid-summer, but the relationship between the two was not strong at either site (R(2)=0.12). Deep root length density was not significantly related to any measured environmental factor. Periods of high water demand during which soil moisture was also abundant (i, e., late spring and early summer) were related to increased shallow root production. Root length mortality was low at these times, but the correlation with soil moisture was statistically significant only in the shallow depth increment. Quantifying the relative importance of the environment on root growth in large field studies like ours is complicated by a number of factors. These include the difficulty of intensive sampling, interactive effects of environmental factors, and the uncertainty of encountering environmental conditions sufficiently severe to elicit a measurable root response during the study period.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT FORESTRY,E LANSING,MI 48824",,,,,,,,27,51,63,2,22,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON ALEXANDRE-VACHON, UNIV LAVAL, ST FOY PQ G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,1997,4,1,,,,,99,105,,10.1080/11956860.1997.11682383,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WQ424,WOS:A1997WQ42400014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mayhead, GJ; Boothman, IR",,,,"Mayhead, GJ; Boothman, IR",,,The effect of treeshelter height on the early growth of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt) Liebl),FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Sessile oak 1 + 1 transplants were grown for 4 years in a weed-free environment at 1 x Im spacing on a fertile sheltered site.

Seedling morphology, root condition, root frost hardiness and bud dry matter were determined at each date. There were clear morphological differences among seed origins. Seedlings raised from the commercial seedlot (A70) were larger but had a poorer root:shoot ratio than the other seed origins. Of the native pines tested, the Loch Maree Islands origin allocated a larger proportion of its photosynthate to fine roots and needles and smaller proportion to woody structures. Seedlings raised from the commercial British seedlot tended to have poorer bud lignification than the other origins and also, in autumn, higher electrolyte leakage rates from its fine roots. During winter, the Swedish origin had the lowest fine root electrolyte leakage. Seedlings of all origins showed a progressive increase in fine root hardiness towards mid-winter with maximum hardiness (-7 degrees C) in January. Dehardening occurred over subsequent months reaching -3 degrees C in April. Differences among origins were evident.

A review of water infiltration literature and some infiltrometer trials in the early sixties led to the formulation of the Air-Earth-intercept (AEI) Concept for water infiltration into initially dry soils which states that the microroughness and macroporosity of the AEI regulate the exchange of surface water and displaced soil air across the AEI with the rough open interface having very high exchange rates and with the smooth closed interface having very low rates. This concept was supported and verified by a series of sprinkling infiltrometer studies, wherein manipulation of surface microroughness and macroporosity gave an order-of-magnitude control over water infiltration. A tenfold increase in infiltration is enough to prevent water runoff even from high intensity storms, thereby eliminating soil erosion. The infiltration role of displaced soil air was verified by using border-irrigation and closed-top infiltrometers to demonstrate that very small soil air pressures could greatly reduce infiltration by blocking downward water flow in macropores. The next step was to apply the AEI Infiltration Concept to controlling erosion on degraded land areas through infiltration acceleration and revegetation. What was needed was a device or machine that would efficiently restore stable roughness and openness to the smooth sealed AEI of degraded land to, in turn, restore the high rates of rainwater infiltration required for erosion control and successful revegetation. This led to the invention and development of a series of land imprinting devices. By efficiently controlling infiltration and erosion, these devices have already restored perennial grasses to 20,000 hectares of degraded rangeland in southern Arizona alone. With the successful development of land imprinting, the AEI concept evolved into the AEI model for restoring degraded land through infiltration and erosion control. This diagrammatic and verbal model of four AEI processes helps guide revegetation projects to successful completion. Currently, imprinters are being developed for steep-slope revegetation. Imprinter attachments for seeding and inoculating with mycorrhizae have already been developed and successfully field tested.",,"Dixon, RM (reprint author), IMPRINTING FDN, 1231 E BIG ROCK RD, TUCSON, AZ 85718 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,INT EROSION CONTROL ASSOC,STEAMBOAT SPRINGS,"PO BOX 4904, STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, CO 80477 USA",1092-2806,,,IECA P CONF,,,1997,28,,,,,,153,164,,,,,12,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Water Resources",Engineering; Water Resources,BH75C,WOS:A1997BH75C00015,,,,,10/31/19B,"Arche, NC",,"Zabala, NQ",,"Arche, NC",,,Responses of selected Albizia species to the allelopathic substances from Eucalyptus at seedling stage under shade house conditions,INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ALBIZIA AND PARASERIANTHES SPECIES,"FOREST, FARM, AND COMMUNITY TREE RESEARCH REPORTS",,English,Proceedings Paper,International Workshop on Albizia and Paraserianthes Species,"NOV 13-19, 1994","BISLIG, PHILIPPINES","Winrock Int Inst Agr Dev, UN Dev Program, FOA Reg Forest Tree Improvement Project, PICOP Resources Inc",,,,"The response of six selected species of Albizia, namely, A. falcataria (L.)

In addition to these macro-gradients, micro-gradients of sand stability and available moisture across each dune slope result in stratified grass communities on the dunes. The effects of abiotic factors and plant associations on the community structure of VA-mycorrhizal fungi in a naturally arid and unstable grassland could thus be investigated. Mycorrhizal fungal communities associated with five grass species were sampled at sites located across the gradients. Diversity and abundance of spores, as well as percent mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots, were used to characterize the fungal communities and their plant specificity. Five Glomus species (Glomales) were associated with grasses at all sites, but no plant specificity was observed. Rather, the fungal communities varied in diversity and abundance both within a dune site and across the dune field. Regression analyses showed that spore abundance and colonization levels were significantly affected by abiotic factors. Sand stability affected spore abundance and thus determined the limits of distribution of the fungal community in the dune grassland. In contrast, colonization levels were primarily affected by moisture availability, and fungal growth and spore production following an isolated rain event were closely associated with moisture availability. A rapid and opportunistic growth response to moisture, production of resilient spores in response to declining moisture, and lack of plant symbiont specificity are characteristics which allow mycorrhizal fungal communities to function under hyperarid conditions.

The bulk of the isolates (91%) were watery, milky-translucent and curdled milk types with moderate to copious extracellular polysaccharide (EPS). The rest were creamy or white opaque with little to moderate EPS production. Overall, they showed a wide range of growth rates: very fast-growing (mean generation time 1.6-2.5 h), fast-growing (2.8-4.8 h), intermediate between fast- and slow-growing (5.6-5.7 h) and slow- and very slow-growing (6.4-8.8 h). The isolates were tentatively grouped into Rhizobium spp., to include very fast, fast and intermediate (acid-producing) types; and Bradyrhizobium spp., to include very slow, slow and intermediate (alkali-producing) types. Bradyrhizobium spp. were more sensitive to antibiotics (40 mu g mL(-1)) than Rhizobium spp., contrary to the general opinion which indicates that they are normally resistant. Cluster analysis based on sensitivity responses of IAR and STL could not distinguish Rhizobium spp. from Bradyrhizobium spp., neither was there any association by site nor host of isolation except for those isolates trapped with Phaseolus vulgaris at Kibwezi. Our data demonstrated a high diversity of tropical rhizobia associated with trees.","KENYA FORESTRY RES INST,DIV BIOTECHNOL,NAIROBI,KENYA","Odee, DW (reprint author), UNIV DUNDEE,DEPT BIOL SCI,DUNDEE DD1 4HN,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,43,58,60,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,1997,188,1,,,,,65,75,,10.1023/A:1004204413140,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XC244,WOS:A1997XC24400008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Shaw, JE; Reynolds, T; Sprent, JI",,,,"Shaw, JE; Reynolds, T; Sprent, JI",,,A study of the symbiotic importance and location of nod gene inducing compounds in two widely nodulating and two non-nodulating tropical tree species,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia; Faidherbia; flavonoids; nod genes; non-nodulating; rhizobia,PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; ROOT EXUDATE; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; MIMOSOID LEGUME; ALFALFA SEEDS; INDUCERS; EXPRESSION; ACTIVATION; LUTEOLIN,"Previous work led us to consider the role of nod gene-inducing compounds in related nodulating and non-nodulating Acacia species. Could the nodulation status of the non-nodulating plants be determined by an inability to produce and exude compounds that the related nodulating species were capable of delivering to the rhizobial symbionts? Also, it seemed to have been assumed previously that results gathered for extracts of seedlings or root tissue would reflect the situation for compounds exuded freely into the rhizosphere. The growth medium used in this investigation gave an opportunity to test this theory with the added bonus of allowing root exudates to be collected from a limited number of plants. The two non-nodulating species were found to lack neither the ability to produce potentially inducing compounds nor the means to exude them into the rhizosphere. However, it was demonstrated, through the distribution of potentially inducing compounds within the plants and their exudates, that the components of tissue extractions did not necessarily reflect the components exuded into the rhizosphere.","UNIV DUNDEE,DEPT BIOL SCI,DUNDEE DD1 4HN,SCOTLAND; ROYAL BOT GARDENS,JODRELL LAB,RICHMOND TW9 3DS,SURREY,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,1997,188,1,,,,,77,82,,10.1023/A:1004212330945,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XC244,WOS:A1997XC24400009,,,,,10/31/19J,"AbdelGadir, AH; Alexander, M",,,,"AbdelGadir, AH; Alexander, M",,,Procedures to enhance heat resistance of Rhizobium,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,alginate; clay; heat resistance; Rhizobium,PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; BACTERIA; SOIL; TEMPERATURES; INOCULANT; ALGINATE; MUTANTS; STRAINS,"Means were sought to enhance the heat resistance of a strain of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli that died rapidly in soil at 43 degrees C.

The following site preparations were used: I) mounding organic and surface mineral horizons; 2) mounding with subsequent physical removal or chemical control of competing vegetation; 3) scalping to reduce competing vegetation; and, 4) a control or no post-harvest disturbance. Treatments were applied on relatively harsh and moderate sites in northern Idaho. Most ectomycorrhizae on the seedling population were found in the mineral substrates that dominated planting sites. However, compared to mineral substrates, highest seedling ectomycorrhizal tip counts were recorded in organic matter, particularly decayed wood or mixtures containing decayed wood. Strong ectomycorrhizal development was characteristic of western white pine. It supported highest ectomycorrhizal activity in organic substrates on the harshest treatments (scalps). Douglas-fir showed even stronger relative increases of ectomycorrhizae in organic substrates on harsh treatments. Three of the four common ectomycorrhizal morphological types were concentrated in mineral substrates with all treatments. A treatment-induced change of behavior was shown by the principal pine type. It occurred at highest numbers in organic substrates of the mound with competing vegetation treatment and in mineral substrates with the control. If relative availability to seedling roots was considered, organics (especially decomposed wood) were generally equal or superior to mineral substrates for supporting ectomycorrhizal activity on planted seedlings.","MICHIGAN TECHNOL UNIV, SCH FORESTRY & WOOD PROD, HOUGHTON, MI 49931 USA","Harvey, AE (reprint author), US FOREST SERV, USDA, INTERMT RES STN, MOSCOW, ID 83843 USA.",,,,,,,43,15,17,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,1997,188,1,,,,,107,117,,10.1023/A:1004299928220,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XC244,WOS:A1997XC24400013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mamoun, M; Oliver, JM",,,,"Mamoun, M; Oliver, JM",,,Mycorrhizal inoculation of cloned hazels by Tuber melanosporum: Effect of soil disinfestation and co-culture with Festuca ovina,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Festuca ovina; hazel; interaction; mycorrhization; Tuber melanosporum,,"A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of soil disinfestation and presence of Festuca ovina L. on the formation of Tuber melanosporum Vitt, mycorrhizae by Corylus avellana L.

A review of water infiltration literature and some infiltrometer trials in the early sixties led to the formulation of the Air-Earth-intercept (AEI) Concept for water infiltration into initially dry soils which states that the microroughness and macroporosity of the AEI regulate the exchange of surface water and displaced soil air across the AEI with the rough open interface having very high exchange rates and with the smooth closed interface having very low rates. This concept was supported and verified by a series of sprinkling infiltrometer studies, wherein manipulation of surface microroughness and macroporosity gave an order-of-magnitude control over water infiltration. A tenfold increase in infiltration is enough to prevent water runoff even from high intensity storms, thereby eliminating soil erosion. The infiltration role of displaced soil air was verified by using border-irrigation and closed-top infiltrometers to demonstrate that very small soil air pressures could greatly reduce infiltration by blocking downward water flow in macropores. The next step was to apply the AEI infiltration Concept to controlling erosion on degraded land areas through infiltration acceleration and revegetation. What was needed was a device or machine that would efficiently restore stable roughness and openness to the smooth sealed AEI of degraded land to, in turn, restore the high rates of rainwater infiltration required for erosion control and successful revegetation. This led to the invention and development of a series of land imprinting devices. By efficiently controlling infiltration and erosion, these devices have already restored perennial grasses to 20,000 hectares of degraded rangeland in southern Arizona alone. With the successful development of land imprinting, the AEI concept evolved into the AEI model for restoring degraded land through infiltration and erosion control. This diagrammatic and verbal model of four AEI processes helps guide revegetation projects to successful completion. Currently, imprinters are being developed for steep-slope revegetation. Imprinter attachments for seeding and inoculating with mycorrhizae have already been developed and successfully field tested.","Imprinting Fdn, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA","Dixon, RM (reprint author), Imprinting Fdn, 1231 E Big Rock Rd, Tucson, AZ 85718 USA.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,1,INT EROSION CONTROL ASSOC,STEAMBOAT SPRINGS,"PO BOX 4904, STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, CO 80477 USA",1092-2806,,,IECA P CONF,,,1997,28,,,,,,153,164,,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Geological; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK89G,WOS:000073814300015,,,,,10/31/19B,"Kang, LH; Li, SC",,"Turnbull, JW; Crompton, HR; Pinyopusarerk, K",,"Kang, LH; Li, SC",,,Responses in Acacia to inoculation with rhizobia,RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ACACIA PLANTING,ACIAR PROCEEDINGS SERIES,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Workshop on Recent Developments in Acacia Planting,"OCT 27-30, 1997","HANOI, VIETNAM","Forest Sci Inst Vietnam, CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Australian Ctr Int Agr Res",,,,"Temperate species of Acacia. A. melanoxylon, A. mearnsii, A. implexa and A. dealbata, inoculated with strains of the root-nodule bacteria Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp. ('rhizobia'), were grown in the nursery for 4-6 months in plastic containers of soil. Responses to inoculation (indices of nitrogen fixation) were measured as nodule dry matter (DM), seedling height, seedling DM, nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction activity - ARA), and the nitrogen content of inoculated and uninoculated plants. Estimates were made of the amount and rate of nitrogen fixation. All 29 strains formed nodules on Acacia host plants and most fixed at least some nitrogen. The best-performing strains increased nodule DM, seedling height, seedling DM and ARA by up to 2.1, 1.1, 2.8 and 7.3 times, respectively, and the differences between the best and poorest strains were statistically significant. Significant differences also occurred between six provenances of four Acacia species in their response to inoculation with selected strains. In A. melanoxylon, the rate of nitrogen fixation (the proportion of total plant nitrogen due to fixed nitrogen) for provenance 17263 was 72.4%, but was only 10.5% for provenance 16358. A. implexa had a rate of 53.4%, but A. mearnsii had a rate of only 10.4%. The shoots of Acacia seedlings contained 76% of the total nitrogen fixed by the plant. It is concluded that, in choosing effective strains for inoculants for lines of Acacia, careful consideration must be given to symbiotic compatibility at both the species and the provenance levels.","Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China","Kang, LH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,AUSTRALIAN CENTRE INT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,CANBERRA,"GPO BOX 1571, CANBERRA, 2601, AUSTRALIA",,,1-86320-217-X,ACIAR PROC,,,1997,,82,,,,,258,263,,,,,6,Agronomy; Forestry,Agriculture; Forestry,BN57M,WOS:000082288700034,,,,,10/31/19B,"Brockwell, J",,"Turnbull, JW; Crompton, HR; Pinyopusarerk, K",,"Brockwell, J",,,Matching rhizobia and temperate species of Acacia,RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ACACIA PLANTING,ACIAR PROCEEDINGS SERIES,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Workshop on Recent Developments in Acacia Planting,"OCT 27-30, 1997","HANOI, VIETNAM","Forest Sci Inst Vietnam, CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Australian Ctr Int Agr Res",,,BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; LEGUME N-2 FIXATION; LEUCAENA-LEUCOCEPHALA; ACETYLENE-REDUCTION; WOODY LEGUME; FIELD; N-15; INOCULANTS; NODULATION; SELECTION,"The literature and unpublished reports relating to the symbiosis between Acacia and its root-nodule bacteria (rhizobia) have been reviewed. The weight of evidence suggests that acacias fix useful quantities of nitrogen in the field. thereby conserving resources of soil nitrogen and perhaps acting as a source of nitrogen for other trees growing with them in mixed stands. Acacia species, and even provenances within species, are highly strain-specific in their requirement for effectively nitrogen-fixing rhizobial strains. Therefore, acacias introduced into new lands will require inoculation with effective rhizobia. Effective strains for acacias are probably most effectually selected on a species-by-species basis. inoculation of acacias will be done most efficiently by sowing seed into rhizobia-rich nursery soil so that seedlings are well nodulated and fixing nitrogen when the!, are outplanted into plantations. The implications of these matters for inoculant preparation are discussed.","CSIRO, Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Brockwell, J (reprint author), CSIRO, Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",,,,,,,71,0,0,0,0,AUSTRALIAN CENTRE INT AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,CANBERRA,"GPO BOX 1571, CANBERRA, 2601, AUSTRALIA",,,1-86320-217-X,ACIAR PROC,,,1997,,82,,,,,264,273,,,,,10,Agronomy; Forestry,Agriculture; Forestry,BN57M,WOS:000082288700035,,,,,10/31/19B,"Ragupathy, S; Ashwath, N; Mahadevan, A",,"Turnbull, JW; Crompton, HR; Pinyopusarerk, K",,"Ragupathy, S; Ashwath, N; Mahadevan, A",,,Acacias and mine rehabilitation: The need for inoculating acacias with mycorrhizal fungi,RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ACACIA PLANTING,ACIAR PROCEEDINGS SERIES,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Workshop on Recent Developments in Acacia Planting,"OCT 27-30, 1997","HANOI, VIETNAM","Forest Sci Inst Vietnam, CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Ctr Int Forestry Res, Australian Ctr Int Agr Res",,,VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; INFECTION; KAKADU; PLANTS; ROOTS,"A field trial was conducted to determine the need for inoculating acacias with mycorrhizal fungi, and a pot experiment aimed to quantify the benefits of endomycorrhizal fungi to acacias.

There was more variation accounted for by both clone-within-population and population in the growth chamber than in the field.

Their ability to adjust growth or to function as potential carbon sinks under conditions of rising atmospheric CO2 during global change may affect global carbon cycling, but as yet has not been investigated experimentally. Halophyte responses to CO2 doubling may be constrained by the need to use carbon conservatively under water-limited conditions, but data are lacking to issue general predictions. We describe the growth, architecture, biomass allocation, anatomy, and photosynthetic physiology of the predominant neotropical mangrove tree, Rhizophora mangle L., grown solitarily in ambient (350 mu ll(-1)) and double-ambient (700 mu ll(-1)) CO2 concentrations for over 1 year. Mangrove seedlings exhibited significantly increased biomass, total stem length, branching activity, and total leaf area in elevated CO2. Enhanced total plant biomass under high CO2 was associated with higher root:shoot ratios, relative growth rates, and net assimilation rates, but few allometric shifts were attributable to CO2 treatment independent of plant size. Maximal photosynthetic rates were enhanced among high-CO2 plants while stomatal conductances were lower, but the magnitude of the treatment difference declined over time, and high-CO2 seedlings showed a lower P-max at 700 mu ll(-1) CO2 than low-CO2 plants transferred to 700 mu ll(-1) CO2: possible evidence of downregulation. The relative thicknesses of leaf cell layers were not affected by treatment. Stomatal density decreased as epidermal cells enlarged in elevated CO2. Foliar chlorophyll, nitrogen, and sodium concentrations were lower in high CO2. Mangroves grown in high CO2 were reproductive after only 1 year of growth (fully 2 years before they typically reproduce in the field), produced aerial roots, and showed extensive lignification of the main stem; hence, elevated CO2 appeared to accelerate maturation as well as growth. Data from this long-term study suggest that certain mangrove growth characters will change flexibly as atmospheric CO2 increases, and accord with responses previously shown in Rhizophora apiculata. Such results must be integrated with data from sea-level rise studies to yield predictions of mangrove performance under changing climate.","MT HOLYOKE COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,S HADLEY,MA 01075; UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA,SCH BIOL SCI,GEORGE TOWN 11800,MALAYSIA","Farnsworth, EJ (reprint author), HARVARD UNIV,DEPT ORGANISM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,22 DIVIN AVE,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138, USA.",,,"Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",,,,74,61,63,5,71,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1996,108,4,,,,,599,609,,10.1007/BF00329032,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VX110,WOS:A1996VX11000003,28307791,,,,10/31/19J,"Bending, GD; Read, DJ",,,,"Bending, GD; Read, DJ",,,Nitrogen mobilization from protein-polyphenol complex by ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PHENOLIC SUBSTANCES; LITTER; TANNINS; SOILS,"The horizons of forest and heathland soils in which mycorrhizal roots proliferate typically contain large quantities of polyphenolic materials.

The effect of polyphenols upon availability of protein to ectomycorrhizal (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing saprophytic fungi was investigated using the soluble polyphenol tannic acid (TA), and protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). While the saprophytic fungi were able to mobilize the precipitate, only three of 18 ECM fungi tested were able to do so. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were capable of partial clearance of the precipitate. It was demonstrated that the ericoid mycorrhizal fungi had access to N contained in protein complexed by TA, while ECM fungi did not. The extracellular proteases of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi remained active in the presence of TA, while those of the ECM fungi were inhibited.

The intensity of root colonization by VAM fungi and the distribution of VAM fungal structures varied with host species over a period of time. The occurrence of vesicles with varied morphology in the mycorrhizal roots indicates infection by different VAM fungal species. This was further confirmed from the presence of spores belonging to different VAM fungal species in the rhizosphere soils. Root colonization and spore number ranged from 56%-72% and 5-14 g(-1) soil in A. farnesiana and from 60%-73% and 5-15 g(-1) soil in A. planifrons. Per cent root colonization and VAM spore number in the rhizosphere soil were inversely related to each other in both the Acacia species. However, patterns of the occurrence of VAM fungal structures were erratic. Spores of Acaulospora foveata, Gigaspora albida, Glomus fasciculatum, G. geosporum and Sclerocystis sinuosa were isolated from the rhizosphere of A. farnesiana whereas A. scrobiculata, G. pustulatum, G. fasciculatum, G. geosporum and G. microcarpum were isolated from that of A. planifrons. The response of VAM status to fluctuating edaphic factors varied with host species. In A. farnesiana though soil nitrogen (N) was positively correlated with root colonization, soil moisture, potassium and air temperature were negatively correlated to both root colonization and spore number. Per cent root colonization and spore number in A. planifrons were negatively related to each other.

Coarse root biomass (over 10 mm diameter) was assessed by complete excavation and fine root biomass (10 mm or less in diameter) by coring. Tree biomass (above and below ground) was linearly related to (DH)-H-2 and to cross-sectional area of the stem, Above ground biomass estimates predicted by the equations developed in this study were smaller than those predicted by published multi-species equations, However, adjusting the estimates to take account of differences in timber density, brought the predictions closer to those from existing equations. Root biomass found in this study was larger than in previous work. The root:shoot ratio was significantly (P < 0.05, r(2) = 60%) and positively correlated with tree size ((DH)-H-2).

The mean root/shoot ratio based on this study and recalculation of other published studies from moist tropical forests was about 0.25, Fine root amounts increased as forests aged from less than 1 year to 30 years, but there were no significant differences in fine root biomass between forests aged 30 (about 9 t ha(-1)) and mature forest.

The objectives were to: (1) assess natural nodulation of the legumes and characterize their indigenous rhizobia, (2) determine their need for rhizobia inoculation and (3) estimate the amount of N-2 fixed by each of these legumes. At 4 weeks after planting (WAP), Crotolaria verucosa was not nodulated at any of the sites while Centrosema pascuorum had the highest number of nodules in all sites. At 8 WAP, all legumes were nodulated, with Mucuna pruriens having the least number of nodules and Stylosanthes hamata the highest. The number of nodules, however, was inversely correlated to the mass of nodules. Significant differences in nodulation of the legume species grown in the field also occurred between and within sites. Mucuna pruriens and Lablab purpureus produced more shoot and nodule biomass than the other legumes in all sites. Growth of most of these legumes responded to fertilizer application, except for C. verrucosa and Aeschynomene histrix. Except for C. verrucosa, average proportion of N-2 fixed was about 80% and this was reduced by about 20% with N fertilizer application. The majority of rhizobia isolates (60%) were slow growing, belonging to the Bradyrhizobia spp. group. Selected rhizobia isolates evaluated on Cajanus cajan, C. pascuorum, M. pruriens and Psophocarpus palustris varied from ineffective to highly effective in Leonard jar conditions. However, only growth of M. pruriens responded to inoculation in potted soils, whereas it was lower than that obtained with N fertilizer application. This indicated the need to screen more rhizobia in order to improve N-2 fixation and growth of legume species such as M. pruriens when it is introduced in soils deficient in N.","INT INST TROP AGR,IBADAN,NIGERIA; UNIV IBADAN,FAC AGR & FORESTRY,DEPT AGRON,IBADAN,NIGERIA","Sanginga, N (reprint author), LAMBOURN & CO,26 DINGWALL RD,CROYDON CR9 3EEE,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,17,20,24,1,13,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

A method for estimating belowground biomass pools and their dynamics was developed for application in the carbon budget model of the Canadian forest sector (CBM-CFS2). Root biomass data for temperate and boreal softwood and hardwood species were compiled from the literature. Total root biomass for softwood and hardwood species was estimated using regression models that incorporate total aboveground biomass as the independent variable. Fine root biomass was estimated as a proportion of total root biomass using a single regression model for softwood and hardwood species combined. A regression model to estimate annual fine root production was derived for softwood and hardwood species. In the CBM-CFS2, net increments of total biomass were estimated using empirical growth functions to predict aboveground biomass. The regression models developed in this study were then used to predict the corresponding root biomass. Total root production was calculated as the sum of net increments, i.e., the change in root biomass per hectare plus annual turnover. The application of this approach to estimate root biomass pools and their dynamics in the CBM-CFS2 is demonstrated. As with all regression models that are developed from regional databases, this approach should not be used to predict root biomass and dynamics of an individual forest ecosystem, because the influence of species, site, and stand characteristics may lead to significant deviations from the regional averages.","CANADIAN FORESTRY SERV,EDMONTON,AB T6H 3S5,CANADA; ESSA TECHNOL LTD,VANCOUVER,BC V6J 5C6,CANADA",,,,"Kurz, Werner/0000-0003-4576-7849",,,,48,132,141,0,33,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Air pollutants are often blamed for this kind of damage. The influence of air pollutant deposition, soil chemical changes and the increasing nitrogen availability may cause a shallowing of the root system and decreasing fine root biomass. We hypothesize chat the changes in the root system cause decreasing drought susceptability of the trees and needle or leaf losses. Using computer models for the watercycle in a mature Norway spruce stand over a period of 18 years we quantified the influence of different rooting patterns on the transpiration and the risk of drought stress. Here me compared the dry year 1976 with the wet year 1981. Ln 1976 the simulated xylem water potentials indicate severe drought stress under conditions of shallow rooting and low root. biomass. Under these rooting conditions the drought stress in 1976 would have been avoided, if the trees had lost about 30% of the needle mass. During the wet year 1981 rooting patterns also influenced xylem mater potentials, but severe drought stress did not occur.",,"Manderscheid, B (reprint author), UNIV BAYREUTH,INST BODENOKOL BITOK,DR HANS FRISCH STR 1-3,D-95448 BAYREUTH,GERMANY.",,,,,,,67,2,2,0,8,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0015-8003,,,FORSTWISS CENTRALBL,Forstwiss.

Sites, ranging from those with Nothofagus forest with high annual (770 mm) to Nothofagus scrub (520 mm), (290 mm) and Stipa (160 mm) grasslands and into desert vegetation (125 mm), were chosen to test whether rooting depth compensates for low rainfall. Along this gradient, both mean above- and belowground biomass and leaf area index decreased, but average carbon isotope ratios of sun leaves remained constant (at -27 parts per thousand), indicating no major differences in the ratio of assimilation to stomatal conductance at the time of leaf growth. The depth of the soil horizon that contained 90% of the root biomass was similar for forests and grasslands (about 0.80-0.50 m), but was shallower in the desert (0.30 m). In all habitats, roots reached water-saturated soils or ground water at 2-3 m depth. The depth profile of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of soil water corresponded inversely to volumetric soil water contents and showed distinct patterns throughout the soil profile due to evaporation, water uptake and rainfall events of the past year. The isotope ratios of soil water indicated that high soil moisture at 2-3 m soil depth had originated from rainy periods earlier in the season or even from past rainy seasons, Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of xylem water revealed that all plants used water from recent rain events in the topsoil and not from water-saturated soils at greater depth. However, this study cannot explain the vegetation zonation along the transect on the basis of water supply to the existing plant cover. Although water was accessible to roots in deeper soil layers in all habitats, as demonstrated by high soil moisture, earlier rain events were not fully utilized by the current plant cover during summer drought.

Between March and September 1993, branch internode and needle fascicle expansion in the upper and lower third of crowns were measured weekly on three south-facing branches of each of four trees, and new root initiation and elongation were measured at 10-day intervals in three vertical rhizotrons per plot. In one replication, soil water content was measured daily. Fertilization significantly increased the expansion of first flush internodes in the upper crown and first flush needle fascicles in the upper and lower crown. New root growth was stimulated by fertilization in the second half of the growing season. The timing of root growth responses to fertilization corresponded to branch phenologies in the upper and lower crown that were conducive to increased basipetal transport of photosynthate. We conclude, therefore, that new root growth was linked to source-sink activities in the crown. Root initiation was greater in the upper than in the lower part of the soil profile; however, as the growing season progressed and water deficit increased, this relationship was reversed. The effect of soil depth on seasonal root growth was closely associated with water availability, suggesting that root initiation deep in the soil profile is critical for the continued production of new roots in environments subjected to short-term, but relatively severe, water deficits.","USA,ENGINEER WATERWAYS EXPT STN,VICKSBURG,MS 39180; LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,WETLAND BIOGEOCHEM INST,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803; LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY WILDLIFE & FISHERIES,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803","Sword, MA (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,SO RES STN,PINEVILLE,LA 71360, USA.",,,,,,,27,25,27,0,9,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV-DEC,1996,16,12-Nov,,,,,899,904,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,VX155,WOS:A1996VX15500005,14871782,,,,10/31/19J,"Tingey, DT; Johnson, MG; Phillips, DL; Johnson, DW; Ball, JT",,,,"Tingey, DT; Johnson, MG; Phillips, DL; Johnson, DW; Ball, JT",,,Effects of elevated CO2 and nitrogen on the synchrony of shoot and root growth in ponderosa pine,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,leaf area index; minirhizotron; N fertilization; open-top chambers; Pinus ponderosa; root-shoot balance,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; SITKA SPRUCE PLANTATION; FINE ROOTS; QUERCUS-ALBA; SOIL N; SEEDLINGS; ENRICHMENT; RESPONSES; MYCORRHIZAL; ECOSYSTEMS,"We monitored effects of elevated CO2 and N fertilization on shoot and fine root growth of Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P.

All CO2 by N interactions were nonsignificant. Both the CO2 and N treatments increased plant height, stem diameter and leaf area index (LAI). Elevated CO2 increased fine root area density and the occurrence of mycorrhizae, whereas N fertilization increased coarse root area density but had no effect on fine root area density. Spring flushes of shoot height and diameter growth were initiated concurrently with the increase in new root area density but height and diameter growth reached their maxima before that of fine roots. The temporal patterns of root and shoot growth were not altered by providing additional CO2 or N. Greatest root loss occurred in the summer, immediately following the period of greatest new fine root growth. Elevated N initially reduced the fine root area density/LAI ratio independently of CO2 treatment, indicating that the relationship between fine roots and needles was not changed by CO2 exposure.","MANTECH ENVIRONM TECHNOL INC, CORVALLIS, OR 97333 USA; DESERT RES INST, RENO, NV 89506 USA","Tingey, DT (reprint author), US EPA, CORVALLIS, OR 97333 USA.",,"Phillips, Donald/D-5270-2011",,,,,47,60,63,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV-DEC,1996,16,12-Nov,,,,,905,914,,,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,VX155,WOS:A1996VX15500006,14871783,,,,10/31/19J,"Lyon, J; Sharpe, WE",,,,"Lyon, J; Sharpe, WE",,,Hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx) Moore) interference with growth of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L) seedlings,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Dynamics of Physiological Processes in Woody Roots,"OCT 08-11, 1995","ITHACA, NY","Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, USEPA Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, W Ecol Div, Corvallis",,root competition; soil acidity; subsoil liming,BLACK-CHERRY; TREE SEEDLINGS; SUCCESSIONAL STATUS; FOREST SOIL; ROOT; REGENERATION; MECHANISMS; ALUMINUM; BIOMASS; LIGHT,"We assessed the impacts of hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula (Michx.)

Red oak seedlings and ferns were grown in reconstructed soil profiles of four common Pennsylvanian forest soils. When grown in the presence of hay-scented ferns, with or without subsoil liming, red oak seedlings had significantly reduced height growth, and foliar, stem and total root biomass. Fern foliar biomass was significantly reduced when ferns were grown with red oaks, but there was no significant difference in total belowground biomass of ferns. Belowground fern biomass was concentrated in the upper soil profile, whereas red oak roots showed a variety of distributions. In the presence of ferns, fine root branching in red oak was reduced in the organic horizons of three of the four soils tested. In both the presence and absence of ferns, root branching in red oak was also significantly and negatively correlated with the concentration of 0.01 M SrCl2-extractable aluminum in the mineral horizons (r(2) = 0.77). Subsoil liming generally improved root branching in red oaks. The presence of ferns significantly reduced ectomycorrhizal infection frequency in red oak.

Rhizotron cells were maintained at high soil water availability (approximately -0.1 MPa) or subjected to three dry-down cycles to low soil water availability (approximately -1.0 MPa), over two growing seasons. Localized increases in nitrogen availability were created by adding nitrogen in solution to root ingress cores placed in each rhizotron cell. Presence of competitors reduced loblolly pine root growth regardless of the nitrogen or soil water treatment. On average, both total root length density and root surface area were reduced 60% when loblolly pine seedlings were grown with crab grass and 31% when grown with sweetgum. Low water availability reduced loblolly pine root length density and root surface area by 25 and 28%, respectively, compared with well-watered seedlings. Sweetgum root surface area was reduced 18% by the low water availability treatment, whereas crab grass root surface area was unaffected by this treatment. At all soil depths, loblolly pine root surface area and root length density were increased in localized areas of increased nitrogen availability. Sweetgum and crab grass root surface areas were also greater in areas of increased nitrogen availability. In the high soil water availability treatment, loblolly pine root surface area increased 128% in localized areas of increased nitrogen in all competition treatments. In the low soil water availability treatment, loblolly pine roots responded to increased nitrogen only in the absence of competitors. In general, loblolly pine and sweetgum roots responded to increases in resource availability similarly, whereas crab grass roots were relatively less affected.","UNIV GEORGIA,DANIEL B WARNELL SCH FOREST RESOURCES,ATHENS,GA 30602","Ludovici, KH (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,3041 CORNWALLIS RD,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709, USA.",,,,,,,22,19,21,0,3,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV-DEC,1996,16,12-Nov,,,,,933,939,,,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,VX155,WOS:A1996VX15500009,14871786,,,,10/31/19J,"Grayston, SJ; Campbell, CD",,,,"Grayston, SJ; Campbell, CD",,,Functional biodiversity of microbial communities in the rhizospheres of hybrid larch (Larix eurolepis) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis),TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Dynamics of Physiological Processes in Woody Roots,"OCT 08-11, 1995","ITHACA, NY","Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, USEPA Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, W Ecol Div, Corvallis",,biology; carbon utilization profiles; metabolic fingerprints; root exudates,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL ORGANISMS; CARBON; BACTERIA; PINE; FLOW,"The diversity of microorganisms associated with trees and their different functional capabilities is thought to be a consequence of variation in carbon compounds in the rhizosphere.

Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids were the substrates responsible for this discrimination. Carbon profiles of the microbial communities from the rhizospheres of the two tree species also clustered when evaluated by CVA, as a result of differences in utilization of carboxylic acids and amino acids, suggesting that these tree species differ in the exudates they produce.

Vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizae increased relative growth rates (RGR) of the shade-tolerant tropical tree species Beilschmiedia pendula at both ambient and doubled CO2 concentrations. 2. RGR was correlated with the net assimilation rate (NAR) of plants. Within this general correlation, in plants with similar RGR, NAR was decreased in VA-mycorrhizal plants compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. As RGR is the product of NAR and the leaf area ratio (LAR, the ratio of leaf area to plant mass), increases in RGR in VA-mycorrhizal plants were the results of increased LAR. Thus, VA-mycorrhizae increased growth rates of B. pendula by altering the morphology of the seedlings. 3. Under elevated CO2 the amount of fungus within roots increased in VA-mycorrhizal plants compared with those grown under ambient CO2 and this was associated with a greater post-inoculation depression in leaf growth. Post-inoculation depressions in leaf growth and the lower NAR (in plants with similar RGR) of VA-mycorrhizal plants indicate there is increased carbon transfer to soils under elevated CO2.","UNIV MISSOURI,DEPT BIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63121","Lovelock, CE (reprint author), SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,POB 2072,BALBOA,PANAMA.",,"Lovelock, Catherine/G-7370-2012","Lovelock, Catherine/0000-0002-2219-6855",,,,28,32,33,1,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Infective rhizobia occurred in all soils studied regardless of soil depth, distance from a host plant or type of plant cover. Plant growth in N-free media and acetylene reduction activity suggested that all nodules were capable of N-2-fixation. 4. The extent of nodulation varied by species.

Gray was studied in three environmentally distinct regions of the Walker Creek marsh, California. This species was mycorrhizal at an upland site removed from tidal influences except when extreme tides coincided with winter precipitation, a tidal channel site, and a waterlogged marine site (pioneer zone). The percentage of root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (%AM) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the upland site (approximate to 7%), compared to either the channel (approximate to 28%) or marine sites (approximate to 17%). 2 The vertical distribution of AM in the 40-cm rooting profile of Jaumea was, in most cases, positively associated (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01) with gravimetric soil moisture. Surprisingly, redox potential did not have a negative effect on AM. AM colonization levels were often > 20% in regions of the soil profile where redox potentials were less than 100 mV and soil moisture levels exceeded 120%. 3 Cross-sections of host plant roots revealed the localization of arbuscules in the radial files of aerenchymatous tissue which may facilitate the survival of AM fungi in reduced soils. Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith was the dominant sporulating species from the marine site soils, while several undescribed species of Glomus dominated the channel and upland site soils. Species composition was similar in soil samples collected during dry (September) and wet (January) months. 4 In the upland site, %AM may be suppressed by the osmotic stresses associated with seasonal extremes of salinity. For the upland and channel sites, %AM and arbuscule frequencies were greatest during the winter months of December and early March, when plants were relatively dormant. In these sites, vesicles and hyphae were most abundant during the summer months. In the waterlogged and reduced soils of the marine site, AM levels did not change seasonally despite high levels of available phosphorus. 5 In the channel site, the tidal deposition of nitrogen-rich (and possibly spore-bearing) sediments, the presence of faunal activity in channel walls, and improved soil aeration associated with tidal inundation and retreat are among the proposed explanations for mycorrhizal abundance in this location of the Walker Creek marsh.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,PLANT BIOL SECT,DIV BIOL SCI,DAVIS,CA 95616; UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT LAND AIR & WATER RESOURCES,DAVIS,CA 95616",,,,,,,,56,61,68,0,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

A specific focus of this study was to test the hypothesis that the genus Elaphomyces is the closest sexual relative of C. geophilum. Thus nucleotide sequence data of five C. geophilum isolates, three Elaphomyces species, and 44 additional genera of ascomycetes were included in the phylogenetic analyses. The percentage of similarity among the 18S rDNA sequences of the C. geophilum isolates examined was 99.8 to 100%, indicating that C. geophilum is monophyletic. Percent similarity of nucleotide sequence among the three Elaphomyces species was also high and ranged from 99.4 to 99.5%. DNA parsimony and distance analysis of the sequence data separated these 2 genera on distant clades when sequence from 44 additional genera of ascomycetes was included. Parsimony and distance analyses positioned C. geophilum as a basal, intermediate lineage between the two Loculoascomycete orders, the Pleosporales and the Dothidiales, and strongly supported Elaphomyces to be of Plectomycete origin. Among the sexual Ascomycetes examined, which included representative taxa from four classes of filamentous Ascomycetes (Plectomycetes, Pyrenomycetes, Discomycetes, and Loculoascomycetes), no close sexual relative to C. geophilum was identified. At least four independent lineages of mycorrhizal fungi were identified among the ascomycetes examined.

After 5 weeks, only pentachlorophenol (PCP) at 200 mg kg(-1) soil decreased the rhizobial population compared to the water and methanol controls (i.e. by >98% from 240,000 and 120,000 cells g(-1) soil, respectively, to 2000 cells g(-1) soil). After 6 months no rhizobia could be detected in the PCP-treated soil, whereas both controls contained 120,000 cells g(-1) soil. In a separate dose-response experiment, PCP was added to soils at nine different concentrations and the rhizobial population enumerated after 6 months. The highest no observed adverse effect concentration (HNOAEC) for this species was 50 mg PCP kg(-1) soil and the lowest observed adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) was 75 mg PCP kg soil.

Previous work reported reductions in net photosynthesis, carboxylation efficiency and quantum yield of mature tree leaves, whereas seedling processes were unaffected by the same ozone exposure. To further characterize differences in ozone response between seedlings and mature trees, we examined carbon partitioning and allocation in 32-year-old trees and 4-year-old seedlings of northern red oak after exposure to subambient (seasonal SUM00 dose (sum of all hourly ozone exposures) = 31 ppm-h), ambient (SUM00 dose = 85 ppm-h) and twice ambient (SUM00 dose = 151 ppm-h) ozone concentrations for three growing seasons. For mature trees, ozone exposure decreased foliar starch partitioning, increased starch partitioning in branches and increased C-14 retention in leaves. In contrast, starch partitioning in leaves and branches, and foliar C-14 retention in seedlings were unaffected by ozone exposure, but soluble carbohydrate concentrations in coarse and fine roots of seedlings were reduced. Differences in carbohydrate demand between seedlings and mature trees may underlie the higher leaf ozone uptake rates and greater physiological response to ozone in mature northern red oak trees compared with seedlings.","IOWA STATE UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT FORESTRY,AMES,IA 50011","Samuelson, LJ (reprint author), AUBURN UNIV,SCH FORESTRY,M WHITE SMITH HALL,AUBURN,AL 36849, USA.",,,,,,,30,40,41,0,7,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,OCT,1996,16,10,,,,,853,858,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,VK975,WOS:A1996VK97500008,14871676,,,,10/31/19J,"Schrey, HP",,,,"Schrey, HP",,,Estimating the effective rooting depth of layered soils,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE,,,German,Article,,,,,,,,The values pf the effective rooting depth given by the Soil Mapping Instruction are valid only for homogenous soils.

There are currently more than a dozen validly named species, but the true number of species is probably orders of magnitude higher. The named species are listed and briefly discussed. Sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU or 16S rRNA) support the well-established subdivision of rhizobia into three genera: Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium. These all lie within the alpha subdivision of the Proteobacteria, but on quite distinct branches, each of which also includes many bacterial species that are not rhizobia. It has been clear for several years that Rhizobium, on this definition, is still too broad and is polyphyletic: there are many non-rhizobia within this radiation. Recently, therefore, it has been suggested that this genus should be split into four genera, namely Rhizobium (R. leguminosarum, R, tropici, R. etli), Sinorhizobium (S. fredii, S. meliloti, S. teranga, S. saheli), Mesorhizobium (M. loti, M. huakuii, M ciceri, M. tianshanense, M. mediterraneum), and a fourth, unnamed, genus for the current R. galegae.

Subnanomolar concentrations of CLOSs induced deformation of root hairs (Had) and increased the number of foci of cortical cell divisions (Ccd) in white clover, some of which developed into nodule meristems. In contrast, ANU843 CLOSs were unable to induce Had in alfalfa and required a 10(4)-fold higher threshold concentration to induce this response in vetch. Also, ANU843 CLOSs were not mitogenic on either of these non-host legumes. In addition, CLOS action also increased chitinase activity in white clover root exudate. Thus, the membrane CLOSs from wild type R. leguminosarum by. trifolii are fully capable of eliciting various symbiosis-related responses in white clover in the same concentration range as extracellular CLOSs of other rhizobia on their respective legume hosts. These results and our earlier studies indicate that membrane CLOSs represent one of many different classes of bioactive metabolites made by R. leguminosarum by, trifolii which elicit more intense symbiosis-related responses in white clover than in other legumes. Therefore, CLOSs evidently play an important role in symbiotic development, but they may not be the sole determinant of host-range in the Rhizobium-clover symbiosis.","UNIV SALAMANCA,FAC FARM,DEPT GENET & MICROBIOL,E-37007 SALAMANCA,SPAIN; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOCHEM,E LANSING,MI 48824; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT CHEM,E LANSING,MI 48824","Orgambide, GG (reprint author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL,E LANSING,MI 48824, USA.",,"Mateos, Pedro/L-6001-2014","Mateos, Pedro/0000-0003-1628-598X",,,,21,8,8,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,1996,186,1,,,,,93,98,,10.1007/BF00035061,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD380,WOS:A1996WD38000014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mpepereki, S; Wollum, AG; Makonese, F",,,,"Mpepereki, S; Wollum, AG; Makonese, F",,,Diversity in symbiotic specificity of cowpea rhizobia indigenous to Zimbabwean soils,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,15th North American Conference on Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation,"AUG 13-17, 1995","NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV, RALEIGH, NC",,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV,cowpea rhizobia; diversity; host range; symbiotic specificity,LEGUME,"Tropical cowpea rhizobia are often presumed to be generally promiscuous but poor N fixers.

An average of 22% and 19% of fast- and slow-growing cowpea isolates respectively were effective on each of 12 legume species tested.

The PFD incident on a phytoelement is computed from the average gap frequency of the canopy and the binary random probability of sunflecks on the phytoelement. Instantaneous CO2 assimilation rate of each phytoelement is computed from PFD and phytoelement age. Assimilation rates are integrated over space and time to estimate whole-canopy CO2 assimilation. The model was used to study carbon balance in five sources of the leguminous agroforestry tree Erythrina poeppigiana (Walpers) O.F. Cook during two 6-month pruning intervals. The canopy description appeared to be realistic. According to the simulations, cumulative assimilation did not provide enough carbon for tree growth until two months after pruning, indicating dependence of tree growth on reserve carbohydrates. The two most productive sources, which had the most open canopies, were the most dependent on reserve carbohydrates after pruning.","UNIV HELSINKI,FORESTRY FIELD STN,FIN-35500 KORKEAKOSKI,FINLAND; UNIV BUENOS AIRES,FAC AGRON,CATEDRA DASONOMIA,RA-1417 BUENOS AIRES,DF,ARGENTINA",,,,,,,,44,17,17,0,6,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,1996,16,9,,,,,733,745,,,,,13,Forestry,Forestry,VF225,WOS:A1996VF22500001,14871680,,,,10/31/19J,"Menyah, MK; Sato, K",,,,"Menyah, MK; Sato, K",,,A proposal for re-evaluating the most probable number procedure for estimating numbers of Bradyrhizobium spp.,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,most probable number (MPN); plate count; Bradyrhizobium japonicum; nodulating scoring; soybean; glycine max,PLANT INFECTION TECHNIQUE; RHIZOBIA; NODULATION; COUNTS,The reliability of the most probable number (MPN) method for estimating bradyrhizobial numbers was evaluated by comparison with the plate count procedure.

Elevated CO2 increased photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance and partially offset growth reductions due to 2 x O-3. Elevated temperature, however, increased both photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and was less effective at mitigating growth reductions due to 2x O-3. Growth at 2x O-3 in elevated CO2 and temperature conditions had little effect on total-tree growth, but decreased fine-root growth by 61%.

In the case of fossorial herbivores, these responses can lead to significant changes in soil properties, vegetation, and even topography. These animals search for food plants by digging tunnels through soil at plant rooting depth. I developed a spatially-explicit, stochastic movement model (SEARCH3, written in FORTRAN) to simulate the search path and associated tunnel construction undertaken by a pocket gopher (Rodentia: Geomyidae) searching for food plants. SEARCH3 assumes a landscape uniform except for number and location of plants. Input parameters include soil properties, animal size, and plant locations. Model output includes tunnel segment coordinates, positions of plants disturbed, and volume and mass of soil disturbed. Coordinates can be input into graphics software or a GIS to create line maps. The present model incorporates the three methods of segment construction presented in Andersen (1988, J. Mammal., 69: 565-582), construction parameters (e.g., tunnel size, segment length, and directionality angles) empirically described for the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), and both random and area-restricted search. SEARCH3 invokes the latter for a set period after a palatable plant is detected. The geometric attributes of paths generated by SEARCH3 conform to those of real tunnel systems at coarse scales, with the exception that looping paths from simulations featuring high plant density are uncommon among most geomyid species' systems. Results of simulations in which sensory ability and plant dispersion patterns were systematically changed support the hypothesis that area-restricted search is adaptive in this taxon. The simulation effort also suggests that research on sensory abilities and excavation mechanics would contribute greatly to understanding how these organisms both affect, and are affected by, the ecosystems in which they reside.",,"Andersen, DC (reprint author), NATL BIOTECHNOL SERV,MIDCONTINENT ECOL SCI CTR,DENVER OFF,MAILCODE D-8220,POB 25007,DENVER,CO 80225, USA.",,"Andersen, Douglas/A-4563-2013","Andersen, Douglas C/0000-0001-9040-0654",,,,16,7,7,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The trees of the primary stands were spontaneously seeded in a drifting sand area. Only thin litter and humus layers were present. The trees of the 16-yr old secondary stand were planted on podzolic sandy soil and those of the 27-yr old stand on non-podzolic sandy soil. In both secondary stands thick litter and humus layers had developed. The litter and humus partly originated from former stands at the same sites and partly from the present stands. In the secondary stands the thick litter and humus layers and herb vegetation were removed ('sod-cutting') in order to simulate the thin litter and humus layers in the primary stands. Control treatments were present. Surveys in 1991, 1992 and 1993 showed that sod-cutting enhanced both abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, species richness and diversity were higher in the primary stands than in the secondary ones, also even in the sod-cut plots. High species richness and diversity were associated with low concentrations of nitrogen and relatively high pH in the litter and humus layers, and in the mineral soil.","AGR UNIV WAGENINGEN,BIOL STN,NL-9418 PD WIJSTER,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,44,21,22,0,14,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,KNIVSTA,"APELSINVAGEN 47, S 741 00 KNIVSTA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

In each stand, we fertilized three 50 x 50 m plots with 30 kg NO3--N ha(-1) year(-1) and an additional three plots received no N and served as controls. We predicted that root respiration rates would increase with increasing soil temperature and N availability. We reasoned that respiration would be greater for trees using NO3- as an N source than for trees using NH4+ as an N source because of the greater carbon (C) costs associated with NO3- versus NH4+ uptake and assimilation. Within stands, seasonal patterns of fine-root respiration rates followed temporal changes in soil temperature, ranging from a low of 2.1 mu mol O-2 kg(-1) s(-1) at 6 degrees C to a high of 7.0 mu mol O-2 kg(-1) s(-1) at 18 degrees C. Differences in respiration rates among stands at a given soil temperature were related to variability in total net N mineralized (48-90 mu g N g(-1)) throughout the growing season and associated changes in mean root tissue N concentration (1.18-1.36 mol N kg(-1)). The hypothesized increases in respiration in response to NO3- fertilization were not observed. The best-fit model describing patterns within and among stands had root respiration rates increasing exponentially with soil temperature and increasing linearly with increasing tissue N concentration: R = 1.347N e(0.072T) (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.01), where R is root respiration rate (mu mol O-2 kg(-1) s(-1)), N is root tissue N concentration (mel N kg(-1)), and Tis soil temperature (degrees C). We conclude that, in northern hardwood forests dominated by sugar maple, root respiration is responsive to changes in both soil temperature and N availability, and that both factors should be considered in models of forest C dynamics.","MICHIGAN TECHNOL UNIV, SCH FORESTRY & WOOD PROD, HOUGHTON, MI 49931 USA","Zogg, GP (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,35,115,148,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,1996,16,8,,,,,719,725,,10.1093/treephys/16.8.719,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,UZ894,WOS:A1996UZ89400008,14871695,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Regvar, M; Gogala, N",,,,"Regvar, M; Gogala, N",,,Changes in root growth patterns of (Picea abies) spruce roots by inoculation with an ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius and jasmonic acid treatment,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhiza; jasmonic acid; Picea abies; Pisolithus tinctorius; spruce,PINE; SUBSTANCES; SEEDLINGS,"Symbiosis between fungi and plant roots forming a mycorrhiza involves extensive interactions at the molecular level between both partners.

After 12 and 22 weeks of seedling growth, soil-CO2 efflux was measured with (1) growing seedlings, and after 22 weeks, with (2) roots only, shoots excised, and (3) with roots removed and soils amended with different rates of glucose. Indices of C-flux and of soil available-C were derived and compared to plant-N uptake, extractable soil mineral-N, anaerobically mineralized soil-N, N bioavailability to Agrostis grass following harvest of seedlings, and to seedling fine root C-chemistry. Significant soil x species interactions were found for total soil-CO2 efflux, root-dependent CO2, soil available-e and microbial biomass. In all cases, roots were important contributors to C-cycling in the mull soil but not in the mor soil. C was more limiting in the mor than in the mull microbial community. Plant-N uptake and the mineral-N pool was greater in the mor soil, reflecting that soil's higher specific N-supplying capacity (N-mineralized:CO2). Seedlings decreased the mineral-N pool in both soils, but the presence of roots increased N-mineralization in the mull soil and decreased N-mineralization in the mor soil. Significant positive relationships were observed in the mull soil only between soil respiration and plant N uptake at mid-season, and between soil respiration and N-mineralization at late-season. Birch root activity in the mull soil was greater than that of all other seedlings and this observation is discussed with respect to the autecology of birch. Soil respiration correlated with the non-polar extract content but not the lignin:N ratio of fine roots. Results suggest that root-released C in mull SOM is sufficient to relieve energy limitation to soil microbes and allow them to access appreciable amounts of soil-N, whereas ligninolytic activity, which may ultimately control soil-N turnover in mor SOM, is not increased by rhizodeposition.",,"Bradley, RL (reprint author), MCGILL UNIV,DEPT NAT RESOURCE SCI,MACDONALD CAMPUS,ST ANNE BELLEVUE,PQ H9X 3V9,CANADA.",,,,,,,46,23,23,3,11,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The soil was a neutral calcic Luvisol with a large pH buffer capacity. Various concentrations of strong acid (0-20 mmol kg(-1)) and anion (0-2 mmol kg(-1)) were applied to soil in suspension (0.5 g soil cm(-3)). The effect of 2 mmol kg(-1) oxalate on the adsorption isotherm of phosphate was also studied. The rate of isotopic exchange was largely unchanged by any of the treatments. Neither pH nor acetate had an effect on phosphate solubility. The addition of di- and trivalent anions increased phosphate solubility somewhat. The effect increased with increasing concentration of anion, and was generally independent of pH and the proportion of anion adsorbed. Oxalate was more efficient in limiting the adsorption of freshly added phosphate than in desorbing native phosphate. The results illustrate that rhizosphere acidification does not necessarily increase phosphate solubility.

Increased tiller and leaf numbers per plant for H. lanatus, but not for D. glomerata, suggested that enhanced biomass was a result of greater tiller and leaf production in Holcus, but to increased tiller weight in Dactylis. Increased competition reduced shoot biomass, tiller number and leaf number in both species. 3 Although the response was variable, mycorrhizal infection generally enhanced shoot biomass of both species in mixed cultures. Tiller production in D. glomerata was generally unaffected by infection but reductions in leaf number were observed in mycorrhizal stands. In contrast to its effects on monocultures, infection had no effect on tiller production when H. lanatus was in mixture. 4 Relative yield totals (RYT) calculated for grasses grown in mixture suggest that, overall, mycorrhizal infection resulted in a reduction of resource complementarity, i.e. it increased the level of competition for the same resources. This was reflected in the relative yields which showed that the shoot biomass for each species in mixture was lower than that expected from growth in monoculture. 5 Aggressivity indices suggested that H. lanatus was more aggressive than D. glomerata when present in equal or greater numbers. Mycorrhizal infection altered the degree of aggressivity in favour of the already more aggressive plant within the combination, although, at very low densities, D. glomerata was more aggressive than H. lanatus when mycorrhizal.","UNIV LANCASTER,INST ENVIRONM & BIOL SCI,DIV BIOL SCI,LANCASTER LA1 4YQ,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,30,57,65,0,30,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

The adsorption proceeded with an essentially quantitative yield, and the immobilized enzyme showed no decrease of specific activity with respect to the free enzyme. The dependence of urease adsorption on NaCl concentration suggested that the enzyme is bound to the carrier gel through electrostatic interactions. The immobilized enzyme showed increased stability, with respect to the free enzyme, with increasing time or temperature, and in the presence of proteolytic enzymes. The pH activity profile revealed that the adsorbed enzyme showed no change in the optimum pH (8.0), but it was more active than the free form in the pH range 5-8. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters V-max and K-m were measured for the free (V-max = 1960 +/- 250 units ml(-1); K-m = 235 +/- 20 mM) and immobilized (V-max = 1740 +/- 185 units ml(-1); K-m = 315 +/- 25 mM) urease. The substantial similarity of V-max in the two cases suggests that there were no conformational changes involving the active site upon enzyme immobilization, while substrate partitioning effects between the bulk solution and the micro-environment surrounding the immobilized enzyme must be operating so as to partly increase its K-m. These results suggest that bacterial urease present in plant root mucigel plays a large role in the mobilization of urea N. Its activity is in fact significantly mantained and protected by immobilization on hydrophilic gels such as those produced by root exudates.

The mutant was indistinguishable from the motile wild-type strain in terms of growth in laboratory media. When separately inoculated to spinach rhizosphere, no significant difference in the root colonization activity was observed between the mutant and the wild type. However, when a 1 : 1 cell mixture of the mutant and the wild-type strain was inoculated to the spinach rhizosphere, the rhizoplane population of the non-motile mutant was as low as one-sixtieth of that of the motile strain. This finding suggests that chemotactic movement is an essential trait for competitive colonization of the roots. In addition, chemotactic migration of the isolates from the root in a soil with low-salinity level (LR-isolates) was inhibited when the isolates were released to a soil with high-salinity level (H-soil). To reveal the factors inhibiting the chemotactic migration of the LR-isolates in the H-soil, effects of inorganic salts on chemotactic activities of the LR-isolates and HR-isolates (isolates from the root in the H-soil) were compared. The results showed that divalent cations were more inhibitory to the LR-isolates than monovalent cations, with the strongest inhibition stemming from Ca2+, and the chemotactic activities were completely inhibited in the presence of 50 mM CaCl2, though the HR-isolates were not inhibited. These results indicated that the high level of Ca2+ in the H-soil may account for the inhibition of the migration of the LR-isolates toward the root exudates.",,"Sakai, M (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC AGR,DEPT AGR CHEM,LAB SOIL MICROBIOL & BIOCHEM,FUKUOKA 81281,JAPAN.",,,,,,,23,9,9,0,5,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

We conducted this greenhouse study to determine if VAM fungi modify the effects of the herbicide bentazon (3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothidiazin-(4)3H-one 2,2-dioxide) on soybean (Glycine mar (L.) Merr.) and common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.). The experiment was designed as an eight-treatment, 2 x 2 x 2 factorial, Individual potted soybean or cocklebur plants were grown in a high (28 mg kg(-1)) P-content soil. The plants were colonized by VAM fungi (a mixture of Glomus etunicatum Becker and Gerdemann, Glomus leptotichum Schenck and Smith, and Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe) and sprayed with bentazon. Alternatively, they were exposed only to VAM fungi or to the herbicide, or to neither of these factors. The effects of VAM fungi on plant dry mass were small, but larger in cocklebur than in soybean, especially for the herbicide-treated plants. Root/shoot ratios in cocklebur were larger and shoot dry matter content smaller than those in soybean. The VAM effect in the herbicide-treated plants was greater than in the nontreated ones for both parameters. Colonized root length in cocklebur was drastically reduced by the herbicide (43%), as were leaf dry weight and N, P, and K concentrations. Changes were small, and generally not significant in soybean. Gradual necrosis of treated cocklebur shoots was related to an accelerated loss of shoot dry matter, especially in VAM plants. The data suggest that changes in source-sink relations following herbicide treatment favor enhanced export of shoot dry matter to the roots in susceptible relative to tolerant plants. This biomass may be preferentially available for export from susceptible-plant roots to the soil system through the VAM mycelium.",,"Bethlenfalvay, GJ (reprint author), USDA ARS, HCRL, 3420 NW ORCHARD AVE, CORVALLIS, OR 97330 USA.",,,,,,,33,11,11,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Five soil samples were collected from Te Puke (Paengaroa Shallow Sand, a Typic Hapludand) and five from Hamilton (Bruntwood silt loam, an Aquic Hapludand), New Zealand. Subsamples of each soil were either amended with chitin or unamended and planted with white clover and ryegrass. The ryegrass shoot weight in amended soil was greater (P<0.01), most probably due to N mineralised from chitin. A significantly lower (P<0.01) root: shoot ratio of ryegrass in the amended soil also suggested improved N availability, and therefore less root mass was needed to support a given shoot mass. A reduction in nodulation was observed in 12-day-old white clover seedlings (P<0.05) and also in 6-week-old seedlings (P<0.01). The shoot weight of white clover was significantly lower (P<0.05) in amended soil, possibly due to phytotoxic effects of chitin. Chitin increased (P<0.01) the populations of bacteria and fungi by 13-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. The cyst nematode of white clover, Heterodera trifolii, was significantly reduced in chitin-amended soil, possibly due to increased levels of chitinase produced by rhizosphere microorganisms.

Plants were established by transplanting in 1988 and 1989 and evaluated for growth (height, crown diameter biomass) parameters and for stand establishment, growth habit, uniformity of growth, vigor, cover, seed production, survival, and recruitment from 1990 to 1992. Soil characteristics (pH, SAR, salinity, sand, clay, silt organic matter NO3--N, Ca, Na, Mg, P, K, CaCO3, and effective rooting depth) were measured at each study site. Two hypotheses were addressed. First, it was confirmed that forage kochia accessions in general perform better in lighter textured soils and at higher precipitation levels (>250 mm annual precipitation) than in heavier textured soils containing higher levels of soluble salts receiving less precipitation.

The bacteria specific PLFAs cy17:0 and cy19:0 increased in both experiments in the root compartments. The PLFAs 15:0 and 17:0, which are usually considered to be bacteria specific, also increased due to the presence of roots, but it was shown that these fatty acids were present in aseptically grown cucumber roots, and thus not bacteria specific.

Experiments using two mesh sizes to either prevent (0.45 mu m) or allow (20 mu m) mycorrhizal connections between Plantago lanceolata (C-3) and Cynodon dactylon (C-4) plants were run. Root and shoot samples were taken for delta(13)C determinations. It could not be assumed that all the pairs of plants were linked; therefore non-parametric statistical tests were used. In order to measure transfer between pairs of plants the shoot delta(13)C value was used as a reference and the deviation of the root delta(13)C value from this as a measure of carbon transfer. As the C. dactylon root delta(13)C value became more negative with the 20 mu m mesh present, the root-shoot difference increased. In P. lanceolata both the root and shoot delta(13)C values became less negative but the root-shoot difference did increase gradually. When the root-shoot difference in C. dactylon was plotted against root delta(13)C value the relationship was unity, suggesting that transferred carbon remained in the roots and fungal material did not move into the shoots. In P. lanceolata the results showed that the slope of the relationship between root-shoot difference and root delta(13)C value was approximate to 0.5. This suggests any transferred carbon moved into both the root and shoot material. The root-shoot difference can be used to estimate % carbon transfer. For individual C. dactylon plants the results varied from 0 to 41% with most values falling at 10% or below. It was not possible to calculate % transfer amounts for P. lanceolata. This range of variation could have important implications for plant interactions in communities.

Alfalfa showed an increase of biomass with mycorrhizal infection only to a small extent. In oat AMF inoculation increased the growth of both root and shoot by up to 70% and 55% respectively. Mycorrhization raised the P-content and -uptake in alfalfa, but not in oat, in both roots and shoots. Mycorrhizal alfalfa showed lower Zn-Cd- and Ni-contents and uptake in roots and shoots. The root length was significantly decreased in mycorrhizal alfalfa plants (up to 38%). The translocation of heavy metals into the shoot of mycorrhizal alfalfa was slightly increased. Mycorrhizal infection of oat led to higher concentrations of Zn, Cd and Ni in the root but to less Zn in the shoot. The translocation of heavy metals to the oat shoot was clearly decreased by mycorrhizal colonisation. This may be based on the ability of fungal tissues to complex heavy metals at the cell walls, thus excluding metals from the shoot. The conclusion is supported by the enhanced root length (up to 78%) of mycorrhizal oat plants in this experiment. The mycorrhizal infection seemed to protect plants against heavy metal pollution in soils.

Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii strain W14-2 contains four plasmids (a, b, c, d). The role of plasmids in saprophytic characteristics and sodium chloride tolerance of W14-2 in vitro was investigated using a library of plasmid-cured W14-2 derivatives that includes derivatives containing only one plasmid and no plasmid, as well as complemented derivatives. Plasmid involvement in certain phenotypes such as swarming (plasmid a), utilization of glycerol (plasmid a), adonitol (plasmid b), rhamnose and sorbitol (plasmid c) was tracked to single plasmids and was not influenced significantly by the other plasmids present in the cell. Presence of plasmid b or c was necessary for the utilization of arabinose and raffinose, whereas presence of both plasmids b and d was required for tolerance to high levels of sodium chloride. The latter phenotype may correspond to tolerance to chloride toxicity or to osmotolerance. Plasmids influenced growth of the strain in liquid HP (peptone-yeast extract-tryptone), a complex medium that was investigated as it contains a wide range of carbon substrates. Positive contributions of plasmids a (shorter duration of the lag phase and increased maximum density of cells), b and c (shorter log-phase generation time) were shown. Plasmid d was detrimental to the strain in HP when it was the only plasmid present in the cell, especially regarding log-phase generation time. Similarly, the derivative with only plasmid d was more sensitive to sodium toxicity than any other derivative, including the plasmidless derivative. Interactions between plasmids influenced growth in HP broth and salt tolerance, and detrimental effects of plasmid d were little expressed if any when the cell contained one plasmid or more besides plasmid d. No plasmid-cured derivative grew better than the wild-type overall, suggesting that the extrachromosomal genome contributes to the saprophytic competence of W14-2 in soil.","TEXAS A&M UNIV,DEPT SOIL & CROP SCI,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843",,,,,,,,64,7,7,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0929-1393,,,APPL SOIL ECOL,Appl.

Only the slow-growing isolate Ls4 and the fast-growers Ls5 and Ls552 lacked cross-reactivity with any of the sera tested. Electrophoretic mobilities of whole cell protein from seven out of the eight isolates included in the serogroup represented by strain Ls31 were identical. Similarly, isolates Ls1B3 and Ls 1B4, both in serogroup Ls 1B3, had the same pattern of cell proteins. In contrast, isolates Ls3 and Ls7, belonging to serogroup Ls7, differed in protein profile. Plant growth experiments carried out under bacteriologically controlled conditions revealed that all of the isolates effectively nodulated L. subbiflorus and L. pedunculatus, but were unable to form effective nodules on L. tenuis and L. corniculatus. All isolates showed similar effectiveness in symbiosis with L. subbiflorus, except isolate Ls7, which gave significantly higher plant dry weight.","CSIC, DEPT MICROBIOL SUELO & SISTEMAS SIMBIOT, ESTAC EXPT ZADIN, GRANADA 18080, SPAIN","Irisarri, P (reprint author), FAC AGRON, DEPT BIOQUIM, GARZON 780, MONTEVIDEO 12900, URUGUAY.",,,"Irisarri, Pilar/0000-0003-2824-5977",,,,38,29,29,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,1996,180,1,,,,,39,47,,10.1007/BF00015409,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,VD848,WOS:A1996VD84800005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Aggangan, NS; Dell, B; Malajczuk, N; delaCruz, RE",,,,"Aggangan, NS; Dell, B; Malajczuk, N; delaCruz, RE",,,Soil fumigation and phosphorus supply affect the formation of Pisolithus Eucalyptus urophylla ectomycorrhizas in two acid Philippine soils,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Eucalyptus urophylla; mycorrhizal formation; phosphorus supply; Pisolithus tinctorius; soil microorganisms; soil fumigation,PINUS-RADIATA; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TINCTORIUS; GROWTH; STIMULATION; INFECTION; ROOTS,"To examine the effects of microbial populations and external phosphorus supply of two Philippine soils on mycorrhizal formation, Eucalyptus urophylla seedlings were inoculated with two Pisolithus isolates and grown in fumigated, reinfested and unfumigated soil fertilized with four rates of phosphorus. The Pisolithus isolates used were collected from under eucalypts in Australia and in the Philippines, Soils were infertile acid silty loams collected from field sites in Pangasinan, Luzon and Surigao, Mindanao. Significant interaction was observed between inoculation, soil fumigation and phosphorus supply on mycorrhizal formation by the Australian isolate in Surigao soil but not in Pangasinan soil. Soil fumigation enhanced mycorrhizal formation by the Australian isolate but did not affect root colonization by the Philippine isolate. Root colonization by the Australian isolate was highest in the reinfested soil while for the Philippine isolate it was highest in the unfumigated soil. The Australian isolate was more effective than the Philippine isolate in promoting growth and P uptake of E. urophylla seedlings in both soils. Total dry weight and P uptake of E. urophylla seedlings inoculated with the Australian isolate were maximum in fumigated and in the reinfested Pangasinan and Surigao soils supplied with 8 mg P kg(-1) soil. In the unfumigated soil, growth of seedlings inoculated with the Australian isolate was significantly reduced. Seedlings inoculated with the Philippine isolate had the largest dry weights and P contents in unfumigated Pangasinan and Surigao soils supplied with 8 mg P kg(-1) soil. These results indicate that the performance of the Australian Pisolithus isolate was markedly affected by biological factors in unfumigated soil. Thus, its potential use in the Philippines needs to be thoroughly tested in a variety of unfumigated soils before its widespread use in any inoculation programme.","CSIRO,DIV FORESTRY,WEMBLY,WA 6014,AUSTRALIA; UNIV PHILIPPINES COLL,NATL INST MOL BIOL & BIOTECHNOL,LAGUNA 4031,PHILIPPINES","Aggangan, NS (reprint author), MURDOCH UNIV,SCH BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI,PERTH,WA 6150,AUSTRALIA.",,,"Dell, Bernard/0000-0001-8623-6425",,,,33,9,10,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,1996,180,2,,,,,259,266,,10.1007/BF00015309,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,VE969,WOS:A1996VE96900011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hunt, HW; Elliott, ET; Detling, JK; Morgan, JA; Chen, DX",,,,"Hunt, HW; Elliott, ET; Detling, JK; Morgan, JA; Chen, DX",,,Responses of a C-3 and a C-4 perennial grass to elevated CO2 and temperature under different water regimes,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,acclimation; Bouteloua gracilis; carbon allocation; climate change; elevated CO2; nitrogen limitation; Pascopyrum smithii; shortgrass steppe,ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; NITROGEN CONCENTRATION; SHORTGRASS PRAIRIE; GROWTH-RESPONSE; TUSSOCK TUNDRA; RISING CO2; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ECOSYSTEMS; ROOT,"An experiment was carried out to determine the effects of elevated CO2, elevated temperatures, and altered water regimes in native shortgrass steppe.

The normal regime mimicked field patterns of diurnal and seasonal temperatures, and the high-temperature regime was 4 degrees C warmer. Water was supplied at three different levels in a seasonal pattern similar to that observed in the field. Total biomass after two growing seasons was 19% greater under elevated CO2, with no significant difference between the C-3 and C-4 grass. The effect of elevated CO2 on biomass was greatest at the intermediate water level. The positive effect of elevated CO2 on shoot biomass was greater at normal temperatures in B. gracilis, and greater at elevated temperatures in P. smithii. Neither root-to-shoot ratio nor production of seed heads was affected by elevated CO2. Plant tissue N and soil inorganic N concentrations were lower under elevated CO2, but no more so in the C-3 than the C-4 plant. Elevated CO2 appeared to increase plant N limitation, but there was no strong evidence for an increase in N limitation or a decrease in the size of the CO2 effect from the first to the second growing season. Autumn samples of large roots plus crowns, the perennial organs, had 11% greater total N under elevated CO2, in spite of greater N limitation.","COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT RANGELAND ECOSYST SCI,FT COLLINS,CO 80523; COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523; ARS,CROPS RES LAB,USDA,FT COLLINS,CO 80523","Hunt, HW (reprint author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,NAT RESOURCE ECOL LAB,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,"Detling, James K/I-1691-2013",,,,,68,67,71,2,35,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Both AM fungi and nematodes originated from field populations of A. breviligulata. 3 Burial stimulated the foliar growth rate of plants in all combinations except when plants had been infected with nematodes prior to burial. The root dry weight was significantly reduced when nematode infected plants were buried. AM fungi improved the foliar growth rate and root dry weight of buried plants infected with nematodes.

Many isolates that were able in vitro to produce typical ericoid mycorrhizae did not form reproductive structures under our culture conditions, whereas others could be identified as belonging to the species Oidiodendron maius. Morphological and molecular analysis of the fungal isolates showed that the root system of a single plant of C. vulgaris is a complex mosaic of several populations of mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal fungi. PCR-RFLP techniques, used to investigate the mycorrhizal endophytes, revealed up to four groups of fungi with different PCR-RFLP patterns of the ITS ribosomal region from a single plant. Some of the mycorrhizal fungi sharing the same PCR-RFLP pattern showed high degree of genetic polymorphism when analysed with the more sensitive RAPD technique; this technique may prove a useful tool to trace the spread of individual mycorrhizal mycelia, as it has allowed us to identify isolates with identical RAPD fingerprints on different plants.","CNR,CTR MICOL TERRENO,I-10125 TURIN,ITALY","Perotto, S (reprint author), UNIV TURIN,DIPARTIMENTO BIOL VEGETALE,VLE MATTIOLI 25,I-10125 TURIN,ITALY.",,,"PEROTTO, Silvia/0000-0003-0121-1806; Bonfante, Paola/0000-0003-3576-8530",,,,33,72,76,0,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The components of competitive ability examined were N-15 uptake rate, N-15 allocation, whole pliant biomass, root:shoot ratio, and tissue N concentrations. It was hypothesized that N-15 uptake rate would be the component most correlated with relative abundance. However, N-15 uptake rate was negatively correlated with percent cover in the community. In contrast, whole plant biomass and root:shoot ratio were positively correlated with relative abundance. Tissue N concentrations and N-15 allocation were not important predictors of relative abundance. These results suggest that in a harsh environment, high resource uptake rates are not indicative of competitive ability, but may instead be a mechanism by which rare species are able to coexist with competitive dominants.","UNIV COLORADO,DEPT ENVIRONM POPULAT & ORGANISM BIOL,BOULDER,CO 80309",,,,,,,,47,41,41,0,14,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1996,75,1,,,,,59,66,,10.2307/3546321,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UK723,WOS:A1996UK72300007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ruess, L; Sandbach, P; Cudlin, P; Dighton, J; Crossley, A",,,,"Ruess, L; Sandbach, P; Cudlin, P; Dighton, J; Crossley, A",,,"Acid deposition in a spruce forest soil: Effects on nematodes, mycorrhizas and fungal biomass",PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,spruce forest; acidification; nematodes; root density; fungal biomass; mycorrhiza,CONIFEROUS FOREST; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; PINE-SEEDLINGS; ACIDIFICATION; POPULATIONS; RAIN; ERGOSTEROL; NITROGEN; CARBON; DECOMPOSITION,"The belowground biota (nematodes, fungal biomass, roots and mycorrhizal development) of a mature Sitka spruce stand under the influence of acid precipitation (equimolar sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate) was investigated. Sampling took place after 3 years of treatment and 5 months after the end of treatment. Acidification led to a decrease of the soil pH from 5.0 to 4.0 in the upper 2 cm of soil. The active fungal biomass, measured as the ergosterol content of the soil, increased. After the end of the acid treatment pH differences decreased between plots. The active fungal biomass was lower, but the amount of total fungal hyphae was higher at the acid treated plots. Additionally, precipitation of acid mist led to an acceleration of fine root and mycorrhizal development and their senescence. A total of 79 nematode species were found in the plots. Acidification caused a distinct decrease in species number, especially among K-strategists like omnivores and predators. The population density was not altered, but the dominance and abundance structure of the community changed. Acrobeloides nanus, Metateratocephalus crassidens and Aphelenchoides spp. spp. showed a higher frequency at the acidified plots. Others, like Cervidellus serratus, Filenchus spp. or Aporcelaimellus obtusicaudatus, decreased. Among the trophic groups, the occurrence of omnivore and predatory nematodes was affected negatively by acidification. The proportion of fungal feeding nematodes increased under acid precipitation, but the effect did not last after the end of the treatment. This corresponds to the amount of the active fungal biomass measured in the soil, indicating that the composition of the nematode fauna is changing with the presence or absence of their food source.","INST TERR ECOL,MERLEWOOD RES STN,GRANGE SANDS LA11 6JU,CUMBRIA,ENGLAND; ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBL,INST LANDSCAPE ECOL,CR-37005 CESKE BUDEJOVICE,CZECH REPUBLIC; RUTGERS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,DIV PINELANDS RES,INST MARINE & COASTAL SCI,CAMDEN,NJ 08102; INST TERR ECOL,PENICUIK EH26 0QB,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND",,,"Cudlin, Pavel/G-3607-2014",,,,,78,38,38,1,22,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG JENA,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0031-4056,,,PEDOBIOLOGIA,Pedobiologia,FEB,1996,40,1,,,,,51,66,,,,,16,Ecology; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,TX342,WOS:A1996TX34200006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chen, HC; Long, BG; Song, HY",,,,"Chen, HC; Long, BG; Song, HY",,,"Exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants of Astragali rhizobia are symbiotically effective on Astragalus sinicus, an indeterminate nodulating host",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Astragali rhizobia; Astragalus sinicus; exopolysaccharide; symbiosis,CALCOFLUOR-BINDING EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE; FORM INEFFECTIVE NODULES; SP STRAIN NGR234; SP STRAIN-NGR234; MELILOTI; GENES; LEGUMINOSARUM; TRIFOLII; CONSTRUCTION; DNA,"Five exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants were isolated after rhizobial strain 107 was subjected to transposon Tn5 mutagenesis.

An inflatable adaptation of the minirhizotron technique has been developed to be used in stony soils. These kind of soils, common in many forests, as in mediterranean forested areas, would present too irregular surface holes to place rigid frames inside.

The botanical and ecological characteristics of the different communities are discussed, with reference to the existing classification of Mongolian plant communities. Analysis of the present data indicates that a refinement or extension of the classification system is desirable, especially concerning the steppe(-related) communities. Discussion of the relative distribution of steppe and forest reveals that in the relatively dry location of Hustain Nuruu grassland and shrubland dominate the natural vegetation (88% of the area). Forest covers ca. 5% of the area, it is limited to sites where ground water is within rooting depth: north slopes above 1400 m (Betula platyphylla woodland) and along erosion gullies (fragmentary Ulmus pumila gallery woodland). Under natural conditions forest cover might reach 12%, but it is speculated that wild ungulates could maintain its extension at a lower level.

Direct assessment of the impact of increasing CO2 is very difficult, however, because of the long-term nature of CO2 effects and the myriad potential interactions between CO2 and other environmental factors that can influence the physiological and ecological relationships of oaks. The CO2 responses of at least 11 Quercus species have been investigated, primarily in experiments with seedlings. The growth response varies considerably among these experiments, and there appears to be no basis for differentiating the response of oaks as a group from those of other woody plants. The more important challenge is to find a basis for addressing questions about the responses of oak forest ecosystems from experimental data on individual seedlings and saplings. A series of experiments with white oak (Quercus alba L) seedlings and saplings was focused toward larger-scale questions, such as whether N limitations would preclude growth responses to elevated CO2 and whether short-term physiological responses could be sustained over longer time scales. These experiments suggested three issues that are particularly important for addressing forest responses: leaf area dynamics, fine root production, and biotic interactions.

Quercus distribution greatly increased at the beginning of the Holocene epoch (10 000 years BP), but has exhibited major changes since European settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, large-scale increases in Quercus species have occurred as a result of fire exclusion in the central tallgrass prairie and savanna regions. In the northern conifer and hardwood forests of New England and the Lake States region, Q rubra exhibited a dramatic increase following early logging and fire. Quercus species have also increased in the mid-Atlantic region from land-clearing, the charcoal iron industry and the eradication of Castanea dentata following European settlement. Studies of the dendroecology and successional dynamics of several old-growth forests indicate that prior to European settlement Quercus grew and regenerated in uneven-aged conditions. At times oak growth was very slow (< 1.0 mm/year) for long periods, which is usually characteristic of highly shade-tolerant species. Quercus species exhibited continuous recruitment into the canopy during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but stopped recruiting in the early 20th century. Since that time, later successional, mixed-mesophytic species have dominated understory and canopy recruitment, which coincides with the period of fire exclusion throughout much of the eastern biome. Major oak replacement species include Acer rubrum, A saccharum, Prunus serotina and others. Logging of oak forests that have understories dominated by later successional species often accelerates the oak replacement process. Relative to other hardwood tree species, many oaks exhibit high fire and drought resistance. Adaptations of oaks to fire include thick bark, vigorous sprouting and resistance to rotting after scarring, as well as benefiting from fire-created seedbeds. Their adaptations to drought include deep rooting, xeromorphic leaves, low water potential threshold for stomatal closure, high gas exchange rates, osmotic adjustment and a drought-resistant photosynthetic apparatus. However, oaks typically have low tolerance for current understory conditions, despite the fact that they produce a large seed with the potential to produce an initially large seedling. Oak seedlings in shaded understories generally grow very slowly and have recurring shoot dieback, although they have relatively high net photosynthesis and low respiration rates compared to many of their understory competitors. Oak forest canopies also allow for relatively high light transmission compared with later successional forest types. Thus, without severe competition from non-oak tree species, oaks should have the physiological capability for long-term survival beneath their own canopies in uneven-age tie, gap-phase) or even-age forest conditions. I argue that fire exclusion this century has facilitated the invasion of most oak understories by later successional species, which are over-topping oak seedlings. If this condition, coupled with severe predation of oak acorns and seedlings, continues into the next century, a major loss of oak dominance should be anticipated.",,"Abrams, MD (reprint author), PENN STATE UNIV,SCH FOREST RESOURCES,4 FERGUSON BLDG,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802, USA.",,,,,,,118,75,78,2,46,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",12-Mar,,,ANN SCI FOREST,Ann.

Soil matric potentials were determined with tensiometers, and xylem water potentials as well as relative water content and osmotic pressure of the leaves were measured in oaks differing in the degree of damage. Additionally, the distribution and biomasses of fine roots were investigated. More negative soil matric potentials in the declining stand of pedunculate oak and lower relative water contents of the leaves of damaged trees even in a vegetation period with sufficient precipitation indicated a higher risk of drought stress in dry years. At the two sites with sessile oaks, the impact of drought on tree water relations seemed to be much smaller. The relative water content of leaves from damaged oaks was not lower than of those from healthy trees, even in an extremely warm and dry period. At these sites, crown reduction may be a temporary form of adaptation to insufficient water supply and, in this case, would have to be differentiated from ''oak decline'' in its true sense. Generally, distinct reductions in fine root biomass and an increased percentage of dead fine roots were detected only in severely damaged trees, indicating that root decay is not a primary factor in the complex of oak decline.","NIEDERSACHS FORSTL VERSUCHSANSTALT,D-37079 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY",,,"Thomas, Frank/H-8418-2019",,,,,32,33,35,0,15,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",12-Mar,,,ANN SCI FOREST,Ann.

Experiments were also conducted in vitro to determine animal feeding responses to (1) increasing quantities of hyphal biomass, (2) the presence of root vs. litter fungal substrates, and (3) hyphae of different widths of Glomus macrocarpum. The results indicate that arthropods prefer to graze in the litter region rather than in the deeper soil layers. Under ideal moisture/temperature conditions, animals are forced to the lower regions by interspecific interactions. They prefer to graze on hyphae of conidial fungi rather than on those of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. When arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae are grazed, there is a clear preference for the narrower hyphae, which are those further away from the root. The thicker hyphal segments, commonly found connecting ''absorptive hyphal fans'' to roots, were less preferred. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that microarthropods are detrimental to arbuscular mycorrhizal associations, and suggest that Glomalean fungi may have evolved mechanisms to deter grazing by microarthropods.","UNIV WATERLOO, DEPT BIOL, WATERLOO, ON N2L 3G1, CANADA",,,,,,,,52,117,123,1,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

A novel methodology for estimating year of germination in woody species by identifying the root-shoot boundary appears to be promising. Both rare seasonal and interannual climatic factors and a unique set of circumstances associated with anthropogenic disturbances played a role in shaping a germination pulse early in the 20th century. A cohort originating in 1919 captured available space and, barring major disturbance, will dominate forest structure at the site for centuries.

'Eugenei' and Populus tristis X Populus balsamifera cv. 'Tristis 1' was established in May 1984 on a level site in East Lansing, MI, USA. Supplemental water in the form of drip irrigation was applied to half the trees beginning the first growing season. All trees were cut down in March 1988 and the stumps allowed to coppice. Pre- and post-coppice height and diameter growth of 'Eugenei' always exceeded that of 'Tristis', and the former clone showed a positive response to irrigation, whereas the latter did not. The greater growth of 'Eugenei' was primarily due to its full use of the growing season. Post-coppice rates of photosynthesis were not affected by irrigation in either clone, but stomatal conductances were reduced in non-irrigated trees. Analysis of microvideo images taken in minirhizotron tubes buried in the soil close to the trees showed that 'Tristis' produced a greater length and number of fine roots in the top 30 cm of soil than 'Eugenei', regardless of treatment. Irrigated trees consistently produced more fine roots at 0-30 cm soil depth than non-irrigated trees only in 'Eugenei', but both clones showed greater fine-root production in non-irrigated trees at 30-100 cm. Both clones also showed substantial fine-root production in the spring immediately following coppicing, with no evidence of a shock-induced dieback of roots.

While optimization theory has great heuristic appeal and has been used to describe a range of physiological and ecological phenomena, it has major limitations. Optimization is necessarily based on a definite time integral and an optimal control strategy must be specific to the same patterns exhibited by the driving variables over this same period of time. Optimization tends to employ the use of oversimplifications in order to facilitate analytical solutions to the optimal control strategy, i.e. the mechanism governing the response of plants, which is the critical issue of interest. It is difficult to define objective criteria that can account for the natural variability in plants and testing the quantitative predictions of optimality models is also difficult. Thus, we suggest that optimization theory is too limited for practical use in modelling whole plant allocation. In this paper, we introduce the use of coordination theory as a practical alternative. We develop a simple plant growth allocation model using both coordination and optimization approaches and show that coordination theory is easily applied, produces results that are quantitatively similar to optimization, and overcomes the inherent limitations of optimization theory.",,"Reynolds, JF (reprint author), DUKE UNIV, DEPT BOT, PHYTOTRON BLDG, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA.",,"Reynolds, James/G-6364-2010",,,,,22,54,63,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,185,1,,,,,65,74,,10.1007/BF02257565,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD377,WOS:A1996WD37700007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dugassa, GD; vonAlten, H; Schonbeck, F",,,,"Dugassa, GD; vonAlten, H; Schonbeck, F",,,Effects of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) on health of Linum usitatissimum L infected by fungal pathogens,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Meeting on Arbuscular Mycorrhizas in Sustainable Soil-Plant Systems,"APR 27-30, 1995","BARCELONA, SPAIN",,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Fusarium-wilt; Oidium lini; plant health; resistance; tolerance,F-SP CHRYSANTHEMI; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; ABSCISIC-ACID; PLANT; GROWTH; ROOTS; RESISTANCE; LIPIDS; SOIL; DNA,"Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on health of Linum usitatissimum infected by fungal pathogens were investigated exemplarily. Physiological and biochemical analyses were done to explain the mechanisms underlying the AM effects. AM plants showed increased resistance against the wilt pathogen (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini), the level of this effects depended on the plant cultivars which all showed the same level of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In contrary to that, AM plants were highly susceptible against the shoot pathogen Oidium lini, but they suffered less than non-AM plants in terms of shoot fresh weight, CO2, assimilation and content of sucrose in shoot apex. This indicates that AM not only activates resistance mechanisms but also can induce tolerance against pathogens. The concentration of phytohormones such as auxin- and gibberellin-like substances were increased in shoots of AM plants. In roots the ethylene production was increased, too. Furthermore the content and composition of free sterols were highly altered in leaves of AM plants.

The roots of all inoculated plants were 55 to 70% colonised after 98 days. Increases in both root and shoot dry weights were measured. Root architecture was also determined and increases in branching were evident in AMF colonised root systems. The remaining plants were then inoculated with the root pathogen Phytophthora fragariae and allowed to grow for a further 58 days before harvest. In two of the cultivars, Cambridge Favourite and Elsanta, AMF reduced root necrosis by approximately 60 and 30% respectively. Only in the least susceptible cultivar, Rhapsody, was no reduction measured in AMF colonised plants. There were differences in the control conferred by the two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and this suggests there may be practical benefits of inoculation. Relationships between the presence of roots of different orders, on inoculation with the pathogen, and subsequent necrosis provided a mechanism for identifying root-architecture driven alteration to susceptibility. Root system necrosis was positively correlated with the proportion of the root system made up of higher order roots (3 degrees to 4 degrees) in non-colonised plants and negatively correlated in AMF colonised plants. These data suggest that root-architecture changes are not important per se but factors expressed concurrently may be.","SAC, EDINBURGH EH9 3JIJ, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND","Norman, JR (reprint author), SAC, LAND RESOURCES DEPT, SOIL BIOL UNIT, DOIG SCOTT BLDG, CRAIBSTONE ESTATE, ABERDEEN AB2 9QT, SCOTLAND.",,"Hooker, John/A-9561-2011",,,,,20,79,90,1,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,185,2,,,,,191,198,,10.1007/BF02257524,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD379,WOS:A1996WD37900005,,,,,10/31/19J,"DumasGaudot, E; Slezack, S; Dassi, B; Pozo, MJ; GianinazziPearson, V; Gianinazzi, S",,,,"DumasGaudot, E; Slezack, S; Dassi, B; Pozo, MJ; GianinazziPearson, V; Gianinazzi, S",,,"Plant hydrolytic enzymes (chitinases and beta-1,3-glucanases) in root reactions to pathogenic and symbiotic microorganisms",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Meeting on Arbuscular Mycorrhizas in Sustainable Soil-Plant Systems,"APR 27-30, 1995","BARCELONA, SPAIN",,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; bioprotection; mycorrhiza-induced isoforms; plant hydrolytic enzymes; rhizobial symbosis; root pathogens,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOMATIC EMBRYO MUTANT; ANTIFUNGAL PROPERTIES; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; TRANSGENIC TOBACCO; GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; ISOFLAVONOID ACCUMULATION; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; HYPERSENSITIVE REACTION,"Within the last decade, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the role of chitinases and beta-1,3-glucanases in plant/microbe interactions.

Our objective was to determine the extent and patterns of fine-diameter root production acid loss during the year of alfalfa stand establishment. The experiment was conducted on a loamy sand soil (Udorthentic Haploboroll) in Minnesota, USA, using horizontally installed minirhizotrons placed directly under the seeded rows at 10, 20, and 40 cm depths in four replicate blocks. We seeded four alfalfa germplasms that differed in N-2 fixation capacity and root system architecture: Agate alfalfa, a winter hardy commercially-available cultivar; Ineffective Agate, which is a non-N-2-fixing near isoline of Agate; a new germplasm that has few fibrous roots and strong tap-rooted traits; and a new germplasm that has many fibrous roots and a strongly branched root system architecture. Video images collected biweekly throughout the initial growing season were processed using C-MAP-ROOTS software. More than one-half of all fine roots in the upper 20 cm were produced during the first 7 weeks of growth. Root production was similar among germplasms, except that the highly fibrous, branch-rooted germplasm produced 29% more fine roots at 20 cm than other germplasms. In all germplasms, about 7% of the fine roots at each depth developed into secondarily thickened roots. By the end of the first growing season, greatest fine root mortality had occurred in the uppermost depth (43%), and least occurred at 40 cm (36%). Survival of contemporaneous root cohorts was not related to soil depth in a simple fashion, although all survivorship curves could be described using only five rates of exponential decline. There was a significant reduction in fine root mortality before the first herbage harvest, followed by a pronounced loss (average 22%) of fine roots at the 10- and 20-cm depths in the 2-week period following herbage removal. Median life spans of these early-season cohorts ranged from 58 to 131 days, based on fitted exponential equations. At all depths, fine roots produced in the 4 weeks before harvest (early- to mid-August) tended to have shorter median life spans than early-season cohorts. Similar patterns of fine root mortality did not occur at the second harvest. Germplasms differed in the pattern, but not the ultimate extent, of fine root mortality. Fine root turnover during the first year of alfalfa establishment in this experiment released an estimated 830 kg C ha(-1) and 60 kg N ha(-1), with no differences due to N-2 fixation capacity or root system architecture.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT SOIL WATER & CLIMATE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA","Goins, GD (reprint author), UNIV MINNESOTA, USDA ARS, 439 BORLAUG HALL, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,,,,,,51,43,46,1,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,185,2,,,,,281,291,,10.1007/BF02257534,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD379,WOS:A1996WD37900015,,,,,10/31/19J,"Watson, CJ; Miller, H",,,,"Watson, CJ; Miller, H",,,Short-term effects of urea amended with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide on perennial ryegrass,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,leaf tip scorch; N-15 recovery; N uptake and metabolism; plant; soil; urease activity,FOLIAR-APPLIED UREA; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; SOIL UREASE; NBTPT; PHYTOTOXICITY; RECOVERY; NITROGEN; NICKEL,"The current study investigated the short-term physiological implications of plant nitrogen uptake of urea amended with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (nBTPT) under both greenhouse and held conditions. N-15 labelled urea amended with 0.0, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5% nBTPT (w/w) was surface applied at a rate equivalent to 100 kg N ha(-1) to perennial ryegrass in a greenhouse pot experiment. Root, shoot and soil fractions were destructively harvested 0.75, 1.75, 4, 7 and 10 days after fertilizer application. Urease activity was determined in each fraction together with N-15 recovery and a range of chemical analyses. The effect of nBTPT amended urea on leaf tip scorch was evaluated together with the effect of the inhibitor applied on its own on plant urease activity. nBTPT-amended urea dramatically reduced shoot urease activity for the first few days after application compared to unamended urea. The higher the nBTPT concentration the longer the time required for shoot activity to return to that in the unamended treatment. At the highest inhibitor concentration of 0.5% shoot urease activity had returned to that of unamended urea by 10 days. Root urease activity was unaffected by nBTPT in the presence of urea but was affected by nBTPT in the absence of urea. Transient leaf tip scorch was observed approximately 7-15 days after nBTPT + urea application and was greatest with high concentrations of nBTPT and high urea-N application rates. New developing leaves showed no visual sign of tip necrosis. Urea hydrolysis of unamended urea was rapid with only 1.3% urea-N remaining in the soil after 1.75 days. N uptake and metabolism by ryegrass was rapid with N-15 recovery from unamended urea, in the plant (shoot + root) being 33% after 1.75 days. Most of the N-15 in the soil following the urea + 0.5% nBTPT application was still as urea after 1.75 days, yet N-15 plant recovery at this time was 25% (root+shoot). This together with other evidence, suggests that if urea hydrolysis in soil is delayed by nBTPT then urea can be taken up by ryegrass as the intact molecule, albeit at a significantly slower initial rate of uptake than NH4+-N. Protein and water soluble carbohydrate content of the plant were not significantly affected by amending urea with nBTPT however, there was a significant effect on the composition of amino acids in the roots and shoots, suggesting a difference in metabolism. Although nBTPT-amended urea affected plant urease activity and caused some leaf-tip scorch the effects were transient and short-lived. The previously reported benefit of nBTPT in reducing NH3 volatilization of urea would appear to far outweigh any of the observed short-term effects, as dry-matter production of ryegrass is increased.","QUEENS UNIV BELFAST,FAC AGR & FOOD SCI,BELFAST,ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND","Watson, CJ (reprint author), DEPT AGR NO IRELAND,AGR & ENVIRONM SCI DIV,NEWFORGE LANE,BELFAST BT9 5PX,ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND.",,,,,,,36,31,33,1,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,184,1,,,,,33,45,,10.1007/BF00029272,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WB962,WOS:A1996WB96200004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mensforth, LJ; Walker, GR",,,,"Mensforth, LJ; Walker, GR",,,Root dynamics of Melaleuca halmaturorum in response to fluctuating saline groundwater,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,leaf water potential; Melaleuca halmaturorum; root; salinity; soil water potential; stable isotopes,SOIL-WATER; PLANTS; TRANSPIRATION; MANAGEMENT; MANGROVE,"Melaleuca halmaturorum is a salt and waterlogging tolerant tree and thus often occurs in saline areas fringing permanent wetlands and in ephemeral swamps. The dominance of this tree in natural groundwater discharge areas may result in M. halmaturorum transpiration making a major contribution to groundwater discharge. To quantify this the seasonal changes in tree water sources in response to fluctuating soil salinity and waterlogging were examined. This study was conducted in a natural system where seasonally fluctuating saline groundwater (64 dS m(-1); 0.3 - 1.2 m deep) allowed the patterns of M. halmaturorum root water uptake to be followed over a 15 month period. Tree water sources were examined using the naturally occurring stable isotopes of water, while new root growth was examined using a field root observation window and from soil scores. The presence of isotopic fractionation of H-2 under conditions of soil salinity and waterlogging was tested in a glasshouse experiment. Measurements of soil and leaf water potential were also made to examine the possible water sources and limits to water uptake. No isotopic fractionation was found by tree roots under conditions of salinity and waterlogging. M. halmaturorum trees were active in taking up groundwater at most times and combined this with a shallower soil water source replenished by rainfall in winter. Water uptake was concentrated in the deeper parts of the soil profile when the groundwater was at its deepest and salt had accumulated in the surface soils, at the end of summer. When groundwater rose, at the end of winter, roots responded by extracting water from near the soil surface (0 - 0.1 m), at the new watertable. This pattern of water uptake in response to groundwater fluctuations and salt accumulation in the surface soil was also reflected in new root tip appearance at the root observation window. Fluctuations in leaf water potential fallowed fluctuations in surface soil (0.1 m depth) water potential at all times. In winter leaf water potential reflected the absolute values of the surface soil water potential but in summer it was between surface soil and groundwater water potentials. We conclude that M. halmaturorum used groundwater in summer and a combination of rainfall and groundwater from the surface soils in winter. The ability to take up water from saline substrates through the maintenance of low leaf water potential, combined with this ability to rapidly alter root water uptake in response to changes in soil water availability contributed to the survival of M. halmaturorum in this saline swamp.","UNIV ADELAIDE,DEPT BOT,ADELAIDE,SA 5001,AUSTRALIA","Mensforth, LJ (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV WATER RESOURCES,PMB 2,GLEN OSMOND,SA 5064,AUSTRALIA.",,"Walker, Glen/F-5762-2013; Walker, Glen/AAA-9703-2019",,,,,32,39,41,0,20,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,184,1,,,,,75,84,,10.1007/BF00029276,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WB962,WOS:A1996WB96200008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hodge, A; Grayston, SJ; Ord, BG",,,,"Hodge, A; Grayston, SJ; Ord, BG",,,A novel method for characterisation and quantification of plant root exudates,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,C-budgets; Festuca ovina; nitrogen; Plantago lanceolata; root exudation,RHIZOSPHERE CARBON-FLOW; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SUBSTRATE FLOW; LOLIUM-PERENNE; AMINO-ACIDS; SOIL; PHOSPHORUS; SEEDLINGS; NITROGEN; BACTERIA,A microcosm unit is described which readily allows manipulation of experimental conditions to enable the subsequent impact on root exudation release to be monitored with time.

These bioassays measured mycorrhizal formation by bait plants that were grown in intact cores of soil collected along a transect at each site. The mine sites included, had sparse, patchy or dense vegetation cover on waste-rock materials that would initially have been devoid of mycorrhizal fungus propagules. The natural habitats included eucalypt savanna sites which had been subjected to hot annual fires for 4 years or remained unburnt. Propagules of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi occurred in all sites, but were sporadically distributed in highly disturbed areas, where they were associated with patches of vegetation. Both the relative abundance and frequency of occurrence of inoculum of VAM and ECM fungi increased with vegetation cover in older disturbed sites. Propagules of VAM fungi were substantially more numerous in some mine site habitats with dense vegetation cover, than in adjacent natural habitats. The presence of substantial amounts of phosphorus, released from weathering rock, in mine waste rock materials may have reduced the requirement of plants for mycorrhizal associations during vegetation establishment in mine sites. In woodland sites, hot annual fires appeared to restrict ECM fungi to infrequent patches in the surface horizon, while ECM fungus inoculum was much more frequently detected in soil from the unburnt site. These fire regimes apparently had less effect on the distribution or quantity of VAM fungus inoculum.","US EPA,ENVIRONM RES INST SUPERVISING SCIENTIST,JABIRU,NT 0886,AUSTRALIA","Brundrett, MC (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,FAC AGR,NEDLANDS,WA 6009,AUSTRALIA.",,"Brundrett, Mark/G-2101-2010","Brundrett, Mark/0000-0002-2501-9037; Ashwath, Nanjappa/0000-0002-4032-4507",,,,32,43,45,2,26,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,184,1,,,,,173,184,,,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WB962,WOS:A1996WB96200018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Athar, M; Johnson, DA",,,,"Athar, M; Johnson, DA",,,Influence of drought on competition between selected Rhizobium meliloti strains and naturalized soil rhizobia in alfalfa,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,competition; drought; Medicago falcata; Medicago sativa; nitrogen fixation; nodulation; rhizobia,INTRINSIC ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM L; NITROGEN-FIXATION; NODULE FORMATION; BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; WATER-STRESS; VICIA-FABA; NODULATION; LEGUMINOSARUM; POPULATIONS,"Drought is an important environmental factor that can affect rhizobial competition and N-2 fixation. Three alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. and M. falcata L.) accessions were grown in pots containing soil from an irrigated (Soil 1) and a dryland (Soil 2) alfalfa field in northern Utah, USA. Mutants of three strains of Rhizobium meliloti Dang. from Pakistan (UL 136, UL 210, and UL 222) and a commercial rhizobial strain 102F51a were developed with various levels of resistance to streptomycin. Seeds inoculated with these individual streptomycin-resistant mutants were sown in the two soils containing naturalized rhizobial populations. Soils in the pots were maintained at -0.03, -0.5, and -1.0 MPa. After 10 weeks, plants were harvested and nodule isolates were cultured on agar medium with and without streptomycin to determine nodule occupancy (proportion of the nodules occupied by introduced rhizobial strains). Number of nodules, nodule occupancy, total plant dry weight, and shoot N were higher for Soil 1 than Soil 2. Number of nodules, plant dry weight, and shoot N decreased as drought increased from -0.03 to -1.0 MPa in the three alfalfa accessions. Rhizobial strains UL 136 and UL 222 were competitive with naturalized alfalfa rhizobia and were effective at symbiotic N-2 fixation under drought. These results suggest that nodulation, growth, and N-2 fixation in alfalfa can be improved by inoculation with competitive and drought-tolerant rhizobia and may be one economically feasible way to increase alfalfa production in water-limited environments.","UTAH STATE UNIV,DEPT RANGELAND RESOURCES,LOGAN,UT 84322; UTAH STATE UNIV,FORAGE & RANGE RES LAB,USDA ARS,LOGAN,UT 84322",,,,,,,,54,10,13,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1996,184,2,,,,,231,241,,10.1007/BF00010452,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WD376,WOS:A1996WD37600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Huang, CY; Webb, MJ; Graham, RD",,,,"Huang, CY; Webb, MJ; Graham, RD",,,Pot size affects expression of Mn efficiency in barley,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,barley; genotype; Mn concentration; Mn efficiency; pot size; screening,,"Mn efficiency is defined here as an ability of a genotype to grow and yield well in a soil which is limiting in available Mn for a standard genotype (Graham, 1984).

One possible factor, pot size was examined as the cause, using two sizes of pot. In large pots, the expectation of higher dry matter and shoot Mn concentration in a Mn-efficient genotype compared to a Mn-inefficient genotype was realised over a wide range of Mn supply, whereas in small pots, the genotypic differences were expressed at only one, low rate of Mn supply (10 mg kg soil(-1)). Plants in the small pots strongly responded to root restriction by decreasing yields and increasing root/shoot ratios and Mn concentrations of shoots. The critical value of Mn concentration for shoot growth was not affected by the small pots, but the Mn mobilization by plants might be affected in the small pots.

Tom. and Mal. and Setchelliogaster sp. nov.) on roots of outplanted Eucalyptus globulus Labill. was examined at two ex-pasture field sites in the south-west of Western Australia. Site 1 was a gravelly yellow duplex soil, and Site 2 was a yellow sandy earth. Plants were grown in steamed or unsteamed soil, in root bags designed as field containers for young growing trees. Three, 6 and 12 months after outplanting, plants were removed from these bags and assessed for dry weights of shoots and ectomycorrhizal colonization of roots. The inoculant ectomycorrhizal fungi (identified on the basis of the colour and morphology of their mycorrhizas) survived on roots of E. globulus for at least 12 months after outplanting at both field sites. At Site 1, however, colonization of new fine roots by the inoculant fungi was low (less than 20% of fine root length). Inoculation had no effect on the growth of E. globulus at this site. In contrast, at Site 2 the inoculant ectomycorrhizal fungi colonized up to 30-50% of new fine root length during the first 6 months after outplanting. There was a corresponding growth response to ectomycorrhizal inoculation at this site, with a close relationship (r(2) = 0.82**) between plant growth at 12 months and root colonization at 3 months. Plant growth at 12 months was related less closely with root colonization at 6 or 12 months. Root colonization by 'resident' ectomycorrhizal fungi increased with time at both field sites. At Site 2, this increase appeared to be at the expense of colonization by the inoculant fungi, which was reduced to less than 10% of fine root length at 12 months. Steaming the soil had little effect on colonization by the inoculant ectomycorrhizal fungi at either field site, but decreased colonization by the resident ectomycorrhizal fungi.","MURDOCH UNIV,SCH BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI,MURDOCH,WA 6150,AUSTRALIA; CSIRO,DIV FORESTRY,WEMBLY,WA 6014,AUSTRALIA; BUNNINGS TREEFARMS,MANJIMUP,WA 6258,AUSTRALIA","Thomson, BD (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,CTR LEGUMES MEDITERRANEAN AGR,NEDLANDS,WA 6009,AUSTRALIA.",,"Hardy, Giles/B-2432-2013","Hardy, Giles/0000-0001-7419-5064",,,,31,21,22,1,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,1996,178,2,,,,,247,253,,10.1007/BF00011590,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,UE063,WOS:A1996UE06300012,,,,,10/31/19B,"Jabbes, M; Johnson, D; Doescher, P",,"Barrow, JR; McArthur, ED; Sosebee, RE; Tausch, RJ",,"Jabbes, M; Johnson, D; Doescher, P",,,Evaluation of root growth of selected Medicago and Hedysarum species,PROCEEDINGS: SHRUBLAND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT,USDA FOREST SERVICE GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT INTERMOUNTAIN,,English,Proceedings Paper,Symposium on Shrubland Ecosystem Dynamics in a Changing Environment,"MAY 23-25, 1995","LAS CRUCES, NM","Shrub Res Consortium, Intermountain Res Stn, New Mexico State Univ, USDA Agr Res Serv, Natl Sci Fdn",,,,"Rapid rates of root elongation benefit plant establishment in semiarid environments.

Therefore, I carried out studies on Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden. trees subjected to soil drying at two field sites in the Mpu-malanga province of South Africa to determine the relation between transpiration rate and soil water availability. I hypothesized that, with this relationship defined, simple modeling of the soil water balance could be used to predict what fraction of potential transpiration was taking place at a given time. Site 1 supported a stand of 3-year-old E. grandis trees, whereas 9-year-old trees were growing on Site 2, situated 2 km away. At each site, plastic sheeting was laid over the ground to prevent soil water recharge and thereby allow the roots in the soil to induce a continuous progressive depletion of soil water. Measurements of predawn xylem pressure potential, leaf area index, growth and sap flow rates revealed that prevention of soil water recharge resulted in only moderate drought stress. At Site 1, the trees abstracted water down to 8 m below the surface, whereas trees at Site 2 obtained most of their water from depths below 8 m. I found that modeling the water balance of deep rooting zones is impractical for the purpose of simulating nonpotential transpiration rates because of uncertainties about the depth of the root system, the soil water recharge mechanism and the water retention characteristics of the deep subsoil strata. I conclude that predicting the occurrence and severity of soil water deficits from the soil water balance is not feasible at these sites.",,"Dye, PJ (reprint author), CSIR,DIV FOREST SCI & TECHNOL,PRIVATE BAG X11227,NELSPRUIT 1200,SOUTH AFRICA.",,,,,,,13,70,77,0,6,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN-FEB,1996,16,2-Jan,,,,,233,238,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,TT024,WOS:A1996TT02400028,14871767,,,,10/31/19B,"Kalhoff, M",,"Pfadenhauer, J",,"Kalhoff, M",,,Reactions of fine roots in a pine-oak forest ecosystem to summer drought periods,"VERHANDLUNGEN DER GESELLSCHAFT FUR OKOLOGIE, VOL 26",,,English,Proceedings Paper,25th Annual Meeting of the Gesellschaft-fur-Okologie,"SEP 11-16, 1995","DRESDEN, GERMANY",Gesell Okol,,fine roots biomass/necromass ratio; summer drought; Pinus sylvestris; Quercus spec.; Prunus serotina,,"The effect of drought and remoistening of the soil on the biomass/necromass ratio of the finest root fraction (0-0.5 mm) was determined in a pine-oak forest ecosystem.

The increase after remoistening is also more rapid for the shrub, whereas the oak reacts gradually but faster than the pine.

Model results of hydrology, forest growth (net primary production of foliage, wood and fine roots) and element cycling, as well as soil and drainage water chemistry generally showed good agreement with measured values. PnET-CN/CHESS was able to predict average concentrations and the increases of NO3- in Selling drainage waters over the 20-year study period (1970-1990), but was not able to simulate some of the dynamics in the overall record. A minor discrepancy between measured and predicted concentrations of SO42- seems to be attributed to a missing source of S in the ecosystem S budget. Model calculations were not able to predict a large decline in pools of exchangeable basic cations observed at the site. Hypothetical simulations of the impact of atmospheric deposition on drainage water chemistry suggest that the Norway spruce (Picea abies) site at Selling is experiencing conditions of N saturation. Future decreases in S and N loading will likely result in marked declines in leaching losses of SO42- and NO3-, causing an increase in pH.","UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE,INST STUDY EARTH OCEANS & SPACE,DURHAM,NH 03824","POSTEK, KM (reprint author), SYRACUSE UNIV,DEPT CIVIL & ENVIRONM ENGN,SYRACUSE,NY 13244, USA.",,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890",,,,18,21,22,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

No significant differences in decomposition rates in root mass losses between the two treatments and years were found. In both treatments there was an annual mass loss of 15.5%, calculated kinetics (k) of 0.18 year(-1), with a turnover time of approximately 17 years. Rates of mass losses of root litter in the Negev Desert were found to be different than those reported for two evergreen shrubs from the Chihuahuan Desert but were found to be comparable to the data reported on Scots pine roots from the SECON research site in Sweden.

Proportions of FDFs were estimated to be 59% for fine roots and 25% for coarse roots, while their decay rates did not differ. The average SDF decay rate of coarse roots was 56% higher compared to fine roots. Overall decomposition of fine roots was higher in coarse compared to medium and fine mesh litterbags.

How biomass allocation patterns determine establishment and stem production was studied in 0 to 2-yr-old plantations of Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora, and Hyeronima alchorneoides on fertile soil in the humid Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. The species were evaluated by: (1) their allocation of biomass to leaves and fine roots; (2) the resource-capturing capacity of the stands as expressed in leaf area, cover, fine-root length, and root distribution; and (3) biomass accrual and aboveground productivity. All species grew very fast: average stand heights at 2 yr ranged from 4 to 6 m, and some individuals were >12 m tall. Canopy closure and root-system overlap were fastest in Cordia, occurring within a year after planting. Cordia's rapid stand closure was achieved by its higher specific leaf area and specific root length, plus an architecture that distributed leaves and fine roots more widely. Maximum aboveground net primary productivities after canopy closure were 7.3, 4.9, and 3.3 g m(-2) d(-1) for Hyeronima, Cordia, and Cedrela stands, respectively. High productivity of Hyeronima correlated with development of a high LAI coupled with a low leaf turnover rate. Cordia and Cedrela, on the other hand, had higher rates of leaf turnover, so a higher rate of leaf production was required to maintain a given leaf area; this, in turn, limited biomass allocation to production of stem biomass. Cedrela productivity was severely reduced by attacks of the stem-borer Hypsipyla grandella. Biomass allocation patterns that promoted rapid establishment of a tree stand, such as broad crowns, high specific leaf area, and high specific root length, did not lead to the highest levels of stem biomass production after canopy closure. Once stand closure is achieved, species having low rates of leaf turnover, high leaf area indices, and high density of fine roots are likely to be most productive. Fast-growing tropical tree species should be evaluated not just on initial growth but also on the stem production attained after stand closure.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT BOT,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611; INST PACIFIC ISL FORESTRY,HONOLULU,HI 96813",,,,,,,,34,38,39,0,5,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814",0015-749X,,,FOREST SCI,For.

A 1,716-bp fragment of the mitochondrial coxI gene from the angiosperm Peperomia polybotrya was amplified via the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Comparison to other coxI genes revealed a 966-bp group I intron, which, based on homology with the related yeast coxI intron aI4, potentially encodes a 279-amino-acid site-specific DNA endonuclease. This intron, which is believed to function as a ribozyme during its own splicing, is not present in any of 19 coxI genes examined from other diverse vascular plant species. Phylogenetic analysis of intron origin was carried out using three different tree-generating algorithms, and on a variety of nucleotide and amino acid data sets from the intron and its flanking exon sequences. These analyses show that the Peperomia coxI gene intron and exon sequences are of fundamentally different evolutionary origin, The Peperomia intron is more closely related to several fungal mitochondrial introns, two of which are located at identical positions in coxI, than to identically located coxI introns from the land plant Marchantia and the green alga Prototheca. Conversely, the exon sequence of this gene is, as expected, most closely related to other angiosperm coxI genes. These results, together with evidence suggestive of co-conversion of exonic markers immediately flanking the intron insertion site,lead us to conclude that the Peperomia coxI intron probably arose by horizontal transfer from a fungal donor, using the double-strand-break repair pathway. The donor species may have been one of the symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi that Live in close obligate association with most plants.","INDIANA UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BLOOMINGTON,IN 47405","VAUGHN, JC (reprint author), MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45056, USA.",,"Palmer, Jeffrey/P-6747-2014","Palmer, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4626-2220",NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM-35087],,,59,91,96,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0022-2844,,,J MOL EVOL,J.

This was considered important because (i) these soils have a history of variable responses to P fertilization, (ii) roots are known to grow in this material, and (iii) previous research has suggested that the P in this material might be available to plants. Desorption experiments using 0.001 M concentrations of a variety of organic ligands (pH 4.3 for initial solutions) with a range of Al complexation constants were conducted by reacting the ligand solutions with spodic horizon soil. Inorganic P, organic P, and AL were measured in the resulting extracts. Results showed that the amount of extractable inorganic P in these soils was variable. Some soils had detectable levels of extractable inorganic P, while others are essentially devoid of it. In those soils that had extractable P, the inorganic P release was correlated to the release of Al as the release of both moieties was initiated by organic anions with logK(Al) values, the Al stability constant with that anion, of about 3.2 to 4.2 or greater. This suggests that root exudates with logK(Al)s less than these values would not be effective in making inorganic P in spodic horizons more available to plants. Organic P is a major component of the soil solution and is released by a mechanism unrelated to the logK(Al) Of the organic ligand.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT SOIL & WATER SCI,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611; UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT CHEM,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",,,"Lambers, Hans/A-1544-2008","Lambers, Hans/0000-0002-4118-2272",,,,23,36,46,0,14,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

We examined germination and establishment of Russian-olive and plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides), the principal native riparian tree of the Great Plains, under a range of experimental moisture and light conditions. The fewest seedlings established under the driest conditions; seedling biomass was predictably lower in the shade; root-to-shoot ratios were higher for cottonwood, higher in the sun, and higher under drier conditions. Several interactions were also significant. The timing of germination and mortality, varied between plains cottonwood and Russian-olive: cottonwood germinated in mid-June in all treatments in a single pulse with subsequent mortality: the timing and amount of Russian-olive germination differed substantially across treatments with little net mortality. Differences in life-history traits of these species, including seed size, viability, and dispersal, help, explain treatment differences Russian-olive will likely remain an important component of riparian communities along both unregulated and regulated western rivers because it succeeds under conditions optimal for cottonwood establishment and under many conditions unfavorable for cottonwood.

Seedlings were reared from seed in atmospheres with 700 mu l l(-1), 525 mu l l(-1), or ambient CO2 concentrations, and in a potting mix with 68, 43, or 18 mu g g(-1) soil P, and all were inoculated with the mycobiont Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker and Couch shortly after emergence. At 4-month intervals over the 1-year duration of the study, three whole seedlings of each combination of CO2 and P treatments were harvested to permit detailed assessment of shoot and root growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization. After 4 months, shoot volume, root dry weight, and total root length of seedlings grown in 700 mu l(-1) CO2 were greater than those of seedlings grown in the other atmospheres regardless of P treatment, and shoot/root ratios decreased as the CO2 concentration increased within each P treatment as well. After 8 months, the smallest shoot volumes and root weights and lengths within each P treatment were those of seedlings grown in ambient CO2. Root weight and total length increased as the CO2 concentration increased in high soil P, but the greatest root weights and lengths within the medium and low P treatments were those of seedlings reared in the 525 mu l(-1) CO2 atmosphere. Nevertheless, shoot/root ratios decreased with increasing CO2 in both high and medium soil P at the second harvest, and the highest shoot/root ratio in low P was that of seedlings grown in ambient CO2. After 1 year, the largest shoot and root volumes within the high and medium P treatments were those of seedlings grown in intermediate CO2, while the reverse was true in low P. The effects of CO2 concentration on dry weights, total root length, and shoot/root ratio at the final harvest were nonsignificant. As proved true with seedling growth, CO2 effects on ectomycorrhizal colonization varied temporally, as mycorrhizal development was not affected by the atmospheric treatments after 4 months, while seedlings grown in ambient CO2 exhibited the highest percent infections within each P treatment at the second harvest but those grown in 700 mu l l(-1) CO2 had the highest percentages after 1 year. These results suggest that elevated CO2 exerts stimulatory effects on shoot and root development of juvenile ponderosa pine which may be dependent on P availability to some degree, but these effects are somewhat transient and vary in magnitude over time.","UNIV NEVADA,DESERT RES INST,CTR BIOL SCI,RENO,NV 89506","WALKER, RF (reprint author), UNIV NEVADA,DEPT ENVIRONM & RESOURCE SCI,RENO,NV 89512, USA.",,,,,,,28,20,22,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Some of these are pathogenic, others appear to be opportunistic and have no apparent impact, while mycorrhizal fungi are generally regarded as mutualistic. Of the various types of mycorrhizal fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association is by far the most abundant and widespread. While the most widely accepted model of AM function depends upon plants benefiting from the facilitation of phosphorus uptake, recent data from field-based studies in temperate ecosystems indicate that only plant species with poorly branched root systems benefit from AM fungi in this way: species with highly branched root systems may benefit in other ways, such as by being protected against root pathogenic fungi. These two responses apparently represent extremes along a continuum of AM benefit determined by root system architecture.","UNIV YORK,DEPT BIOL,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND; UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND","NEWSHAM, KK (reprint author), INST TERR ECOL,MONKS WOOD EXPTL STN,HUNTINGDON PE17 2LS,CAMBS,ENGLAND.",,"Newsham, Kevin/C-4192-2011; Watkinson, Andrew/N-1649-2013",,,,,56,368,398,6,129,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

In this paper P- and Al-species calculations under equilibrium assumptions were conducted to determine the species which were mobilized by the humics and red clover root exudates. Phosphate distribution between free ortho-P and humic-Al-P complexes was calculated by an iterative procedure. In the soil without plants more tan 50% of P in solution was present as humic associated P even at the lowest humic level. In soil under ryegrass the proportion of humic-P complexes was much lower due to the relatively low concentrations of humic-Al complexes in solution. In soil under red clover, between 55 increase compared to soil without plants or with ryegrass is caused by the high concentrations of humic-Al complexes in solution. The higher P-influx of red clover compared to ryegrass and P species distribution indicate that red clover can take up P from solubilized humic-P complexes. Aluminium species calculations showed that, even at the lowest level of humics addition, more than 60% of Al was complexed by the humics in soil without plants. The proportion of Al complexed by humics increased to about 90% at the highest level of humics addition. In soil under ryegrass cover, the proportion of humic-Al complexes was lower, not exceeding 73% due to the reduced solubility of humic substances. In contrast, higher humics concentrations in soil solution under red clover total al even at the lowest of humic-Al complexes to more than 80% of total Al even at the lowest humic level. It was concluded that the strong complexation of Al by humics in the soil solution under red clover reduces Al toxicity.",,"GERKE, J (reprint author), UNIV GOTTINGEN,INST AGR CHEM,VON SIEBOLD STR 6,D-37075 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,,,,,,25,1,1,0,0,VCH PUBLISHERS INC,DEERFIELD BEACH,"303 NW 12TH AVE, DEERFIELD BEACH, FL 33442-1788",0044-3263,,,Z PFLANZ BODENKUNDE,Z.

The soils were a grey silt-loam of high P and a yellow clay-loam of low P content. The rhizobacterium had no significant effect on plant biomass production in either soil in the absence of the VAM fungus, but decreased plant growth by more than 30% in its presence. It enhanced the root/shoot and seed/plant ratios in plants of both VAM and non-VAM treatments. Without the VAM fungus, both soils disaggregated. This slaking of water-stable aggregates (over 0.5 mm) was significantly less severe when the rhizobacterium was present. With the VAM fungus, aggregation increased up to 27% during the experiment, but the rhizobacterium did not affect this process significantly.

We found sporocarps of Sclerocystis coremioides and spores of four Glomus species in 69.3% of fecal samples, with 37.5% of samples containing 2-4 fungus species. There were median numbers of 8.6 S. coremioides sporocarps and 712 Glomus spores/0.1 g feces. S. coremioides and all Glomus species comprised up to 4.1 and 5.4% of fecal mass, respectively. We did not detect differences in fungus consumption by rodent species or sex, but did find significant differences between rodent genera. More than 60% of Proechimys samples contained glomalean fungi in contrast to approximate to 37% of Oryzomys samples. Occurrence of the two fungus genera in feces differed seasonally but was generally congruent between Proechimys and Oryzomys. Glomus presence in feces is significantly positively associated with the dry season. Both rodent genera together annually pass 2.96 x 10(5) S. coremioides sporocarps and 7.30 x 10(7) Glomus spores/ha at Cocha Cashu.

All treatments were carried out at ambient (350 mu L L(-1)) and at elevated CO2 concentration (700 mu L L(-1)). Total tree biomass, mycorrhizal infection, net CO2 assimilation (P-n), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration of the shoots and NH3 metabolization of the needles were measured. In ambient CO2 (1) gaseous NH3 decreased mycorrhizal infection, without significantly affecting tree biomass or N concentration and it enhanced the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in one-year-old needles; (2) ozone decreased mycorrhizal infection and the activity of GS in the needles, while it increased the activity of GDH; (3) exposure to NH3 + O-3 lessened the effects of single exposures to NH3 and O-3 on reduction of mycorrhizal infection and on increase in GDH activity. Similar lessing effects on mycorrhizal infection as observed in trees exposed to NH3 + O-3 at ambient CO2, were measured in trees exposed to NH3 + O-3 at elevated CO2. Exposure to elevated CO2 without pollutants did not significantly affect any of the parameters studied, except for a decrease in the concentration of soluble proteins in the needles. Elevated CO2 + NH3 strongly decreased root branching and mycorrhizal infection and temporarily stimulated P-n and g(s). The exposure to elevated CO2 + NH3 + O-3 also transiently stimulated P-n. The possible mechanisms underlying and integrating these effects are discussed. Elevated CO2 clearly did not alleviate the negative effects of NH3 and O-3 on mycorrhizal infection. The significant reduction of mycorrhizal infection after exposure to NH3 or O-3, observed before significant changes in gas exchange or growth occurred, suggest the use of mycorrhizal infection as an early indicator for NH3 and O-3 induced stress.","UNIV ROME,DEPT PLANT BIOL,I-00165 ROME,ITALY; UNIV GRONINGEN,DEPT PLANT BIOL,9750 AA HAREN,NETHERLANDS","PEREZSOBA, M (reprint author), AB DLO,RES INST AGROBIOL & SOIL FERTIL,DEPT CROP & WEED SCI,POB 14,BORNSESTEEG 65,6700 AA WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,58,44,46,2,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,1995,176,1,,,,,107,116,,10.1007/BF00017681,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RW205,WOS:A1995RW20500013,,,,,10/31/19J,"JONER, EJ; MAGID, J; GAHOONIA, TS; JAKOBSEN, I",,,,"JONER, EJ; MAGID, J; GAHOONIA, TS; JAKOBSEN, I",,,P DEPLETION AND ACTIVITY OF PHOSPHATASES IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF MYCORRHIZAL AND NONMYCORRHIZAL CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS-SATIVUS L),SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOIL ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; PLANT-ROOTS; HYPHAE; FUNGI; CLOVER; DEFICIENCY; METABOLISM; INFECTION; P-32,"An experiment was set up to test the ability of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots and hyphae to produce extracellular phosphatases and to study the relationship between phosphatase activity and soil organic P (P-o). Non-mycorrhizal cucumber and cucumber in symbiosis with either of two mycorrhizal fungi were grown in a sandy loam-sand mixture in three-compartment pots. Plant roots were separated from two consecutively adjoining compartments, first by a 37 m mesh excluding roots and subsequently by a 0.45 m membrane excluding mycorrhizal hyphae. Soil from the two root-free compartments was sectioned in a freezing microtome and analyzed for extracellular acid (pH 5.2) and alkaline (pH 8.5) phosphatase activity as well as depletion of NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P (P-i) and P-o. Roots and mycorrhizal hyphae depleted the soil of P-i but did not influence the concentration of P-o in spite of increased phosphatase activity in soil influenced by roots. Phosphatase activity at both pH values was highest in soil influenced by uncolonized roots, but this was attributed to higher root length densities as compared to mycorrhizal roots. Mycorrhizal hyphae showed no influence on soil phosphatase activity in spite of high hyphal length densities(>22 m cm(-3)).

Our objectives were to determine treatment effects, quantify seasonal variation, and determine regulating mechanisms. Elevated CO2 treatments were applied in open-top chambers containing 3-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) seedlings. Nitrogen applications were made annually in early spring. The experimental design was a replicated factorial combination of CO2 (ambient, +175, and +350 mu L . L(-1) CO2) and N (0, 10, and 20 g . m(-2) N as ammonium sulfate). Soils were irrigated to maintain soil moisture at >25%. Soil CO2 evolution was measured over diurnal periods (20-22 h) in April, June, and October 1993 using a flow-through, infrared gas analyzer measurement system. To examine regulating mechanisms, we linked our results with other studies measuring root biomass with destructive sampling and root studies using minirhizotron techniques. Significantly higher soil CO2 evolution was observed in the elevated CO2 treatments in April and October; N effects were not significant. In October, integrated daily values for CO2 evolution ranged from 3.73 to 15.68 g CO2 . m(-2)day(-1) for the ambient CO2 + 0 N and 525 mu L . L(-1) CO2 + 20 g . m(-2) N, respectively. Soil CO2 flux among treatments was correlated with coarse root biomass (r(2) = 0.40; p >F = 0.0380), indicating that at least some of the variation observed among treatments was related to variation in root respiration. Across ail sample periods and treatments, there was a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.63; p >F = 0.0001) between soil CO2 evolution acid percent fungal hyphae observed in minirhizotron tubes.

The response of treated trees was compared with that of untreated control trees to determine the effect that extreme winds, such as those from hurricanes, have on the growth and function of surviving trees. The impact of acute wind stress on the susceptibility of pine trees to attack by the bark-feeding beetle genera Dendroctonus and Ips also was investigated. The reduction of photosynthetic capacity due to 50% leaf area loss from branch pruning decreased stem diameter growth by 67% after 1 year. It also decreased oleoresin flow, a critical defense mechanism of pines against bark beetle attack. Short-term mortality of fine roots was observed for trees receiving branch pruning, but fine root biomass quickly returned to levels similar to controls. Little damage to larger roots was observed. During the year following treatment, treated pines had similar xylem water potentials compared with control trees as well as similar gas exchange rates, except for higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area for treated trees. Any reduction in xylem water flow caused by stem bending appeared to be offset by decreased transpirational demand due to branch pruning. A trend of greater numbers of beetles trapped near stressed trees was observed in the study, but the increase was statistically significant only for one period. Overall, the number of beetles trapped was not large and there was no evidence of successful beetle attack on any tree. Loblolly pine trees subjected to treatment similar to that received from acute wind stress were not dramatically impaired physiologically under the conditions in this study and were not immediately prone to bark beetle attack, especially where crown loss was not severe.","CLEMSON UNIV,BELLE W BARUCH FOREST SCI INST,GEORGETOWN,SC 29442",,,,,,,,52,7,7,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Measurement of tensile strength loss in cotton strips was used as an assay to remove substrate quality effects. Generally, tensile strength loss was more rapid in swales than dunes, and was faster in the summer followed by fall and winter/spring respectively. Even though environmental gradients existed across the chronosequence (nitrogen availability and water levels), there were no consistent, significant trends in decomposition rates across the chronosequence. During the winter/spring, decay rates decreased with increasing soil depth in the dunes. The inverse was observed in the swales. During the summer, these patterns reversed. In the summer, desiccation of the upper soil layer on the dunes apparently inhibits decomposition, while lower depths are more moist. At the same time in the swales, the upper soil layer is moist but not saturated like the deeper levels. Temperature, hydrology and nitrogen availability appear to be the predominant factors regulating belowground decomposition on the Virginia coastal barrier islands. A major limitation of the method was revealed by the comparison of dunes and swales, where strikingly different environmental conditions produce very different results with pure cellulose compared to roots.

Clover seeds were planted in sand and inoculated either with a single plasmid-cured derivative of strain W14-2 or with a mixture of the derivative and the wild-type. Changes in population size of the genotypes in the rhizosphere were monitored by plate counts on selective media. Derivatives cured of single plasmids achieved population numbers similar to those of the wild-type when inoculated alone. When co-inoculated with the wild-type, they did not achieve as high population numbers as the wild-type. Curing of plasmid a resulted in a population one-tenth that of the wild-type. Derivatives containing plasmids b or c achieved population numbers similar to the wild-type when inoculated singly although there was a prolonged period before growth began.

The number of species per hectare ranged from 61 to 84 (> 5.0 cm dbh) and 50-71 (>10.0 cm dbh). The total number of trees per hectare varied two-fold between study plots, with 45-50% of the trees within the 5-10 cm size-class. Mean total basal area varied from 32.39-34.63 m2 per 100 m2. The four most dominant plant families represented 43.8% of the total number of trees, while representing only 11.2% of the species. No one plant family dominated in more than one of the four study plots, and all four plots held at least one plant family with more than 20% of the total number of trees. Although 14 tree species were common to all four plots, only 26%-35% of the species were represented by a single tree. Between three and seven species represented 50% of the trees within all size-classes, with species dominance occurring within the highest density plot. These tropical forest types of central Guyana may represent some of the lowest diversity forests in the neotropics, whereby the total number of tree species is relatively limited, typically with six dominant canopy species, but the relative abundance of these species is highly variable between the forest types.

In addition, we performed multiple regression, principal components analysis, and canonical correspondense analysis to identify those factors important in defining patch structure and to investigate their ability to predict the current vegetative structure. We found that total daily photosynthetic photon flux density was 50 times greater in the landslide compared to the surrounding forest, but similar between landslides. The red:far red ratio was homogenous in the open areas of the landslides, but in areas covered by vegetation it was similar to those ratios found in the forest border. The soil had average extractable phosphorus of 0.108 g/m(2) to 9 cm depth. Nitrogen was .10 percent of average soil mass, carbon was 1.83 percent of average soil mass, and there was a 69 percent average moisture content. Seed rain averaged 31 seeds per trap with the seed pool showing an average of two seedlings per sample. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi covered 7 percent of the average length of roots sampled, and the vegetation (dominated by species Cyathea arborea, Cecropia schreberiana, Miconia spp., and Nepsera acuatica) had two structural levels on average. For these factors, the strongest gradient was from the forest into the landslides from the side rather than from she top of the landslide to the bottom or between landslides. Evidence of distinct patches was found where patch structure was defined by levels of light, seed pool, fungi, vegetation, soil N, and soil C.

The stem diameter was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) increased and both total biomass and woody stem biomass also showed higher values (38% and 31% increases respectively) in elevated CO2. Trees in elevated CO2 had more leaves and a greater total leaf area, whilst the specific leaf area was decreased in elevated CO2 on four out of five occasions and was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) lower after 68 days, an effect indicating that leaves were thicker and/or heavier. Rates of photosynthesis (A) measured after 49 and 67 days of exposure revealed that trees in the elevated CO2 treatment had lower values of A when measured at either 350 or 580 mu l 1(-1) CO2. Sequential harvests at intervals during the study in which the root and shoot components were analysed separately allowed the construction of root:shoot ratios and allometric coefficients; there was no significant effect on the allometric coefficient and the root:shoot ratio was significantly increased on only one occasion. However, measurements of the 'apparent' root length suggested that root lengths were greater in the CO2 treatment. There was a significant increase in the number of fine root tips visible down the surface of specially designed rooting tubes (P less than or equal to 0.05), indicating more fine roots or an increase in fine root branching. The growth rates of individual fine or large roots over 24 h were unaffected, again suggesting that increases in biomass may be due to more root segments rather than longer individual roots. Root water relations were also examined and showed a tendency towards solute accumulation and increases in turgor pressure (P) and effective tugor (P-e) at times when root growth was stimulated, although these were not consistent. Cell wall plasticity of the tips of large roots was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) reduced in elevated CO2, possibly indicating a greater tendency to divert resources to the formation of root branches. The results of the study are discussed in the light of the possible consequences of changes in poplar growth and physiology for forestry practice in an increased CO2 environment.","HORT RES INT, LITTLEHAMPTON BN17 6LP, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","BOSAC, C (reprint author), UNIV SUSSEX, SCH BIOL SCI, BRIGHTON BN1 9QG, E SUSSEX, ENGLAND.",,,"Taylor, Gail/0000-0001-8470-6390",,,,53,35,35,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

The fungicide benomyl was applied to a lichen-rich plant community growing on a sandy soil in Suffolk, UK, once a month from November to May for 3 years. Benomyl application eliminated the lichen Cladonia rangiformis from the community and resulted in a large increase in the cover of the moss Ceratodon pulpureus. There were also changes in the frequencies of several higher plant species in response to benomyl application. 2. There were significant reductions in mycorrhizal colonization following fungicide application in Crepis capillaris and Erodium cicutarium, which were reduced in abundance by benomyl application, whereas the non-mycorrhizal Arenaria serpyllifolia and Rumex acetosella increased in abundance in fungicide-treated plots. Changes in the frequencies of mycorrhizal higher plant species were negatively correlated with reductions in mycorrhizal colonization of their root systems. There was also a 22% increase in plant species density m(-2) in plots treated with benomyl. 3. Ordination analyses showed that 60% of the variation in the vegetation data set could be accounted for by Carer arenaria, Cladonia rangiformis and R. acetosella on the first component axis, and by Ceratodon purpureus, Hypnum cupressiforme var. lacunosum and Cerastium fontanum on the second axis, and demonstrated that the two sets of plots were vegetationally distinct. 4. The results show that two groups of symbiotic fungi are important regulators of plant community structure: the lichen C. rangiformis was a keystone organism in the community studied and appeared to be able to suppress the moss C. purpureus, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi appeared to play a significant role in determining the interspecific competitive abilities of higher plant species.","UNIV YORK,DEPT BIOL,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND; UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND; UNIV LANCASTER,DIV BIOL SCI,LANCASTER LA1 4YQ,ENGLAND",,,"Newsham, Kevin/C-4192-2011; Watkinson, Andrew/N-1649-2013",,,,,44,36,39,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The model is used to interpret results of experiments on nitrogen saturation and reversibility of nitrogen saturation conducted within a gradient of N-deposition in Europe. Observed and simulated nitrate concentrations in the soil solution both responded quickly to reduced input in an experiment, with N-input in throughfall excluded. Foliar N-concentrations decreased more slowly, and were observed to be unchanged over a 2-year period. Due to isotope fractionation processes delta(15)N values of ecosystem compartments are predicted to increase for systems approaching N-saturation, due to output of nitrate and denitrification products being relatively is depleted in N. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed a strong influence of the microbial substrate-use efficiency for organic carbon on input/output budgets of N. Factors causing an increase of primary production such as increasing CO2 concentration are predicted to result in decreased nitrate concentrations. The model has hitherto been calibrated with conventional N-14 data.

A simple whole tree model for fir is used as a basis to assess changes. A detailed crown analysis was carried out on old crowns. the yearly height growth increment traced back morphologically and the branching of the S-1-axes were investigated. Further, the age of the needles on various branches of crowns differing in the degree of damage were determined. Using longitudinal sections of the crown, information could be gained about the distribution and contribution of regular and proventitious branches and needles within the crown. Firs are able to develop secondary crowns, which must be divided into those with light-adapted or shade-adapted crowns.

Data are presented from 15 soils (sites) located in eight states in the North Central United States. Based on the thickness of topsoil, two to three levels of prior erosion were identified at-each location. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for bulk density, water retention, particle size analysis, and hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Rooting depth for each soil was also determined from field observations. Soil erasion primarily affected the physical properties of the Ap horizon. Clay content of the Ap horizon increased with increasing erosion. In most cases, bulk density increased slightly and hydraulic conductivity of saturated sail decreased. Changes in water content at given tensions were mixed with increases in some cases and decreases in others with erosion.","IOWA STATE UNIV SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT AGRON,AMES,IA 50011; S DAKOTA STATE UNIV,DEPT PLANT SCI,BROOKINGS,SD 57007; UNIV NEBRASKA,DEPT AGRON,LINCOLN,NE 68583","LOWERY, B (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT SOIL SCI,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,14,44,68,0,14,SOIL WATER CONSERVATION SOC,ANKENY,"7515 N E ANKENY RD, ANKENY, IA 50021-9764",0022-4561,,,J SOIL WATER CONSERV,J.

Root densities of each species were described in situ by counting roots in the trench surrounding the dry plot. Soil water contents and potentials, and pre-dawn leaf water potentials (Psi(wp)) were monitored during three successive years. Soil water retention characteristics were obtained from field measurements of water potential and water content. The decreasing rooting density with depth was strongly related to soil physical properties. The root system was separated into two compartments by a layer with a high clay content. The deepest soil compartment was mainly explored by fine roots. Neutron probe measurements allowed the detection of variations in water content down to a depth of 2.00 m. The distribution of water uptake among the different soil layers changed when drought increased. Water was extracted from the deepest reservoir, and capillary rises even occurred after partial water depletion in the upper part of the soil. Seasonal trends of pre-dawn leaf water potential generally matched those of soil water potential in the wettest rooted zone, which was at - 140 cm. In the upper, dry, horizons, the sharp loss of soil hydraulic conductivity reduced water transport to roots leading to impossible equilibrium between roots and soil at pre-dawn. Finally, Psi(wp) presented a low sensitivity to variations of total soil water content between 40% and 100% of extractable water. Below this threshold, Psi(pw) decreased sharply to a minimal value of about -2.0 MPa.","INRA,UR ECOPHYSIOL FORESTIERE,EQUIPE BIOCLIMATOL & ECOPHYSIOL FORESTIERES,F-54280 SEICHAMPS,FRANCE; LAB ENERGET & MECAN THEOR & APPL,URA 875,F-54516 VANDOEUVRE NANCY,FRANCE",,,,,,,,34,117,125,5,95,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,1995,172,1,,,,,17,27,,10.1007/BF00020856,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RC928,WOS:A1995RC92800002,,,,,10/31/19J,"HAYNES, BE; GOWER, ST",,,,"HAYNES, BE; GOWER, ST",,,BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION IN UNFERTILIZED AND FERTILIZED RED PINE PLANTATIONS IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,CARBON BALANCE; FERTILIZATION; LITTERFALL; PINUS RESINOSA; ROOT PRODUCTION; SOIL RESPIRATION; TRENCHED PLOTS,FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; SOIL CO2 EVOLUTION; DOUGLAS-FIR STANDS; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; ORGANIC-MATTER; RESPIRATION; BIOMASS; TURNOVER; NITROGEN; SITES,"We estimated carbon allocation to belowground processes in unfertilized and fertilized red pine (Pinus resinosa Air.) plantations in northern Wisconsin to determine how soil fertility affects belowground allocation patterns.

I examined spatial distribution of California red-backed voles (Clethrionomys californicus) on 13 forest remnants and five control sites in southwestern Oregon. The species was virtually isolated on remnants, making little use of the regenerating clearcuts surrounding the remnants. The effects of the clearcut also impinged on the remnants as edge effects: six times more voles were captured per trap in the interior of remnants than on the edge. Consequently, the density of voles per unit area on remnants increased with remnant size, despite the potential buildup of population density in small isolates due to limited emigration. I explored potential mechanisms of the negative edge effect on voles and found that the biomass of coarse woody debris, per se, did not explain the vole distribution because both number and volume of logs increased from the interior to the edge of remnants. However, the distribution of the vole's primary food item, hypogeous sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi, did correspond to the vole edge effect.","UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,DEPT BIOL,SANTA CRUZ,CA 95064",,,"Mills, L.

Scop., Festuca ovina L., Pilosella officinarum F. Shultz & Shultz-Bip and Lotus corniculatus L. In a chronic fumigation (mean O-3 concentration of 71 ppb (71 nl l(-1)) for 7 h d(-1), AOT40 4585 ppb-h) which lasted for 21 d, the effects of ozone were assessed using classical growth analysis. Large reductions in mean relative growth rates for shoot and root weight and root length were observed for the two legumes (Fabaceae) Lotus corniculatus and Anthyllis vulneraria, although these were only statistically significant for Lotus corniculatus. Significant reductions in specific root length (length per unit dry weight) were found for Cirsium acaule and Pilosella officinarum (Asteraceae), while for Festuca ovina (Poaceae) the allometric coefficient was reduced significantly following exposure to ozone. An acute fumigation (mean O-3 concentration of 196 ppb, 7 h) resulted in a range of visible injury, from no injury (Festuca ovina and Pilosella officinarum) through moderate levels of injury (Cirsium acaule and Lotus corniculatus) to extensive and widespread injury (Anthyllis vulneraria). Scoring of visible damage showed that this was only statistically significant for the two legumes, Lotus corniculatus and Anthyllis vulneraria. These results suggest that native herbs may differ in their sensitivity to tropospheric ozone. Both chronic and acute exposures revealed that members of the Fabaceae may be most sensitive to ozone pollution, but the study also suggests that subtle changes in root morphology occurred for members of the Asteraceae. These findings are discussed in relation to the critical levels of ozone set recently for plants and the implications of increasing tropospheric ozone for the conservation of native plant communities.","UNIV SUSSEX,SCH BIOL SCI,BRIGHTON BN1 9QG,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND",,,"Taylor, Gail/C-6030-2013","Taylor, Gail/0000-0001-8470-6390",,,,35,32,33,0,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

This suggests that, in screening experiments where acid soil tolerant rhizobia are not available, inorganic nitrogen should be supplied in determining the species' intrinsic ability to tolerate soil acidity and to avoid confounding sensitivity to acid soil with ineffectiveness of Rhizobium/Bradyrhizobium. The second experiment enabled us to rank 36 species into 4 classes of differing tolerance to acid soil. This experiment also indicated that the ranking order of species differed with the soil type, suggesting the need to use more than one soil type in screening experiments in order to obtain a better and more reliable ranking of species for tolerance to acid soil.","CSIRO FORESTRY,BRISBANE,QLD 4067,AUSTRALIA; UNIV QUEENSLAND,DEPT AGR,BRISBANE,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA; CSIRO FORESTRY,CANBERRA,ACT 2600,AUSTRALIA",,,,"Ashwath, Nanjappa/0000-0002-4032-4507",,,,2,7,7,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,1995,171,1,,,,,83,87,,10.1007/BF00009569,,,5,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RE056,WOS:A1995RE05600012,,,,,10/31/19J,"STASS, A; HORST, WJ",,,,"STASS, A; HORST, WJ",,,EFFECT OF ALUMINUM ON MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES OF SOYBEAN (GLYCINE-MAX) CELLS IN SUSPENSION-CULTURE,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,3rd International Symposium on Plant-Soil Interactions at Low pH,"SEP 12-16, 1993","BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA",,,CALLOSE; PERMEABILITY; PH TOXICITY,LIPID-PEROXIDATION; CALLOSE SYNTHESIS; QUERCUS-RUBRA; ROOT-TIPS; PHYTOTOXICITY; PERMEABILITY; AL-3+,"Short-term responses of soybean (Glycine max) cells to aluminium (Al) were studied in suspension culture.

Contribution of internal Ca2+ stores to maintaining cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration at physiological levels is considered to be insufficient in meristematic cells at the root tip. It is suggested that differential blockage of Ca2+ channels may be at the core of differential tolerance to Al, opening up the possibility of manipulating Al tolerance at the molecular level.","UNIV ADELAIDE,DEPT BOT,ADELAIDE,SA 5005,AUSTRALIA; UNIV CAMBRIDGE,DEPT PLANT SCI,CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA,ENGLAND","RENGEL, Z (reprint author), UNIV ADELAIDE,WAITE AGR RES INST,DEPT PLANT SCI,GLEN OSMOND,SA 5064,AUSTRALIA.",,"Tester, Mark/J-2368-2017; Rengel, Zed (Zdenko)/A-2496-2008","Tester, Mark/0000-0002-5085-8801; Pineros, Miguel/0000-0002-7166-1848",,,,36,21,21,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,1995,171,1,,,,,125,130,,10.1007/BF00009574,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,RE056,WOS:A1995RE05600017,,,,,10/31/19J,"YOKOTA, S; OJIMA, K",,,,"YOKOTA, S; OJIMA, K",,,PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSE OF ROOT-TIP OF ALFALFA TO LOW PH AND ALUMINUM STRESS IN WATER CULTURE,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,3rd International Symposium on Plant-Soil Interactions at Low pH,"SEP 12-16, 1993","BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA",,,ALFALFA; ALUMINUM; LOW PH; VIABILITY,,"In acid volcanic soils, plant roots are thought to be injured by acidity (low pH) and/or solubilized aluminium (Al) ions.

We discuss the molecular genetics of the two most studied inositol rhizopines from R. meliloti and describe the coordinated regulation of rhizopine biosynthesis and nitrogen fixation.

Tilia cordata and Fagus sylvatica had their optima for most growth parameters at 20 degrees C. The root temperature apparently indirectly influenced photosynthesis (dry weight accumulation) and respiration loss. From the observed symptoms and indications in the literature it seems probable that a change in hormone levels is involved as the main factor in the described effects.

I assessed relative understory suppression and intensity of root competition in year-old stands of Cordia alliodora, Hyeronima alchorneoides, and Cedrela odorata by measuring the growth of seedlings of the pioneer tree Piper auritum and cuttings of the shade-tolerant shrub P. phtolaccaefolium that were planted into trenched and untrenched sites under the trees. After 5 mo, growth of P. auritum was significantly less under Cordia and Hyeronima than under Cedrela or in the open. The most severe growth reductions occurred under Hyeronima, the species with the highest leaf area index (LAI). Lack of a significant trenching response under Hyeronima suggests the competitive effects of this species were largely the result of shading, In contrast, the competitive effects of Cordia, a species with relatively high fine root density and open canopy, were almost entirely below ground. Nonetheless, the effects of Cordia and Hyeronima on the growth of P. auritum seedlings were equivalent when compared on a per-unit of tree canopy LAI basis. Lack of P. auritum growth suppression under Cedrela is likely the result of the open canopies and relatively low fine root densities of the Cedrela stands. In contrast to the growth of P. auritum, P. phytolaccaefolium growth did not differ among tree overstories.

Compared with small adults, juveniles have greater allocations to foliage and fine-root biomass, higher rates of CO2 assimilation, leaf conductance, and transpiration, and lower investments of biomass and nitrogen per unit of foliar area. Juvenile foliage is less costly to produce than adult foliage. The suite of physiological processes associated with juvenile awl-like foliage should enhance establishment and early growth of J. occidentalis. However, high rates of water loss, which are associated with high rates of CO2 assimilation of juvenile foliage, appear to be a liability for large trees in the semiarid environment of eastern Oregon.

Morphological changes at the needle level included decreased mesophyll to vascular tissue ratio and variations in starch storage in chloroplasts. The elevated CO2 increased internal CO2 concentrations and assimilation of carbon.

These results indicate that the sink-source relationships of these trees have shifted carbon allocation toward above ground growth, possibly due to transport limitations.","LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATL LAB, LIVERMORE, CA 94550 USA; US FOREST SERV, FOREST SERV LAB, RHINELANDER, WI 54501 USA","Pushnik, JC (reprint author), CALIF STATE UNIV LOS ANGELES, DEPT BIOL SCI, CHICO, CA 95929 USA.",,,,,,,24,18,18,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

The trees were grown in native soil in open-top field-exposure chambers at PlacerviUe, CA and exposed to ambient (similar to 350 mu mol mol(-1)) air or ambient air plus either 175 or 350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and three levels of nitrogen addition (0, 100 and 200 kg ha(-1)); however, the 100 kg ha(-1) N treatment at ambient plus 175 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 treatment was omitted from the experimental design. Roots were classified as new, white, brown, decaying or missing and their lengths and diameters measured. The occurrence of mycorrhizae and fungal hyphae was also recorded. The majority (>90%) of roots observed were smaller than 2 mm and the mean diameter decreased during the study. None of the root parameters measured showed a significant response to elevated CO2. The elevated CO2 treatments consistently showed an increase in root area density averaging 50% larger compared to ambient CO2, but this response was not statistically significant due to the high spatial variability of root distribution. Only new root area density showed a significant nitrogen response. The most new roots were initiated between April and June and the highest level of root loss occurred between June and August. The occurrence of mycorrhizae and fungal hyphae increased in response to CO2 treatment but not the nitrogen. Their highest levels of occurrence were during August and October 93.","MANTECH ENVIRONM TECHNOL INC, CORVALLIS, OR 97333 USA","Tingey, DT (reprint author), US EPA, ENVIRONM RES LAB, 200 SW 35TH ST, CORVALLIS, OR 97333 USA.",,"Phillips, Donald/D-5270-2011",,,,,35,29,31,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

For instance, coniferous forests of northern latitudes may have more than 1000 species of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi where only a few ectomycorrhizal plant species dominate, but there are fewer than 25 species of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in tropical deciduous forest in Mexico with 1000 plant species. AM and EM fungi are distributed according to biome, with AM fungi predominant in arid and semiarid biomes, and EM fungi predominant in mesic biomes. In addition, AM fungi tend to be more abundant in soils of low organic matter, perhaps explaining their predominance in moist tropical forest, and EM fungi generally occur in sails with higher surface organic matter. EM fungi are relatively selective of host plant species, while AM tend to be generalists. Similar morphotypes of AM fungi collected from different sites confer different physiological benefits to the same plant species. While the EM fungi have taxonomic diversity, the AM fungi must have physiological diversity for individual species to be so widespread, as supported by existing studies. The environmental adaptations of mycorrhizal fungi are often thought to be determined by their host plant, but we suggest that the physiology and genetics of the fungi themselves, along with their responses to the plant and the environment, regulates their diversity. We observed that one AM plant species, Artemisia tridentata, was associated with different fungal species across its range, indicating that the fungi can respond to the environment directly and must not do so indirectly via the host. Different species of fungi were also active during different times of the growing season on the same host, again suggesting a direct response to the environment. These patterns suggest that even within a single ''functional group'' of microorganisms, mycorrhizal fungi, considerable diversity exists. A number of researchers have expressed the concept of functional redundancy within functional groups of microorganisms, implying that the loss of a few species would not be detectable in ecosystem functioning. However, there may be high functional diversity of AM fungi within and across habitats, and high species diversity as well for EM fungi. If one species of mycorrhizal fungus becomes extinct in a habitat, field experimental data on AM fungi suggest there may be significant shifts in how plants acquire resources and grow in that habitat.","SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SAN DIEGO,CA 92182; UNIV ALASKA,AGR & FORESTRY RES STN,PALMER,AK 99645; OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT FOREST SCI,CORVALLIS,OR 97331; US FOREST SERV,FORESTRY SCI LAB,CORVALLIS,OR 97331; NATL AUTONOMOUS UNIV MEXICO,CTR ECOL,MEXICO CITY 04510,DF,MEXICO","ALLEN, EB (reprint author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT BOT & PLANT SCI,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521, USA.",,,,,,,78,226,249,4,122,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,1995,170,1,,,,,47,62,,10.1007/BF02183054,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,QV546,WOS:A1995QV54600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"MEHARG, AA; KILLHAM, K",,,,"MEHARG, AA; KILLHAM, K",,,LOSS OF EXUDATES FROM THE ROOTS OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS INOCULATED WITH A RANGE OF MICROORGANISMS,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,CARBON FLOW; LOLIUM PERENNE L; RHIZOSPHERE; ROOT EXUDATION,BACTERIA; PLANTS; CARBON; GROWTH,"To determine the effect of microbial metabolites on the release of root exudates from perennial ryegrass, seedlings were pulse labelled with [C-14]-CO2 in the presence of a range of soil micro-organisms, Microbial inoculants were spatially separated from roots by Millipore membranes so that root infection did not occur.

Ozone was supplied either from 1900 until 0700 h (nighttime regime), from 0700 until 1900 h (daylight regime), or all day (24-h regime). By autumn, reductions in whole-plant biomass production, root/shoot biomass and stem weight/length ratios were evident in all three O-3 regimes. The reductions in cuttings receiving the 24-h O-3 treatment were about twofold larger than in cuttings receiving the daylight O-3 treatment. Stomata were open at night, and stomatal conductance was about 50% of its maximum daytime value. We calculated that the rate of O-3 uptake into leaves in the dark approached 4 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Whole-plant production and carbon allocation were more sensitive to O-3 during the night than during the day; however, O-3 exposure caused similar visible leaf injury in both of the 12-h regimes, although the leaves exposed to O-3 at night exhibited delayed O-3-induced shedding. Overall, changes in production and carbon allocation were determined by the external O-3 dose rather than by the kind of O-3 exposure, indicating that, at the seasonal scale, the internal dose of ozone that was physiologically effective was a constant fraction of the external O-3 dose. We conclude that nighttime O-3 exposures should be included in the daily time period for determining critical concentrations of O-3 causing injury in trees.","SWISS FED INST FOREST SNOW & LANDSCAPE RES,CH-8903 BIRMENSDORF,SWITZERLAND",,,"Gunthardt-Goerg, Madeleine/L-6461-2013",,,,,46,110,116,2,17,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,1995,15,3,,,,,159,165,,10.1093/treephys/15.3.159,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,QN600,WOS:A1995QN60000003,14965971,,,,10/31/19J,"MUNZENBERGER, B; KOTTKE, I; OBERWINKLER, F",,,,"MUNZENBERGER, B; KOTTKE, I; OBERWINKLER, F",,,REDUCTION OF PHENOLICS IN MYCORRHIZAS OF LARIX-DECIDUA MILL,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS; CATECHIN; EPICATECHIN; FERULIC ACID; FLAVONOIDS; LACCARIA AMETHYSTEA; LARCH; MYCORRHIZA; P-HYDROXYBENZOYLGLUCOSE; P-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID GLUCOSIDE; PICEIN,CELL-WALLS; RESPONSES; ROOTS,"Soluble and cell-wall-bound phenolics in mycorrhizas of Larix decidua-laccaria amethystea and in nonmycorrhizal fine roots of larch grown in sterile culture were analyzed by HPLC.

Karst.) from different layers in the upper 3 dm of podzolized forest soil. To improve the resolution of the tracer technique, a pair of tracers was employed. One tracer was the naturally occurring vertical gradient in the oxygen isotope ratio, delta(18)O, of soil solution. The second tracer was a H-3 solution placed in the mor layer. A three-component mixing model of water uptake was used to simulate the content of these two tracers in the xylem sap. Each component in the mixing model represented a horizontal layer of soil with a characteristic composition of delta(18)O and H-3. Two stands were investigated. In both stands, the volume-weighted water uptake by Scots pine occurred at a depth of 8-17 cm in the upper B horizon. This was below the concentration of fine roots in the mor layer and the upper few centimeters of mineral soil. In one of the two study stands, Norway spruce was present. It had mean uptake depths ranging from within the mor layer to 5 cm below the mor-mineral soil contact. An uncertainty in the water uptake depth for each tree of +/-1-2 cm was estimated from a Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainties in the model inputs. In addition to these specific results, the study demonstrated that isotopic tracers provide a simple and effective method for determining the vertical distribution of water uptake.","INRA, CTR RECH FORESTIERES NANCY, F-54280 CHAMPENOUX, FRANCE","BISHOP, K (reprint author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, FAC FORESTRY, DEPT FOREST ECOL, S-90183 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Bishop, Kevin H/C-7816-2012","Bishop, Kevin H/0000-0002-8057-1051",,,,38,38,38,0,18,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The studies in our survey report that at the tissue level, elevated CO2 reduces leaf nitrogen concentration an average 21%, but that it has a smaller effect on nitrogen concentrations in stems and fine roots. In contrast, higher soil nitrogen availability generally increases leaf nitrogen concentration. Among studies that manipulate both soil nitrogen availability and atmospheric CO2, photosynthetic response depends on a linear relationship with the response of leaf nitrogen concentration and the amount of change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Although elevated CO2 often results in reduced tissue respiration rate per unit biomass, the link to changes in tissue nitrogen concentration is not well studied.","US FOREST SERV, ROCKY MT FOREST & RANGE EXPT STN, FT COLLINS, CO 80526 USA","MCGUIRE, AD (reprint author), MARINE BIOL LAB, CTR ECOSYST, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,136,145,155,1,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4162,,,ANNU REV ECOL SYST,Annu.

Root growth dynamics of Artemisia halodendron and Caragana microphylla were measured using minirhizotrons. An alternative estimate of fine-root production was made based on root growth measurements from minirhizotrons and biomass estimates from soil cores. During the dry growing season of 1989, root biomass increased significantly. However, during the wet growing seasons of 1990 and 1991, no significant changes in root biomass were found. On the other hand the minirhizotron method revealed that root numbers changed rapidly and significantly during both wet years. Current-year root biomass in the mesh bags reached a maximum of 56 g m(-2). Estimates of annual fine-root production to 35-cm depth varied between zero and similar to 250 g m(-2), depending on the method used.

The chemical methods used were N mineral (NO3- + NH4+) analyses on soil samples taken in late winter, and extraction with 0.01 M CaCl2 from soil samples taken the preceding autumn and in late winter. The results of the chemical methods were evaluated in models using estimated optimum nitrogen fertilization, nitrogen present in beets or beets+leaves at leaf maximum and sugar yield as variables. In addition, parameters such as estimates of possible rooting depth and mineralization capacity of the soil were also included in the model. All models for estimating nitrogen fertilization need showed low R(2) values. The two methods of soil chemical analysis yielded similar R(2) values for nitrogen uptake in plots both with and without nitrogen fertilization. The N mineral method was least useful in predicting sugar yield. Addition of the covariables rooting depth and mineralization capacity appreciably improved the explanatory value of the models with 0.01 M CaCl2, especially when the analytical results of soil samples taken in autumn were used. For the N mineral method the addition of covariates was found to have far less influence.","SUGAR BEET RES INST,4600 AA BERGEN,NORWAY; AGR UNIV WAGENINGEN,DEPT MATH,6700 EB WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS","HOUBA, VJG (reprint author), WAGENINGEN UNIV AGR,DEPT SOIL SCI & PLANT NUTR,POB 8005,6700 EC WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,14,18,18,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The investigation of below-ground tree biomass and its length was done by means of destructive analysis of sample trees. The total below-ground biomass of the main forest stand represents 65.7 t.ha(-1) in term of dry weight. The greatest portion of this biomass is occupied by stumps (31 %) and thick roots with diameter above 10 cm (39 %). One third of the overall below-ground biomass falls to other diameter classes. From the view of stability and physiology fine roots included in the first diameter fraction play important role - their amount is 1.3 t.ha(-1). The length of the roots decreases with the raising diameter. The most substantial root length occurred in the first diameter class (O < 0.5 cm) - 538 km.ha(-1) and represented 88 % of all spruce ecosystem root length.

However, observation of flocculation patterns show that even when the curves are identical, there is a difference in the way P is adsorbed in the presence of tartrate and citrate in terms of the type of site that is attacked. Assessment of phosphate - citrate competition using P-32 and C-14 showed that citrate is less readily adsorbed by ferric hydroxide than tartrate and that citrate dissolves adsorption sites more readily than tartrate. The implications of this study are that root exudates containing a greater amount of tartrate would cause more efficient use of added P by plants since tartrate occupies the high affinity sites and therefore reduces phosphate fixation.

Pot-culture isolation procedures were used to supplement spore occurrence data in this survey and provided much additional information about VAM fungi. Results showed that spores of VAM fungi were absent from locations in mine sites without vegetation, but were more abundant in other mine site habitats with dense vegetation cover than in undisturbed plant communities in the region. The diversity of Glomalean fungi was lower in disturbed sites than in natural habitats. The capacity of propagules pf VAM and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to form associations in soils from the same disturbed and undisturbed habitats were examined. Propagules of VAM fungi were detected in all sites, but were rare in disturbed areas with sparse plant cover, and occurred in exceptionally high numbers in soil from a rainforest site and some fully vegetated mine site habitats. Fungi capable of forming ECM associations with Eucalyptus seedlings were only absent from disturbed areas and wetland sites where suitable hosts did not occur. in disturbed habitats. the probability of seedlings encountering VAM or ECM inoculum increased with the cover of suitable hosts.

In culture experiments, mycorrhizal fungi were found to be able to destroy the vegetative mycelia of pathogens and inhibited the formation and germination of their conidia, sporangia or sclerotia. When the mechanisms of antagonism were examined, it seemed that mycorrhizal fungi could secrete non-volatile substances which caused the contraction and lysis of the protoplasm of pathogens such as A. tumefaciens even after high temperature treatment (60 degrees C for 30 min.).

After 35 days of growth, CO2 had no effect on the relative growth rate, total biomass or partitioning of biomass in the C-4 species. However, the C-3 species had greater biomass accumulation with increasing CO2 partial pressure. C-3 plants grown in 15 Pa CO2 for 35 days had only 8% of the total biomass of plants grown in 35 Pa CO2. In 15 Pa CO2, C-3 plants had lower relative growth rates and lower specific leaf mass than plants grown in higher CO2 partial pressures, and aborted reproduction. C-3 plants grown in 70 Pa CO2 had greater root mass and root-to-shoot ratios than plants grown in lower CO2 partial pressures. These findings support other studies that show C-3 plant growth is more responsive to CO2 partial pressure than C-4 plant growth. Differences in growth responses to CO2 levels of the Pleistocene through the future suggest that competitive interactions of C-3 and C-4 annuals have changed through geologic time. This study also provided evidence that C-3 annuals may be operating near a minimum CO2 partial pressure for growth and reproduction at 15 Pa CO2.",,"DIPPERY, JK (reprint author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT BOT,DURHAM,NC 27708, USA.",,"Tissue, David T/N-1710-2019; Tissue, David/AAA-8829-2019","Tissue, David/0000-0002-8497-2047",,,,37,93,98,20,148,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1995,101,1,,,,,13,20,,10.1007/BF00328894,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QE054,WOS:A1995QE05400002,28306970,,,,10/31/19J,"LOHMUS, K; IVASK, M",,,,"LOHMUS, K; IVASK, M",,,DECOMPOSITION AND NITROGEN DYNAMICS OF FINE ROOTS OF NORWAY SPRUCE (PICEA-ABIES (L) KARST) AT DIFFERENT SITES,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Nutrient Uptake and Cycling in Forest Ecosystems,"JUN 07-10, 1993","HALMSTAD, SWEDEN","COMMISS EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, DG XII",,DECOMPOSITION; ENERGY CONTENT; FINE ROOTS; FINEST ROOTS; NITROGEN CONTENT; NORWAY SPRUCE,NEEDLE; LITTER,"Long-term decomposition and nitrogen dynamics of Norway spruce finest (<1 mm in diameter) and fine (<2 mm in diameter) roots were estimated using the root fitter-bag techniques.

In all initial and decomposing root samples oven-dry weight, ash and energy content and nitrogen concentration was determined. After five years the finest roots had lost 40% of their initial dry weight, half of it during the first year. The initial concentration of nitrogen was 1.29%, the mean concentrations varied during the incubation from 1.47 to 1.78%.

Root data also included in the study were obtained by excavating whole trees and soil coring. The data suggest a fairly deep distribution pattern of fine roots (< 1 mm in diameter) in the study area compared with other forest sites in SW Sweden.

Drought seemed to result in a redistribution of fine roots to deeper mineral soil horizons. Ammonium sulphate application led to the reverse, viz, a concentration of fine roots to the LFH-horizon. A significantly smaller fine-root necromass was indicated in the LFH-horizon of the control areas compared with both the D and NS-treatment areas, suggesting a high mortality of fine roots in these areas.

Individual spores or root pieces were incubated on small pieces of membrane filter that were in contact with the soil-solution of steam-sterilized sand, and were observed daily to follow the course of germination events. This procedure could be used to provide samples of germinating spores or growing hyphae for biochemical or microscopy studies. The second technique uses single germinating spores produced as described above to initiate pot cultures. Most plants inoculated with a germinating spore with intact mycelium became mycorrhizal. Periodic harvests allowed the development of hyphae, mycorrhizas and spores from a single propagule to be examined.

Ehrh.) cuttings were observed as a result of differences in genotype and physiology of the stock plants. The uniformity in response among cuttings from micropropagated plants compared with cuttings from seed plants confirmed the advantage of using micropropagated plants to study environmental effects. Shoot morphology of the seed stock plants was influenced by both photoperiod and thermoperiod. A day/night temperature of 15/25 degrees C reduced stem elongation compared with a day/night temperature of 25/15 degrees C regardless of photoperiod, and a continuous light regime resulted in more shoots per plant in both temperature regimes than a 16-h photoperiod. A reduction in the supply of macronutrients did not influence shoot morphology, but increased rooting substantially and seemed to override the effects of environmental factors. In cuttings of seed plants, the highest rooting percentage and number of roots were obtained in a 16-h photoperiod with a day/night temperature of 15/25 degrees C. In micropropagated stock plants, there was a positive correlation between shoot length and number of leaves per shoot and topographical distribution of light within the plants, but there was no correlation between these parameters and rooting ability of the cuttings. A rooting temperature of 16 degrees C delayed the rate of root production compared with the rate at higher temperatures, but the final rooting percentage was the same over the range from 16 to 28 degrees C. Root branching increased with temperature. At all temperatures, there was a large increase in sucrose content at the base of the cuttings during rooting, whereas the concentration of nontranslocated sugars remained constant. The carbohydrate content al the base of cuttings from micropropagated stock plants was three times higher than at the base of cuttings from seed stock plants, but the higher carbohydrate content was not correlated with a higher rooting potential.",,"WELANDER, M (reprint author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT HORT,BOX 55,S-23053 ALNARP,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,42,10,10,0,0,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"BOX 5579 STATION B, VICTORIA BC V8R 6S4, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,1995,15,1,,,,,11,18,,10.1093/treephys/15.1.11,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,QG001,WOS:A1995QG00100002,14966006,,,,10/31/19J,"DEGENS, BP; SPARLING, GP; ABBOTT, LK",,,,"DEGENS, BP; SPARLING, GP; ABBOTT, LK",,,"THE CONTRIBUTION FROM HYPHAE, ROOTS AND ORGANIC-CARBON CONSTITUENTS TO THE AGGREGATION OF A SANDY LOAM UNDER LONG-TERM CLOVER-BASED AND GRASS PASTURES",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WATER-STABLE AGGREGATION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SOIL; STABILITY; MATTER,"Water-stable macro-aggregate size fractions (>2.0 mm, 1.0-2.0 mm, 0.5-1.0 mm and 0.25-0.5 mm) and non-aggregated soil from a sandy loam under long-term clover-based pasture and from grass pasture were analysed to determine the role of acid- and water-extractable carbohydrate C, total hyphal length, microbial biomass, organic C and total and mycorrhizal root length in stabilization of the aggregates. Aggregates were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the particle-size distribution of the size fractions was also determined. Macro-aggregation increased under grass, relative to clover-based pasture; however, the properties of the aggregate fractions measured did not reflect this difference. Microbial-biomass C, extractable-carbohydrate C, hyphal length, total and mycorrhizal root length and organic C content of the soils were poorly correlated with macro-aggregation. Within the aggregates, the proportion of 250-1000-mu m sand was smaller and clay, silt and fine sand (20-250 mu m) were greater relative to non-aggregated soil, suggesting that the >250-mu m sand in the non-aggregated soil limited the stabilization of macro-aggregates. Under SEM, no enmeshment of aggregates by hyphae and roots was apparent. Although 50-160 m hyphae g(-1) soil was found within the aggregates, calculations showed that an average only 5 to 13 lengths of hyphae were associated with each 250-mu m cube of soil within the aggregates, and suggested little potential to stabilize the aggregates by enmeshing.

The fine root systems of the two co-existing species overlapped completely with beech roots being twice as abundant as oak roots. Since Fagus and Quercus occupied equivalent parts of the canopy volume, oak appeared to be under-represented in the below-ground space. There was evidence for some degree of below-ground niche partitioning between the species in both the vertical and the horizontal direction. Oak fine roots were found to be more superficially distributed than beech roots in the organic layers, indicating a vertical stratification of the root systems of the two species. In the forest floor, fine roots were more abundant in the vicinity of oak stems where thicker organic layers occurred. However, this distribution pattern was not a consequence of a greater abundance of oak roots close to their parent stem, but was due to a higher frequency of beech roots here.","UNIV GOTTINGEN,LEHRSTUHL GEOBOT,D-37073 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY",,,,,,,,37,59,65,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

However, total plant biomass, shoot and root biomass and phosphorus inflows were unaffected in benomyl treated plants. The only direct effect of benomyl on the plants was to increase fecundity (seed number) at one site. 3 These null or positive effects of benomyl on plant performance may be explained by the deleterious effects of the fungicide on the abundance of other root-inhabiting fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum or Embellisia chlamydospora isolated from the roots of V. ciliata. 4 Whilst direct comparisons of plant performance with the abundance of root-inhabiting fungi showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi appeared to play a relatively insignificant role in the ecology of the plant, the abundance of root pathogenic fungi such as F. oxysporum, E. chlamydospora and a species of Phoma was found to be negatively correlated with plant fecundity, even though these fungi produced asymptomatic infections. 5 The poor relationship between plant fecundity and benomyl application contrasted markedly with the clear effects of benomyl on root pathogenic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and with the clear impact of the root pathogenic fungi on plant fecundity. The most likely explanation for this apparent paradox was that the two groups of fungi were in some way interactive, and that when both groups were reduced in abundance, the resultant effects on the plants were neutral. 6 A generalized linear model applied to the fecundity data appeared to indicate that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi interacted directly with the root pathogenic fungi, and improved fecundity by interfering with the negative effects of the pathogens. We concluded that asymptomatic root pathogenic fungi were important determinants of fitness in V. ciliata and that the main benefit supplied by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to the plant was apparently in protection from pathogenic attack, not in phosphorus uptake. The implications of the results for plant population dynamics are discussed.","UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND","NEWSHAM, KK (reprint author), UNIV YORK,DEPT BIOL,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.",,"Watkinson, Andrew/N-1649-2013; Newsham, Kevin/C-4192-2011",,,,,42,97,102,3,35,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

These AM fungi were tested for their tolerance to Cd and Zn added as salt solutions with increasing concentrations (0 to 10 mg L(-1)) in a simple spore germination device. According to preliminary identification the predominant species in S2 and F cultures was Glomus mosseae, whereas Cd40 and Cd0 cultures contained a mixture of at least G. mosseae and G. etunicatum. Germination of Cd40 spores was more tolerant to Cd and Zn than for Cd0 spores, with EC(50) values of 73 and 158 mu mol L(-1) added Cd and Zn corresponding to approximately 10 and 13 mu mol L(-1) remaining in solution in the device. The S2 spores from the sludge contaminated soil were more tolerant to Zn (EC(50) = 87 mu mol L(-1)), but not to Cd (EC(50) = 7.5 mu mol L(-1)), than the spores from the farmyard manure-treated F soil (EC(50) = 38 and 8.8 mu mol L(-1), respectively). Thus, S2 culture exhibited a specific tolerance to Zn, which was lower than the unspecific tolerance of Cd40 culture to both Cd and Zn, despite the much higher Zn availability in S2 soil.

Swelling in the main stem was used as an indicator of abnormal wood (i.e., ''rotholz'') production induced by infestation. At three of the four field sites, the main stems of infested seedlings were significantly more swollen than those of uninfested seedlings. The amount of swelling caused by BWA generally was not affected by seed source (half-sib family), soil source (soil from higher or lower elevations), or interactions of these variables. At two of four field sites, infestation was associated with a significant increase in root:shoot ratio. Variability in root:shoot ratios and total dry weights of seedlings was influenced by interactions of infestation, soil source, and seed source. This result demonstrates that both tree genetics and environment play a significant role in the growth responses of infested Fraser fir seedlings. Results from the greenhouse study indicated that BWA might be represented by two or more biotypes in the southern Appalachians. Shoot weights and diameter increases were relatively large for Mount Mitchell seedlings infested by BWA from Mount Rogers, and relatively small when infested by BWA from Mount Mitchell. For seedlings from Mount Rogers, the converse was true. Overall, these results suggest that environment is probably more important than tree or insect genetics in explaining why so many infested trees have died in the Black Mountains of North Carolina.","N CAROLINA STATE UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,RALEIGH,NC 27695",,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,0,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

It is suggested that the 'in situ' mineralization technique provides the best information, but it is labour intensive and time consuming. Among the simpler techniques, autoclave - N is expected to be quite sensitive to changes which would affect the character of the organic N. Among the plant-based indices of N status of stands, concentration of N in the fallen litter has shown more promising results than the concentration of N in the live foliage or roots. For P the following parameters were considered: concentration of P in the foliage, fine roots and leaf litter, plant bioassays (P-32 uptake by excised fine roots and phosphatase activity of fine roots), available and labile P content of soils obtained by using a number of methods, soil phosphatase activity, P mineralization in soils and microbial soil P. P content in the fine roots showed promising results, and the soil method using iron-impregnated filter paper merits special attention in future studies because of the simplicity with which it can be used under field conditions. Choice of the method for N and P will depend on the specific situations and the information required.",,"KHANNA, PK (reprint author), CSIRO,DIV FORESTRY,CANBERRA,ACT 2600,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,39,1,1,0,0,INTERCIENCIA,CARACAS,"APARTADO 51842, CARACAS 1050A, VENEZUELA",0378-1844,,,INTERCIENCIA,Interciencia,NOV-DEC,1994,19,6,,,,,366,373,,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PX415,WOS:A1994PX41500014,,,,,10/31/19J,"SHELEY, RL; LARSON, LL",,,,"SHELEY, RL; LARSON, LL",,,COMPARATIVE GROWTH AND INTERFERENCE BETWEEN CHEATGRASS AND YELLOW STARTHISTLE SEEDLINGS,JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,CENTAUREA-SOLSTITIALIS; BROMUS-TECTORUMFALIEN WINTER ANNUALS; RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PARTITIONING,DIFFERENT ROOTING DEPTHS; MORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; PLANT-POPULATIONS; BROMUS-TECTORUM; RANGE GRASSES; NORTH-AMERICA; COMPETITION; ESTABLISHMENT; WEEDS,"Annual grasslands in the Pacific Northwest are being invaded by Eurasian weeds, such as yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.). Plant-plant interactions influence community dynamics and plant establishment. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of interference between seedlings of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and yellow starthistle and to compare growth of isolated individuals of these species. Isolated individuals and addition series mixtures with total stand densities ranging from 20-20,000 plants m-2 were grown in an environmental chamber (10-degrees-C, 12-hour daylength). Individuals were harvested on 4-day intervals between 10 and 46 days, and mixtures were harvested 37 days after planting. Shoot weight, root weight, leaf area, and total root length of isolated individuals were similar. Yellow starthistle roots penetrated deeper into the soil than did cheatgrass roots 22 days after planting. Intraspecific interference was greater than interspecific interference for both species, and resource partitioning via rooting depth was evident. The yellow starthistle root:shoot ratio and the cheatgrass lower (below 200 mm): upper (above 200 mm) root ratio increased with increasing densities. Yellow starthistle and cheatgrass minimize interspecific interference as seedlings through differential growth and rooting depth. Invasion of cheatgrass rangelands by yellow starthistle increase resource partitioning and reduce our ability to revegetate rangelands by conventional means.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT RANGELAND RESOURCES,CORVALLIS,OR 97331",,,,,,,,36,35,36,0,9,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

Fine root respiration rates were in the range of 0.5 - 9.8 nmol CO2 gDW(-1) s(-1) at both sites, but respiration rates of UND saplings were higher, compared to those of GAP saplings. The dependence of respiratory activity on soil temperature proved to be highly significant (p < 0.001) for both plots, following a quasi-Arrhenius type curve. Fine root respiration rates of UND saplings were highly significantly, negatively correlated with the water content of the attached organic material, whereas respiration rates of GAP saplings did not show such a correlation. Further, a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between mycorrhizal biomass and respiration rate was detected at the UND site, but not at the GAP site. Medium and coarse root respiration rates were very similar and no significant differences between the two sites were detected. Maximum respiration rates of 3.1 nmol CO2 gDW(-1) s(-1) were reached in the middle of July. Due to low light intensities in the under storey, daily net CO2 assimilation rates of UND saplings were much smaller than those of GAP saplings.

The mean percent colonization of VAM fungi in lawn habitats (35%) was over twice that in waste habitats (15%). This suggests that the dense mycorrhizal matrix offered by the lawn habitat influences the development of VAM in this typically nonmycorrhizal species.

The differentiation of the soil communities was evident in measurements of plant survival, phenology, growth, and root-shoot ratios. Effects on survival and growth suggest negative feedbacks between these species and the soil communities that they culture.

Significant differences were observed in the phosphate and inoculation treatments for plant dry weight, P content in the tissue, root length and root colonization, at fourteen days after planting. At 7 days, mycelium growth, root colonization and their relationship were reduced at supra-optimal P concentrations. Applications of P one week after planting reduced mycelium growth and root colonization more than when applied to the soil before planting. In a second experiment the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, Scutellospora heterogama (Nicol. and Gerd.) Walker and Sanders and E3 were tested and compared with Glomus etunicatum.

After clearcutting, fine root biomass accumulated rapidly in the regrowing forest, reaching 71% of that in the mature forest after only four years of recovery. 3 Fine root diameter distributions and specific root length (SRL; length/mass) differed among species. SRL was higher in the forest floor than mineral soil horizons, and decreased with increasing root diameter. 4 Fine root production in the mature forest, measured with in-growth cores, averaged 254 gm(-2) year(-1), but this method probably underestimated production. Rapid disappearance of fine roots was observed for roots growing through in situ screens, and these ephemeral roots are difficult to quantify. 5 The initiation of fine root growth in the forest floor was coincident with leaf expansion in the forest canopy; root growth in the mineral soil began 1-2 weeks later. Root growth was most rapid in early summer (mid-June to early July), and the lifespan of these early season roots averaged about 8-10 months across three years of study. This estimate of longevity was consistent with that obtained from the ratio of fine root biomass to production, after correcting the production value for the observed root disappearance from in situ screens (about 50% of fine roots disappeared from screens within an annual cycle). These longevity estimates also appeared to be consistent with an analysis of the soil C budget based upon soil and fine root respiration and total root allocation. Fine root production was apparently nearly twice as high as leaf production in this ecosystem. 6 These fine root production and turnover estimates are not consistent with results from previous studies of fine root decomposition, and we suggest that fine root decay has been underestimated because existing methods inhibit the saprotrophic activity of rhizosphere organisms.",,"FAHEY, TJ (reprint author), CORNELL UNIV,DEPT NAT RESOURCES,FERNOW HALL,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",,,,,,,58,245,287,1,71,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In the control treatment named 'uniform', potting compost was evenly mixed with sand; the treatment named 'patchy' contained the same quantity of potting compost, but half was concentrated in a central resource-rich circle in each box. In the treatment named 'low', compost was distributed homogeneously as in the first treatment, but the total quantity of potting compost was halved. 2 The biomass of G. hederacea produced in the patchy treatment was over two and a half times that produced in the uniform treatment, and over ten times that produced in the low treatment. In addition, more leaves were produced in the patchy treatment than in the other two treatments. Almost twice as many stolons reached the perimeters of the boxes, in the patchy treatment as in the uniform treatment. However, the biomass of the portions of the clones that had no basipetal connections via stolons into the central circle did not differ between treatments. 3 There was little evidence that above-ground biomass or ramets were concentrated inside the central circle of the patchy treatment relative to the other two treatments. 4 In contrast, 80% of the root biomass of plants in the patchy treatment was concentrated within the resource-rich central circle. Contrary to the situation in plants grown in homogeneous conditions, root:shoot ratio was highest where soil-derived resources were locally most abundant. Inside the central circle, ramets developed roots earlier in the patchy treatment than in the uniform treatment; outside the central circle, ramets developed roots later in the patchy treatment than in the uniform treatment. 5 In a supplementary experiment the length of young root systems increased exponentially from whatever time their growth was initiated. Thus, local delay or advancement of the initiation of root growth, in response to variations in soil characteristics, could have generated the observed concentration of root biomass inside the central circle of the patchy treatment. 6 G. hederacea can exploit environmental heterogeneity through local functional specialization of plant parts. In many habitats, species that have this ability may outcompete those adapted solely to resource-poor conditions.","UNIV SUSSEX,SCH BIOL SCI,BRIGHTON BN1 9QG,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND",,,"Birch, Colin P.

Rhizobium meliloti strains were found more susceptible to storage at 3 or 83.5% r.h. than B. japonicum strains. Whatever the r.h. values, cell populations of B. japonicum declined at a rather constant rate and no surviving cells were observed after 100 days of storage.

Critchfield stand, southeastern Wyoming. We hypothesized that active fine root densities within the canopy gaps would remain comparable with densities in undisturbed forest and would not decline abruptly until a threshold number of trees had been killed, after which the root gap would be recolonized gradually and centripetally. One-, 5-, 15-, and 30-tree clusters were felled to create a series of gaps in the root mat of lodgepole pine forest soil. For 2 years, densities of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root tips were determined by intensive soil coring in the experimental gaps and in a nearby 8-year-old clearcut. Data on fine-root activity were obtained using mesh screens inserted into the soil and incubated for up to 5 years. The results were consistent with the original hypothesis, but no clear threshold gap size was observed for ECM root tips. Densities of active ECM root tips measured along transects through one of the 30-tree gaps decreased quickly within 5-6 m of the forest edge, and did not significantly differ from zero at the center of the gap; in contrast to the 2-year-old gap, active ECM densities were fairly constant across the 8-year-old clearcut. Moreover, root-rip densities declined gradually with increasing gap size, while fine root penetrations of the mesh screens were significantly lower in the 30-tree gaps than in the smaller gaps. During the first 3 years, fine roots intercepting the screens were nonmycorrhizal; at the final removal, root screens that had been incubated for 1837 days in the gaps, including the 30-tree gaps, contained ectomycorrhizal root tips. The root screen removal data suggested that belowground gaps persisted 5 years after initial clear-felling of the 30-tree clusters, but the screens also provided evidence for closure from the edges of these gaps.","UNIV WYOMING,DEPT BOT,LARAMIE,WY 82071",,,,,,,,40,49,49,2,20,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Ring widths were measured in the roots and trunks of trees located within a 120-year-oid, boreal mixedwood stand (control) and at the edge of a road built through the stand 16 years before sampling (released). The observed ring widths were divided by widths predicted from regression to produce ring indices. Response indices were produced by subtracting the ring indices of control trees from those of released trees. Allocation indices were produced by subtracting the ring indices of trunks from those of roots. A final index, quantifying the change in allocation to the root and trunk after road clearing, was produced by subtracting allocation indices of control trees from those of released trees. Following the road clearing, the rate of trunk diameter growth remained unchanged for 3-9 years, while root diameter growth increased. These observations suggest that trunk growth may be suppressed for some years following road clearing as a result of increased root growth. The increase in root growth may help stabilize trees after exposure to increased wind stress by increasing the amount of root wood anchoring and supporting them.","UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT FOREST SCI,EDMONTON,AB T6G 2H1,CANADA",,,,"Lieffers, Victor/0000-0001-6939-4093",,,,27,65,68,1,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Theory predicts a negative correlation between root (and stem) allocation and growth rate in enriched environments (RGR(max)), but evidence does not consistently support this. There is one possible supporting example from previous research in which root allocation in the field increases during old-field succession at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area, both community wide and for individual species samples, and RGR(max) declines for some important species. 2. In this study, we confirm that late successional species have lower RGR(max) for a larger sample of species (n = 28) as well as higher field root allocation. However, root allocation by seedlings does not increase for the late successional species for those same species in the greenhouse in enriched conditions; indeed it declines. 3. These results suggest that seedlings may have markedly different allocation than adults and that observed allocation patterns may be better viewed as adaptively plastic responses to resource gradients, rather than fixed species attributes that determine growth rates. Other, presumably less plastic characters (e.g. nitrogen- or water-use efficiency) may control growth rate, optimal allocation, and potentially competition and succession in this sample of plant types. 4.

Species with higher RGR in sun also had higher RGR in shade. These interspecific trends could be explained by differences in morphological traits and allocation patterns among species. Within each light regime, seedlings of shade-intolerant species had lower root: shoot ratios, higher leaf mass per unit area, and higher leaf area ratios (LAR) than shade tolerant species. In contrast, leaf gas exchange characteristics, or acclimation potential in these traits, had no relationship with seedling mortality rates in shade. In both shade tolerant and intolerant species, light saturated photosynthesis rates, dark respiration, and light compensation points were higher for sun-grown seedlings than far shade-grown seedlings. Differences in R:FR ratio in shade did not affect gas exchange, allocation patterns, or growth rates of any species. Survival of young tree seedlings in shade did not depend on higher net photosynthesis or biomass accumulation rates in shade. Rather, species with higher RGR died faster in shade than species with lower RGR. This trend could be explained if survival depends on morphological charac teristics likely to enhance defense against herbivores and pathogens, such as dense and tough leaves, a well-established root system, and high wood density. High construction costs for these traits, and low LAR as a consequence of these traits, should result in lower rates of whole-plant carbon gain and RGR for shade tolerant species than shade-intolerant species in shade as well as in sun.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT PLANT BIOL,URBANA,IL 61801",,,"Kitajima, Kaoru/M-8521-2018; Kitajima, Kaoru/E-8877-2012","Kitajima, Kaoru/0000-0001-6822-8536; ",,,,59,571,629,5,166,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1994,98,4-Mar,,,,,419,428,,10.1007/BF00324232,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PE432,WOS:A1994PE43200023,28313920,,,,10/31/19J,"KHALIL, S; LOYNACHAN, TE",,,,"KHALIL, S; LOYNACHAN, TE",,,SOIL DRAINAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF VAM FUNGI IN 2 TOPOSEQUENCES,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COLONIZATION; POPULATIONS; GROWTH; IOWA,"Much remains unknown about the distribution and abundance of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi in natural ecosystems.

Plant roots and rhizosphere soil from 24 soils, which consisted of sets of three soils each that varied in soil drainage class from four sites located in two toposequences [Clarion-Nicollet-Webster (CNW) and Sharpsburg-Macksburg-Winterset (SMW)], were sampled. Soils were analyzed for chemical properties, and numbers of VAM fungal spores per 50 g soil were determined by a wet-sieving-and-decanting technique. The percentages of root VAM fungal colonization were determined by the grid-line intersect method. The distribution of spores among locations, series and series within locations varied significantly (P < 0.001). Soil from the CNW toposequence averaged 417 spores (50 g)-1 soil, whereas soil from the SMW toposequence averaged 147 spores (50 g)-1 soil. Within the two toposequences, the poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils had higher spore counts than the well-drained to moderately well-drained soils.

In two Douglas-fir stands (Kootwijk and St Anthonis) with a different deposition rate of AS (ca 22 and 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively), fungi were isolated from the roots and identified. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the fungal populations in the two stands differed significantly at the community level. Regression analysis showed that Trichoderma viride and Penicillium spinulosum occurred significantly more frequently in the Kootwijk stand, whereas Cylindrocarpon didymum and Sesquicillium candelabrum were dominant species in the St Anthonis forest. P. brevicompactum appeared to be common in both Douglas-fir stands. To estimate the possible role of AS in the observed differences between the two stands, a laboratory experiment was performed in which 5, 50 and 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1 was applied to 3 yr old Douglas-firs for 23 months. Although the occurrence of Sesquicillium candelabrum, Trichoderma hamatum and T. viride increased and Sphaerodes retispora decreased with increasing ammonium deposition, CCA did not show that the overall fungal community was affected. The results of both CCA and regression analysis indicated that the differences between the two Douglas-fir stands were not primarily caused by different amounts of AS deposition. Separate analyses of the fungal communities of root tips and older roots showed that deposition of AS tended to alter the fungal community on the root tips; the occurrence of Sporothrix inflata was stimulated at increasing rates of AS, whereas the occurrence of 'unidentified chlamydospores' decreased.","DLO,AGR MATH GRP,6700 AC WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS","GORISSEN, A (reprint author), DLO,AGROBIOL & SOIL FERTIL RES INST,POB 14,6700 AA WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,34,0,0,0,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Inoculation increased total shoot length, stem girth and biomass of the plants, when cultivated in controlled conditions with a phosphorus fertilization of 31 mgP.kg-1 added to a substrate already containing 13.5 mg.kg-1 available P (Olsen). The positive effect increased with time and, after 6 months, the above-ground dry matter production was 5 to 6 times higher for inoculated plants. The Relative Mycorrhizal Dependency Index, calculated on total dry matter, reached 77-78% at the end of experiment. Calculated on above-ground dry matter, the R.M.D.I. was 81-83%, placing the argan tree among the plants most dependent on mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Fusion constructs of lacZ under symbiotic promoters P1 (for nifHDK operon) and P2 (for fix-ABCX operon) of Rhizobium meliloti were mobilized into Rhizobium spp. (Cicer) strains Rcd301 and RCR13. The assays for beta-galactosidase activity to monitor the expression of lacZ under these promoters was performed in host backgrounds of Escherichia coli, R. meliloti, and Rhizobium spp. (Cicer). The enzyme assays indicated significant levels of expression from P1 and P2 promoters in chickpea rhizobia, specifically in symbiotic cells from nodules. However, as in R. meliloti, these promoters did not induce strong expression in free-living cells of Rhizobium spp. (Cicer). This indicates functional homology of R. meliloti promoters in Rhizobium spp. (Cicer). Functional cross-reactivity of trans regulatory factors like NtrA, NtrC, and NifA between these rhizobia seems evident from the nodule-specific expression of P1 and P2 cis elements.","INDIAN AGR RES INST, DIV MICROBIOL, NEW DELHI 110012, INDIA","KHANUJA, SPS (reprint author), INDIAN AGR RES INST, CTR BIOTECHNOL, NEW DELHI 110012, INDIA.",,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Hydroxyurea treatment and 0.6 per cent colchicine solution significantly increased the quantity of mitotic cells which were mostly in the metaphase stage. The highest mitotic index was observed in cells of embryogenic suspensions. The embryogenic lines were cytologically stable and their utilization for karyotype studies and technique development holds great potential. The arm ratios and relative chromosome length values showed the same trends between embryogenic cultures and seedling root tips and among the five black spruce populations studied. This study shows that the black spruce karyotype is asymmetric and semi-advanced, as in Larix and Abies. Three pairs of chromosomes are of the sm-type with submedian centromeres. One pair is median-submedian (msm), six pairs are m-type having median centromeres and two pairs are metacentric or M-type.","PETAWAWA NATL FORESTRY INST, CHALK RIVER K0J 1J0, ON, CANADA","NKONGOLO, KK (reprint author), LAURENTIAN UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, SUDBURY P3E 2C6, ON, CANADA.",,,,,,,29,11,11,0,2,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0018-067X,,,HEREDITY,Heredity,JUL,1994,73,,1,,,,11,17,,10.1038/hdy.1994.93,,,7,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,NU771,WOS:A1994NU77100002,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"CULLINGS, K",,,,"CULLINGS, K",,,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY OF THE MONOTROPOIDEAE (ERICACEAE) WITH A NOTE ON THE PLACEMENT OF THE PYROLOIDEAE,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,PCR; DNA SEQUENCING; 28S RIBOSOMAL RNA GENE; MYCORRHIZAE; MYCOTROPHIC PARASITISM,,"Mycotrophism occurs in two ericaceous subfamilies, the Monotropoideae and the Pyroloideae. However, three aspects of the evolution of these subfamilies remain equivocal; 1) morphological, biochemical, and molecular analyses have failed to establish that the Monotropoideae is monophylectic; 2) the relationships among members of the Monotropoideae remain unresolved; 3) it is unclear whether the Pyroloideae should be included as a subfamily within the Ericaceae or treated as a separate family. To address these topics a phylogeny was constructed using a portion of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene from 22 members of the Ericaceae. Results indicate that the present Monotropoideae is polyphyletic; one species, Monotropsis ordata, is more closely related to members of the Vaccinioideae than to the rest of the Monotropoideae. This arrangement is supported by consideration of mycorrhizal type, consequently multiple origins of mycotrophic parasitism must be assumed. The relationships depicted within the Monotropoideae are nearly congruent with those depicted in Copeland's (1941) phylogeny, and morphological or biochemical characters are identified which support the relationships depicted by the molecular tree which do not agree with the morphological tree. In addition, the data indicate, although not strongly, that the Pyroloideae should be included within the Ericaceae.",,"CULLINGS, K (reprint author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720, USA.",,,,,,,0,36,38,0,3,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"PO BOX 133 KLOSTERBERG 23, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1010-061X,,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.
