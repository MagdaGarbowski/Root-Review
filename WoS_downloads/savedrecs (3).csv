However, the accuracy and errors of this approach for estimating the stand biomass of subtropical forests remain unclear. In this study, we selected four typical subtropical forests (Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation, Pinus massoniana evergreen coniferous forest, Choerospondias axillaris deciduous broadleaved forest, and Lithocarpus glaber-Cyclobalanopsis glauca evergreen broadleaved forest) in Dashanchong Forest Park to calculate the biomass expansion factor (BEF) and the root: shoot ratio (R). Our results showed that the average BEF values for the four forests were 1.144, 1.301, 1.592 and 1.396, respectively, while the average R values were 0.197, 0.192, 0.226 and 0.221, respectively.

We further explore how a subset of these mechanisms results in microbial responses to climate change using simulation modelling. Specifically, we incorporate soil moisture sensitivity into two current enzyme-driven models of soil carbon cycling and find that moisture has large effects on predictions for soil carbon and microbial pools.

The last treatment was to simulate a canopy opening. Both species exhibited increases in biomass, totally and in part, and decreases in leaf water content, specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentrations in LH treatment compared to CL treatment. For A. truncatum, exposure to high light condition (LH) increased crown area, and decreased root to shoot ratio, stem mass ratio and leaf perimeter. However, for Q. variabilis, LH treatment increased stem diameter at ground height, effective quantum yield, photochemical quenching and decreased maximum photosystem II quantum yield. The biomass allocation pattern did not change in Q. variabilis among three light conditions. With respect to newly developed leaves, no significant differences were found in leaf size of Q. variabilis between LH treatment and CH treatment while that of A. truncatum decreased in LH treatment. All chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in newly developed oak leaves in LH treatment increased compared to those of CH treatment while no difference was found for A. truncatum between LH and CH treatment. A. truncatum displayed a greater overall plasticity than Q. variabilis although the oak seedlings have a greater plasticity with respect to chlorophyll concentration and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. A. truncatum should be a better candidate for vegetation recovery, especially in places with heterogeneous light conditions.","[Guo, Xiao] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Forestry, Qingdao 266109, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiao; Wang, Ren-Qing; Wang, Cheng-Dong; Zhao, Song; Guo, Wei-Hua] Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiao; Wang, Ren-Qing; Wang, Cheng-Dong; Zhao, Song; Guo, Wei-Hua] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Xu, Fei] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China","Guo, WH (reprint author), Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.; Guo, WH (reprint author), Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",guo_wh@yahoo.com,"Guo, Xiao/B-6794-2019; Guo, Xiao/K-9759-2019","Guo, Xiao/0000-0003-2268-5090; Guo, Xiao/0000-0003-2268-5090","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470402, 31270374]; Science and Technology Project of Shandong Province [2014GZX217005]",We express our deep appreciation to Yifu Yuan and Ning Du for their assistance during experiment.

This study was designed to reveal the effects of stand age on biomass partitioning and carbon storage of Chinese fir plantation stands in Dabie Mountains of Anhui, East China. A total of six even-aged Chinese fir plantation stands along an age-sequence from 10 to 50 years were selected. To quantify the biomass of different tree components, 18 trees with diameter at breast height (D-1.3) from 6.5 to 35.2 cm were harvested from the different aged stands. Biomasses of understory vegetation, forest floor and standing dead trees were also investigated. Total biomass carbon storages ranged from 57.6 to 211.4 Mg ha(-1) in the different aged stands. Tree layer comprised from 93.7% to 96.4% of the total biomass C pools in the different aged stands. The C pools of the necromass were from 1.8 to 6.2 Mg ha(-1). Stand age had a significant effect on tree biomass partitioning, with an increase in proportion of root biomass. The root/shoot ratios were from 0.187 to 0.312, which was significantly positively correlated to stand age. The existing plantation stands are still developing and have somewhat high rate of biomass and carbon accumulations beyond the normal rotation period (usually 25-30 years) even over an age of 50 years. Appropriate prolongation of the rotation period of Chinese fir plantation will be effective in maintaining long-term productivity and providing large carbon sink. The measurements provide valuable data for modelling productivity of Chinese fir plantation forest.","[Xie, Xinyun; Cui, Jun; Liu, Xijun; Tao, Xiao; Xu, Xiaoniu] Anhui Agr Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xinyun; Cui, Jun; Liu, Xijun; Tao, Xiao; Xu, Xiaoniu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Agri Forestry Ind Dabiesha, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wentao; Wang, Qin] Anhui Agr Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China","Xu, XN (reprint author), Anhui Agr Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China.; Xu, XN (reprint author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Agri Forestry Ind Dabiesha, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China.",qlsforest@ahau.edu.cn; xnxu6162@163.com,,"Xiaoniu, Xu/0000-0002-7343-8703",National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416905]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370626],"We are very grateful for Dr. A.M.

Thus, this study was aimed at investigating root architectural and mechanical properties of seven tropical plants. Based on root growth pattern, it was observed that Leucaena leucocephala and Pterocar pusindicus had taproots and their lateral roots grew horizontally and profusely. Therefore, the root systems of L. leucocephala and P. indicus were categorised as VH-type and the trees were recommended for planting in the middle of the slope. Peltophorum pterocarpum and Acacia mangium exhibited R-and H-types root systems respectively and were also recommended for planting in the middle of the slope. Melastoma malabathricum, Dillenia suffruticosa and Lantana camara possessed shallow roots. Their root systems were more similar to the M-type and these plants were suggested for planting at the top or toe of the slope. Leaf area index and root biomass of the species were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.90). Tensile strength decreased with increasing root diameter, implying that lower root diameter contributed to the higher tensile strength.

Nevertheless, direct comparisons of the different primers remain rare. In this study, AMF community profiles were generated by 454 pyrosequencing of amplicons resulting from direct (i.e., single) PCR amplification with three commonly used primer pairs. Root DNA extracts from four different plant species growing in the same field soil were included into the study to address the following aspects: (1) specificity of the primers for Glomeromycota, (2) structure of the detected AMF communities, and (3) efficiency of the different primers for detecting specific AMF genera. The magnitude of the effect due to PCR selectivity was then compared with the well documented effect of host plant identity on the structure of AMF communities. The primers targeting the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) yielded almost exclusively glomeromycotan sequences. The primers targeting the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) were reasonably selective for Glomeromycota (75% of the operational taxonomic units [OTUs] detected), whereas only about 25% of the OTUs obtained by the primers targeting the internal transcribed region (ITS) of the rDNA belonged to the Glomeromycota. There was good agreement in detecting AMF community dominants between the different PCR primers. In comparison to the AMF selectivity due to host plant identity, the variation due to PCR primer choice was even larger. This was partly due to a large fraction of (mainly ITS) sequences that could not be assigned to validly described AMF taxa. The community profiles generated by the SSU and LSU primers also differed significantly from each other, mainly due to considerable SSU primer selectivity.

We followed the appearance of the isotopic label in springtails inhabiting different layers of soil and litter (euedaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic life forms) after in situ pulse-labelling of spruce trees with C-13-O-2. Isotopic label was most frequently observed in euedaphic Collembola (26% of all samples), mainly in Protaphorura armata. The label was very rare in litter-dwelling (hemiedaphic) species (4%). Surprisingly, the label was often observed in epigeic Collembola (11%). During the period of 44 days after labelling, the proportion of labelled samples increased with time in euedaphic, but not in epigeic species, suggesting that freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by these collembolan groups via different pathways. Most likely, euedaphic species are trophically linked to plant roots, whereas epigeic species receive freshly fixed carbon from aboveground. The exact mechanisms and potential importance of the latter pathway should be evaluated in further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Research suggests that disturbance-tolerant taxa may be represented by fungi in the Glomerales, those in culture collections, and by cosmopolitan taxa due to their generalist growth habit. The corollary is that these taxa should be less common in undisturbed systems. Although widely accepted, these ideas originate from research conducted in previously disturbed systems. Whether they hold up to comparisons of disturbed versus undisturbed systems remains to be seen. We addressed this question by surveying logged and intact sites within forests dominated an AM fungal host (western redcedar; Thuja plicata). We predicted that old-growth sites would host fewer taxa from the Glomerales, fewer cultured taxa, and fewer cosmopolitan taxa compared to logged sites. Contrary to our predictions, the logged and intact sites did not differ with respect the putative disturbance-tolerant taxa. However, taxonomic composition differed, driven primarily by variation in relative abundance rather than loss or gain of taxa. Multiple analyses of indicator taxa revealed no consistent indicators of either undisturbed or disturbed habitats. Based on these findings, the current paradigm for a phylogenetically based LHS of AM fungi warrants re-examination. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

To estimate biomass and carbon accumulation in a young and disturbed forest (regenerated after a tornado) and an aged cork oak forest (undisturbed forest) as well as its distribution among the different pools (tree, litter and soil). Area of study. The north west of Tunisia Material and methods. Carbon stocks were evaluated in the above and belowground cork oak trees, the litter and the 150 cm of the soil. Tree biomass was estimated in both young and aged forests using allometric biomass equations developed for wood stem, cork stem, wood branch, cork branch, leaves, roots and total tree biomass based on combinations of diameter at breast height, total height and crown length as independent variables. Main results. Total tree biomass in forests was 240.58 Mg ha(-1) in the young forest and 411.30 Mg ha-1 in the aged forest with a low root/shoot ratio (0.41 for young forest and 0.31 for aged forest). Total stored carbon was 419.46 Mg C ha(-1) in the young forest and 658.09 Mg C ha(-1) in the aged forest. Carbon stock (Mg C ha(-1)) was estimated to be113.61 (27.08%) and 194.08 (29.49%) in trees, 3.55 (0.85%) and 5.73 (0.87%) in litter and 302.30 (72.07%) and 458.27 (69.64%) in soil in the young and aged forests, respectively. Research highlights. Aged undisturbed forest had the largest tree biomass but a lower potential for accumulation of carbon in the future; in contrast, young disturbed forest had both higher growth and carbon storage potential.","[Zribi, Lobna; Khaldi, Abdelhamid] Inst Natl Rech Genie Rural Eaux & Forets, BP 10,Rue Hedi El Karray El Menzah IV, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Zribi, Lobna; Hanchi, Belgacem; Gharbi, Fatma] Fac Sci Tunis, Campus Univ, El Manar Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Chaar, Hatem] Inst Natl Agron Tunisia, Tunis Mahrajene 1082, Tunisia; [Mouillot, Florent] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE,IRD 1919,CEFE,UMR 5175, Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Zribi, L (reprint author), Inst Natl Rech Genie Rural Eaux & Forets, BP 10,Rue Hedi El Karray El Menzah IV, Ariana 2080, Tunisia.; Zribi, L (reprint author), Fac Sci Tunis, Campus Univ, El Manar Tunis 2092, Tunisia.",lobna_zribi@yahoo.fr,"Khaldi, Abdelhamid/H-5218-2018; Mouillot, Florent/C-2204-2015","Khaldi, Abdelhamid/0000-0002-3258-8860; Mouillot, Florent/0000-0002-6548-4830","INRGREF (Tunisia); French Ministry of Foreign Affairs CORUS 2 project ""Changements globaux et vulnerabilite des forets mediterraneennes en Afrique du Nord""","This study was financially supported by INRGREF (Tunisia) and by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs CORUS 2 project ""Changements globaux et vulnerabilite des forets mediterraneennes en Afrique du Nord"".",,76,2,2,0,17,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

Pubescens) is an important forest type in subtropical China and comprises an important pool in the global carbon cycle. Understanding the effects of the stand management, such as understory removal, on soil respiration (RS) will help to provide a more accurate estimation of carbon cycling and predict future climate change. The study aimed to compare RS and net ecosystem production (NEP) in two Moso bamboo forests managed by the application of herbicide (AH) and conventional hand-weeded (HW) treatment, and further examine their root carbon use efficiency (RCUE). Trenching and litter removal were used to partition the source components of RS and one-year field measurement was conducted. Maximum-minimum approach was used to estimate fine root production. NEP was determined by the balance between NPP of vegetation and heterotrophic respiration (RH) of soil. RCUE was calculated using an indirect method. In both stands, soil temperature and soil moisture at 5 cm depth were the main driving forces to the seasonality of RS. Annual RS was 31.6 t CO2 ha(-1) for the stand AH and 33.9 t CO2 ha(-1) for the stand HW, while net ecosystem production (NEP) were 21.9 and 21.1 t CO2 ha(-1), respectively, indicating that the both Moso bamboo stands acted as carbon sinks in the scenarios of current climate change. The RCUE was 30.6% for the stand AH, which was significantly lower than that for the stand HW (58.8%). This result indicates that different stand management practices can alter RCUE and the assumed constant universal carbon use efficiency (CUE) of 50% is not appropriate in Moso bamboo forests. This study highlight the importance of partition the source components of RS and accurate estimation of RCUE in modelling carbon cycling in Moso bamboo forests.","[Tang, X.; Fan, S.; Qi, L.; Guan, F.; Su, W.] Int Ctr Bamboo & Rattan, Key Lab Bamboo & Rattan Sci, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China; [Tang, X.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Forest Inventory & Remote Sensing, Burckhardt Inst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Du, M.] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Forestry North China, Beijing 102300, Peoples R China","Fan, S; Guan, F (reprint author), Int Ctr Bamboo & Rattan, Key Lab Bamboo & Rattan Sci, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China.",fansh@icbr.ac.cn; guanfy@icbr.ac.cn,,,948 project of State Forest Administration [2013-4-70]; International Centre for Bamboo and Rattan [1632013010]; Special Funds for Forestry Public Industry Research [201104008],"This study was supported by ""948 project"" of State Forest Administration (2013-4-70), special research fund of International Centre for Bamboo and Rattan (1632013010), Special Funds for Forestry Public Industry Research (201104008).

It was transcript data from environmental sample of Ganoderma boninense PER17 derived from GenBank. Some bioinformatics tools were used for this workflow. From this data, 43 411 contigs were assembled using meta-velvet software combined with CAP3 (Contig Assembly Program). Ribosomal contig sequences were annotated using BLASTN against SILVA database while all non-ribosomal contig sequences were annotated using BLASTX against SWISS-PROT and NR databases. Two genera were identified from ribosomal sequences, i.e., Ganoderma, and Ralstonia. Ganoderma had 28 ribosomal and 43 370 non-ribosomal contig sequences. They were annotated as 20 Large Sub-Unit (LSU) and 8 Small Sub-Unit (SSU) for ribosomal sequence and 18 202 as a functional sequence. Ralstonia sequences were also detected in this metatranscriptomics data. It has seven ribosomal contig sequences (6 LSU and 1 SSU) and six contig functional sequences.

The partitioning of N-15 in leaves, twigs, phloem, xylem, fine roots, rhizospheric soil and microbial biomass was followed during two growing seasons. Results showed a significant incorporation of N-15 into the soil-tree system; more than 30% of the administered N-15 was recovered. Analysis of the partitioning clearly revealed that in autumn, roots' N reserves were formed from foliage N-15 (73 %) and to a lesser extent from soil N-15 (27 %). The following spring, N-15 used for the synthesis of new leaves came first from N-15 stored during the previous autumn, mainly from N-15 reserves formed from foliage (95 %).

The necromass was 17.6 Mg ha(-1) and included woody debris (9.0 Mg ha(-1)) and litter (8.6 Mg ha(-1)). The spatial pattern of the aboveground biomass was determined by the spatial distribution of dominant trees with large diameter, tall height, and dense wood. The belowground biomass differed in terms of root diameter and decreased with increasing soil depth. The belowground biomass in each soil pit in local habitats was not related to the spatial distribution of woody plants and soil pit depth. The karst forest presented lower biomass compared than the nonkarst forests in the subtropical zone. Biomass carbon in the karst terrains would increase substantially if degraded karst vegetation could be successfully restored to the forest. Comprehensive site-based biomass inventory of karst vegetation will contribute not only to provide data for benchmarking global and regional vegetation and carbon models but also for regional carbon inventory and vegetation restoration.","[Liu, Li-Bin; Wu, Yang-Yang; Cheng, An-Yun; Wang, Shi-Jie; Ni, Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Inst Geochem, Lincheng West Rd 99, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li-Bin; Wu, Yang-Yang; Cheng, An-Yun; Wang, Shi-Jie; Ni, Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Puding Karst Ecosyst Res Stn, Puding 562100, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li-Bin; Wu, Yang-Yang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hu, Gang; Zhang, Zhong-Hua] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Sch Chem & Life Sci, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China; [Hu, Gang; Zhang, Zhong-Hua] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Key Lab Beibu Gulf Environm Change & Resources Ut, Minist Educ, Nanning 530001, Peoples R China","Ni, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Inst Geochem, Lincheng West Rd 99, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China.; Ni, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Puding Karst Ecosyst Res Stn, Puding 562100, Peoples R China.",nijian@vip.skleg.cn,"Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956704]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [2011031]; Science and Technique Foundation of Guizhou Province [GKH-J-2012-2332],"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2013CB956704), the Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2011031), and the Science and Technique Foundation of Guizhou Province (GKH-J-2012-2332).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of native rhizobia isolated from coal mining areas in the nodulation and growth of leguminous trees. We isolated 19 strains of rhizobia from a degraded soil near Criciuma, SC, Brazil, and evaluated the nodulation and growth-promoting capacity of the inoculated isolates for bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella), marica (M. bimucronata) and angico-vermelho (Parapiptadenia rigida). Isolates UFSC-B2, B6, B8, B9, B11 and B16 were able to nodulate bracatinga, providing average increases of 165 % in shoot dry matter, with a significant contribution to N accumulation. Isolates UFSC-B5, B12, and M8 favored nodulation and growth of marica, especially isolate UFSC-B12, which promoted increases of 370 % in N accumulation compared to treatment with N fertilizer. All strains were inefficient in promoting growth and N uptake by angico-vermelho. In conclusion, isolation and use of selected rhizobia for bracatinga and marica plant inoculation can contribute to the growth and accumulation of N, with prospects for use in programs for revegetation of degraded soils in coal mining areas.","[Doin de Moura, Ginaini Grazielli] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Curso Agron, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [de Armas, Rafael Dutra; Meyer, Edenilson] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Programa Posgrad Recursos Genet Vegetais, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Giachini, Admir Jose; Rossi, Marcio Jose; Fonseca Sousa Soares, Claudio Roberto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil","Soares, CRFS (reprint author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Microbiol Imunol & Parasitol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",crfsoares@gmail.com,,,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [561819/2010-6],"The authors would like to thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for the financial support (Process No 561819/2010-6) and scholarships provided to G.G.D.M. and R.D.A., and an award for excellence in research to the latest author.",,26,2,2,2,11,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

However, it is unknown to what extent this is due to a root depletion rate that depends on initial root weight, or due to differences in resource allocation to fine root and bg shoot growth. To resolve this, we retrieved data from an experiment in which plants were grown in the dark at constant temperature (4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, and 18 degrees C) and harvested prior to or at shoot emergence. A dynamic mass-balance model, in which biomass of the initial root was allocated to bg shoot and fine root daily growth, and where respiration took place from all tissues, was used. The relative depletion rate of root biomass (RDR; d(-1)) and fraction of the depleted biomass allocated to bg shoots (SFRR) were estimated and calibrated to observed biomass. The RDR increased with initial root weight and temperature and SFFR was highest for light roots and lowest for heaviest roots, whereas the rest was allocated to fine root biomass. The length-to-biomass ratio of bg shoots decreased with initial root weight. Under betweenyear weather variations (2004-2010), the reduction in root biomass during the coldest AprilMay was simulated to be over 12 days delayed compared with the warmest spring. The influence of biomass allocation on bg shoot elongation of heavier roots was thus stimulated by a larger fraction of root biomass being depleted, but counteracted by a smaller fraction of it allocated into bg shoot elongation, compared with lighter roots. The complexity of shoot emergence based on root depletion estimates may be a reason why predictions based on only an accumulated root weight-specific temperature sum, as proposed by a previous study, are expected to be less uncertain than those based on root depletion estimates.","[Torssell, Bengt; Eckersten, Henrik; Lundkvist, Anneli; Verwijst, Theo] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden","Lundkvist, A (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden.",anneli.lundkvist@slu.se,,,"Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden; SLU EkoForsk, Sweden","This work was supported by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden and SLU EkoForsk, Sweden.",,20,1,1,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

Unfortunately, it is extracted from the wild and there has been little or no focused effort to domesticate and cultivate the species. Mastering its propagation through root segment cuttings (RSC) is a real alternative to the difficult process of regeneration from seeds. The aim of our study was to assess two of the key factors (rooting medium and root diameter) that influence its rooting ability. The root system of 23 trees was partially excavated to a depth of 20 cm. Root segment cuttings 15 cm in length were carefully cut and arranged horizontally in a polypropagator, on five different substrates. The experimental setup involved a split-plot design with three replications. The main treatment was applied to all five substrates: black soil (Bs), fine sand (S), sawdust (Sd), 50% Bs/50% Sc (Bs-Sc) and 50% Bs:50% S (Bs-S). The secondary treatment covered two diameter size classes (0.5-1 cm; 1.1-2.5 cm). The latency time before emergence was 8 weeks for the aerial shoots and 12 weeks for the roots. After 28 weeks, the percentage of leafy shoots formed varied from 28.3% in the black soil substrate (Bs) to 55.0% in the sand (S). Aerial shoots developed mainly (82%) on the distal pole. The RSC diameter had a significant influence (P < 0.01) on the development of leafy shoots. The budding rate of the RSC was 21 +/- 1.8% for 0.5-1 cm RSC and 86 +/- 7.8% for 1.1-2.5 cm RSC. The diameter also had a significant impact (P < 0.001) on RSC rooting. The rooting rate was 12 +/- 2.3% for 0.5-1 cm RSC and 59.3 +/- 4.7% for 1.1-2.5 cm RSC. These results show that vegetative propagation by RSC could improve the economic value of V. doniana in Cameroon's savannah uplands.","[Mapongmetsem, Pierre Marie; Fawa, Guidawa; Noubissie-Tchiagam, Jean Baptiste] Univ Ngaoundere, Dept Biol Sci, POB 454, Ngaoundere, Cameroon; [Nkongmeneck, Bernard Aloys] Univ Yaounde I, Dept Plant Biol, BP 812, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Biaou, S.

To improve the physical stabilization, the base of the slope was stabilized with urban construction waste. After this, the slope was revegetated with native species and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) inoculation was applied with a successfully restoration of the vegetative cover and ecological functions. This study aims to evaluate the role of the AMF population in the soil aggregation and stabilization of the revegetated slope. The soil aggregation was higher at the experimental site than at the disturbed site, especially under the AMF inoculation. The aggregates improvement was accompanied by an increase of soil humic acid and glomalin contents 24 months after the transplantation despite a flood impact 12 months after the transplantation. A scatter plot based on Principal Component Analysis of aggregates Showed that the preserved site samples clustered with most of those from experimental site. However, some samples from experimetal site were found between those from preserved and disturbed sites. This result shows that the recovering site is evolving toward the conditions of the preserved site and that the rehabilitation process is in an intermediate phase related to the aggregate formation.

To overcome the lack of fossil record in bacteria, divergence times of host legumes were used to calibrate molecular clocks and perform phylogenetic analyses in rhizobia. The 16S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer region remain among the favored molecular markers to reconstruct the timescale of rhizobia. We evaluate the performance of the random local clock model and the classical uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model, in combination with four tree models (coalescent constant size, birth-death, birth-death incomplete sampling, and Yule processes) on rhizobial divergence time estimates. Bayes factor tests based on the marginal likelihoods estimated from the stepping-stone sampling analyses strongly favored the random local clock model in combination with Yule process. Our results on the divergence time estimation from 16S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer region sequences are compatible with age estimates based on the conserved core genes but significantly older than those obtained from symbiotic genes, such as nodIJ genes. This difference may be due to the accelerated evolutionary rates of symbiotic genes compared to those of other genomic regions not directly implicated in nodulation processes.","[Chriki-Adeeb, Rim; Chriki, Ali] Fac Sci Bizerte, Dept Biol, Genet Lab, Jarzouna, Tunisia","Chriki, A (reprint author), Fac Sci Bizerte, Dept Biol, Genet Lab, Jarzouna, Tunisia.",ali.chriki@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Research; University of Carthage; Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte,"This study was supported by the Ministry of Research, the University of Carthage, and the Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte.

We performed a factorial greenhouse experiment where the seeds from four low Arctic co-occurring mycorrhizal herbs (Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Solidago virgaurea) were germinated alone or in the vicinity of an adult Sibbaldia plant with or without AM fungi; given either as spores or being present in a common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Three different AM fungal species were examined to assess species-specific differences in symbiont acquisition rate. Of the four plant species investigated, the presence of AM fungi affected seed germination only in Campanula and this effect was dependent on whether the AM fungi were present in the soil as spores or as a CMN. Overall, after germination, developing seedlings showed AM fungal colonization in their roots as soon as 2 d after cotyledon emergence. Our results show that CMN may provide germinating seedlings faster acquisition of the AM fungal partner in comparison to acquisition from spores. Furthermore, there were AM species-specific differences in the symbiont acquisition rate highlighting the importance of species identity in AM interactions. These findings suggest that while AM fungi may not play a fundamental role during seed germination, plant community composition may be affected by the species-specific AM fungal effects on seedling establishment and CMN acquisition.","[Varga, Sandra; Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Varga, Sandra] Lincoln Univ, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England","Varga, S (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.; Varga, S (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Joseph Banks Labs, Sch Life Sci, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",svarga@lincoln.ac.uk,"; Varga, Sandra/B-6044-2012","Kytoviita, Minna-Maarit/0000-0002-8928-6951; Varga, Sandra/0000-0001-9799-714X","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [157685, 250911]","The authors thank Hanna-Leena Aarnio, Sandy Barkoczy, Anke Bartels, Rita Haapakoski, Jouni Karvonen, Jaana Lahti-Domenicki, Taina Laitakari, Carolin Nuortila and the personnel of the Botanical Gardens of the University of Oulu for practical help.

Material and Methods: We studied P. pinaster root apexes from seedlings grown in soils collected one year after fire in undisturbed sites, sites moderately affected by fire and sites highly affected by fire. Natural ectomycorrhization was observed at the whole root system level as well as at two root vertical sections (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm). We also measured several morphometric traits ( tap root length, shoot length, dry biomass of shoots and root/shoot ratio), which were used to test the influence of fire severity and soil chemistry upon them. Main results: Ectomycorrhizal colonization in undisturbed soils for total and separated root vertical sections was higher than in soils that had been affected by fire to some degree. Inversely, seedling vegetative size increased according to fire severity. Research highlights: Fire severity affected soil properties and mycorrhizal colonization one year after occurrence, thus affecting plant development. These findings can contribute to a better knowledge of the factors mediating successful establishment of P. pinaster in Mediterranean forests after wildfires.","[Vasquez-Gassibe, Pablo; Oria-de-Rueda, Juan-Andres; Santos-del-Blanco, Luis; Martin-Pinto, Pablo] Univ Valladolid Palencia, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Fire & Appl Mycol Lab, Dept Agroforestry Sci, Palencia, Spain; [Vasquez-Gassibe, Pablo; Oria-de-Rueda, Juan-Andres; Santos-del-Blanco, Luis; Martin-Pinto, Pablo] Univ Valladolid Palencia, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Fire & Appl Mycol Lab, Dept Vegetal Prod & Nat Resources, Palencia, Spain; [Santos-del-Blanco, Luis] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Vasquez-Gassibe, P (reprint author), Univ Valladolid Palencia, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Fire & Appl Mycol Lab, Dept Agroforestry Sci, Palencia, Spain.; Vasquez-Gassibe, P (reprint author), Univ Valladolid Palencia, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Fire & Appl Mycol Lab, Dept Vegetal Prod & Nat Resources, Palencia, Spain.",,"; Martin-Pinto, Pablo/D-5219-2014","Vasquez Gassibe, Pablo/0000-0002-0421-7317; Oria-de-Rueda, Juan Andres/0000-0001-6851-038X; Martin-Pinto, Pablo/0000-0002-2853-056X",,,,80,3,3,1,28,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

Soil freezing damages fine roots, which may reduce radial tree growth and stem respiration. We conducted a snow removal experiment at Harvard Forest, MA to quantify effects of a reduced winter snowpack and increased soil freezing on root biomass, stem radial growth and respiration in a mixed-hardwood forest. The proportion of live fine root biomass during spring (late-April) declined with increasing soil frost severity (P = 0.05). Basal area increment index was positively correlated with soil frost severity for Acer rubrum, but not Quercus rubra. Rates of stem respiration in the growing season correlated positively with soil frost duration in the previous winter, (R-LMM(m)(2) = 0.15 and 0.24 for Q. rubra and A. rubrum, respectively). Losses of C from stem respiration were comparable to or greater than C storage from radial growth of Q. rubra and A. rubrum, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that in mixed-hardwood forests (1) soil freezing has adverse effects on spring live root biomass, but at least in the short-term could stimulate aboveground processes such as stem respiration and radial growth for A. rubrum more than Q. rubra, (2) stemrespiration is an important ecosystemC flux and (3) the increasing abundance of A. rubrum relative to Q. rubra may have important implications for C storage in tree stem biomass.","[Reinmann, Andrew B.; Templer, Pamela H.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Reinmann, AB (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",reinmann@bu.edu,,,US EPA Science; Northeastern States Research Cooperative; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service,"We are grateful for the assistance of Audrey Barker-Plotkin, Christine Bollig, Keala Cummings, Dash Donnelly, Omar Gutierrez del Arroyo Santiago, Adam Jacobs, Stephanie Juice, Eli Melaas, Trustees of Reservation, and the staff at Harvard Forest.

Mycorrhizal plants can be used in the revegetation process because these plants are known to increase the structural stability of degraded soils and improve natural vegetation cover, thus increasing both survival and growth of the species, especially in semi-arid areas. The aim of the present study was to analyse mycorrhizal colonisation of native species to ensure success of revegetation in solar photovoltaic farms in Mediterranean areas. The present study was performed in the field because most studies on mycorrhizal species have been conducted in a controlled nursery environment. Four species were planted (Cistus monspeliensis L., Lavandula stoechas L., Thymus vulgaris L. and Rosmarinus officinalis L.) with inoculated and non-inoculated plants. Once the percentage of mycorrhizal colonisation of inoculated plants was known, the survival percentage and apical growth were determined over 2 years. The mycorrhizal colonisation of inoculated plants was satisfactory at the end of the study period, although there was a natural colonisation of mycorrhizae in plants that initially had not been inoculated. Lavandula stoechas L. had the highest survival percentage (95.8% in mycorrhizal plants and 100% in non-mycorrhizal plants) and Rosmarinus officinalis L. had the highest apical growth (19 cm in mycorrhizal plants and 15.2 cm in non-mycorrhizal plants).

Experimental sand burial depths in the soil were 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 cm, and soil water contents were 4%, 8%, 12% and 16% of field capacity. All two-way ANOVA (five sand burial depths and four soil water contents) results showed that seed burial depths, soil water content and their interactions significantly affected all the studied plant variables. Most of the times, seedling emergence conditions were greater at the lower sand burial depths (less than 1.0 cm) than at the higher (more than 1.0 cm) seed burial depths, and at the lower water content (less than 12%) than at the higher soil water content. However, high seed burial depths (more than 1.5 cm) or low soil water content (less than 12%) reduced seedling growth or change in the root/shoot biomass ratios. In conclusion, the most suitable range of sand burial was from 0.5 to 1.0 cm soil depth and soil water content was about 12%, respectively, for the processes of seedling emergence and growth. These findings indicate that seeds of the sandy elm should be kept at rather shallow soil depths, and water should be added up to 12% of soil capacity when conducting elm planting and management. Our findings could help to create a more appropriate sandy elm cultivation and understand sparse elm woodland recruitment failures in arid and semi-arid regions.","[Tang, Jiao; Jiang, Deming; Wang, Yongcui; Musa, Ala; Miao, Renhui; Miao, Chunping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jiao; Miao, Renhui; Miao, Chunping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Busso, Carlos A.] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, CERZOS, CONICET, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Wu, Dafu] Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Resource & Environm, Xinxiang 450003, Peoples R China","Jiang, DM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",tangjiaoviva1988@126.com; cebusso@criba.edu.ar; jiangdeming@iae.ac.cn; yongcuiwang@iae.ac.cn; uau@hist.edu.cn; alamusa@iae.ac.cn; miaorenhui@henu.edu.cn; miaochunping316@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370706],"This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370706).

A realistic representation of processes governing carbon allocation and phenology for the two defining elements of savanna vegetation (namely trees and grasses) may be a key to understanding variations in tree-grass partitioning in time and space across the savanna biome worldwide. Here we present a new approach for modelling coupled phenology and carbon allocation, applied to competing tree and grass plant functional types. The approach accounts for a temporal shift between assimilation and growth, mediated by a labile carbohydrate store. This is combined with a method to maximize long-term net primary production (NPP) by optimally partitioning plant growth between fine roots and (leaves C stem). The computational efficiency of the analytic method used here allows it to be uniquely and readily applied at regional scale, as required, for example, within the framework of a global biogeochemical model. We demonstrate the approach by encoding it in a new simple carbon-water cycle model that we call HAVANA (Hydrology and Vegetation-dynamics Algorithm for Northern Australia), coupled to the existing POP (Population Orders Physiology) model for tree demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. HAVANA-POP is calibrated using monthly remotely sensed fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon and water fluxes at five tower sites along the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), which is characterized by large gradients in rainfall and wildfire disturbance. The calibrated model replicates observed gradients of fPAR, tree leaf area index, basal area, and foliage projective cover along the NATT. The model behaviour emerges from complex feedbacks between the plant physiology and vegetation dynamics, mediated by shifting above-versus below-ground resources, and not from imposed hypotheses about the controls on tree-grass co-existence. Results support the hypothesis that resource limitation is a stronger determinant of tree cover than disturbance in Australian savannas.","[Haverd, V.; Briggs, P.; Nieradzik, L.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, POB 3023, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Smith, B.] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Raupach, M.] Australian Natl Univ, Climate Change Inst, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Beringer, J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, M004,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hutley, L.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Trudinger, C.

In these cases, the invasive plant can act as a pathogen reservoir. However, little is known about this as a possible plant invasion mechanism. We isolated fungi from the roots of 32 Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) plants collected across Ontario, Canada, where it is highly invasive. The growth effects of known pathogenic fungi were tested on V. rossicum and two commonly co-occurring native plants, Asclepias syriaca (Apocynaceae) and Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae). We hypothesised that these fungi would reduce the growth of native plants more than that of V. rossicum. Of the18 fungal taxa isolated from V. rossicum roots, 15 were previously reported as pathogens on other plants and 16 represent new records on this plant. Four of the seven fungi tested on V. rossicum increased its total biomass and/or root-shoot ratio compared to uninoculated controls. When inoculated individually, three of these fungi had neutral growth effects on the native plants. However, when inoculated together, Cadophora sp., Ilyonectria radicicola, and Macrophomina phaseolina reduced the total biomass of S. canadensis. These results support that at least in some cases non-native invaders may benefit from associating with soil microbes that can function as pathogens on native plants. These differential functional outcomes between non-native invasive and native plants may be important for mediating plant community structure and the persistence of invasive plants.","[Day, Nicola J.; Dunfield, Kari E.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Day, Nicola J.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada","Antunes, PM (reprint author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.",pantunes@gmail.com,,"Day, Nicola/0000-0002-3135-7585",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; New Zealand Federation of Graduate Women Fellowship; University of Guelph; Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters,"We would like to sincerely thank G.

An accretion rate of 4.6 Mg SOC.ha(-1) of soil.year(-1) was observed in the fine earth fraction (<= 2 mm), reflecting the rapid phase of stand growth. The accretion was primarily observed in the upper 10 cm of the soil. Treatment effects were most apparent in soil bulk density, SOC of the fine earth, and 150-53 mu m size fractions. In general, changes in SOC observed in the L treatment was an intermediate increase between the UC and LR treatments, where only the removal of roots provided no change in SOC and was significantly different from the control (p = 0.05). We conclude that a major contributor to the maintenance and increase of SOC in this fast-growing pine ecosystem was due to root turnover (60%), with 40% due to aboveground litter inputs.","[Stoppe, A.

We conducted a mesocosm experiment with eight species of riparian herbaceous plants, and found evidence that plant biodiversity significantly reduced fluvial erosion rates, with the eight-species polyculture decreasing erosion by 23% relative to monocultures. Species richness effects were largest at low levels of species richness, with little increase between four and eight species. Our results suggest that plant biodiversity reduced erosion rates indirectly through positive effects on root length and number of root tips, and that interactions between legumes and non-legumes were particularly important in producing biodiversity effects. Presumably, legumes increased root production of non-legumes by increasing soil nitrogen availability due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Our data suggest that a restoration project using species from different functional groups might provide the best insurance to maintain long-term erosion resistance.","[Allen, Daniel C.] Arizona State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wynn-Thompson, Theresa] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Allen, DC (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",daniel.c.allen@asu.edu,"Allen, Daniel/S-5975-2017","Allen, Daniel/0000-0002-0451-0564",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1103500]; USDA McIntyre-Stennis program,"Couryn Beleck, Joel DeBoer, Jake Kornfield, Kelly McClure, Paul Parent, Charlotte Wilson, and Charles Zhou assisted in experiment set-up, and Chase Baldwin assisted in sample processing.

For absorptive roots, which are mainly responsible for resource acquisition, we hypothesized that root economic strategies differ with increasing root diameter. To test this hypothesis, we used seven plant species (a fern, a conifer, and five angiosperms from south China) for which we separated absorptive roots into two categories: thin roots (thickness of root cortex plus epidermis < 247 mu m) and thick roots. For each category, we analyzed a range of root traits related to resource acquisition and conservation, including root tissue density, different carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) fractions (i.e., extractive, acid-soluble, and acid-insoluble fractions) as well as root anatomical traits. The results showed significant relationships among root traits indicating an acquisition-conservation tradeoff for thin absorptive roots while no such trait relationships were found for thick absorptive roots. Similar results were found when reanalyzing data of a previous study including 96 plant species. The contrasting economic strategies between thin and thick absorptive roots, as revealed here, may provide a new perspective on our understanding of the root economics spectrum.","[Kong, D.

Here, we investigate whether deviation from niche optima would affect the outcome of plant-plant interactions along a soil acidity gradient (pH = 3.1, 4.1, 5.5 and 6.1) in a pot experiment. We used the acid-tolerant species Lespedeza formosa Koehne as the neighbouring plant and the acid-tolerant species Indigofera pseudotinctoria Mats. or acid-sensitive species Medicago sativa L. as the target plants. Biomass was used to determine the optimal pH and to calculate the relative interaction index (RII). We found that the relationships between RII and the deviation of soil pH from the target's optimal pH were linear for both target species. Both targets were increasingly promoted by the neighbour as pH values deviated from their optima; neighbours benefitted target plants by promoting soil symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, increasing soil organic matter or reducing soil exchangeable aluminium. Our results suggest that the shape of the curve describing the relationship between soil pH and facilitation/ competition depends on the soilpHoptima of the particular species.","[He, Lei; Cheng, Lulu; Hu, Liangliang; Tang, Jianjun; Chen, Xin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Tang, JJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chandt@zju.edu.cn; chen-tang@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31470483, 31570411]; Zhejiang Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [Y15C030005]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos 31470483 and 31570411) and Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation (no.

The diversity of microbes in rhizosphere can affect plant health. The objective was to investigate the effects of consecutive monoculture of this plant on rhizospheric microbial community composition and catabolic diversity at different stages of plant growth. The results showed that the microbial communities were significantly affected by both longevity of monoculture and plant growth stage. The amounts of phospholipid fatty acids indicative of most microbial functional groups differed significantly between the newly planted and monocultured soils. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the microbial biomass and the community metabolic activities. The cyclopropyl-to-precursor ratio (cy/pre), an indicator of physiological stress in microbial communities, was significantly higher in the mono cultured soils than in the newly planted soil at both the root elongation and expansion stages. Furthermore, the amounts of two pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus flavus) significantly increased with increasing years of monoculture. In conclusion, we revealed characteristic differences in the microbial community composition and functions in R. glutinosa rhizosphere after monoculture, which might be attributed to the changes in plant performance and root exudates.

However, our knowledge about the responses of soil microbial biomass and community composition to P availability is still limited. In this study, we established field plots with addition of 0, 5 (LP), 15 (MP) and 30 (HP) g P m(-2) y(-1) in a subalpine spruce plantation and investigated the responses of soil microbes. Chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis were used to determine soil microbial biomass and community composition, respectively. After two growing seasons of P addition, the HP treatment significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and P. The P addition exerted the specific influences on soil microbial community composition. The abundance of most groups of soil microbial community (bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) increased in the HP treatment and the ratio of fungi to bacteria decreased in the LP and MP treatment, whereas the nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed no significant difference in the PLFA pattern between the P treatments and the control. Although soil P availability increased in all P treatments compared to the control, the dissolved organic carbon, indicative of soil carbon availability, was promoted only by the HP treatment. Besides, soil microbial biomass was positively correlated to soil carbon availability and pH. These results indicate that soil microbes are insensitive to the elevated P availability in this spruce plantation and P addition increases soil microbial biomass mainly through improving carbon availability and pH.

For the highly diverse orchid family, many species face imminent extinction. Successful re-introductions that result in self-sustaining populations require not only an understanding of existing threats, but an in-depth understanding of species ecology. Increasingly, translocations, ranging from re-introductions to assisted colonisation, are being adopted as recovery actions. Do these translocations mitigate threatening processes and account for the two key ecological attributes for orchid survival; pollinator and mycorrhizal presence? Here, we conducted a literature review identifying the known threats to orchid survival and their necessary mitigation strategies. Next, we evaluated the success of 74 published international orchid translocations on 66 species against a consideration of orchid ecological attributes. Lastly, we empirically tested an additional 22 previously unpublished re-introductions on 12 species undertaken since 2007 against a re-introduction process that accounts for identified threats and orchid ecological attributes. We identified habitat destruction, weed invasion, herbivory, illegal collection, pollinator decline, pathogens and climate change as critical threats to orchid survival. In our global review based on published translocations, the average survival rate, 1-year post translocation was 66 % yet only 2.8 % of studies reported natural recruitment in field sites. Although survival of translocated orchids is clearly being achieved, these programmes did not relate orchid growth and development to key ecological requirements of orchid population resilience, pollinator and mycorrhizal ecology. Ensuring pollinator and mycorrhizal presence shows that these two factors alone are key factors influencing survival and persistence in an Australian review of 22 previously unpublished orchid re-introductions. In the Australian review flowering in the year following, out-planting was observed for 81 % of the re-introductions with seed set occurring in 63 % of re-introductions within the length of the study. Recruitment was observed in 18 % of the Australian re-introduced populations indicating a degree of population resilience. As orchid re-introductions will be a major strategy for wild orchid conservation in the future, we present a framework for orchid re-introductions, including criteria for success. We recommend symbiotic propagation and, for specialised pollination syndromes, the study of pollinator interactions prior to site selection and re-introduction of plants.","[Reiter, Noushka] Royal Bot Gardens Victoria, Corner Ballarto Rd & Bot Dr, Cranbourne, Vic 3977, Australia; [Whitfield, Julie] Amaryllis Environm, Bendigo, Vic 3550, Australia; [Pollard, Gail; Bedggood, Wendy; Argall, Mary] Australian Network Plant Conservat, Horsham, Vic 3400, Australia; [Dixon, Kingsley; Davis, Belinda] Bot Gardens & Parks Author, Kings Pk & Bot Garden, Fraser Ave, Perth, WA 6005, Australia; [Dixon, Kingsley; Davis, Belinda] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Dixon, Kingsley; Swarts, Nigel] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Dixon, Kingsley; Swarts, Nigel] Royal Tasmanian Bot Gardens, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Swarts, Nigel] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, Australia","Reiter, N (reprint author), Royal Bot Gardens Victoria, Corner Ballarto Rd & Bot Dr, Cranbourne, Vic 3977, Australia.",noushka.reiter@rbg.vic.gov.au,"dixon, kingsley w/A-8133-2016; Swarts, Nigel/D-9380-2012","dixon, kingsley w/0000-0001-5989-2929; Reiter, Noushka/0000-0001-8450-2769; Swarts, Nigel/0000-0002-4527-7658",Australian Network for Plant Conservation; Department of Environment Land Water and Planning; Department of Parks and Wildlife; Wimmera Catchment Management Authority; Australian Federal Government's Caring for our Country Program; Australian Orchid Foundation; Portland Aluminium; ALCOA; Griffin Coal,"The authors would like to thank the following people for their part with guidance, assistance in laboratory, field and nursery work for various species mentioned: Rob Cross, Magali Wright, David Pitts, Ash Burns, Geoff Neville, Ryan Phillips, Penelope Amy, Kate Vlcek, Andrew Pritchard, Pauline Rudolph, Ann Lawrie, Australasian Native Orchid Society (Victorian Branch) in particular Richard Thomson, L and J Carrigan, Neil Anderton, Peter Kiernan, Russell Mawson, Andrew Dilley and Mike Wicks for assistance with the plantings.

Fine roots and mycorrhiza often represent the largest input of carbon (C) into soils and are therefore of primary relevance to the soil C balance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have previously been found to increase litter decomposition which may lead to reduced soil C stocks, but these studies have focused on immediate decomposition of relatively high amounts of high-quality litter and may therefore not hold in many ecological settings over longer terms. 2. Here, we assessed the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on the fate of C and nitrogen (N) contained within a realistic amount of highly C-13-/N-15-labelled root litter in soil. This litter was either added fresh or after a 3-month incubation period under field conditions to a hyphal in-growth core where mycorrhizal abundance was either reduced or not through rotation. After 3 months of incubation with a plant under glasshouse conditions, the effect of turning cores on residual C-13 and N-15 inside the cores was measured, as well as C-13 incorporation in microbial signature fatty acids and N-15 incorporation of plants. 3. Turning of cores increased the abundance of fungal decomposers and C-13 loss from cores, while N-15 content of cores and plants was unaffected. Despite the difference in disturbance that turning the cores could have caused, the results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and field incubation of litter acted to additively increase the proportion of C-13 left in cores. 4. Synthesis. Apart from stimulating litter decomposition as previously shown, mycorrhizas can also stabilize C during litter decomposition and this effect is persistent through time.","[Verbruggen, Erik; Hammer, Edith C.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Verbruggen, Erik; Hammer, Edith C.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jansa, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Microbiol, CR-14220 Prague, Czech Republic; [Hammer, Edith C.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Microbial Ecol Biodivers, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Verbruggen, E (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Plant & Vegetat Ecol, Antwerp, Belgium.",erik.verbruggen@uantwerpen.be,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Jansa, Jan/H-3161-2014","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Jansa, Jan/0000-0002-0331-1774; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515","Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and SportsMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LK11224]; Fellowship J.E.

Here, we investigated whether soil P fractions (i.e., labile inorganic P [P-i], intermediately available P-i, organic P, occluded P, and apatite P) differed among three tropical forests at different stages of succession (early, middle, and late) in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve (DBR), Southern China. We also determined which soil P fractions was closely related to soil microbial and chemical properties in these forests. Soil microbial biomass and chemical properties (except pH, exchangeable Ca, and Mn) were higher in the late successional forest than those in the other two forests. We found that soil organic and occluded P were the dominant fraction in all three forests and together accounted for 78.9, 84.2, and 78.6 % of total P in the early, middle, and late successional forests, respectively. Soil P fractions and acid phosphomonoesterase activity differed significantly among forest successional stages; intermediately available P-i and organic P (potential sources of labile P-i) were highest in the late successional forest, occluded P was highest in the middle successional forest, and acid phosphomonoesterase activity significantly increased in middle and late successional forest. Soil labile P-i fraction and its potential sources (i.e., intermediately available P-i and soil organic P) were both positively correlated with soil microbial and chemical properties, suggesting that these properties may play critical roles in maintaining high levels of available or potentially available P fractions during this forest succession. Overall, our study indicates that succession in tropical forest ecosystems may not always lead to lower soil P availability.","[Zhang, Hongzhi; Shi, Leilei; Wen, Dazhi] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongzhi; Shi, Leilei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kailiang] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Wen, DZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, 723 Xingke Rd, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhz0729@scbg.ac.cn; dzwen@scbg.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31070409, 31570483]; Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050205]",This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31070409; 31570483) and the Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

At the Calblanque site, the inoculation with native strains was more effective than that with allochthonous strains, with respect to increasing shoot dry weight (about 48 and 28 %, respectively, compared to control plants), primarily due to improvements in NPK uptake and plant drought tolerance. However, at Rellano, the efficacy of plant growth promotion was not influenced by the strain origin. The highest increases in the urease, protease, and dehydrogenase activities and in microbial biomass C in response to inoculation with actinobacteria occurred at the Rellano site (about 200, 28, 29, and 30 %, respectively, compared to the respective controls), regardless of the origin of the strain assayed.

How does S.caprea modify its understorey? How is the understorey vegetation affected by above-ground and below-ground competition with S.caprea? LocationHeaps after coal mining near Sokolov, Czech Republic (50 degrees 1421N, 12 degrees 4045E). MethodsThe effects of above-ground and below-ground competition with thewillow S.caprea on its understorey plant community were studied in un-reclaimed post-mining sites. Below-ground competition was evaluated by comparing (1) frames inserted into the soil that excluded woody roots (frame treatment), (2) frames that initially excluded woody root growth but then allowed regrowth of the roots (open-frame treatment), and (3) undisturbed soil (no-frame treatment). These treatments were combined with S.caprea thinning to assess the effect of above-ground competition. ResultsThree years after the start of the experiment, above-ground competition from S.caprea (as modified by thinning of the S.caprea canopy) had not affected understorey biomass or species number, but had affected species composition. In contrast, below-ground competition significantly affected both the above-ground and below-ground biomass of the understorey. The above-ground biomass of the understorey was larger in the frame treatment (which excluded woody roots) than in the other two treatments. The below-ground biomass of the understorey was larger in the frame than in the open-frame treatment. Unlike above-ground competition (light availability), below-ground competition did not affect understorey species composition. ConclusionsOur results suggest that S.caprea is an important component during plant succession on post-mining sites because it considerably modifies its understorey plant community. Below-ground competition is a major reason for the low cover and biomass of the herbaceous understorey in S.caprea stands on post-mining sites.","[Mudrak, Ondrej] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Funct Ecol, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Hermova, Marketa; Tesnerova, Cecilie; Frouz, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Environm Studies, CZ-12800 Prague, Czech Republic; [Rydlova, Jana] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Mycorrhizal Symbioses, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Frouz, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Inst Soil Biol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Mudrak, O (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, Dept Funct Ecol, Dukelska 135, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic.",ondrej.mudrak@centrum.cz; m.hermova@gmail.com; CilkaJ@seznam.cz; jana.rydlova@ibot.cas.cz; jan.frouz@natur.cuni.cz,"Frouz, Jan/P-4388-2016; Mudrak, Ondrej/H-1614-2014; Frouz, Jan/G-2220-2014","Frouz, Jan/0000-0002-0908-8606; Mudrak, Ondrej/0000-0001-7775-0414; ","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GA13-10377S, 15-11635S, P504/12/1288];  [RVO 67985939]","This study was supported as a long-term research development project no.

Network theory can reveal rules of community assembly within and across study systems and suggest novel hypotheses regarding the formation and stability of communities. However, such studies generally face the challenge of disentangling the relative influence of factors such as interaction type and environmental conditions on shaping communities and associated networks. Endophytic and endolichenic symbioses, characterized by microbial species that occur within healthy plants and lichen thalli, represent some of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature. Fungi that engage in these symbioses are hyperdiverse, often horizontally transmitted, and functionally beneficial in many cases, and they represent the diversification of multiple phylogenetic groups. We evaluated six measures of ecological network structure for > 4100 isolates of endophytic and endolichenic fungi collected systematically from five sites across North America. Our comparison of these co-occurring interactions in biomes ranging from tundra to subtropical forest showed that the type of interactions (i.e., endophytic vs. endolichenic) had a much more pronounced influence on network structure than did environmental conditions. In particular, endophytic networks were less nested, less connected, and more modular than endolichenic networks in all sites. The consistency of the network structure within each interaction type, independent of site, is encouraging for current efforts devoted to gathering metadata on ecological network structure at a global scale. We discuss several mechanisms potentially responsible for such patterns and draw attention to knowledge gaps in our understanding of networks for diverse interaction types.","[Chagnon, Pierre-Luc] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [U'Ren, Jana M.; Arnold, A.

The studied plots along an elevation gradient are located at 80, 600, and 1,000 m. Soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected in four seasons from SE Brazilian winter 2012 to autumn 2013. AMF spores in rhizosperic soils were morphologically classified and chemical, physical and microbiological soil caracteristics were determined. AMF diversity in roots was evaluated using the NS31/AM1 primer pair, with subsequent cloning and sequencing. In the rhizosphere, 58 AMF species were identified. The genera Acaulospora and Glomus were predominant. However, in the roots, only 14 AMF sequencing groups were found and all had high similarity to Glomeraceae. AMF species identities varied between altitudes and seasons. There were species that contributed the most to this variation. Some soil characteristics (pH, organic matter, microbial activity and microbial biomass carbon) showed a strong relationship with the occurrence of certain species. The highest AMF species diversity, based on Shannon's diversity index, was found for the highest altitude. Seasonality did not affect the diversity. Our results show a high AMF diversity, higher than commonly found in the Atlantic Forest. The AMF detected in roots were not identical to those detected in rhizosperic soil and differences in AMF communities were found in different altitudes even in geographically close-lying sites.","[Bonfim, Joice Andrade; Gumiere, Thiago; Colombo Mescolotti, Denise de Lourdes; Bran Nogueira Cardoso, Elke Jurandy] Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Soil Microbiol Lab, Dept Soil Sci, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Figueiredo Vasconcellos, Rafael Leandro] EMBRAPA Brazilian Co Res Agr Husb & Environm, BR-13820000 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil; [Oehl, Fritz] Agroscope, Fed Res Inst Sustainabil Sci, Plant Soil Interact, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Oehl, Fritz] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Micol, BR-50740600 Recife, PE, Brazil","Bonfim, JA (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, ESALQ, Soil Microbiol Lab, Dept Soil Sci, Padua Dias Ave 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",joice.agro@yahoo.com.br; rafaellfvasc@gmail.com; fritz.oehl@agroscope.admin.ch; ejbncard@usp.br,"Vasconcellos, Rafael/G-7583-2012; Gumiere, Thiago/O-6568-2014; Cardoso, Elke J.B.N./E-5039-2013","Vasconcellos, Rafael/0000-0001-7399-0007; Gumiere, Thiago/0000-0003-1033-1447; ",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [11/15262-5]; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),J.A.B. thanks Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) (process no. 11/15262-5) for a research fellowship.

The measurements were taken during the less rainy (December 2010) and rainy (May 2011) periods. The soil CO2 efflux was highest during the rainy season, probably due to increased microbial activity influenced by climatic factors coupled with biotic factors. The soil CO2 efflux correlated positively with soil moisture and microbial biomass carbon and negatively with soil temperature and metabolic quotient, but these correlations were weak. The soil CO2 efflux was sensitive to the type of agroforestry system and to rainfall seasonality.","[da Silva, Carolina Melo] Univ Fed Para UFPA, Inst Geocencias, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Vasconcelos, Steel Silva; Mourao Junior, Moises; Kato, Osvaldo Ryohei] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Lab Anal Sistemas Sustentaveis, BR-66095100 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Capela Bispo, Carlos Jose; Castellani, Debora Cristina] Nat Inovacao & Tecnol Prod Ltda, BR-07750000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [da Silva, Carolina Melo; da Silva Junior, Alberto Cruz] UFRA, BR-68650000 Capitao Poco, Para, Brazil","da Silva, CM (reprint author), Univ Fed Para UFPA, Inst Geocencias, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, Rua Augusto Correa 1, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil.",cms.carol@yahoo.com.br,,"Vasconcelos, Steel/0000-0003-2364-8822",,,,34,2,4,0,87,INST NACIONAL PESQUISAS AMAZONIA,MANAUS,"CAIXA POSTAL 478,  ALAMEDA COSME FERREIRA, 1756, MANAUS, AMAZONAS 00000, BRAZIL",0044-5967,1809-4392,,ACTA AMAZON,ACTA AMAZON.,JAN-MAR,2016,46,1,,,,,1,11,,10.1590/1809-4392201500193,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry; Zoology,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Zoology,CW3QO,WOS:000364907000001,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Liu, YJ; Hu, JM; Wang, TW; Cai, CF; Li, ZX; Zhang, Y",,,,"Liu, Yao-Jun; Hu, Jian-Min; Wang, Tian-Wei; Cai, Chong-Fa; Li, Zhao-Xia; Zhang, Yu",,,"Effects of vegetation cover and road-concentrated flow on hillslope erosion in rainfall and scouring simulation tests in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China",CATENA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Three Gorges Reservoir Area; Road erosion; Vegetation restoration; Rainfall simulation; Scouring test,UNPAVED FOREST ROADS; SEDIMENT PRODUCTION; NORTHERN THAILAND; RUNOFF GENERATION; WESTERN CASCADES; SUBSURFACE FLOW; SOIL THICKNESS; FILTER STRIPS; SLOPING LANDS; WATER EROSION,"Roads play a significant role in altering hydrological processes. Roads cause more erosion to be generated from the hillslope for both road-concentrated flow and rainfall. In this study, six treatments (Natural Restoration, Grass, Grass & Shrub, Sodded Strip, Grass & Farmland, and Farmland) were used to recolonize hillslope plants on a newly built unpaved road. Rainfall simulation (rainfall intensity of 90 mm h(-1) and 120 mm h(-1)) and scouring simulation (scouring flow rate 15 L min(-1) and 20 L min(-1)) tests were conducted to identify the effects of plants on soil erosion. In the rainfall simulation test, Grass & Shrub was more effective at reducing hillslope erosion than the other treatments, and Grass & Shrub also had a lower runoff coefficient, soil detachment rate, and higher efficiency in trapping runoff and sediment. The hydrological responses of all of the tested plots in the scouring test were much faster than in the rainfall simulation, as indicated by the lower lag time to runoff generation. The hillslope erosion in the scouring test was significantly higher than in the rainfall simulation. The water-stable aggregate, saturated hydraulic conductivity, vegetation cover, root length density, and root weight density were important factors that conditioned the runoff generation and sediment yield from the hillslope in both experimental tests. In the scouring test, in infiltration improvement and flow erosivity reduction, Grass was more effective at trapping runoff and sediment because of its dense well-developed system of fine roots. Therefore, except for an immediate surface cover, in the areas where the hillslope has a risk of road-concentrated flow scouring, the enhancement of topsoil roughness was also very important in weakening the impact of road-concentrated flow on the hillslope.

However, estimations of grassland biomass on large spatial scale usually suffer from large variability and mostly lack quantitative uncertainty analyses. In this study, the spatial grassland biomass estimation and its uncertainty were assessed based on 265 field measurements and remote sensing data across Northern China during 2001-2005. Potential sources of uncertainty, including remote sensing data sources (DATsrc), model forms (MODfrm) and model parameters (biomass allocation, BMallo, e.g. root:shoot ratio), were determined and their relative contribution was quantified. The results showed that the annual grassland biomass in Northern China was 1268.37 +/- 180.84Tg (i.e., 532.02 +/- 99.71 g/m(2)) during 2001-2005, increasing from western to eastern area, with a mean relative uncertainty of 19.8%. There were distinguishable differences among the uncertainty contributions of three sources (BMallo >DATsrc>MODfrm), which contributed 52%, 27% and 13%, respectively. This study highlighted the need to concern the uncertainty in grassland biomass estimation, especially for the uncertainty related to BMallo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite their critical roles, roots have been understudied mainly due to methodological challenges. There is currently no consensus on Which methods are most suitable to accurately study root biomass and production. Critical evaluation of the assumptions, strengths and inherent limitations of methods to study root biomass and production are necessary to help investigators decide which method is best for their purposes. This synthesis compares existing methods for root biomass and production estimation based on relevant criteria that include cost, labor requirements, time efficiency and accuracy and, also compares fine- and coarse-root biomass and production estimates from different methods measured at the same sites. Root excavation and soil-pit methods are commonly used to estimate coarse-root biomass, despite the high cost and labor required. Ground-Penetrating Radar is a very promising indirect approach to estimate coarse-root biomass, but may not be suitable for ecosystems with dense understory and soils with high organic matter and ion contents. Soil-core remains the most preferred method to estimate fine-root biomass. Empirical models are accepted as fast and cost-effective indirect approach to predict fine- and coarse-root biomass and production. Fine-root production is usually estimated with the (mini) rhizotrons, sequential-coring and ingrowth-core methods. Coarse-root biomass estimates were not significantly different between soil-pit and soil-core methods. There was a significant positive correlation (r(2) = 0.91, p < 0.0001) between fine-root biomass estimates obtained from soil-pit and soil-core methods. Fine-root production estimates were lower in the ingrowth-core (2.06 +/- 0.23 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) compared to the (mini) rhizotrons (3.81 +/- 0.46 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and sequential-coring (3.84 +/- 0.93 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) methods. Based on the reviewed literature and comparative analysis we propose that (mini) rhizotrons should be preferred over the others in estimating fine-root production. In situations where cost and site conditions preclude their use, the sequential-coring and ingrowth-core methods are suitable. The ingrowth-core should be used with caution in sites where root growth is slow and root biomass may be influenced by strong seasonal fluctuations. Multiple methods are still recommended for yielding realistic estimates of fineand coarse-root production, and more comparative studies of different methods should be conducted on the same sites.

The quantity and quality of organic carbon in soils can be affected by vegetation through influencing the inputs and outputs of SOM. We examined how storage and quality of C in SOM were affected by vegetation under grass cover or single and a polyculture plot of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Fagus sylvatica. An acid hydrolysis approach was used to quantify three SOM fractions differing in biodegradability. Tree species identity and stand composition had no significant effect on the total amount of C stored in different SOM fractions to a depth of one meter. However, when examining individual SOM fractions in the upper layers of the soil profile, significantly more C was stored in the putatively more labile fractions 1 and 2 under F. sylvatica and A. glutinosa, respectively. In deeper soil layers, the highest storage of recalcitrant organic C was found under the tree polyculture. The vertical distribution of these three soil organic C pools was compared to C inputs via decomposed leaf litter. Our data indicated that in the tree species polyculture, combining litter inputs of multiple species can have a positive impact on the accumulation of acid resistant recalcitrant C in deep soil layers in 4 years. This C fraction has the greatest potential for long-term sequestration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To gain a better understanding of revegetation practices, we investigated the vertical distribution of fine-root biomass, necromass, production, and effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) content in three shrub species (Salix psammophila, Hedysarum mongolicum, and Artemisia ordosica). In addition, we also estimated the fine root decomposition rate with litterbag techniques. The results showed that revegetation practices resulted in a significant increase in SOC content. Over a 10 year period of revegetation, the SOC content in S. psammophila, H. mongolicum, and A. ordosica plots increased by 0.87, 1.07, and 1.82 times, respectively, more than that in bare-land plot. Increase in total SOC content was mainly due to increase in light-fraction SOC, except for the A. ordosica plot. Variations in the short-term increase of SOC content after revegetations with the three shrubs on sand land might be explained by fine root decomposition rates, at least in part. A. ordosica may be a better species for SOC accumulation and sequestration in the study site. Additionally, fine-root biomass and production were not associated with more SOC content increase in shrub plots. The results suggest the mechanism of SOC accumulation and sequestration differed among shrub plots and highlight the effectiveness of different shrub species as revegetation materials in terms of SOC accumulation and sequestration.

These interactions occur in the presence of additional microbes that can modify fungal phenotypes, such as endohyphal bacteria (EHB). Here we examine the occurrence, diversity, and taxonomic composition of EHB in fungi that colonize seeds and leaves of plants in tropical forests. We use PCR and fluorescence microscopy to detect EHB in fungi, and a phylogenetic approach to explore evolutionary relationships among seed- and leaf-inhabiting fungi and their bacterial partners. Analyses focusing on two prevalent orders of fungi (Hypocreales and Xylariales) revealed that seed- and leaf-inhabiting fungi have a shared evolutionary history, yet differ in the prevalence, richness, and composition of their endohyphal symbionts. Phylogenetic analyses detected that the endohyphal habit is widespread, here encompassing members of seven phyla of bacteria (including three classes of Proteobacteria). Occurring in seed- vs. leaf-associated fungi has not resulted in detectable structure in the evolution of EHB, and no congruence was observed in the phylogenetic relationships of these apparently facultative, horizontally transmitted symbionts, and their fungal hosts. Our results are consistent with multiple origins of fungus-bacterium associations and argue for evaluating focal pairs to determine how particular EHB affect the establishment or maintenance of fungal symbioses in seeds and leaves.","[Shaffer, Justin P.; Baltrus, David A.; Arnold, A.

The Eucalyptus Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment was established to study the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) on a native mature eucalypt woodland with low fertility soils in southeast Australia. In contrast to other FACE experiments, the concentration of CO2 at EucFACE was increased gradually in steps above ambient (+0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150ppm CO2 above ambient of similar to 400ppm), with each step lasting approximately 5weeks. This provided a unique opportunity to study the short-term (weeks to months) response of C cycle flux components to eCO(2) across a range of CO2 concentrations in an intact ecosystem. Soil CO2 efflux (i.e., soil respiration or R-soil) increased in response to initial enrichment (e.g., +30 and +60ppm CO2) but did not continue to increase as the CO2 enrichment was stepped up to higher concentrations. Light-saturated photosynthesis of canopy leaves (A(sat)) also showed similar stimulation by elevated CO2 at +60ppm as at +150ppm CO2. The lack of significant effects of eCO(2) on soil moisture, microbial biomass, or activity suggests that the increase in R-soil likely reflected increased root and rhizosphere respiration rather than increased microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. This rapid increase in R-soil suggests that under eCO(2,) additional photosynthate was produced, transported belowground, and respired. The consequences of this increased belowground activity and whether it is sustained through time in mature ecosystems under eCO(2) are a priority for future research.","[Drake, John E.; Macdonald, Catriona A.; Tjoelker, Mark G.; Crous, Kristine Y.; Gimeno, Teresa E.; Singh, Brajesh K.; Reich, Peter B.; Anderson, Ian C.; Ellsworth, David S.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Gimeno, Teresa E.] INRA, UMR 1391, ISPA, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Drake, JE (reprint author), Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",je.drake@westernsydney.edu.au,"Singh, Brajesh/R-6321-2019; Gimeno, Teresa E/C-8770-2011; Drake, John/N-8490-2014; Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016","Singh, Brajesh/0000-0003-4413-4185; Gimeno, Teresa E/0000-0002-1707-9291; Drake, John/0000-0001-9453-1766; Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238; Anderson, Ian/0000-0002-3507-163X; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Crous, Kristine/0000-0001-9478-7593","Australian Government through the Education Investment FundAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Department of Industry and Science; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Western Sydney University","We thank Steven Wohl, Vinod Kumar, Craig McNamara, and Craig Barton (Western Sydney University) for running all technical aspects of the EucFACE facility.

This definition is based on the bias that, under ""normal conditions"", cambial activity stops once a year. Each tree ring can thus be dated to one calendar year, which is one of the principles of dendrochronology. The formation of IADFs can be triggered directly by environmental changes, especially in precipitation and temperature, that affect cambial activity and cell differentiation. It can also be the result of limited photosynthesis, due to defoliation induced by biotic or abiotic constraints. Often indicated with alternative terms, IADFs were first described in the 1930s, and recently reported for many trees and shrubs from different ecosystems throughout the world, particularly for Mediterranean species. Different types of IADFs have been detected; their formation and structural properties depend on many factors including tree genotype, age, size, rooting depth, habitat, soil, climate, photosynthetic activity, and allocation strategies. Whether IADFs affect the adaptive capability of plants remains, however, unclear. We provide an overview of the main anatomical features of IADFs and their occurrence in tree rings from various environments and climatic regimes. We propose a simplified way of classifying them and discuss the hypotheses about their functional role and the factors triggering their formation. To understand the ecological role of IADFs better, we recommend a multidisciplinary approach, involving wood anatomy, dendroecology, and stable isotopes, which has already been applied for Mediterranean species. We conclude by considering that IADFs appear to be the ""rule"" rather than ""anomalies"" in some ecosystems where they help plants cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. Moreover, their anatomical structure represents a valuable proxy of past climatic conditions at a sub-seasonal resolution and may be relevant to adapt hydraulic functioning of living trees to changing climatic conditions.","[De Micco, V.] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Campelo, F.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [De Luis, M.] IUCA Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Pedro Cerbuna 12, Zaragoza 50009, Spain; [Braeuning, A.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Geog, Wetterkreuz 15, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Grabner, M.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, UFT Tulln, Konrad Lorenz Str 24, A-3430 Tulln, Austria; [Battipaglia, G.] Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Biol & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Via Vivaldi 43, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Battipaglia, G.] Univ Montpellier 2, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud PALECO EPHE, Ctr Bioarchaeol & Ecol, Inst Bot, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Cherubini, P.] Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","De Micco, V (reprint author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy.",demicco@unina.it,"Campelo, Filipe/D-6931-2011; de Luis, Martin/F-2559-2010; Cherubini, Paolo/N-9702-2013","Campelo, Filipe/0000-0001-6022-9948; de Luis, Martin/0000-0002-7585-3636; Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X",,,,112,72,75,6,63,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0928-1541,2294-1932,,IAWA J,IAWA J.,,2016,37,2,,,,,232,259,,10.1163/22941932-20160132,,,28,Forestry,Forestry,DN8PV,WOS:000377342500007,,,Y,N,10/31/19J,"Okazaki, S; Tittabutr, P; Teulet, A; Thouin, J; Fardoux, J; Chaintreuil, C; Gully, D; Arrighi, JF; Furuta, N; Miwa, H; Yasuda, M; Nouwen, N; Teaumroong, N; Giraud, E",,,,"Okazaki, Shin; Tittabutr, Panlada; Teulet, Albin; Thouin, Julien; Fardoux, Joel; Chaintreuil, Clemence; Gully, Djamel; Arrighi, Jean-Francois; Furuta, Noriyuki; Miwa, Hiroki; Yasuda, Michiko; Nouwen, Nico; Teaumroong, Neung; Giraud, Eric",,,Rhizobium-legume symbiosis in the absence of Nod factors: two possible scenarios with or without the T3SS,ISME JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,III SECRETION SYSTEM; PHOTOSYNTHETIC BRADYRHIZOBIA; PLANT IMMUNITY; AESCHYNOMENE; NODULATION; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA; SPECIFICITY; INFECTION; MELILOTI,"The occurrence of alternative Nod factor (NF)-independent symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia was first demonstrated in some Aeschynomene species that are nodulated by photosynthetic bradyrhizobia lacking the canonical nodABC genes. In this study, we revealed that a large diversity of non-photosynthetic bradyrhizobia, including B. elkanii, was also able to induce nodules on the NF-independent Aeschynomene species, A. indica. Using cytological analysis of the nodules and the nitrogenase enzyme activity as markers, a gradient in the symbiotic interaction between bradyrhizobial strains and A. indica could be distinguished. This ranged from strains that induced nodules that were only infected intercellularly to rhizobial strains that formed nodules in which the host cells were invaded intracellularly and that displayed a weak nitrogenase activity. In all non-photosynthetic bradyrhizobia, the type III secretion system (T3SS) appears required to trigger nodule organogenesis. In contrast, genome sequence analysis revealed that apart from a few exceptions, like the Bradyrhizobium ORS285 strain, photosynthetic bradyrhizobia strains lack a T3SS. Furthermore, analysis of the symbiotic properties of an ORS285 T3SS mutant revealed that the T3SS could have a positive or negative role for the interaction with NF-dependent Aeschynomene species, but that it is dispensable for the interaction with all NF-independent Aeschynomene species tested. Taken together, these data indicate that two NF-independent symbiotic processes are possible between legumes and rhizobia: one dependent on a T3SS and one using a so far unknown mechanism.","[Okazaki, Shin; Furuta, Noriyuki; Miwa, Hiroki; Yasuda, Michiko] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Int Environm & Agr Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Tittabutr, Panlada; Teaumroong, Neung] Suranaree Univ Technol, Inst Agr Technol, Sch Biotechnol, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand; [Teulet, Albin; Thouin, Julien; Fardoux, Joel; Chaintreuil, Clemence; Gully, Djamel; Arrighi, Jean-Francois; Nouwen, Nico; Giraud, Eric] UM2, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, CIRAD, IRD,UMR IRD,SupAgro,INRA, Montpellier, France","Giraud, E (reprint author), IRD, LSTM, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",eric.giraud@ird.fr,"OKAZAKI, Shin/G-1164-2013","OKAZAKI, Shin/0000-0002-6406-720X; Thouin, Julien/0000-0001-8229-6156; GULLY, Djamel/0000-0003-1695-5744; ARRIGHI, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-6184-2066",French national research agencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-BugsInaCell-13-BSV7-0013]; Franco-Thai PHC Siam program (project SIAM) [29589XA],"This work was supported by grant from the French national research agency (ANR-BugsInaCell-13-BSV7-0013) and the Franco-Thai PHC Siam program (project SIAM No 29589XA).

We selected 75 plots in gully beds, representing five successional stages that differ in plant community composition, dominated by herbs, shrubs or trees according to successional stage. In each plot, we measured soil aggregate stability, basic soil characteristics, root traits and plant diversity indices. Soil aggregate stability increased along the successional gradient, being thrice higher in tree-dominated communities as compared to grass-dominated communities. This increase was mainly driven by soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. In early successional stages showing low SOC (below 24 g.kg(-1) or 12 g.kg(-1) in some cases), fine sand content and the percentage of fine roots acted as co-drivers enhancing soil aggregate stability while silt content decreased it. Plant succession in severely eroded Mediterranean gully bed ecosystems is accompanied by a strong stabilization of soil aggregates, mainly driven by SOC accumulation and for early successional stages, by soil granulometry and root traits as co-drivers. Stimulating succession thus appears as a promising restoration strategy for severely eroded ecosystems.","[Erktan, Amandine; Cecillon, Lauric; Rey, Freddy] Irstea, UR EMGR Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Erktan, Amandine; Cecillon, Lauric; Legout, Cedric; Rey, Freddy] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38402 Grenoble, France; [Erktan, Amandine] INRA, UMR AMAP Bot & Modelisat Architecture Plantes & V, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Graf, Frank] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Roumet, Catherine] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE,Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Legout, Cedric] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, IRD, G INP,LTHE, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France","Erktan, A (reprint author), Irstea, UR EMGR Ecosyst Montagnards, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",amandine.erktan@gmail.com,,"Cecillon, Lauric/0000-0001-7795-2382; , Cedric/0000-0003-2958-4815","Electricite de France (EDF); Agence de l'eau Rhone; Mediterranee et CorseRegion Corse; Region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'AzurRegion Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; European Union (FEDER program "" L'Europe s'engage en PACA avec le Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional "")","We thank Electricite de France (EDF), Agence de l'eau Rhone, Mediterranee et Corse, Region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur and European Union (FEDER program "" L'Europe s'engage en PACA avec le Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional "") for financial support.

Disentangling the influence of temperature, precipitation and soil moisture content (AWR) on the forest productivity remains an important research area. We analyzed the impact of climate variability on the leaf phenology (10 sample trees) and radial growth (17 sample trees) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The study was conducted on 130-year-old European beech trees growing in a temperate forest stand in the Czech Republic. Detailed 20-year phenological monitoring was performed at the study site (1992-2011). As expected, leaf phenological events were mainly driven by the growing season temperatures. Leaf unfolding was highly affected positively by spring temperatures and the top-layer (to 40 cm) AWR in March. The correlation of tree-ring width with the interpolated climate data was positive significant for the growing season AWR and precipitation signal. Furthermore, the water availability in the top soil layer was found to be an important predictor of tree growth and extremely low growth occurrence. The extended phenological growing season, which was caused by a temperature increase, was not followed by an increased tree-ring width. The examined relationships point out the significance of the water availability in the top soil layer in European beech stands.","[Kolar, Tomas; Giagli, Kyriaki; Vavrcik, Hanus; Rybnicek, Michal] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kolar, Tomas; Trnka, Miroslav; Rybnicek, Michal] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Global Change Res Inst, Belidla 986-4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Bednarova, Emilie] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Kolar, T (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Dept Wood Sci, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",koldatom@gmail.com,"Bednarova, Emilie/C-8065-2014; Giagli, Kyriaki/P-2865-2019; Giagli, Kyriaki/E-3894-2014; Vavrcik, Hanus/B-4751-2014; Kolar, Tomas/B-4846-2014; Rybnicek, Michal/B-5714-2014","Vavrcik, Hanus/0000-0001-9386-9554; ","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415, EHP-CZ02-OV-1-019-2014]; Czechadapt - System for Exchange of Information on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation Measures on the Territory of the Czech Republic [EHP-CZ02-0V-1-066-01-2014]; Czech Republic Grant AgencyGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-04291S]; ECEuropean Commission Joint Research CentreEuropean Community (EC) [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0031]; state budget of the Czech Republic","The paper was prepared within the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I), grant number LO1415; the ""Frameworks and possibilities of forest adaptation measures and strategies connected with Climate change"" (no.

Recently, conversion factors in soils at 10-cm depth intervals successfully estimated fine root biomass using image data from the minirhizotron method. However, this technique was conducted only at one forest site and did not consider different vegetation types. Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify a method for calibration of minirhizotron data with the core sampling values obtained by direct measurement of root biomass in wetland ecosystems among three vegetation types. Evaluations by minirhizotron technique and soil-core sampling were made at 30-cm soil depth in a cool-temperate brackish marsh in northern Japan. Linear regression was examined between root volume and weight of fine roots in soil core samples, and the fine root biomass on minirhizotron tubes was calculated from their length and diameter. The technique was well adapted for vegetation types dominated by Phragmites australis, Juncus yokoscensis, and Miscanthus sinensis and Cirsium inundatum. Compared with the fine root biomass estimated by the core sampling method, fine root biomass estimated by the minirhizotron method was overestimated in the 0-10-cm layer. Further, we determined conversion factors based on the ratio of the fine root biomass by the core sampling method to that by the minirhizotron tubes. Estimation of the fine root biomass using the conversion factors for each 10-cm soil depth was well adapted in P. australis vegetation and J. yokoscensis vegetation types as a forest ecosystem; meanwhile, M. sinensis and C. inundatum vegetation types were not well adapted. This study suggests that the minirhizotron technique is available to estimate fine root biomass of single-species dominated vegetation in the brackish marsh using conversion factors for each 10-cm depth.","[Lee, Chol Gyu; Inubushi, Kazuyuki] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan; [Suzuki, Shizuo] Inst Environm Sci, Dept Environm Simulat, Aomori, Japan; [Noguchi, Kyotaro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Site Environm, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Lee, Chol Gyu] RIKEN, BioResource Ctr, Div Microbe, Japan Collect Microorganisms, 3-1-1 Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050074, Japan; [Suzuki, Shizuo] Numazu Colloge, Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect Control Syst Engn, Shizuoka 4108501, Japan","Lee, CG (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan.",cholgyu.lee@riken.jp,"Lee, Chol Gyu/C-8163-2017","Lee, Chol Gyu/0000-0002-5456-0607",,,,22,0,0,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

A greenhouse study was carried out to determine the influence of different soil amendments, namely poultry manure (PM), cattle manure (CM), and sulfur (S), on soil P status. The application rates were 0, 4, and 8 t ha(-1) for PM; 0, 20, and 40 t ha(-1) for CM; and 0, 0.75, and 1.5 t ha(-1) for S treatments. Individual additions of PM and CM unlike S significantly affected phosphorus (P) concentrations in soils. The highest Olsen P and total P (TP) were with the highest PM (8 t ha(-1)) and CM (40 t ha(-1)) treatments. The addition of PM increased Olsen P to 59.2 mg kg(-1) and TP to 761 mg kg(-1). For the CM treatments, the highest Olsen P (66.5 mg kg(-1)) and TP (713 mg kg(-1)) concentrations were with the highest CM treatments (40 t ha(-1)). While PM additions decreased the bioavailability factor, CM increased it. Increasing S treatments decreased soil pH (8.0 to 7.8) but not statistically significantly. Application of S significantly increased EC (801.6 to 1163.4 mu s cm(-1)). While the applications of CM increased shoot P concentrations unlike root P concentrations, PM and S did not significantly influence plant shoot or root P concentrations. Plant shoot P concentration was higher compared to root P concentration as expected due to the transformation of P from root to shoot. Poultry manure had no effect on plant length or weight. However, they were significantly increased by increasing additions of CM and S. The study indicated that CM addition is more effective on soil Olsen P and plant P concentrations as well as plant growth compared to PM and S. There are controversial results in the literature depending on the nature of amendments, plant systems, and specific soil properties. Therefore, more research is needed on manure as a soil amendment.","[Sonmez, Osman] Erciyes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Kayseri, Turkey; [Turan, Veysel] Bingol Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosyst Engn, Bingol, Turkey; [Kaya, Cengiz] Harran Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Sanliurfa, Turkey","Sonmez, O (reprint author), Erciyes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Kayseri, Turkey.",osmansonmez@erciyes.edu.tr,"c, kaya/Q-1912-2019; SONMEZ, Osman/R-2114-2019","Turan, Veysel/0000-0001-7805-8411",,,,33,9,9,1,8,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-011X,1303-6173,,TURK J AGRIC FOR,Turk.

One of them, EcoFINDERS, launched a pan-European survey in order to define normal operating ranges for soil biodiversity and quality, through the use of several methodologies. The objective of the current work was the characterization of European soils under different land uses and from representative bio-geographical locations, using a PLEA method developed in the context of the mentioned survey, in order to recognize and define operation ranges for soil PLEA. PLEA analysis demonstrated to be a valuable tool in the evaluation, comparison and distinction of several land uses and biogeographical (BG) zones. The analysis of the PLEA diversity with PCA and PERMANOVA/SIMPER demonstrated a good separation of soil samples relatively to each defined land use and BG zone. Soils of the same BG zone and land use group showed an average biomarker constitution with consistent differences of PLFA/biomarker compositions relatively to other groups, especially concerning land uses. Total PLEA biomass was consistently higher in non-arable environments, i.e., forest or grass soils. Arable soils contained a total PLEA biomass that was in average 2.5-2.9 times lower than grassland or forest soil. Arable and grassland soils contained significantly low relative quantities of the saprophytic Fungi biomarker 18:2 omega 6,9c (which decreased more than 18:1 omega 9c), and low Total Fungi biomarkers/Bacteria biomarkers ratio (TF/B). The opposite occurred in forestry soil samples, and the Boreal BG zone stood out, showing the highest total fungal composition, with a most important contribution of the 18:2 omega 6.9c saprophytic Fungi biomarker. Grasslands (all BG zones) showed to be the richest (3.5-3.8%) in Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Fungi biomarker, 16:1 omega 5c. High proportions of Gram-positive, relatively to Gram-negative biomarkers occurred essentially in arable soils, in this study, but also in Alpine grasslands, which main Gram-positive biomarkers were a15:0, and i15:0.

Only five species have recently been described based on isolates from tropical soils, three species from Brazil (B. manausense, B. ingae, B. neotropicale) and two species from Peru (B. paxllaere e B. icense), although tropical region is considered to be the origin of legume rhizobia symbiosis. Besides, some authors suggested that Bradyrhizobium was introduced in Brazil with first soybeans inoculants from USA. In this work, 46 Bradyrhizobium strains were isolated from soils collected in different regions of Brazil (Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, and South), using soybean as a trap plant. These strains were characterized genetically by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene and five housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, dnaK, recA, and rpoB). They were also characterized in terms of their symbiotic efficiency with soybean plants grown under axenic conditions in Leonard jars. The phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes revealed the possible presence of novel species in the Northeast and Southeast soils, some of which exhibited high symbiotic efficiency with soybean plants. These results emphasize the great diversity among native strains belonging to Bradyrhizobium genus in Brazilian soils as well as potential ones to be used as inoculants. They also indicate that symbiotically efficient native bradyrhizobia occur in Brazilian soils and are independent of strains introduced as soybean inoculant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanisms, especially the direct influences of AMP on the translocation and transformation of Cr in the soil-plant continuum, are still unresolved. In a two-compartment root-organ cultivation system, the extraradical mycelium (ERM) of mycorrhizal roots was treated with 0.05 mmol L-1 Cr(VI) for 12 days to investigate the uptake, translocation, and transformation of Cr(VI) by AMP using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS), and X-ray-absorption fine structure (XAFS) technologies. The results indicated that AMF can immobilize quantities of Cr via reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), forming Cr(III)-phosphate analogues, likely on the fungal surface. Besides this, we also confirmed that the extraradical mycelium (ERM) can actively take up Cr [either in the form of Cr(VI) or Cr(III)] and transport Cr [potentially in the form of Cr(III)-histidine analogues] to mycorrhizal roots but immobilize most of the Cr(III) in the fungal structures. Based on an X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis of Cr(VI)-treated roots, we proposed that the intraradical fungal structures can also immobilize Cr within mycorrhizal roots. Our findings confirmed the immobilization of Cr by AMP, which plays an essential role in the Cr(VI) tolerance of AM symbioses.","[Wu, Songlin; Zhang, Xin; Sun, Yuqing; Wu, Zhaoxiang; Li, Tao; Hu, Yajun; Su, Dan; Chen, Baodong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Lv, Jitao; Li, Gang; Zhang, Zhensong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Environm Chem & Ecotoxicol, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Wu, Songlin; Sun, Yuqing; Wu, Zhaoxiang; Su, Dan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yajun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Lirong; Zhang, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chen, BD (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",bdchen@rcees.ac.cn,"Chen, Baodong/A-7707-2009","Chen, Baodong/0000-0002-1790-7800","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41101246, 41471219, 41371264]","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41101246, 41471219, and 41371264).

Nevertheless, facilitating establishment between plant species can help accelerate ecological succession, especially in stressful environments. Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a key role in plant growth, particularly in harsh environments, and could also play a role in facilitation between plants, as mycorrhizal fungi can form a mycelial network that simultaneously interacts with the root systems of several plant species. In a high-elevation Malagasy tropical rainforest on acidic and iron-rich soil surrounding an active mining site, four genera of ectomycorrhizal plants are locally abundant: Leptolaena, Sarcolaena, Uapaca and Asteropeia. A floristic survey showed that only Asteropeia seedlings can grow on bare soil. Molecular analysis of ectomycorrhizal fungi ITS rDNA enabled us to describe ectomycorrhizal communities and their distribution among these four plant genera. Russulaceae, Boletales, Cortinariaceae and Thelephoraceae are abundant in these forests. There is extensive sharing between ectomycorrhizal communities associated with Asteropeia mcphersonii and other ectomycorrhizal plants. There are also many mycorrhizal fungi species which are common to ectomycorrhizal communities of seedlings and adult trees. This abundance of generalist fungi allows us to envisage the use of A. mcphersonii in the ecological restoration of the mine site. Planting ectomycorrhizal fungi in the bare soil at the beginning of ecological restoration could allow them to grow, thereby establishing a source of inoculum to colonize other ectomycorrhizal plants and consequently facilitate their establishment.

We investigated differences in the C traits among 16 white birch populations grown in two provenance trials in northeastern China. Effects of provenance were significant for most combinations of C trait, tree portion, and trial site. Substantial differences among provenances were found in (I) C concentration in the bole wood and in bark, in fine roots, and at the whole tree scale; (2) C amount sequestered in each studied tree component and in the whole tree; and (3) ratios of C partitioning to bole wood, bole bark, leaves, and existing fine roots. Mostly, significant variations in C concentration and partitioning ratios were independent of provenance volume growth, while those in C amount were strongly positively correlated with volume growth. Summer climate at the provenance origin was the best predictor, of C concentration and allocation but clinal patterns in these traits were found for only some tree components. The C sequestration showed a clinal pattern following the mean annual temperature at the provenance origin. While this suggests an adaptive nature of C traits in white birch, site conditions and/or tree density act strongly on expression of these traits. Implications of this study to C budgeting, trading C credits, and to genetic selection are discussed. Our results may interest ecologists studying dynamics of ecosystems in times of climate change.

The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design, with five treatments (dosages) and five replicates, with 10 minicuttings each. Data were subjected to the analysis of variance and regression (alpha = 0.05). In the VM01 clone, all parameters were influenced by doses of polymer incorporated into the substrate and the dose of 1.5 g L-1 was recommended. In AEC0144 clone, only the parameters CMR, SM and EM was influenced by doses of polymer and 1.0 g L-1 is recommended.

The subordinate insurance hypothesis suggests that highly diverse communities contain greater numbers of subordinate species than less diverse communities. It has previously been reported that subordinate species can improve grassland productivity during drought, but the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. 2. Using a combination of subordinate species removal and summer drought, we show that soil processes play a critical role in community resistance to drought. Interestingly, subordinate species drive soil microbial community structure and largely mitigate the effect of drought on grassland soil functioning. Our results highlight subordinate species in shifting the balance within the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) microbial community towards more fungal dominance. 3. Fungal communities promoted by subordinate species were more resistant to drought and maintained higher rates of litter decomposition and soil respiration. These results emphasize the important role of subordinate species in mitigating drought effects on soil ecosystem functions. Reciprocal effects between fungi and subordinate species explain also how subordinate species better resisted to drought conditions. 4. Our results point to a delayed plant-soil feedback following environmental perturbation. Additionally, they extend the diversity insurance hypothesis by showing that more diverse communities not only contain species well adapted to perturbations, but also species with higher impacts on soil microbial communities and related ecosystem functions.","[Mariotte, Pierre] Univ Sydney, Ctr Carbon Water & Food, Camden, NSW 2570, Australia; [Mariotte, Pierre] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Robroek, Bjorn J.

Here, we relate the distribution of plant-feeding nematodes with dominant plant species in the field to host specialization and impacts on plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions. Methods We assessed plant-feeding nematodes in soil and roots of six plant species that dominate the vegetation at successional positions along the gradient. In controlled conditions, we determined performance of all plant-feeding nematodes on each plant species and their effects on plant biomass. Results Specialist feeding type nematodes were confined to plant species in either foredunes or landward dunes. Generalist feeding type nematodes were found in highest numbers in the landward dunes. Most tested nematode species decreased root, but not shoot or rhizome biomass. Conclusions Host plant suitability determined occurrence of some plant-feeding nematodes in dunes, but abiotic and biotic soil conditions may play a role as well. Generalist feeding type nematodes were able to reproduce on all plant species. Feeding specialists, which are more protected by plant roots, might prefer host plants in the foredunes for the same reason as their host plants: to escape from natural enemies.","[Brinkman, E.

However, in previous experiments, isotopically labeled amino acids were often added to soils in concentrations that may be higher than those normally available to roots and mycorrhizal hyphae in situ, and these high concentrations could contribute to exaggerated uptake. We used an experimental approach in which we added C-13-labeled and N-15-labeled whole cells to root-ingrowth cores, allowing proteolytic enzymes to release labeled organic nitrogen at a natural rate, as roots and their associated mycorrhizal fungi grew into the cores. We employed this method in four forest types representing a gradient of soil pH, nitrogen mineralization rate, and mycorrhizal type. Intact uptake of organic nitrogen was detected in mycorrhizal roots, and accounted for at least of 1-14 % of labeled nitrogen uptake. Forest types did not differ significantly in the importance of organic uptake. The estimates of organic N uptake made here using C-13-labeled and N-15-labeled whole cells are less than those reported in other temperate forest studies using isotopically labelled amino acids, and likely represent a minimum estimate of organic N-use. The two approaches each have different assumptions, and when used in tandem should complement one another and provide upper and lower bounds of organic N use by plants.","[Vadeboncoeur, Matthew A.; Ouimette, Andrew P.; Hobbie, Erik A.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Vadeboncoeur, MA (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, 8 Coll Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Matt.Vad@unh.edu,"Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/J-6918-2019","Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708",Switzer Environmental Fellowship; UNH Dissertation Year Fellowship; NRESS graduate program; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0614266],"We thank R.

An imbalance between root demand and shoot production of carbohydrates may contribute to the degradation of abandoned coppices. Our understanding of root respiration is limited, particularly in root-resprouting species with many stems and a large system of interconnected roots resulting from long-term coppicing. We tested the hypothesis that clone size influences the internal flux of CO2 dissolved in xylem sap (F (T)) from roots into the stem and soil CO2 efflux (F (S)) as indicators of root respiration. We predicted that large clones would exhibit higher F (T) per stem and F (S) than small clones due to larger root system per stem in large clones. Genetic analyses were performed to elucidate clonal grouping. F (T) was measured continuously for 100 days in 16 similar-sized stems of Quercus pyrenaica belonging to two large and two small clones. F (S) was measured in 20 clones of varying size. F (T) per stem and F (S) were higher in large clones. F (T) was 2 % of the root-respired CO2 that diffused through soil to the atmosphere. Relative to other studies, the contribution of F (T) to root respiration was very low, pointing to large differences depending on species or site. Higher stem F (T) and F (S) in large clones compared with small clones suggest greater carbon consumption by roots in large clones, pointing to a root/shoot biomass and physiological imbalance resulting from long-term coppicing that would partially explain the degradation of currently abandoned stands of Q. pyrenaica.","[Salomon, Roberto; Valbuena-Carabana, Maria; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus; Gil, Luis; Gonzalez-Doncel, Ines] Tech Univ Madrid, Forest Genet & Ecophysiol Res Grp, ETS Forestry Engn, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Aubrey, Doug] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Aubrey, Doug; McGuire, MaryAnne; Teskey, Robert] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Salomon, R (reprint author), Tech Univ Madrid, Forest Genet & Ecophysiol Res Grp, ETS Forestry Engn, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",maria.valbuena@upm.es; roberto.salomon@upm.es; jesus.rcalcerrada@upm.es; daubrey@georgiasouthern.edu; maryanne.mcguire@uga.edu; rteskey@uga.edu; luis.gil@upm.es; ines.gdoncel@upm.es,"McGuire, Mary Anne/A-8089-2008; Salomon, Roberto/E-8530-2010; Valbuena-Carabana, Maria/V-2104-2017; Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014; RODRIGUEZ CALCERRADA, JESUS/P-6716-2014","McGuire, Mary Anne/0000-0002-9629-524X; Salomon, Roberto/0000-0003-2674-1731; Valbuena-Carabana, Maria/0000-0002-4321-2711; Gil, Luis/0000-0002-5252-2607; RODRIGUEZ CALCERRADA, JESUS/0000-0001-7408-7653",CAM [P2009/AMB-1668]; OAPN [Prop23/10]; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"This work was funded by CAM P2009/AMB-1668 project and OAPN Prop23/10 JD/pl contract.

The swidden cycle of cultivation and regrowth creates mosaic landscapes with regrowing fallows of various age interspersed with active fields and patches of mature forest. Quantifying tree biomass in these landscapes is limited by the availability of reliable allometric models, hindering accurate carbon stock estimation and thus quantification of GHG emission associated with land use transitions. We therefore developed new allometric models for the prediction of both above- and below-ground woody biomass in swidden systems based on a destructive harvest of 150 trees in Luang Prabang Province, Laos People's Democratic Republic (PDR). This study is the first to develop allometric models of root biomass for swidden landscapes in this region, which we hypothesised would be a major carbon pool given that resprouting, and associated high root biomass, is a common physiological/morphological trait in regularly disturbed ecosystems. We found that a general model including tree diameter (DBH, cm) and height (H, m) was best for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB, kg) for both resprouts and trees growing from seed (AGB = 1.09 + 0.027D(2)H) though the inclusion of H only resulted in a marginal increase in model performance meaning a DBH-only model is acceptable to use in the absence of height data (AGB = 0.1286DBH(2.134)). Tree height was less important for estimating root biomass, with models including only DBH performing best. Re-sprouting trees exhibited greater root biomass (BGB = 0.355DBH(1.732)) compared to those growing from seed (0.016DBH(2.597)) meaning different root allometric models were developed for each tree type. Thus, we suggest that field efforts should be directed towards checking resprouting status over the estimation of tree height. We also found that models fit using non-linear regression provided equally good fits to the data compared to the traditional approach of log-transforming the data. Our models were subsequently applied to 12 nearby plots spanning a chronosequence of fallows to examine the impact of re-sprouting allometry on biomass estimation. Root biomass stocks were on average 58% higher after accounting for the allometry of resprouting trees, resulting in an average 9% increase in total biomass stocks, highlighting the importance of choosing root allometrics based on growth form in swidden fallows. If re-sprouting status is unknown, a stand-level root:shoot ratio of 0.32 can be applied. Our analysis suggests that using our models will substantially improve the accuracy of estimates of tree biomass and its distribution among different pools in swidden fallows. This information is crucial in better quantifying carbon stock changes resulting from the conversion of swidden land to other land uses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The methodology included a forest inventory in nine randomly assigned plots and the destructive sampling of G. sepium 32 trees, measuring for each tree the diameter at breast height (DBH), stem height, total tree height, branch weight, leaf weight and coarse root weight. In addition, we measured grass biomass, collected litterfall and collected soil samples at depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm in the plots. A logarithmic model was developed to quantify the above- and below-ground tree biomass. The soil organic matter was determined by the dry combustion method. The total carbon stored in the CFSLF was 119.82 Mg C ha(-1), with the G. sepium trees contributing 5.7 % of the total C (6.48 Mg C ha(-1)). The CFSGM stored 113.34 Mg C ha(-1). The grass biomass stored 15.32 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the CFSGM and 15.68 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in the CFSLF, and the litterfall in the CFSLF stored 0.205 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1).

The soil coring method can accurately assess fine root biomass and necromass, but the concurrent growth, death and decomposition processes were not reasonably assessed during the sampling period, leading to greatly biased rate estimates. We developed a dynamic-flow method with two variations to address these processes by combining the soil coring method with an improved decomposition experiment. For a certain interval i (1 <= i) in the growing season, the dead fine roots were classified into fine roots dying before the start of interval i (G(l-i)) and those dying during interval i (G(ll-i) ). The decompositions of G(l-i) and G(ll-i) were separately quantified and integrated into a modified mass balance model to estimate the production, mortality and decomposition. An example study conducted in a secondary Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour) forest showed that fine root production, mortality and decomposition were greatly underestimated by conventional soil coring methods failing to address the simultaneous growth, death and decomposition processes but overestimated by the method in which the decompositions of G(l-i) and G(ll-i) were not separately determined and the decomposition rate was assumed to be constant. The dynamic-flow method greatly improved the accuracy of fine root estimates and can be widely applied to forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These in turn immobilise N and reduce its availability to plants as boreal ecosystems develop. Here, we studied a boreal forest ecosystem chronosequence created by new land rising out of the sea due to iso-static rebound along the coast of northern Sweden. We used height over the ocean to estimate ecosystem age and examined its relationship to soil microbial community structure and the gross turnover of N. The youngest soils develop with meadows by the coast, followed by a zone of N2-fixing alder trees, and primary boreal conifer forest on ground up to 560 years old. The young soils in meadows contained little organic matter and microbial biomass per unit area. Nitrogen was turned over at low rates when expressed per area (m(-2)), but specific rates (per gram soil carbon (C)) were the highest found along the transect. In the zone with alder, the amounts of soil C and microbial biomass were much higher (bacterial biomass had doubled and fungal biomass quadrupled). Rates of gross N mineralisation (expressed on an area basis) were highest, but the retention of added labelled NH4+ was lowest in this soil as compared to other ages. The alder zone also had the largest extractable pools of inorganic N in soil and highest N % in plant foliage. In the older conifer forest ecosystems the amounts of soil C and N, as well as biomass of both bacteria and fungi increased. Data on organic matter C-14 suggested that the largest input of recently fixed plant C occurred in the younger coniferous forest ecosystems. With increasing ecosystem age, the ratio of microbial C to total soil C was constant, whereas the ratio of microbial N to total soil N increased and gross N mineralization declined. Simultaneously, plant foliar N % decreased and the natural abundance of N-15 in the soil increased. More specifically, the difference in delta N-15 between plant foliage and soil increased, which is related to relatively greater retention of N-15 relative to N-14 by ECM fungi as N is taken up from the soil and some N is transferred to the plant host. In the conifer forest, where these changes were greatest, we found increased fungal biomass in the F- and H-horizons of the mor-layer, in which ECM fungi are known to dominate (the uppermost horizon with litter and moss is dominated by saprotrophic fungi). Hence, we propose that the decreasing availability of N to the plants and the subsequent decline in plant production in ageing boreal forests is linked to high tree belowground C allocation to ECM fungi, a strong microbial sink for available soil N.

Therefore, accurate determination of the composition and quantity of these compounds is of importance. A continuous trapping system (CTS) with XAD-4 macroporous resin is widely used for collecting root exudates in hydroponics, and ion exchange resins are used in the separation of root exudates into neutral, acid and basic fractions. Here, we studied the adsorption equilibrium isotherms and dynamic adsorption properties of 27 standard LMWOCs on XAD-4 resin. The adsorption isotherms of most LMWOCs matched the Langmuir isotherm equations. Furthermore, we investigated the adsorption efficiency of the CTS for LMWOCs and the recovery ratios during fractionation by ion exchange resins. The adsorption capacities of the CTS for LMWOCs which are non-polar or having large non-polar moieties were higher. The recovery ratios of most LMWOCs were larger than 80% during fractionation. The overall recovery ratios of LMWOCs were ca. 10, 20, and 30% for sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, respectively. Using this collection method, we present the composition and quantity of root exudates of cucumber (Cumumis sativus L.) at four different growth stages. The major components of root exudates were similar to previous works, whereas the quantities were different. The various collection methods may be the main reason for these differences. Therefore, it is necessary to study the overall recovery ratios when the compositions of root exudates via different collection methods are compared.","[Li, Xun; Dong, Jinlong; Chu, Wenying; Duan, Zengqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Jinlong; Chu, Wenying] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Duan, ZQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zqduan@issas.ac.cn,"Li, Xun/L-4438-2019; Li, Xun/K-2026-2019","Li, Xun/0000-0003-1926-616X; Li, Xun/0000-0003-1926-616X; Dong, Jinlong/0000-0002-7766-4409",National Science and Technology Support Program of China [2014BAD14B04]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science [XDB15030300]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41101272]; State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture,"The authors thank the National Science and Technology Support Program of China (2014BAD14B04), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science (XDB15030300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41101272), and the Outstanding Youth Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture for funding support.",,45,2,2,3,47,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

We aimed to investigate the response of AMF communities to wildfire over different timescales. Primer set AMV4.5NF/AMDGR was used to amplify soil 18S rRNA gene fragments for the 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing platform to examine belowground AMF communities 1 and 11 years following low- and high-intensity wildfires in the Greater Khingan Mountains of China. The majority of AMF sequences detected were annotated as Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae and Acaulosporaceae. Both AMF community composition and alpha-diversity were correlated with herbaceous and shrubby biomass, available phosphorus (AP) and NH4 (+), which were in turn altered by wildfire. AMF community composition, alpha-diversity, and phylogenetic structure were significantly altered 1-year-post-fire. However, AMF communities were indistinguishable from unburned forest soils 11-year-post-fire. Our results indicated that AMF communities are resilient to wildfire on decadal timescales. This resilience appears to depend on the post-fire regrowth of understory vegetation and the subsequent recovery of soil chemical properties.","[Xiang, Xingjia; Sun, Ruibo; Chu, Haiyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gibbons, Sean M.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yang, Jian; Kong, Jianjian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Xingjia; Sun, Ruibo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chu, HY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, East Beijing Rd 71, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hychu@issas.ac.cn,"Yang, Jian/L-3415-2016","Gibbons, Sean/0000-0002-8724-7916; Xiang, Xingjia/0000-0003-4410-1789","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010101]; National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954002]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371254, 41071121]; EPA STAR Graduate FellowshipUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5T-32EB-00941]","We thank Wenhua Cai, Zhihua Liu, Weili Liu and Lei Fang for assistance in sampling.

Uncertainties still exist regarding the degree of segmentation and the role of stomatal regulation in keeping hydraulic integrity of organs at different hierarchies. In the present study, we measured hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability in stems, compound leaf petioles and leaflet laminas of Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. and Juglans mandshurica Maxim. growing in Changbai Mountain of Northeast China to identify the main locality where hydraulic segmentation occurs along the shoot water transport pathway. Stomatal conductance in response to leaf water potential change was also measured to investigate the role of stomatal regulation in avoiding extensive transpiration-induced embolism. No major contrasts were found between stems and compound leaf petioles in either hydraulic conductivity or vulnerability to drought-induced embolism, whereas a large difference in hydraulic vulnerability exists between compound leaf petioles and leaflet laminas. Furthermore, in contrast to the relatively large safety margins in stems (4.13 and 2.04 MPa) and compound leaf petioles (1.33 and 1.93 MPa), leaflet lamina hydraulic systems have substantially smaller or even negative safety margins (-0.17 and 0.47 MPa) in F. mandshurica and J. mandshurica. Under unstressed water conditions, gas exchange may be better optimized by allowing leaflet vascular system function with small safety margins. In the meantime, hydraulic safety of compound leaf petioles and stems are guaranteed by their large safety margins. In facing severe drought stress, larger safety margins in stems than in compound leaf petioles would allow plants to minimize the risk of catastrophic embolism in stems by sacrificing the whole compound leaves. A strong coordination between hydraulic and stomatal regulation appears to play a critical role in balancing the competing efficiency and safety requirements for xylem water transport and use in plants.","[Liu, Yan-Yan; Song, Jia; Wang, Miao; Li, Na; Niu, Cun-Yang; Hao, Guang-You] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yan-Yan; Song, Jia; Niu, Cun-Yang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Hao, GY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China.",haogy@iae.ac.cn,,,Hundred-Talents Program from the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences,This work was supported by the Hundred-Talents Program from the Chinese Academy of Sciences awarded to G.-Y.H.,,77,8,10,1,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,2015,35,12,,,,,1333,1342,,10.1093/treephys/tpv061,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,DB3VE,WOS:000368440100006,26209618,,,,10/31/19J,"Lam, TY; Li, X; Kim, RH; Lee, KH; Son, YM",,,,"Lam, Tzeng Yih; Li, Xiaodong; Kim, Rae Hyun; Lee, Kyeong Hak; Son, Yeong Mo",,,Bayesian meta-analysis of regional biomass factors for Quercus mongolica forests in South Korea,JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Uncertainty analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Bayesian hierarchical model; Nesting structure; Biomass estimation,EXPANSION FACTORS; CARBON; STOCK; CHINA,"Indirect approaches to estimation of biomass factors are often applied to measure carbon flux in the forestry sector. An assumption underlying a country-level carbon stock estimate is the representativeness of these factors. Although intensive studies have been conducted to quantify biomass factors, each study typically covers a limited geographic area. The goal of this study was to employ a meta-analysis approach to develop regional biomass factors for Quercus mongolica forests in South Korea. The biomass factors of interest were biomass conversion and expansion factor (BCEF), biomass expansion factor (BEF) and root-to-shoot ratio (RSR). Our objectives were to select probability density functions (PDFs) that best fitted the three biomass factors and to quantify their means and uncertainties. A total of 12 scientific publications were selected as data sources based on a set of criteria. From these publications we chose 52 study sites spread out across South Korea. The statistical model for the meta-analysis was a multilevel model with publication (data source) as the nesting factor specified under the Bayesian framework. Gamma, Log-normal and Weibull PDFs were evaluated. The Log-normal PDF yielded the best quantitative and qualitative fit for the three biomass factors. However, a poor fit of the PDF to the long right tail of observed BEF and RSR distributions was apparent. The median posterior estimates for means and 95 % credible intervals for BCEF, BEF and RSR across all 12 publications were 1.016 (0.800-1.299), 1.414 (1.304-1.560) and 0.260 (0.200-0.335), respectively.

Four N treatment levels-control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) a(-1))-were applied monthly in the P. amarus plantation starting in November 2007. In June 2012, we collected intact soil cores in the bamboo plantation and conducted a 30-day laboratory incubation experiment. The results showed that the soil N net mineralization rate was 0.96 +/- A 0.10 mg N kg(-1) day(-1), under control treatment. N additions stimulated the soil N net mineralization, and the high-N treatment significantly increased the soil N net mineralization rate compared with the control. Moreover, the soil N net mineralization rate was significantly and positively correlated with the fine root biomass, the soil microbial biomass nitrogen content and the soil initial inorganic N content, respectively, whereas it was negatively correlated with the soil pH value. There were no significant relationships between the soil N net mineralization rate and the soil total nitrogen (TN) content and the soil total organic carbon content and the soil C/N ratio and the soil microbial biomass carbon content, respectively. These results suggest that N additions would improve the mineral N availability in the topsoil of the P. amarus plantation through the effects of N additions on soil chemical and physical characteristics and fine-root biomass.","[Xiao, Yin-long; Tu, Li-hua; Chen, Gang; Peng, Yong; Hu, Hong-ling; Hu, Ting-xing] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Li] Sichuan Agr Univ, Personnel Dept, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Tu, LH (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",iamtlh@163.com,,,National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31300522]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20125103120018],This study was funded by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 31300522) and Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No. 20125103120018).,,59,3,5,7,84,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV,HARBIN,"NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-662X,1993-0607,,J FORESTRY RES,J.

Predicting current and future levels of plant drought stress is important not only at the local scale, but also at larger, landscape to regional, scales, because these are the management scales at which adaptation and mitigation strategies are implemented. To obtain reliable predictions of soil moisture and plant drought stress over large extents, water balance models need to be complemented with detailed information about the spatial variation of vegetation and soil attributes. We designed, calibrated and validated a water balance model that produces annual estimates of drought intensity and duration for all plant cohorts in a forest stand. Taking Catalonia (NE Spain) as a case study, we coupled this model with plot records from two Spanish forest inventories in which species identity, diameter and height of plant cohorts were available. Leaf area index of each plant cohort was estimated from basal area using species-specific relationships. Vertical root distribution for each species in each forest plot was estimated by determining the distribution that maximized transpiration in the model, given average climatic conditions, soil attributes and stand density. We determined recent trends (period 1980-2010) in drought stress for the main tree species in Catalonia; where forest growth and densification occurs in many areas as a result of rural abandonment and decrease of forest management. Regional increases in drought stress were detected for most tree species, although we found high variation in stress changes among individual forest plots. Moreover, predicted trends in tree drought stress were mainly due to changes in leaf area occurred between the two forest inventories rather than to climatic trends. We conclude that forest structure needs to be explicitly considered in assessments of plant drought stress patterns and trends over large geographic areas, and that forest inventories are useful sources of data provided that reasonably good estimates of soil attributes and root distribution are available. Our approach coupled with recent improvements in forest survey technologies may allow obtaining spatially continuous and precise assessments of drought stress. Further efforts are needed to calibrate drought-related demographic processes before water balance and drought stress estimates can be fully used for the accurate prediction of drought impacts.

The purified EPS revealed prominent functional reactive groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxylic, which correspond to a typical heteropolysaccharide. The EPS are composed primarily of galactose and glucose. Minor components found were rhamnose, glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid. Indeed, from the results of techniques applied in this study, it can be noted that the EPS are species-specific heteropolysaccharide polymers composed of common sugars that are substituted by non-carbohydrate moieties.

Our aim was to use quantitative data from a site in the Northern Great Plains, USA and a semi-quantitative literature search to demonstrate the robustness of soil stability as an indicator of ecosystem functioning. Empirical data included measurements of plant and soil properties along a local livestock grazing gradient to determine whether soil stability (e.g., % water-stable aggregates) explained primary productivity and soil water transport for a mixed-grass prairie site in the Northern Great Plains. We measured: annual net primary productivity (ANPP), elevation, % soil moisture, measures of soil stability, and soil water transport (field-saturated infiltrability and sorptivity) across points spanning a local gradient in livestock grazing intensity (none vs. light to moderate stocking rates; mean distance separating points = 39.9 m [range = 5.2-71.3 m]). Across the sampled gradient, variation in ANPP was best explained by a model with field-saturated infiltrability and % soil moisture. Infiltrability explained slightly more of the variation. We then determined that moderate amounts of variation in infiltrability were explained by ANPP, % soil moisture, and % water-stable aggregates. We determined that most of this variation was explained by ANPP and then soil moisture. Our empirical findings indicate that plant production was correlated with infiltration though we could not determine whether variation in plant production was caused by variation in infiltration or vice versa. We generally failed to show that soil stability (e.g., % water-stable aggregates) was a useful predictor of primary productivity and soil water transport. Our semi-quantitative literature review also indicated that soil stability was not a consistent predictor of either plant production or infiltration. The varying evidence reported here on whether soil stability is a predictor of ecosystem function illustrates the difficulty in identifying an indicator of ecosystem health that (1) is a predictor of ecosystem function across grassland types, (2) is sensitive to rangeland management, and (3) can be easily implemented by non-experts.","[Reinhart, Kurt O.; Petersen, Mark; Vermeire, Lance T.] ARS, USDA, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, Miles City, MT 59301 USA; [Nichols, Kristine A.] ARS, USDA, No Great Plains Res Lab, Mandan, ND 58554 USA","Reinhart, KO (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Ft Keogh Livestock & Range Res Lab, 243 Ft Keogh Rd, Miles City, MT 59301 USA.",kurt.reinhart@ars.usda.gov,,"Vermeire, Lance/0000-0001-9147-0099; Reinhart, Kurt/0000-0002-7985-6738",,,,52,9,9,4,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2015,6,11,,,,,,,238,10.1890/ES15-00056.1,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CZ7WH,WOS:000367310600029,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Quentin, AG; Crous, KY; Barton, CVM; Ellsworth, DS",,,,"Quentin, A.

In contrast, few long-term studies on trees find greater stimulation of photosynthesis in response to elevated [CO2] at warmer compared with cooler temperatures. To test for CO2 x temperature interactions on leaf photosynthesis and whole-plant growth, we planted Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in climate-controlled chambers in the field at the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment research site, and investigated how photosynthetic enhancement changed across a range of seasonal temperatures. Trees were grown in a complete two-way factorial design with two CO2 concentrations (ambient and ambient + 240 ppm) and two temperatures (ambient and ambient + 3 degrees C) for 15 months until they reached similar to 10 m height, after which they were harvested for biomass. There was significant enhancement of photosynthesis and growth with elevated [CO2], with the photosynthetic stimulation varying with season, but there was no significant effect of warming. Photosynthetic enhancement was higher in summer (+46% at 28 degrees C) than in winter (+14% at 20 degrees C). Photosynthetic enhancement as a function of leaf temperature was consistent with theoretical expectations, but was strongly mediated by the intercellular [CO2]/ambient [CO2] (Ci/Ca) ratio across seasons. Total tree biomass after 15 months was 66% larger in elevated CO2 (P = 0.017) with no significant warming effect detected. The fraction of biomass in coarse roots was reduced in warmed trees compared with ambient temperature controls, but there was no evidence of changed biomass allocation patterns in elevated CO2. We conclude that there are strong and consistent elevated CO2 effects on photosynthesis and biomass of E. globulus. It is crucial to consider stomatal conductance under a range of conditions to appraise the interactive effect of [CO2] and temperature on photosynthetic enhancement and subsequent implications for tree growth and forest productivity in future climates.","[Quentin, A.

We ask how large herbivore grazing affects the direction of plant-plant interactions along an environmental gradient in a salt marsh. Location: Grazed (cattle) and ungrazed salt marshes of the Dutch Wadden Sea island Schiermonnikoog. Here, patches of tall plant communities, dominated by the tough, unpalatable species Juncus maritimus Lam., are found alternating with low-statured, intensively grazed plant communities. Methods: Along the inundation gradient, we measured plant species composition and plant species traits (specific leaf area, specific root length, maximum height and abundance) inside and outside J. maritimus patches in grazed and ungrazed areas. In addition, we measured soil structure parameters (bulk density, soil porosity, clay depth), multiple limiting conditions for plant growth (soil salinity, soil redox, plant canopy light interception), plant biomass, presence of herbivores and abundance of soil macro-detritivores. Results: Under grazing, the palatable grasses Elytrigia atherica (Link) Kerguelen and Festuca rubra L. were positively associated with J. maritimus, while shade-intolerant Puccinellia maritima (Huds.) Parl. and Juncus gerardii Loisel. were negatively associated with this species. Furthermore, macro-detritivore presence was higher inside J. maritimus patches. In ungrazed areas E. atherica and F. rubra were negatively associated with J. maritimus, while P. maritima and J. gerardii were rare. In both grazed and ungrazed conditions the directions of species associations were independent of the inundation gradient. Analysis of species traits and abiotic conditions suggested that associational resistance (a facilitation type) was important in grazed areas. In ungrazed areas, light competition was the likely dominant process. Conclusions: The direction of species associations within these salt marsh communities was strongly affected by grazing, not by the underlying stress gradient. Measurement of species traits indicated that plant-plant interactions shifted from competitive to facilitative under grazing. Besides grazing, cross-trophic facilitation of soil disturbing macro-detritivores may play an important - thus far ignored - role in structuring plant communities.","[Howison, Ruth A.; Olff, Han; Steever, Rutger; Smit, Christian] 428 Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Conservat Ecol, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Howison, RA (reprint author), 428 Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Conservat Ecol, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.",ruthhowison@gmail.com; h.olff@rug.nl; rdsteever@live.nl; c.smit@rug.nl,"Olff, Han/A-8516-2008","Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576",,,,65,10,10,5,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, these effects and how they respond to increased nitrogen (N) availability are poorly known. We conducted a 524-day field litterbag experiment to examine the potential non-additive effects of order-based fine root decomposition and their responses to different rates of N addition in a Pinus elliottii (slash pine) plantation in China. The intact fine roots of slash pine trees were hierarchically dissected and split into two groups (lower-order roots (the first and second order roots) and higher-order roots (the third to fifth order roots)). The decomposition of these two root groups was monitored either separately or in 1:1 mixture. The non-additive effects did not occur when the two root groups decomposed in mixture. However, high rate of N addition shifted the root group interactions from additive to synergistic effects through contrasting effects on individual root group (lower-order roots). High rate of N addition retarded the decomposition of lower-order roots more in isolation than in mixture, due to the decreased binding of acid-unhydrolyzable residue to inorganic N ions in mixture. Therefore, we suggest that although stoichiometric heterogeneity holds within the branching hierarchy of fine roots, the tight coupling of N with acid-unhydrolyzable residue of root tissues may limit N use by microdecomposers, and thereby causing the additive effect. Since the mixing effect of order-based root decomposition is affected by N addition, understanding the chemical heterogeneity within fine root systems and their linkage with ambient N availability during decomposition either in isolation or in mixture may facilitate the accurate prediction of root decomposition responses to N loading.","[Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Gao, Wenlong; Yang, Hao; Wang, Huimin; Li, Shenggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Gao, Wenlong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, SG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lisg@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Li, Sheng-Gong/H-5101-2012",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31130009]; National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program [2013BAC03B03],This research is financially supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31130009) and the National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program (No. 2013BAC03B03).

We conducted a meta-analysis using 67 publications, involving 70 native and 55 invasive plant species to assess support for the enhanced mutualism hypothesis, the degraded mutualism hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis that factors other than invasive status (such as plant functional group) better predict AM function following invasion. We used multiple measurements to test these hypotheses: AM fungal colonization, growth responses to AM fungi and AM fungal-mediated shifts in competitive interactions among native and invasive plants. Additionally, we assessed whether invasive plants alter AM associations in native plants and whether native and invasive plants host different AM fungal abundances and communities. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization (%) and average growth responses did not differ between native and invasive plants. However, growth responses () were dampened among invasive plants, and the positive correlation between AM fungal colonization and growth response in native plants was absent in invasive plants. Rather than plant invasive status, plant functional group was a significant explanatory factor; forbs were generally more colonized and exhibited positive growth responses (when grown alone and in competition), whereas grass responses were neutral to negative. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance (measured by percentage colonization, extraradical hyphal and spore densities, as well as neutral lipid fatty acid and glomalin concentrations) did not differ between native and invasive plants, but invasive plants hosted different AM fungal communities in 78% of studies. AM fungal colonization of native plants was lower when grown with, or after, invasive plants, likely due to the prevalence of non-mycorrhizal plants in studies of neighbour and legacy effects.Synthesis. Neither the degraded nor the enhanced mutualism hypothesis was supported, suggesting that invasions do not select for directional shifts in AM associations. Instead, our results indicate that AM fungi are most likely to influence invasion trajectories when native and invasive plants belong to different functional groups.","[Bunn, Rebecca A.] Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Ramsey, Philip W.; Lekberg, Ylva] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59802 USA","Bunn, RA (reprint author), Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll, Dept Environm Sci, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",rebecca.bunn@wwu.edu,,,MPG Ranch,"We are indebted to Laura Aldrich-Wolfe, Pedro Antunes, John Maron, Dean Pearson, Lauren Waller and two anonymous referees for providing excellent comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

The time required for these dynamics to occur is unknown and seldom addressed. Furthermore, no study has assessed plant-soil feedback while characterizing plant pathogen and mutualist root fungal communities in the context of invasion time. We used a plant-soil feedback study and 454 pyrosequencing to investigate pathogen accumulation over 100years on a highly invasive plant in eastern North America that shows localized declines, Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae). We collected soil from five sites representing each of four invasion periods of V.rossicum across Ontario, Canada (old, c.100years; intermediate, 50-60years; young, < 12years; and uninvaded), and grew V.rossicum in these soils in a glasshouse study. Our hypothesis was that plants grown in soils invaded for longer periods of time would experience less positive feedbacks compared to those grown in more recently invaded or uninvaded soils. We collected roots of V.rossicum from the invasion periods and performed 454 pyrosequencing targeting fungi. We hypothesized that the abundance and richness of fungi that are known plant pathogens would be higher in roots from older invasions compared to more recent invasions. Contrasting with our hypothesis, V.rossicum experienced overall growth promotion due to soil biota, regardless of invasion period. Vincetoxicum rossicum roots were colonized by a large number of fungal taxa, including many known plant pathogens or mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, we found no evidence of pathogen accumulation in older invaded sites in terms of species composition, richness or abundance.Synthesis. Our consistent results in the glasshouse and the field highlight the strength of combining high-throughput sequencing data with plant-soil feedback experiments. We showed that the roots of Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) were colonized by many fungal taxa, but found no evidence for changes in plant growth or accumulation of fungal pathogens with longer invasion time. High pathogen loads may not lead to concurrent declines in invasive plants. Plant invasions, as demonstrated by V.rossicum, may be unpredictable in their ability to accumulate pathogens capable of leading to population declines.","[Day, Nicola J.; Dunfield, Kari E.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada","Antunes, PM (reprint author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, 1520 Queen St East, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.",pedro.antunes@algomau.ca,,"Day, Nicola/0000-0002-3135-7585",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; New Zealand Federation of Graduate Women Fellowship; University of Guelph International Graduate Scholarship,"We thank Carleton University, Couchiching Conservancy, the Grand River Conservation Authority, Kawartha Conservation, Lake Simcoe Conservation Authority, Trent University, Toronto Parks and Rouge Park for granting us permission to collect soil and plants.

But how N deposition affects below-ground processes of grasslands is less well known. Here, we evaluated the effects of chronic N amendment at a relatively low rate (20kgha(-1)year(-1)) on root traits (root productivity, root biomass, root/shoot ratio) in Inner Mongolia steppes by rhizotron and ingrowth core and soil monolith techniques at levels of individual species, functional groups and ecosystem. For 8years, N amendment suppressed above-ground net primary production (ANPP), photosynthetic rates and root biomass of forbs, but enhanced ANPP and root biomass of grasses. This led to an overall reduction in below-ground productivity of the grassland by 24-33%, while ANPP remained unchanged. Nitrogen amendment acidified soil and subsequently increased extractable soil manganese (Mn) concentration. Nitrogen amendment increased foliar Mn concentrations in forb, but not grass species, leading to a significant inhibition of photosynthetic rates in forb species.Synthesis. These findings highlight the importance of the differentiating responses of plant functional groups to long-term N deposition and the important consequences of these responses for below-ground productivity and long-term soil C sequestration.","[Bai, Wenming; Tian, Qiuying; Liu, Nana; Li, Linghao; Zhang, Wen-Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dali] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Synth Res Ctr,Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Weixin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Cheng, Weixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Bai, WM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bwming@ibcas.ac.cn; whzhang@ibcas.ac.cn,"Liu, Nana/M-1627-2019; Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012; Zhang, Wen-Hao/B-5805-2009; Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011","Liu, Nana/0000-0001-8745-108X; Zhang, Wen-Hao/0000-0003-2708-2221; Cheng, Weixin/0000-0003-2964-2376","State Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2013CB956304]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370468, 31130008]","We thank G Wang and Y Dong for their help in field and laboratory work.

The soil for the study was collected from a nursery plot and then compacted into PCV pots in eight different bulk density levels ranging from 0.81 to 1.32 g cm(-3). Oak seedlings were cultivated in controlled conditions for 76 days after sowing. The growth and mass parameters of particular seedlings together with the parameters of the assimilation apparatus and roots were measured, taking into account the share of various diameter roots in the root system. For the purpose of the experiment, 120 acorns were sowed, of which 73 seedlings were cultured. An analysis of the growth of the sessile oak seedlings revealed that a change in soil density significantly affected root system development, total height of seedlings and dry mass. It was observed that the dry mass of the root system as well as the area and length of the roots decreased with an increase in soil density. Root system reduction was noted, the size of which determines the proper development of the tree and ensures its stability. Besides a decrease in the root system, an increase in soil compaction also resulted in a reduction in the number of roots of a specified diameter. The first to be affected were the smallest roots, i.e., those with diameters up to 0.2 mm, which are responsible for the uptake of mineral components. It was confirmed that even a slight increase in soil compaction might negatively result in the growth of young seedlings, impeding root system development.","[Kormanek, Mariusz] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Work Mechanizat, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Glab, Tomasz] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Machinery Exploitat Ergon & Prod Proc, PL-31149 Krakow, Poland; [Banach, Jacek] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Dept Genet & Forest Tree Breeding, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Szewczyk, Grzegorz] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest & Wood Utilizat, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland","Kormanek, M (reprint author), Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Work Mechanizat, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",rlkorma@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Kormanek, Mariusz/D-2307-2013","Banach, Jacek/0000-0002-2142-8247","Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [DS-3401/KMPL/2013, DS-3405/ZGNiSzL/2013]",This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education with their 2013 budget for statutory activities (DS-3401/KMPL/2013 and DS-3405/ZGNiSzL/2013).,,70,10,10,3,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,1612-4677,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

However, in contrast to interspecific diversity and composition, very little is known regarding which environmental factors drive the genetic diversity and genetic composition of a single Rhizobium species. Based on chromosomal and plasmid genes, we quantified the genetic diversity and compositional differences of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae genotypes associated with twenty-four different Vicia cracca populations across a wide environmental and geographical range. Long-term soil nitrogen availability had a positive effect on chromosomal and plasmid diversity, whereas salinity had a negative effect on chromosomal diversity. Soil pH and geographic distance were the main factors driving compositional differences among populations. In contrast to differences in chromosomal composition, differences in the symbiotic plasmid composition were primarily related to geographic distance or unmeasured related environmental factors (e.g. host plant genetic differentiation). We propose different hypotheses to explain how long-term soil nitrogen availability affects rhizobial genetic diversity. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that ecological processes that are known to operate at the interspecific level do not necessarily result in the same patterns at the intraspecific level.

Despite increasing knowledge of the problem involved in the build-up of soil-borne pathogens and allelopathy, relatively little is known about tree-derived allelochemicals and their impacts on the soil microbial community and root growth. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine a novel allelochemical cyclic dipeptide in relation to the soil microbial community and phytotoxicity to tree roots in 25-year-old monospecific Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest plantations. We sampled soils and fine roots in situ and quantified soil cyclic dipeptide, microbial and root characteristics along with their correlation analyses. When compared with soil from a plantation established following removal of natural forest vegetation, soil from a replanted plantation contained a greater amount of cyclic dipeptide. Furthermore, increased soil potentially pathogenic fungi and reduced root biomass, root surface area and root length density were observed in the replanted plantations. There were negative relationships among cyclic dipeptide concentration, microbial community composition and root biomass in given plantations. Phospholipid fatty acid profiling showed that the signature lipid biomarkers of soil bacteria and fungi, and soil microbial community structure were affected under cyclic dipeptide application. Soil degradation dynamics indicated that cyclic dipeptide declined rapidly. The results demonstrated that allelochemical cyclic dipeptide not only had direct phytotoxicity to tree roots but also indirectly altered soil microbial community compositions, suggesting that productivity decline of continuous Chinese fir monocultures may be a negative feedback interaction between allelochemical-mediated soil microbial community and root phytotoxicity.

When interactions are less negative, or more positive compared to native plant species, this may increase invasion success, and differences among ranges may cause changes in exotic plant traits. Here, we investigated arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) associated with Triadica sebifera seedlings from populations in native (China) and introduced ranges (US) and with seedlings from US and China species within three co-occurring genera (Liquidambar, Ulmus, Celtis) grown in multiple common gardens in both ranges. No general pattern of higher or lower AM colonization was found in the introduced range for China and US Celtis, Liquidambar, or Ulmus species. However, AM colonization was significantly higher for Triadica than for other genera, particularly in the introduced range, suggesting AM may improve Triadica's invasion success. Triadica AM colonization was higher in US than China gardens, decreased with increasing soil nitrogen in China, but was independent of soil nitrogen in the US. This might reflect a different effect of soil fertility on this mutualism among ranges. Introduced Triadica populations had higher AM colonization than native populations, particularly in US gardens, implying a possible advantage from greater AM association in the introduced range. This is the first field study demonstrating post-introduction changes in mycorrhizal colonization of an invasive species. It indicates that there are ecological and evolutionary components to the effect of positive interactions on plant invasions.","[Yang, Qiang; Wei, Shujuan; Shang, Lei; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Minist Educ Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Carrillo, Juli; Gabler, Christopher A.; Nijjer, Somereet; Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Yang, Q (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Minist Educ Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",siemann@rice.edu,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666","US-NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [2009S1-30]; China NSFNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30930019]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [10JC1400700, 12XD1400500]; Wintermann Research Grant; NSF Graduate ResearchNational Science Foundation (NSF); Ford Foundation; American Association of University Women; Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo; Wray Todd Graduate Research Fellowships; Exchange Program Fund of Doctoral Student under the Fudan Univ.

The objective of this study was to test whether there is any link between the functional groups of both the dominant plant species and soil microbial communities on unreclaimed coal mine spoil heaps of different age located in the Silesian Upland (Poland). At each sampling site the dominant plant species were recorded and characterised based on their Raunkiaer's life form, socio-ecological group and their potential to form mycorrhiza. The functional diversity of the plant-associated microbial communities was assessed using the microbial carbon-utilisation guilds generated using the Biolog method. We observed no differences in the microbial functional diversity, but a gradual increase in the plant functional diversity with the age of the heap. Our results indicate that trees, plants with the potential to form ectomycorrhiza, and deciduous plants strongly affected the carbon-utilisation profiles. The mean proportion of microbe guilds in dominant plant patches accounts for 60 % of the variance while the soil physicochemical parameters explained only 30 % of the variance. This suggest that in post-industrial habitats the biotic features of the soil substratum are more important for the vegetation development than the abiotic parameters.","[Markowicz, Anna; Borymski, Sawomir; Piotrowska-Seget, Zofia] Silesian Univ, Dept Microbiol, PL-40032 Katowice, Poland; [Wozniak, Gabriela] Silesian Univ, Dept Geobot & Nat Protect, PL-40032 Katowice, Poland; [Chmura, Damian] Univ Bielsko Biala, Inst Environm Protect & Engn, PL-43309 Bielsko Biala, Poland","Markowicz, A (reprint author), Silesian Univ, Dept Microbiol, Jagiellonska 28, PL-40032 Katowice, Poland.",anna.markowicz@us.edu.pl; gabriela.wozniak@us.edu.pl; slawomir.borymski@us.edu.pl; zofia.piotrowska-seget@us.edu.pl; dchmura@ath.bielsko.pl,"Chmura, Damian/A-1301-2016; Markowicz, Anna/P-6274-2019","Chmura, Damian/0000-0002-0242-8962; Piotrowska-Seget, Zofia/0000-0002-9039-2268; Wozniak, Gabriela/0000-0003-1936-2880; Markowicz, Anna/0000-0001-7444-8439","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N305 046336]",The study was supported by Grant No. N305 046336 from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,78,8,9,2,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

However, current definitions of cheating do not reliably capture the evolutionary threat that has been a central motivation for the study of cheating. We describe the development of the cheating concept and distill a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating that encapsulates the evolutionary threat posed by cheating, i.e. that cheaters will spread and erode the benefits of mutualism. We then describe experiments required to conclude that cheating is occurring and to quantify fitness conflict more generally. Next, we discuss how our definition and methods can generate comparability and integration of theory and experiments, which are currently divided by their respective prioritisations of fitness consequences and traits. To evaluate the current empirical evidence for cheating, we review the literature on several of the best-studied mutualisms. We find that although there are numerous observations of low-quality partners, there is currently very little support from fitness data that any of these meet our criteria to be considered cheaters. Finally, we highlight future directions for research on conflict in mutualisms, including novel research avenues opened by a relative-fitness-based definition of cheating.","[Jones, Emily I.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jones, Emily I.] Wissenschaftskolleg Zu Berlin, Inst Adv Study, D-14193 Berlin, Germany; [Jones, Emily I.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Afkhami, Michelle E.; Frederickson, Megan E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Akcay, Erol] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bronstein, Judith L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hoeksema, Jason D.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Ness, Joshua H.] Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Pankey, M.

Interactions between above- and belowground organisms may occur either simultaneously or sequentially, and jointly can determine plant responses to future enemies. However, little is known about time-dependency of such aboveground-belowground interactions. We examined how the timing of a 24 h period of aboveground herbivory by Spodoptera exigua (1-8 d prior to later arriving conspecifics) influenced the response of Plantago lanceolata and the performance of later arriving conspecifics. We also examined whether these induced responses were modulated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Funneliformis mosseae. The amount of leaf area consumed by later arriving herbivores decreased with time after induction by early herbivores. Mycorrhizal infection reduced the relative growth rate (RGR) of later arriving herbivores, associated with a reduction in efficiency of conversion of ingested food rather than a reduction in relative consumption rates. In non-mycorrhizal plants, leaf concentrations of the defense compound catalpol showed a linear two-fold increase during the eight days following early herbivory. By contrast, mycorrhizal plants already had elevated levels of leaf catalpol prior to their exposure to early herbivory and did not show any further increase following herbivory. These results indicate that AMF resulted in a systemic induction, rather than priming of these defenses. AMF infection significantly reduced shoot biomass of Plantago lanceolata. We conclude that plant responses to future herbivores are not only influenced by exposure to prior aboveground and belowground organisms, but also by when these prior organisms arrive and interact.","[Wang, Minggang; Bezemer, T.

We reviewed the role of stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and nitrogen (N) in juvenile woody species for spring growth and cold and drought stress tolerance, which are crucial processes for early performance of forest plantations. Plant functional types differed in NSC and N partitioning and allocation to new growth. In general, however, new leaves/shoots were more enriched in remobilized resources than new fine roots. Conifers used less remobilized resources than broadleaf species for fine root growth. New shoots/leaves were mostly comprised of remobilized N (> 60 %) in conifers and broadleaf deciduous species, while broadleaf evergreens relied more on soil N (< 50 % remobilized N). In contrast, few differences among functional groups existed in the contribution of remobilized carbon (C) to new leaves/shoots, which comprised 28-45 % of stored C reflecting the importance of current photosynthesis and distinctions in C and N remobilization physiology. The amount of N remobilized by an organ was positively related to its contribution to seedling N content. However, leaves are priority N sources in evergreens, which remobilized more N than predicted by their contribution to seedling N content. In contrast, roots in broadleaf evergreens and conifers were poor contributors of remobilized N. Under low stress, spring growth has little effect on NSC reserves. However, prolonged and intense photosynthesis depression strongly reduces NSC. In contrast, N reserves usually decline after planting and their replenishment takes longer than for NSC reserves. Strong storage reduction can hinder seedling stress acclimation and survival capacity. Resource storage can be promoted in the nursery by arresting plant growth and supplying resources at a higher rate than seedling growth and maintenance rate. We conclude that the way in which woody plants manage stored resources drives their growth and stress tolerance. However, plant functional types differ in storage physiology, which should be considered in silvicultural management.","[Villar-Salvador, Pedro] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Uscola, Mercedes; Jacobs, Douglass F.] Purdue Univ, Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regenerat Ctr, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Villar-Salvador, P (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain.",pedro.villar@uah.es,"Uscola-Fernandez, Mercedes/J-6970-2016; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/L-1380-2014","Uscola-Fernandez, Mercedes/0000-0002-6922-2889; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/0000-0001-9338-4530; Jacobs, Douglass/0000-0002-5580-2516","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain [AGL2011-24296, CGL2014-53308-P]; Community of MadridComunidad de Madrid [S2013/MAE-2719]; University of Alcala [CCG2014/BIO-004]","This research was supported by funds of Projects AGL2011-24296 (ECOLPIN) and CGL2014-53308-P (SERAVI) of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, Remedinal 3 (S2013/MAE-2719), of the Community of Madrid, and CCG2014/BIO-004 of the University of Alcala.",,147,34,38,11,130,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,1573-5095,,NEW FOREST,New For.,NOV,2015,46,6-May,,,SI,,813,839,,10.1007/s11056-015-9499-z,,,27,Forestry,Forestry,CU1BL,WOS:000363253900011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dyc, C; Covaci, A; Debier, C; Leroy, C; Delcroix, E; Thome, JP; Das, K",,,,"Dyc, Christelle; Covaci, Adrian; Debier, Cathy; Leroy, Celine; Delcroix, Eric; Thome, Jean-Pierre; Das, Krishna",,,Pollutant exposure in green and hawksbill marine turtles from the Caribbean region,REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,French West Indies; Chelonia mydas; Eretmochelys imbricata; Pollutant; Risk assessment,,"Despite their common occurrence in Guadeloupe, little is known about levels and effects of pollutants in free-ranging green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles.

However, their impacts on the more accessible rhizospheric C, which represents a major energy source for soil food webs and an essential factor for C sequestration, are still unclear. Previous studies indicate that earthworms regulate the dynamics of SOC and leaf litter-C by increasing C accessibility to microbiota. However, in the case of labile rhizodeposit-C, microbiota might not require any pre-conditioning by earthworms and may rapidly metabolize most of this root-derived C. Consequently, potential pathways by which earthworms may affect the fate of rhizodeposit-C would be to regulate the biomass and/or activity of rhizosphere microbiota and, further, to mineralize/stabilize microbial products. A (CO2)-C-13 labelling experiment was performed to determine the impacts of four different earthworm species on the fate of tree rhizodeposit-C in a subtropical soil. We hypothesized that endogeic earthworm species, representing primarily geophagous species, would closely interact with soil microbiota and sequester the microbially metabolized rhizodeposit-C more efficiently than epigeic and anecic earthworm species. We found that irrespective of ecological group affiliation, the three native earthworms did not affect rhizodeposit-C sequestration. In contrast, the exotic endogeic species stimulated the immobilization of rhizodeposit-C in the biomass of root-associated bacteria and/or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and, further, accessed the microbiota-metabolized rhizodeposit-C more efficiently. As a consequence, the exotic endogeic earthworm species transiently tripled rhizodeposit-C retention in soil. We propose that the weak linkages between native earthworms and rhizodeposits-related microbiota limit earthworm impacts on rhizodeposit-C sequestration. However, the exotic endogeic species Pontoscolex corethrurus may potentially alter rhizodeposit-C dynamics in invaded areas by shifting rhizosphere microbial community composition. This work highlights a distinct mechanism by which earthworms can regulate C dynamics and indicates a significant contribution of invasive earthworm species to belowground processes.

We determined the microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) of three different floodplain soils (Eutric Gleysol = GLe, Eutric Fluvisol = FLe, and Mollic Fluvisol = FLm) at the Elbe River, Germany, for 17 months. Flood duration, soil moisture, soil temperature were also monitored, and hot and cold water extractable carbon (C-HWE, C-CWE) were determined. Flood duration seems to have a negative impact on total PLFA biomass which increased in the order GLe < FLe << FLm. All PLFA profiles were dominated by Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) and actinomycetes, respectively, and a low content of fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In the briefly flooded relatively quickly drained soils (FLe and FLm) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were abundant compared to the longer flooded, relatively slow drained soil (GLe). This was also obvious in the significant lowest fungi-bacteria ratio and aerobe-anaerobe ratio of GLe. Non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) as multivariate statistical procedures reveal that FLm could be separated from GLe and FLe probably due to aerobic conditions and available soil organic carbon. The GLe can be discriminated from FLe and FLm mainly due to different flooding durations. The GNB, fungi and AMF were more affected by changes of soil moisture and extractable carbon than the GPB, actinomycetes and anaerobes. We conclude that more stable properties of bulk soil such as the magnitude of soil organic carbon, soil texture, and associated flood duration had a stronger impact on soil microbial community than monthly fluctuations of more dynamic properties, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and C-HWE, C-CWE in our soils.

Soil samples were collected periodically in 2010 and 2011 in three dune areas (herbaceous, shrubby and arboreal) that form an environmental gradient from the beach to the inland tropical rainforest. Fifty AMF species were identified belonging to 18 glomeromycotan genera and 10 families. Several remarkable observations were made: higher AMF spore density was observed in the arboreal dune compared to the shrubby and herbaceous dunes, while the highest number of infective propagules was observed in the herbaceous dune, followed by the shrubby and arboreal dunes. Although AMF species richness and AMF root colonization were similar in all dunes, the Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness indices were higher in the herbaceous dune than in the shrubby and arboreal dunes, which was the opposite in relation to the Simpson dominance index. Thus, surprisingly, the areas closest to the sea had greater diversity compared to the later successional dunes in farer distance from the sea. Funneliformis halonatus was the indicator species of the arboreal dune, Ambispora appendicula, Gigaspora gigantea and Paradentiscutata maritima were the indicator species of the shrubby dune, while two undescribed Cetraspora species and Sclerocystis sinuosa were the indicator species of the herbaceous dune. The study areas can be considered as hotspots for the conservation of diversity of AMF. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains unexplored whether such indirect effects may occur across soil boundaries and connect spatially isolated organisms. Here, we demonstrate that, by changing plant (milkweed Asclepias sp.) traits, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) significantly affect interactions between a herbivore (the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus) and its protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha), which represents an interaction across four biological kingdoms. In our experiment, AMF affected parasite virulence, host resistance and host tolerance to the parasite. These effects were dependent on both the density of AMF and the identity of milkweed species: AMF indirectly increased disease in monarchs reared on some species, while alleviating disease in monarchs reared on other species. The species-specificity was driven largely by the effects of AMF on both plant primary (phosphorus) and secondary (cardenolides; toxins in milkweeds) traits. Our study demonstrates that trait-mediated indirect effects in disease ecology are extensive, such that below-ground interactions between AMF and plant roots can alter host-parasite interactions above ground. In general, soil biota may play an underappreciated role in the ecology of many terrestrial host-parasite systems.","[Tao, Leiling; Gowler, Camden D.; Ahmad, Aamina; de Roode, Jacobus C.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Gowler, Camden D.; Hunter, Mark D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Tao, LL (reprint author), Emory Univ, Dept Biol, 1510 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",ltao@emory.edu,,"Hunter, Mark/0000-0003-3761-8237","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1257160, DEB-1256115]","The work was supported by National Science Foundation grants DEB-1257160 and DEB-1256115 to J.C.d.R. and M.D.H., respectively.",,53,11,11,0,59,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Here, we investigated whether naturally-regenerated mixtures of common North American boreal tree species were more productive and stored more C than single-species stands. We also examined how closely the different C pools and fluxes were interrelated and whether these relationships varied with species composition. Single- and mixed-species stands of trembling aspen, black spruce and jack pine on mesic sites were selected in two regions of the Canadian boreal forest to assess aboveground and belowground productivity and C storage. Although previous studies conducted in these stands found synergistic effects of tree species mixtures on specific C pools and fluxes, such as higher organic layer C stocks and higher fine root productivity in some mixtures, no effects were detected on combined C pools or fluxes at the ecosystem level in the current study. Aspen abundance was linked with higher aboveground tree productivity, higher aboveground living biomass and higher soil heterotrophic respiration, indicating that aspen acts as a key driver of ecosystem C storage and fluxes in these natural forest ecosystems, more so than species richness. However, our results do not rule out the possibility of increased productivity and C storage in mixed stands under environmental conditions or stand developmental stages that are different from the ones studied here. Furthermore, when the entire forest ecosystem is considered (not only tree parts), synergistic effects of tree species mixtures may be more difficult to observe because the beneficial effect of species mixing on one specific C pool may be counterbalanced by a negative effect on another pool.

For all treatments, soils amended with the two phenolic compounds were incubated at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) for 30 days. The responses of soil enzyme activity and microbial property to modelled root exudates to some extent depended on temperature regime, exudation component, and addition concentration. For example, the addition of BHT tended to decrease the soil enzyme activities. However, DBP addition generally increased the two metabolic enzyme activities at 30 degrees C, and tended to decrease the two enzyme activities at 20 degrees C, but a significant reduction was observed only at a high concentration at 20 degrees C.

Based on the measured data of biomass components and stem volume from 100 sample trees of two larch species (Larix gmelinii and L. principis-rupprechtii) in northeastern and northern China, an integrated equation system including individual tree biomass equations, stem volume equation and height-diameter regression model were constructed using the dummy variable model and error-in-variable simultaneous equations. In the system, all the parameters of equations were estimated simultaneously, so that the aboveground biomass equation was compatible to stem volume equation and biomass conversion factor (B-CF) function; the belowground biomass equation was compatible to root-to-shoot ratio (R-SR) function; and stem wood, stem bark, branch and foliage biomass equations were additive to aboveground biomass equation. In addition, the system also ensured the compatibility between one- and two-variable models. The results showed that: (1) whether aboveground biomass equations or belowground biomass equations and stem volume equations, the estimates for larch in northeastern China were greater than those in northern China; (2) B-CF of a larch tree decreased with the growing diameter while R-SR increased with the growing diameter; (3) the proportion of stem wood biomass to aboveground biomass increased with the growing diameter while those of stem bark, branch, and foliage biomass decreased.","State Forestry Adm, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China","Zeng, WS (reprint author), State Forestry Adm, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, 18 Hepingli East St, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China.",zengweisheng@sohu.com,,,State Forestry Administration [2030208]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270697],This work was supported by State Forestry Administration under [grant number 2030208]; and Natural Science Foundation of China under [grant number 31270697].,,40,15,17,3,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii, currently used in the reforestation of Mediterranean regions, may host an ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with the Ascomycetes fungus Tuber melanosporum Vitt. (black truffle). Previous investigations demonstrated that the inoculation of Pinus halepensis seedlings with the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens CECT 844 and T. melanosporum improved plant growth and N absorption, and doubled the rate of mycorrhization of T. melanosporum. In the present work, we studied the morphophysiological response of P. nigra seedlings grown under well-watered conditions in a nursery to the combined inoculation with T. melanosporum and/or P. fluorescens CECT 844. Five months after inoculation, growth parameters (seedling height, basal diameter, and shoot and root dry weight), mycorrhizal colonization, water parameters (osmotic potential at both full and zero turgor and modulus of elasticity), and total contents and concentrations of N, P, and K were measured in the roots and shoots of seedlings, and the root growth potentials was estimated. The addition of P. fluorescens CECT 844 did not significantly improve the mycorrhizal colonization by T. melanosporum on P. nigra seedling roots. Additionally, P. fluorescens inoculation caused few significant improvements in growth and water parameters of seedlings. Moreover, apparently opposing effects on P uptake were observed between the two inoculations. The use of P. fluorescens CECT 844 as a Mycorrhizal Helper Bacterium (MHB) through different mechanisms and in different environmental conditions is discussed.","[Dominguez-Nunez, Jose Alfonso; Medina, Marcelina; Berrocal-Lobo, Marta] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Mt, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Anriquez, Analia; Albanesi, Ada] Nacl Univ Santiago Estero, Fac Agron & Agroind, Santiago Del Estero, Argentina","Dominguez-Nunez, JA (reprint author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Mt, Av Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",josealfonso.dominguez@upm.es,"M, Berrocal-Lobo/B-3482-2018","M, Berrocal-Lobo/0000-0002-4711-9338",PCI-AECID [A/030 952/10],"This work was part of the project A/030 952/10 ""Application of mycorrhizae in sustainable management of silvopastoral systems in the Mediterranean"", PCI-AECID (Program of cooperation between universities and scientific research between Spain and Mediterranean countries, Spanish International Cooperation Agency for Development).",,54,3,3,0,24,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,OCT,2015,8,,,,,,624,630,,10.3832/ifor1334-007,,,7,Forestry,Forestry,CY4VO,WOS:000366407200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Henriksson, N; Tarvainen, L; Lim, H; Tor-Ngern, P; Palmroth, S; Oren, R; Marshall, J; Nasholm, T",,,,"Henriksson, Nils; Tarvainen, Lasse; Lim, Hyungwoo; Tor-Ngern, Pantana; Palmroth, Sari; Oren, Ram; Marshall, John; Nasholm, Torgny",,,Stem compression reversibly reduces phloem transport in Pinus sylvestris trees,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,belowground carbon transport; carbon-13; carbon partitioning; girdling; soil respiration; stem respiration,LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; CARBON ALLOCATION; SOIL RESPIRATION; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TURGOR PRESSURE; EUROPEAN BEECH; FOREST; GROWTH; TRANSLOCATION; TEMPERATURE,"Manipulating tree belowground carbon (C) transport enables investigation of the ecological and physiological roles of tree roots and their associated mycorrhizal fungi, as well as a range of other soil organisms and processes. Girdling remains the most reliable method for manipulating this flux and it has been used in numerous studies. However, girdling is destructive and irreversible. Belowground C transport is mediated by phloem tissue, pressurized through the high osmotic potential resulting from its high content of soluble sugars. We speculated that phloem transport may be reversibly blocked through the application of an external pressure on tree stems. Thus, we here introduce a technique based on compression of the phloem, which interrupts belowground flow of assimilates, but allows trees to recover when the external pressure is removed. Metal clamps were wrapped around the stems and tightened to achieve a pressure theoretically sufficient to collapse the phloem tissue, thereby aiming to block transport. The compression's performance was tested in two field experiments: a C-13 canopy labelling study conducted on small Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees [2-3 m tall, 3-7 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)] and a larger study involving mature pines (similar to 15 m tall, 15-25 cm DBH) where stem respiration, phloem and root carbohydrate contents, and soil CO2 efflux were measured. The compression's effectiveness was demonstrated by the successful blockage of C-13 transport. Stem compression doubled stem respiration above treatment, reduced soil CO2 efflux by 34% and reduced phloem sucrose content by 50% compared with control trees. Stem respiration and soil CO2 efflux returned to normal within 3 weeks after pressure release, and C-13 labelling revealed recovery of phloem function the following year. Thus, we show that belowground phloem C transport can be reduced by compression, and we also demonstrate that trees recover after treatment, resuming C transport in the phloem.","[Henriksson, Nils; Tarvainen, Lasse; Lim, Hyungwoo; Palmroth, Sari; Oren, Ram; Marshall, John; Nasholm, Torgny] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Tor-Ngern, Pantana] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Palmroth, Sari; Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Marshall, John] Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Nasholm, Torgny] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Nasholm, T (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",torgny.nasholm@slu.se,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; lim, hyungwoo/0000-0001-9457-7203; Tarvainen, Lasse/0000-0003-3032-9440","Kempe Foundations; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences [TC4F, Bio4E]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation SystemsVinnova; Department of Energy-Biological and Environmental Research, Terrestrial Ecosystem Science [DE-SC-0006700-11-ER65189, DE-SC0006967]","This study was supported by The Kempe Foundations, The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (TC4F and Bio4E) and the research councils: The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, The Swedish Research Council and The Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems.

Our objective was to determine if different transplanting techniques, time of year of transplanting, and association with a nurse plant upon transplanting affected the long-term survival (8 years) and vigor of Sclerocactus parviflorus (Clover and Jotter). The 3 transplanting procedures were as follows: (1) cacti excavated, soil removed from roots, roots trimmed, plants placed in shaded open environment for 2 days and then transplanted (modification of conventional procedure); (2) cacti excavated to maintain a root ball and transplanted within 2 hours; and (3) cacti excavated, soil shaken off the roots and transplanted within 2 hours. Mortality was documented every spring and fall for 8 years. Plant vigor was determined in the eighth year by measuring flower and tubercle production. There was no difference in cactus survival among the 3 transplanting techniques, time of year of transplanting, and association with a nurse plant. There was no difference in vigor among the treatments as measured by flower and tubercle production. Three years after transplanting, 97% of the cacti were alive, and after 8 years 84% were alive. Based on this study, transplanting of S. parviflorus with high long-term survival can be done by any of these procedures, at any time of year, and with or without an associated nurse plant.","[Ballard, Richard] Colorado Mesa Univ, Grand Junction, CO 81501 USA; [Ott, Rick; Novotny, Tim] Colorado Mesa Univ, Comp Sci Math & Stat Dept, Grand Junction, CO 81501 USA; [Lincoln, Anna] Bur Land Management, Grand Junction Field Off, Grand Junction, CO 81506 USA; [Rechel, Eric] Colorado Mesa Univ, Dept Biol, Grand Junction, CO 81501 USA","Rechel, E (reprint author), Colorado Mesa Univ, Dept Biol, 1100 North Ave, Grand Junction, CO 81501 USA.",rechel@coloradomesa.edu,,,Math Department at Colorado Mesa University; Biology Department at Colorado Mesa University; Bureau of Land Management Grand Junction Field Office; local nonprofit Desert Ecosystem Analysis and Restoration,"We honor the enthusiasm and dedication that Dr. Ballard gave to this study.

In seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti or Rhizobium tropici, we investigated how the developmental stage and a short drought influenced overall biomass and the accumulation of carbon and N in plant tissues. In early developmental stages, the number of nodules and nodule biomass were correlated with total plant biomass and N-15, and nodules and roots contributed 33%-35% of the seedling total N. Seedlings associated with R. tropici fixed more N and exhibited higher overall biomass compared with M. loti seedlings. Four and a half months after inoculation (140 days after inoculation, DAI), a short (15-day) drought inhibited seedling growth and caused a decline in total plant N, with the smallest decline in R. tropici seedlings. After 15 days of drought, i.e., 155 DAI, the nodules had accumulated proline, but the total amino acid concentration did not change. Our results indicate that N-fixation is independent of seedlings growth. In addition, R. tropici is a better choice than M. loti as a symbiont for Leucaena seedlings for forest restoration and agroforestry applications under increasingly drier conditions.","[Pereyra, Gabriela; Hartmann, Henrik; Ziegler, Waldemar; Trumbore, Susan] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Michalzik, Beate] Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Fac Chem & Earth Sci, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Pereyra, G (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",gpereyra@bgc-jena.mpg.de; hhart@bgc-jena.mpg.de; beate.michalzik@uni-jena.de; wziegler@bgc-jena.mpg.de; trumbore@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Hartmann, Henrik/C-5632-2015","Hartmann, Henrik/0000-0002-9926-5484",,,,61,2,2,0,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2015,6,10,,,,,3686,3703,,10.3390/f6103686,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,CV4IQ,WOS:000364230800016,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Ovalle, JF; Arellano, EC; Ginocchio, R",,,,"Ovalle, Juan F.; Arellano, Eduardo C.; Ginocchio, Rosanna",,,Trade-Offs between Drought Survival and Rooting Strategy of Two South American Mediterranean Tree Species: Implications for Dryland Forests Restoration,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,water-acquisition strategies; root architecture; drought tolerance; field survival; dryland restoration,WOODY SEEDLING SURVIVAL; FINE ROOTS; GROWTH-RESPONSES; WATER RELATIONS; ESTABLISHMENT; DEEP; PERFORMANCE; PLASTICITY; REGENERATION; TOLERANCE,"Differences in water-acquisition strategies of tree root systems can determine the capacity to survive under severe drought. We evaluate the effects of field water shortage on early survival, growth and root morphological variables of two South American Mediterranean tree species with different rooting strategies during two growing seasons. One year-old Quillaja saponaria ( deep- rooted) and Cryptocarya alba ( shallow- rooted) seedlings were established under two watering treatments ( 2 L . week- 1 . plant- 1 and no water) in a complete randomized design. Watering improved the final survival of both species, but the increase was only significantly higher for the shallow- rooted species. The survival rates of deep- and shallow- rooted species was 100% and 71% with watering treatment, and 96% and 10% for the unwatered treatment, respectively. Root morphological variables of deep- rooted species such as surface area, volume, and diameter were higher under unwatered treatment. On the other hand, shallow- rooted species had a higher total root dry mass, length, surface area with watering treatments. Our findings suggest that deep- rooted species are highly recommended for reforestation in dry conditions, even under low soil water availability.

Identifying the environmental filters that exert selective pressures on specific riparian vegetation guilds is a critical step in setting baseline expectations for how riparian vegetation may respond to environmental conditions anticipated under future global change scenarios. In this study, we ask: (1) What riparian plant guilds exist across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins? (2) What environmental filters shape riparian guild distributions? (3) How does resource partitioning among guilds influence guild distributions and co-occurrence? Woody species composition was measured at 703 stream reaches and each species' morphological and functional attributes were extracted from a database in four categories: (1) life form, (2) persistence and growth, (3) reproduction, and (4) resource use. We clustered species into guilds by morphological characteristics and attributes related to environmental tolerances, modeling these guilds' distributions as a function of environmental filters-regional climate, watershed hydrogeomorphic characteristics, and stream channel form-and guild coexistence. We identified five guilds: (1) a tall, deeply rooted, long-lived, evergreen tree guild, (2) a xeric, disturbance tolerant shrub guild, (3) a hydrophytic, thicket-forming shrub guild, (4) a low-statured, shade-tolerant, understory shrub guild, and (5) a flood tolerant, mesoriparian shrub guild. Guilds were most strongly discriminated by species' rooting depth, canopy height and potential to resprout and grow following biomass-removing disturbance (e.g., flooding, fire). Hydro-climatic variables, including precipitation, watershed area, water table depth, and channel form attributes reflective of hydrologic regime, were predictors of guilds whose life history strategies had affinity or aversion to flooding, drought, and fluvial disturbance. Biotic interactions excluded guilds with divergent life history strategies and/or allowed for the co-occurrence of guilds that partition resources differently in the same environment. We conclude that the riparian guild framework provides insight into how disturbance and bioclimatic gradients shape riparian functional plant diversity across heterogeneous landscapes. Multiple environmental filters should be considered when the riparian response guild framework is to be used as a decision-support tool framework across large spatial extents.","[Hough-Snee, Nate; Laub, Brian G.; Long, A.

This study used a comprehensive approach to analyze C sequestration that included the main C compartments in forests, i.e., litterfall, fine roots, and aboveground woody biomass. We aimed at modeling each of them in response to an array of environmental drivers to untangle the functioning of C sequestration by compartment. The study was conducted in a Central European riparian forest that is part of the Donau-Auen National Park in Austria. Carbon sequestration by compartment was correlated with environmental parameters (climate, stream flow, hydrological, spatial, and forest stand parameters) using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), and the correlations were prioritized by hierarchical partitioning. Our results suggest divergent responses of C sequestration in different ecosystem compartments under dry and wet soil conditions. In particular, dry conditions led to significantly higher C sequestration in aboveground woody biomass (larger distance to the low groundwater table), whereas wetter conditions fostered C sequestration in fine-root (smaller magnitude of fluctuation in the groundwater table) and leaf biomass (smaller distance to the low groundwater table). Fine roots and litterfall responded to short-term variations in climate (mean annual temperature) and flooding parameters (duration of the low to mean Danube River water level in the previous dormant season), highlighting the pivotal role of the dynamic fine-root and leaf biomass compartments for C uptake in forest ecosystems. Consequently, litterfall and fine roots should be considered to improve the sensitivity of C sequestration model responses to climate scenarios.","[Rieger, I.; Kowarik, I.; Cierjacks, A.] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Rieger, I.; Kowarik, I.; Cierjacks, A.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Rieger, I.; Cierjacks, A.] Univ Hamburg, Bioctr Klein Flottbek, Biodivers Useful Plants, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany","Rieger, I (reprint author), Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, Rothenburgstr 12, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",isaak.rieger@tu-berlin.de,"Cierjacks, Arne/C-8629-2011","Cierjacks, Arne/0000-0002-1536-8153",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CI 175/1],"This study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, grant number CI 175/1) and was part of the project ""Carbon dynamics in soil and vegetation of riparian forests.''

It was the first published work considering site effects on aboveground biomass and first work for predicting root biomass, for this species in this region, where it covers about 310,000 ha. Context Eucalyptus globulus is a species of great economic relevance, being increasingly used for bioenergy. In Galicia (NW Spain), where most of the E. globulus in the country is growing, there are scarce studies modeling aboveground biomass fractions of that species, together with a lack of information on its belowground biomass. Aims The objective of this study was to develop new and more accurate allometries for predicting E. globulus tree aboveground biomass fractions and coarse belowground biomass in NW Spain. Methods Aboveground biomass models were calibrated by two approaches: nonlinear seemingly unrelated regressions (NSUR), using tree and stand variables, and nonlinear mixed effects (nlme) equations adding the site factor effect. Validation was made with an independent dataset (85 trees). Belowground biomass equations were constructed for planted and coppiced trees. Results Crown length and dominant height substantially improved the precision in leaf and branch biomass estimation (NSUR). An added value of our study was the modeling of root/shoot ratio, as a function of diameter of planted and coppiced trees, for first time in this species. Conclusion This study confirms the importance of site and stand stage to explain aboveground biomass variability. Although different belowground biomass accumulation patterns were observed for planted and coppice trees, aboveground biomass equations were common.","[Vega-Nieva, Daniel J.] Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Fac Forest Sci, Durango 34120, Dgo, Mexico; [Valero, Enrique; Picos, Juan] Univ Vigo, Fac Forest Engn, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Jimenez, Enrique] Conselleria Medio Rural & Mar, Ctr Invest Forestales Lourizan, Govt Of Galicia, A Coruna, Spain","Vega-Nieva, DJ (reprint author), Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Fac Forest Sci, Rio Papaloapan & Blvd Durango S-N Col Valle Sur, Durango 34120, Dgo, Mexico.",DanielJVN@gmail.com,"Picos, Juan/L-2037-2017","Picos, Juan/0000-0002-2069-8501",CATEDRA ENCE from pulp and energy company ENCE,Financial support from CATEDRA ENCE from the pulp and energy company ENCE is acknowledged for the current study.,,49,6,7,1,26,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

We analysed the effect of DSE strains on P uptake by Trifolium repens in the presence or absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Phosphatases were observed both in the absence of the host plant and the organic resource, showing that the P mineralization process is not induced by the enzyme substrate or the host. DSE were more efficient at mineralizing organic P. Independently of the presence of AMF, DSE increased the pool of P in the soil, with significant differences being found in P levels among the different DSE. In contrast, plant P uptake was increased by AMP. The P content of plants increased with the co-inoculation of AMF and P. turiciensis or P. piceae. We hypothesize a close relationship between DSE and AMP in relation to P availability and uptake in plants. Whereas DSE increase the pool of P in the rhizosphere, AMP are responsible for P transfer to the host, with co-colonization of plants by DSE and AMP showing a synergistic outcome.

The fungi co-inhabiting Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizae (ECM) of Allies balsamea, Betula papyrifera and Picea glauca were studied at two boreal forest sites in Eastern Canada by direct PCR of ITS rDNA. 50 non-Cenococcum fungal sequence types were detected, including several potentially mycorrhizal species as well as fungal root endophytes. Non-melanized ascomycetes dominated, in contrast to the dark septate endophytes (DSE) reported in most culture dependent studies. The results demonstrate significant differences in root associated fungal assemblages among the host species studied. Fungal diversity was also host dependent, with P. glauca roots supporting a more diverse community than A. balsamea. Differences in root associated fungal communities may well influence ecological interactions among host plant species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

This study summarizes results from experiments to quantify the effect of above ground and below ground vegetation biomass on vehicle performance. Soil-vegetation combinations of three soils and three grasses were used. The vegetation was tested at various growth stages and was also subjected to stressors such as trafficking, burning, and cutting. Vegetation measurements included above ground (leaves and shoots) and below ground (root) biomass weights, lengths, diameters and surface area parameters. The soils were characterized for size distribution, moisture, density and terrain strength for each test condition. Vehicle traction and motion resistance were measured for each soil grass combination using the CRREL Instrumented Vehicle. Results showed an increase in net traction biomass in sandy soils. For clay soils above ground biomass generally increased resistance while increased root diameter clearly decreased resistance. This study represents the first measurements quantifying the impacts of specific biomass parameters on vehicle mobility. The results will serve to guide new experimental methods, improve datasets, and develop physics-based models for years to come. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of ISTVS.","[Shoop, S.

However, the horizontal cross angle (x) of root orientation intersecting a survey line considerably impacts the amplitude area (A) reflected from a root and impairs the accuracy of GPR-based root quantification. Prediction of A(90A degrees) (the value of A scanning at x = 90A degrees) from multiple A(x) measurements could correct such impact. Previous method of A(90A degrees) prediction focused on target roots at field point scale. The aim of this study is to develop a method to predict A(90A degrees) at field plot scale. A(90A degrees) was predicted by a pair of A(x) measured at two arbitrary scanning lines together with an estimated soil background amplitude area. Three independent datasets were employed to test the proposed method. The field experiment included radar data collected for six roots of Caragana microphylla in a sandy-clay soil at four cross angles (30A degrees, 45A degrees, 60A degrees, and 90A degrees). The sand box experiment included radar data for 12 dowels at 13 cross angles (0A degrees to 180A degrees, in 15A degrees steps). The simulation experiment included A(x) of 46 simulated roots at 13 cross angles (0A degrees to 180A degrees, in 15A degrees steps). For all experiments, A(90A degrees) was accurately estimated. Root orientation could also be determined. After correcting the impact of cross angle, the accuracy of root diameter estimation improved. Correlation coefficient between actual and estimated root diameters increased from 0.77 to 0.81, with RMSE declining from 9.53 to 7.05 mm. A method of correcting the influence of root orientation on root GPR signal at the field plot scale has been established. This method enhances root quantification using GPR.","[Guo, Li; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Guo, Li; Chen, Jin] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuan; Li, Wentao; Cui, Xihong] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Tanikawa, Toko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Chen, J (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",chenjin@bnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; cui, xihong/E-8735-2015; Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014; Guo, Li/B-7820-2016","Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; Guo, Li/0000-0003-3821-4058; Tanikawa, Toko/0000-0002-6042-8071","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41401378]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2013NT39]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [22380090, 25252027]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41401378) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2013NT39).

We examined how mixed forests alter fine root traits compared to pure forests. A pseudo-experimental tree cluster design was used to select small-area plots of single and mixed species in a Pinus massoniana-Lithocarpus glaber (PM-LG) forest and a L. glaber-Cyclobalanopsis glauca (LG-CG) forest. In each plot, soil cores were sampled down to 30 cm at a 0.5 m interval between target and neighbouring trees. Fine roots in soil cores were then divided by species to determine biomass and morphological traits. The mixed PM-LG plots exhibited significantly higher fine root biomass while the mixed LG-CG plots had no significant differences in fine root biomass compared to their respective pure plots. In pure plots, P. massoniana had higher fine root biomass and lower specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) than L. glaber, whereas fine root traits were similar for L. glaber and C. glauca. Compared with pure plots for a given species, fine root biomass in the entire soil profile decreased for P. massoniana but increased for L. glaber in mixed PM-LG plots. In mixed LG-CG plots, fine root biomass decreased for each species at all soil depths. Whether positive interactions of fine roots occur is dependent on tree species composition. Fine root biomass was greater in mixed forests where tree species showed contrasting growth strategies and root traits, such as PM-LG forests, thus suggesting positive interactions.","[Xiang, Wenhua; Fan, Gangwei; Lei, Pifeng; Zeng, Yelin; Tong, Jie; Fang, Xi; Deng, Xiangwen] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Wenhua; Fan, Gangwei; Lei, Pifeng; Zeng, Yelin; Tong, Jie; Fang, Xi; Deng, Xiangwen; Peng, Changhui] Chinese Fir Plantat Ecosyst Hunan Prov, Huitong Natl Field Stn Sci Observat & Res, Huitong 438107, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Environm Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Xiang, WH (reprint author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiangwh2005@163.com,,"deng, xiang wen/0000-0002-9399-1231","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31170426, 30771720]; New Century Excellent Talents ProgramProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-06-0715]; Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Teams in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31170426 and 30771720), the New Century Excellent Talents Program (NCET-06-0715), and the Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Teams in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province.

Rooting behavior was compared in both unshaded (FS) and shaded (AFS) coffee combined with two previously untested tropical timber species (deciduous Tabebuia rosea Bertol. and evergreen Simarouba glauca DC.). The predominant andisol possesses a compacted soil layer (talpetate). The study was conducted in sub-optimal environmental conditions for coffee cultivation (455 m.a.s.l., annual mean 27 A degrees C, 1300 mm rainfall/year, 6 months dry season) in Nicaragua. Twelve and five trenches 200 cm deep were dug in AFS and FS respectively. Roots per unit area were counted on two perpendicular soil faces. Volumetric water was measured continuously over 2 years by using 45 reflectometers in different soil layers. The talpetate varied greatly in depth, thickness and physical structure. Coffee fine roots were more abundant than tree roots and were concentrated in the shallower strata (0-80 cm) whilst tree roots proliferated more below 100 cm. The S. glauca root system was denser below 100 cm than T. rosea root system. There was no meaningful difference in coffee root counts in FS and under T. rosea, but coffee root counts were higher near S. glauca trees. 2012 and 2014 had mild dry seasons and whole profile soil water content was similar in FS and AFS, but in the 2013 severe dry period volumetric water and water uptake were lower in AFS than in FS. This indicates that the normal advantage of greater soil exploration in AFS was cancelled presumably due to continued water uptake by deep rooting trees whereas the FS still had available water.","[Padovan, M.

Mapping and monitoring of mycorrhizas have untapped potential to inform science, management, conservation and policy regarding distributions, diversity hotspots, dominance and rarity, and indicators of forest changes. Context A dearth of information about fungi at large scales has severely constrained scientific, forest management, fungal conservation and environmental policy efforts worldwide. Nonetheless, fungi fulfil critical functional roles in our changing environments and represent a considerable proportion of terrestrial biodiversity. Mycorrhizal fungi are increasingly viewed as a major functional guild across forest ecosystems, and our ability to study them is expanding rapidly. Aims This study aimed to discuss the potential for starting a mycorrhizal monitoring programme built upon the existing forest monitoring network, raise questions, propose hypotheses and stimulate further discussion. Results An overview of the state-of-the-art regarding forest ectomycorrhizal ecology raises questions and recommendations for scaling up mycorrhizal assessments aimed at informing a variety of stakeholders, with a new focus on conservation and policy. Conclusion Fungal research and conservation are areas that can be informed by ICP Forests and may lead to useful spin-offs; research linked to long-term forest monitoring plots will enhance the relevance of science and conservation.","[Suz, Laura M.; Van der Linde, Sietse; Bidartondo, Martin I.] Kew, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England; [Barsoum, Nadia; Benham, Sue] Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; [Cheffings, Chris] Joint Nat Conservat Comm, Peterborough PE1 1JY, Cambs, England; [Cox, Filipa] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Hackett, Louise] Woodland Trust, Grantham NG31 6LL, England; [Jones, Alan G.] Univ Oxford, Earthwatch, Oxford OX2 7DE, England; [Mueller, Gregory M.] Chicago Bot Garden, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA; [Orme, David] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Seidling, Walter] Thunen Inst Forest Ecosyst, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Van der Linde, Sietse; Bidartondo, Martin I.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England","Suz, LM (reprint author), Kew, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, Surrey, England.",l.martinez-suz@kew.org; Nadia.Barsoum@forestry.gsi.gov.uk; sue.benham@forestry.gsi.gov.uk; Chris.Cheffings@jncc.gov.uk; filipa.cox@manchester.ac.uk; LouiseHackett@woodlandtrust.org.uk; ajones@earthwatch.org.uk; gmueller@chicagobotanic.org; d.orme@imperial.ac.uk; walter.seidling@ti.bund.de; s.van-der-linde@imperial.ac.uk; m.bidartondo@imperial.ac.uk,"Suz, Laura M./W-7565-2019; Forests, ICP/F-7626-2019; Jones, Alan/D-7883-2019","Suz, Laura M./0000-0003-4742-572X; Jones, Alan/0000-0003-3047-3338; Cox, Filipa/0000-0003-1405-7481; van der Linde, Sietse/0000-0002-1255-8963","UK Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council; Imperial College London's Grand Challenges in Ecosystems and the Environment initiative; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowshipEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-PEOPLE-2009-IEF-253036]; NERC case studentshipNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NER/S/A/2006/14012]; NERC grantNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K006339]; Bentham-Moxon Trust; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K006339/1]","The ideas presented in this article were discussed and developed at a workshop supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, Imperial College London's Grand Challenges in Ecosystems and the Environment initiative and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Here we report the effects of warming and nitrogen addition on aboveground insect defoliation and belowground root-knot nematode infection of a native plant and an introduced invasive congener. Warming increased belowground nematode infection only, while nitrogen addition increased both nematodes and defoliation. Defoliation rates were similar for the exotic invasive and native species and the increases with nitrogen addition were large (almost doubled) but comparable. However, roots of native plant were more intensively infected (i.e., knot density) than roots of the exotic invasive plant (similar to 4-fold in ambient conditions) and this difference increased under elevated temperature (similar to 30-fold higher) in which total nematode infection were nearly tenfold higher. Compared to the exotic invasive plant, the native plant had a higher proportion of fine roots and specific leaf area, but lower photosynthesis ability irrespective of warming and nitrogen deposition treatments. The nematode preferred fine roots to coarse roots for both plant species. Our study indicates that above- and below-ground herbivory of plants differ in their sensitivity to varying drivers of environmental change, which may alter plant interactions and makes it difficult to predict future community structure. Together with the dramatic response of belowground nematodes to warming, this suggests that future modeling or experimental studies on species' responses to environmental change should simultaneously consider above- and below-ground communities.","[Lu, Xinmin; Wei, Hui; Shao, Xu; Ding, Jianqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Inst, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Ding, JQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Inst, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lxm3412@wbgcas.cn; dingjianqing@yahoo.com,"Ding, Jianqing/C-2751-2009",,"NSF-ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100302, 31370547]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-Z-1019]; Wuhan Botanical GardenChinese Academy of Sciences [Y455437H05]; CAS Foreign Professorship [O929361H02]; US-NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560]","We thank Fang Chen, Minyan He, Mingxun Ren, Jialiang Zhang, and Sunliang Feng for assistance and Richard Mack for comments and edits.

A high growth rate and the broadly applicable timber as raw material for different types of products made of wood make poplar attractive for industrial usage. Despite the positive aspect of its growth capacity and wood composition, one major problem in cultivating fast-growing tree species in a forestry plantation system is the comparably high water demand of the plants. In this context, a rapid development of an efficient adventitious root system from dormant hardwood cuttings is an essential requirement for the successful establishment of short-rotation cultures. It reduces the establishment costs of plantations, and the developing plant can be transferred into favourable conditions due to varying environmental conditions. Results of greenhouse pot and soil-column experiments on the development of shoots and adventitious roots from hardwood cuttings of seven hybrid poplar cultivars and the reaction of the plants performance on varying water availability will be presented. We estimated root and shoot length, root and shoot growth and biomass accumulation over time, root-to-shoot length ratio, and root morphological traits.","[Krabel, Doris; Meyer, Matthias; Solger, Alexander; Mueller, Rosi] Tech Univ Dresden, Mol Physiol Woody Plants Grp, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [Carvalho, Pedro; Foulkes, John] Univ Nottingham, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England","Krabel, D (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Mol Physiol Woody Plants Grp, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany.",krabel@forst.tu-dresden.de,,"Foulkes, John/0000-0002-7765-8340",German Agency for Renewable Resources; German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture project FastWOOD II [22002911]; European Plant Phenotyping Network (EPPN) - FP7 Research Infrastructures Programme of the European Union [284443],"We thank our students Frauke Czech, Silva Herzog, Vivien Kiessling, Birgit Reiche, and Marie Weigandt for supporting our work in the laboratory and in the greenhouse.

Almost 400 Acacia species have been introduced outside their native ranges in Australia; approximately 6% have become invasive, 12% are naturalized, and 82% have no record of naturalization or invasion. This variation in invasiveness provides a comparative framework in which to examine mechanisms that either promote or constrain establishment and colonization of species in novel regions. Here, we experimentally examine the role that the legume-rhizobia symbiosis plays in the differential invasiveness of acacias introduced outside their native Australian ranges. LocationCanberra, Australia. MethodsWe paired 12 Acacia species ranging in invasiveness globally with 12 rhizobial strains ranging in average symbiotic effectiveness. We measured plant growth and nodulation success and abundance to assess whether invasive acacias were more promiscuous hosts, that is had positive growth and nodulation responses to a broader range of rhizobial strains than naturalized and non-invasive species. ResultsInvasive acacias had a higher growth response across more rhizobial strains (six of 12 strains) than naturalized and non-invasive species, but invasiveness categories differed only moderately with regard to the percentage of plants with nodules and nodulation abundance. Main conclusionWith respect to plant growth, invasive acacias appear to be more promiscuous hosts than naturalized and non-invasive Australian Acacia species. Plant growth response to nodulation, however, is likely more important than nodulation alone in the successful invasion of species in novel ranges. Results from this study help elucidate an important mechanism in the invasive capacity of legumes.","[Klock, Metha M.; Harms, Kyle E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO, Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Klock, MM (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mklock1@tigers.lsu.edu,"Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731",Louisiana Board of Regents EPSCoR grant; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1311290],"We thank Mohammad S.

However, the effects of changes in beneficial endosymbionts in plants are poorly known (except for mycorrhizal and rhizobial associations). We sampled and compared endophytes from hundreds of trees belonging to the economically important genus Hevea, the source of natural rubber, in their native range in the Amazon basin and in plantations. We also conducted antagonism tests to determine the potential effects that some of these endophytes may have on selected plant pathogenic fungi. The natural and indigenous endosymbiotic mycota of the rubber tree (Hevea) contains a high diversity of beneficial fungi that may protect against pathogens (protective mutualism). In contrast, plantation trees have a reduced and different diversity of these beneficial fungi. We propose that abundance, and not just presence, of competitive fungal strains and species (i.e., Trichoderma and Tolypocladium) create a protective effect against pathogens in wild trees. This study provides support for the importance of mutualistic endosymbionts in plant health and ecosystem resilience, and calls for awareness of their potential loss by human-related activities.

In plants, HGT is relatively common, whereas in animals it appears to be quite rare. It is of considerable importance to understand mitochondrial HGT across the major groups of eukaryotes at a genome-wide level, but so far this has been well studied only in plants. In this study, we generated ten new mitochondrial genome sequences and analyzed 40 mitochondrial genomes from the Saccharomycetaceae to assess the magnitude and nature of mitochondrial HGT in yeasts. We provide evidence for extensive, homologous-recombination-mediated, mitochondrial-to-mitochondrial HGT occurring throughout yeast mitochondrial genomes, leading to genomes that are highly chimeric evolutionarily. This HGT has led to substantial intraspecific polymorphism in both sequence content and sequence divergence, which to our knowledge has not been previously documented in any mitochondrial genome. The unexpectedly high frequency of mitochondrial HGT in yeast may be driven by frequent mitochondrial fusion, relatively low mitochondrial substitution rates and pseudohyphal fusion to produce heterokaryons. These findings suggest that mitochondrial HGT may play an important role in genome evolution of a much broader spectrum of eukaryotes than previously appreciated and that there is a critical need to systematically study the frequency, extent, and importance of mitochondrial HGT across eukaryotes.","[Wu, Baojun; Buljic, Adnan; Hao, Weilong] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA","Hao, WL (reprint author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",haow@wayne.edu,"Hao, Weilong/C-4923-2009","Hao, Weilong/0000-0002-6337-7169",Wayne State University,The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments; Jeffrey Palmer and Brian Golding for critically reading the manuscript; the National Center of Agricultural Utilization Research and Matthew Goddard for providing the Torulaspora yeast strains; and Kenneth Wolfe for providing sequence data from T. delbrueckii CBS1146.

Test if in Cistus albidus plants, a summer semi-deciduous species, ammonium (NH4 (+) ) can inhibit NRA, despite the availability of NO3 (-) , and whether Olea europaea plants, evergreen sclerophyll, are more tolerant of NH4 (+) than the former.

Tolerance of NH4 (+) was evaluated using integrative (mortality and biomass accumulation) and plant nitrogen metabolism parameters (in vitro NRA and concentrations of NO3 (-) and NH4 (+)) determined in roots and leaves. C. albidus plants were consistently less NH4 (+) tolerant than O. europaea, displaying: higher mortality; growth and NRA inhibition and NH4 (+) accumulation above 0.2 % NH4NO3-N in the soil.

However, there has been growing evidence that non-monotonic effects of environmental factors and both intra- and inter-specific interactions can significantly influence the dynamics and stability of populations, communities and ecosystems. In this paper, we present a review and synthesis on both theoretical and empirical studies on ecological non-monotonicity. There are various non-monotonic relations observed in populations, communities and ecosystems. The non-monotonic function of per capita population increase rate against intrinsic or extrinsic factors is a significant driving force in determining the complexity and stability of biological systems. There are several mechanisms such as the law of tolerance, adaptive behaviors, or opposing dual or pathway effects which may result in non-monotonic functions. Ecological non-monotonic functions are often closely related to spatial and temporal scale processes which may explain why ecosystems are often highly variable and unpredictable in both space and time. Recognizing ecological non-monotonicity would greatly change our conventional monotonic views on the effects of environmental factors and species interactions on ecosystems. We appeal for more effort to study ecological non-monotonicity and re-think our strategies to manage ecosystems under accelerated global change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, such knowledge is limited. In this study, three common Tibetan forest types, dominated by Abies, Pinus, and Picea species, were sampled across a large altitude gradient (1700-4300 m asl). Vertical depths of SOC and STN in these forests were determined, and their changes with altitude, aspect, and gradient and the associated regulating factors were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Species shift along the altitude gradient has a significant effect on SOC and STN depth patterns, partly inducing the lack of a trend in SOC and STN vertical distributions across the entire altitude range. For an individual genus, the SEM model demonstrated species-dependent altitudinal changes in patterns that were shallower with increased altitude for Abies and Pinus, but no change was detected for Picea. Greater altitudinal increases in SOC and STN stocks in the topsoil relative to the deeper layer were correlated with increased depths for Abies and Pinus. Eastern and southern aspects had a greater proportion of topsoil SOC and STN than western and northern aspects for Abies and Pinus. Gradient had a limited effect on SOC and STN vertical distribution across the three genera. Our results indicate a significant change in SOC and STN depth patterns associated with species change and the topographic effects on these vertical patterns.","[Chang, Ruiying; Wang, Genxu; Fei, Ran; Yang, Yang; Luo, Ji; Fan, Jianrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Environm Evolvement & Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Wang, GX (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Environm Evolvement & Regulat, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",wanggx@imde.ac.cn,,"chang, rui ying/0000-0002-0534-4502",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA01020304]; CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research TeamsChinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-TZ-06]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41301219],"We thank the Associate Editor Darlene Zabowski, and all of the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

This study investigates seasonal soil respiration rates and underlying mechanisms under wetter, warmer, and more fertile conditions in a Mediterranean cork oak forest of Northern Tunisia (Africa), acknowledged as one of the most productive forests in the Mediterranean basin. We applied a soil respiration model based on soil temperature and relative water content and investigated how ecosystem functioning under these favorable conditions affected soil carbon storage through carbon inputs to the soil litter. Annual soil respiration rates varied between 1774 gC m(-2) year(-1) and 2227 gC m(-2) year(-1), which is on the highest range of observations under Mediterranean climate conditions. We attributed this high soil carbon flux as a response to favorable temperatures and soil water content, but this could be sustained only by a small carbon allocation to roots (root/shoot ratio = 0.31-0.41) leading to a large allocation to leaves with a multiannual leaf production, enhanced annual twig elongation (11.5-28.5 cm) with a reduced leaf life span (<1 year) maintaining a low LAI (1.68-1.88) and generating a high litterfall (386-636 gC m(-2) year(-1)). Thus, the favorable climatic and edaphic conditions experienced by these Mediterranean cork oak forests drove high soil respiration fluxes which balanced the high carbon assimilation leading to a relatively small overall contribution (10.96-14.79 kgC m(-2)) to soil carbon storage.","[Zribi, Lobna; Gharbi, Fatma] Inst Natl Rech Genie Rural Eaux & Forets, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Zribi, Lobna; Gharbi, Fatma; Hanchi, Belgacem] Fac Sci Tunis, Dept Biol, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Mouillot, Florent; Ourcival, Jean-Marc] Univ Montpellier 3, UMR 5175, CNRS, EPHE,IRD,CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Mouillot, F (reprint author), Univ Montpellier 3, UMR 5175, CNRS, EPHE,IRD,CEFE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",lobna_zribi@yahoo.fr; florent.mouillot@ird.fr; fatmagharbi@yahoo.com; jean-marc.ourcival@cefe.cnrs.fr; belgacem.hanchi@fst.rnu.tn,"Mouillot, Florent/C-2204-2015","Mouillot, Florent/0000-0002-6548-4830","INRGREF (Tunisia); French Ministry of Foreign Affairs CORUS 2 project ""Changements globaux et vulnerabilite des forets mediterraneennes en Afrique du Nord""","This study was financially supported by INRGREF (Tunisia) and by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs CORUS 2 project ""Changements globaux et vulnerabilite des forets mediterraneennes en Afrique du Nord"".

Such biogeographical comparisons are crucial to better understand the role of invasive species in plant-plant interactions and in the evolution of community organization. Using Solidago canadensis, we conducted field surveys in the native range (North America) and non-native range (Europe) and correlated stem density and aboveground biomass of Solidago with associated plant species richness and diversity indices. We also conducted experiments to compare the competitive and allelopathic impact of Solidago on the growth of species from its native and non-native ranges. In the field, increasing stem density and biomass of Solidago correlated with more significant decreases in total species richness and two diversity indices in Europe than in North America. Solidago strongly suppressed both European species and North American species in competition experiments, but this competitive effect did not differ between species from the different ranges. However, root extracts from Solidago strongly suppressed the root growth of European species as a group, but not North American species as a group. Our results indicate that the biogeographic origin of species can have important effects on plant interactions and community organization.","[Ledger, Kimberly J.; Pal, Robert W.; Murphy, Patrick; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Ledger, Kimberly J.; Pal, Robert W.; Murphy, Patrick; Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pal, Robert W.; Nagy, David U.; Filep, Rita] Univ Pecs, Inst Biol, Fac Sci, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary; [Murphy, Patrick] Hellgate High Sch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Ledger, KJ (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",kjledger6@hotmail.com,"Nagy, David U/N-8697-2019","Nagy, David U/0000-0001-7742-4459",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under REAEuropean Union (EU) [300639]; National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Track-1National Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-1101342],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Here, we test if plant-soil feedbacks act as drivers of secondary succession. We found that the strength of feedback experienced by a plant species was positively correlated with that species' successional stage, indicating that plant-soil feedbacks can contribute to shifts in plant species abundance during succession. We did not observe a significant relationship between strength of feedback and plant species abundance at our study sites, but the positive relationship of feedback and successional stage would generate positive relationships between feedback and the abundance of plant species in communities at equilibrium.

Modeling approaches that seek to address this question are limited in their ability to accurately represent resource competition, which occurs belowground, by the limited detail of existing data on root system structure. Using compressed air, we excavated individual trees and shrubs and mapped their coarse roots on a three-dimensional grid system up to 1.5 m depth. We excavated four woody savanna species at three sites spanning a climate gradient on the Kalahari Transect in southern Africa and determined functions to describe the distribution of root biomass within the root systems. Overall, most of the variation in both large-scale and small-scale characteristics of root system structure was related to species. The species excavated fell into two groups that coexisted across the climate gradient. Acacia mellifera and Terminalia sericea had straight roots in a laterally extensive system that was shallow relative to the aggregate root profile for woody plants at the sites. Boscia albitrunca and Ochna pulchra had sinuous roots that were mostly concentrated beneath the canopy and were more prevalent in deep than near-surface soil layers, departing from the conventional model of decreasing root abundance with depth. Based on our results, we suggest a reframing of the theoretical characterization of the root zone used in modeling approaches to consider diversity within the woody plant community.","[O'Donnell, Frances C.; Caylor, Kelly K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bhattachan, Abinash; D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Dintwe, Kebonye; Okin, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","O'Donnell, FC (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",frances.odonnell@nau.edu,"D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008; Dintwe, Kebonye/P-8938-2019; Okin, Greg/D-3226-2019","D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; Dintwe, Kebonye/0000-0001-5512-2361; O'Donnell, Frances/0000-0002-5886-8270",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0742933],"The authors thank M.

This study aimed to determine the community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in natural and revegetated coastal areas of the so-called 'restingas' on the borderline of the tropical Atlantic Forests and to provide information on the recuperation of the soil mycobiota in recovering environments. Soil samples were collected in two consecutive years at four sites (two natural and two revegetated 'restinga' areas), and the fungal communities were identified. Thirty AMF species were identified. Species of Acaulospora and Glomus prevailed in both areas, and the revegetated areas had a higher species richness than the natural areas. The BIO-ENV analysis did not select any soil characteristics that could affect the AMF communities, but the ANOSIM indicated that the AMF communities differed between the 'restinga' areas (Rglobal = 0.621; p < 0.0001). Because the physicochemical soil factors do not directly influence this relationship, these differences may be due to the biological soil-plant interactions between the areas. Funneliformis halonatus was an indicator of natural 'restinga' areas, but no species was an indicator of the revegetated areas. These areas had a higher species richness, demonstrating that revegetation contributed to the recovery and increased the AMF diversity. The results emphasized the importance of biodiversity inventories in coastal areas subjected to natural and anthropic pressures. These areas have rarely been studied from the point of view of soil microorganisms, and this study highlighted the need for conservation policies.","[Alves da Silva, Danielle Karla; Coutinho, Flavia Paiva; Costa Escobar, Indra Elena; de Souza, Renata Gomes; Oehl, Fritz; Silva, Gladstone Alves; Tiburcio Cavalcante, Uided Maaze; Maia, Leonor Costa] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Micol, Programa Posgrad Biol Fungos, BR-50740600 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Alves da Silva, Danielle Karla] Univ Fed Vale do Sao Francisco, Microbiol Lab, BR-56300990 Petrolina, PE, Brazil; [Oehl, Fritz] Fed Res Inst Sustainabil Sci, Agroscope, Plant Soil Interact, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","Maia, LC (reprint author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Micol, Programa Posgrad Biol Fungos, Cidade Univ,Ave Engn S-N, BR-50740600 Recife, PE, Brazil.",leonorcmaia@gmail.com,"MAIA, LEONOR/E-6992-2013; Silva, Gladstone/E-5110-2013; Silva, Danielle Karla/J-7734-2012","Silva, Gladstone/0000-0002-5652-7800; Maia, Leonor/0000-0003-0095-5758; Escobar, Indra/0000-0002-1644-682X; Silva, Danielle Karla/0000-0001-9890-1285",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES; Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"The authors are grateful to: the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for a PhD (I.

For example, although most woody plant species depend on belowground mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the relative importance of these mutualisms in conferring invasion success is unresolved. Here, we describe how neighborhood context (identity of nearby tree species) affects the formation of belowground ectomycorrhizal partnerships between fungi and seedlings of a widespread invasive tree species, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), in New Zealand. We found that the formation of mycorrhizal partnerships, the composition of the fungal species involved in these partnerships, and the origin of the fungi (co-invading or native to New Zealand) all depend on neighborhood context. Our data suggest that nearby ectomycorrhizal host trees act as both a reservoir of fungal inoculum and a carbon source for late-successional and native fungi. By facilitating mycorrhization of P. menziesii seedlings, adult trees may alleviate mycorrhizal limitation at the P. menziesii invasion front. These results highlight the importance of studying biological invasions across multiple ecological settings to understand establishment success and invasion speed.","[Moeller, Holly V.; Fukami, Tadashi] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dickie, Ian A.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.; Peltzer, Duane A.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Moeller, HV (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hollyvm@alum.mit.edu,"Peltzer, Duane A/A-9463-2009; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013; Fukami, Tadashi/A-2934-2010","Peltzer, Duane A/0000-0001-7724-3738; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Fukami, Tadashi/0000-0001-5654-4785; Moeller, Holly/0000-0002-9335-0039","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE); Stanford UniversityStanford University; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); ARCS","Field assistance was provided by Kathryn Affeld, Jessica Baker, Helena Ponstein, and Katie Spellman.

Here, we try to clarify the specific site and necessary conditions for the transformation of precipitated CeO2 NPs in hydroponic cucumber plants. Three different treatment modes were adopted according to whether the NPs were incubated with roots all the time or not. Results showed that exposure modes significantly affect the translocation and transformation of CeO2 NPs. In the normal exposure mode, Ce was present as a Ce(IV) and Ce(III) mixture in the roots and shoots, and the proportion of Ce(III) in the shoots was enhanced obviously with the increase of exposure time. The results of short-time incubation and petiole exposure modes suggested that CeO2 NPs could not be reduced within a short incubation time (3 h) or be further reduced inside the plant tissues. It was deduced that root surfaces are the sites, and the physicochemical interaction between the NPs and root exudates at the nanobio interface is the necessary condition for the transformation of CeO2 NPs in plant systems. These results will contribute to understanding the transformation mechanism of CeO2 and other metal-based NPs and properly evaluate their ecological effects.","[Ma, Yuhui; Zhang, Peng; Zhang, Zhiyong; He, Xiao; Zhang, Junzhe; Ding, Yayun; Chai, Zhifang; Zhao, Yuliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Key Lab Biol Effects Nanomat & Nanosafety, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing; Zheng, Lirong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Guo, Zhi; Zhang, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Appl Phys, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Key Lab Biol Effects Nanomat & Nanosafety, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangzhy@ihep.ac.cn,"He, Xiao/K-8033-2019; He, Xiao/D-6584-2014; Zhang, Peng/H-9461-2018","Zhang, Peng/0000-0002-2774-5534","Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2011CB933400, 2013CB932703]; Ministry of Environmental Protection of China [201209012]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11275215, 11275218, 11375009]","This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2011CB933400, 2013CB932703), Ministry of Environmental Protection of China (Grant No. 201209012), and Projects 11275215, 11275218, and 11375009 supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,42,36,40,7,66,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

The soil of the rhizosphere is shown to differ significantly from the surrounding soil in most characteristics concerning both the composition of the solid phase and soil solution and the function of individual components of the soil system. The rhizosphere soil has a great number of microorganisms and they have high diversity. The most important specific features of soils in the rhizosphere are related to a continuous input of root exudates, metabolic products of microorganisms and border cells. The presence of these diverse substances leads to significant changes in the cycles of chemical elements, intensification of the carbon cycle, weathering, and decomposition of organic matter.

The objectives of the present study were to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of R (s) , and to identify the determinants of the spatial and temporal variability of R (s,) using general linear mixed models (GLMM), in an old-growth beech-oak forest. GLMM analyses identified monthly effect as a significant explanatory variable for temporal variation, as well as gap/canopy and soil water content (SWC) as explanatory variables for spatial variation, in R (s) . The complexity of vertical structure in the forest was reflected in the spatial pattern of R (s) , which was higher in canopy areas than in gap areas during the growing season, except in November. This spatial pattern was not affected by soil temperature. Moreover, SWC did not differ between gap and canopy areas, although SWC partially explained the spatial heterogeneity in R (s) . The carbon:nitrogen ratios of soil organic matter in canopy areas were significantly higher than those in gap areas. Fine root biomass was 1.7-fold greater in canopy areas than in gap areas, likely because of the higher R (s) in canopy areas, and root respiration made a much large contribution to R (s) than heterotrophic respiration. The different patterns of fine root biomass between gap and canopy areas mainly control the spatial heterogeneity in R (s) ; thus, it is worth considering the gap/canopy variability in R (s) when evaluating annual efflux in old-growth forests.","[Suchewaboripont, Vilanee; Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki] Gifu Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Suchewaboripont, Vilanee; Yoshitake, Shinpei; Ohtsuka, Toshiyuki] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Ando, Masaki] Gifu Univ, Fac Appl Biol Sci, Lab Forest Ecol, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Iimura, Yasuo] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan","Suchewaboripont, V (reprint author), Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",vilanee.s@hotmail.com,", _______/V-6687-2019",", _______/0000-0002-9032-7933",,,,45,3,5,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

In this study, we estimated the NPP in a warm-temperate old-growth evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwestern Japan. The estimation was based on four compartments: aboveground stand increment (Delta M), aboveground litterfall (Lf), fine-root production (Fr), and coarse root increment (Delta Cr). The data for Delta M and Delta Cr were collected from a permanent 200 x 200 m(2) plot over a 4-year interval, while Lf and Fr were collected over a 1-year interval. The NPP was 4.65 g m(-2) day(-1), of which Delta M accounted for 25.2 %, Lf accounted for 38.7 %, Fr accounted for 33.4 %, and the remaining 2.7 % was attributed to Delta Cr. There was a significant regression between aboveground litterfall and fine-root production (R (2) = 0.65, P < 0.05). Fine-root decomposition (0.66 g m(-2) day(-1)) accounted for 14.2 % of the NPP, leading to a higher belowground NPP in the present study compared with that in other forests. We conclude that an estimation of the decomposition of dead fine-roots by the continuous inflow method must be included to improve the accuracy of NPP estimations for forest ecosystems.","[Tran Van Do; Sato, Tamotsu] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Vegetat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Tran Van Do; Kozan, Osamu] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Tran Van Do] Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Silviculture Res Inst, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Saito, Satoshi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Plant Ecol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan","Van Do, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Sakyo Ku, 46 Shi Moadachi Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",dotranvan@hotmail.com,"Van, Tran/I-8464-2019; Van Tran/H-8431-2013","Van, Tran/0000-0001-9059-5842; Sato, Tamotsu/0000-0002-3601-9657","Global Environmental Research Account for National Institute, Ministry of the Environment Japan (MOEJ); Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of JapanMinistry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan; MOEJ; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [106-NN.06-2013.01]","This research is co-funded by Long-term monitoring of forest carbon dynamics in East Asia [EA-FDPN Phase II]'' from the Global Environmental Research Account for National Institute, Ministry of the Environment Japan (MOEJ), ""Evaluation, Adaptation and Mitigation of Global Warming in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: Research and Development'', Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, ""Monitoring-site 1000 Project'' MOEJ, and Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under Grant number 106-NN.06-2013.01.",,51,8,8,1,42,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Trophic interactions among these microorganisms could, however, induce shifts in food web energy flows. Given increasing evidence for a prominent role of saprotrophic fungi as primary consumers of root-derived carbon, we propose that fungusderived carbon may be an important resource for rhizosphere bacteria. To test this assumption, two common saprotrophic, rhizosphere-inhabiting fungi, Trichoderma harzianum and Mucor hiemalis, were confronted in a microcosm system with bacterial communities extracted from the rhizospheres of a grass and sedge species, Carex arenaria and Festuca rubra. This showed a widespread ability of rhizosphere bacteria to attach to and feed on living hyphae of saprotrophic fungi. The identity of the fungi had a strong effect on the composition of these potentially mycophagous bacteria, whereas plant species identity was less important. Based on our results, we suggest that food web models should account for bacterial secondary consumption since this has important consequences for carbon fluxes with more carbon dioxide released by microbes and less microbial carbon available for the soil animal food web.

These observations have generally been reproduced in SOC models by introducing a SOC pool that decomposes on the time-scale of millennia. The overemphasis of chemical recalcitrance as the major factor for the persistence of SOC was able to provide a mechanistic justification for these very low decomposition rates. The emerging view on SOC persistence, however, stresses that apart from molecular structure a multitude of mechanisms can lead to the long-term persistence of organic carbon in soils. These mechanisms, however, have not been incorporated into most models. Consequently, we developed the SOC profile model COMISSION which simulates vertically resolved SOC concentrations based on representations of microbial interactions, sorption to minerals, and vertical transport. We calibrated COMISSION using published concentrations of SOC, microbial biomass and mineral-associated OC (MOC), and in addition, C-14 contents of SOC and MOC of a Haplic Podzol profile in North-Eastern Bavaria, Germany. In order to elucidate the contribution of the implemented processes to the C-14 age in different parts of the profile, we performed model-experiments in which we switched off the limitation of SOC decomposition by microbes, sorptive stabilization on soil minerals, and dissolved OC (DOC) transport. By splitting all model pools into directly litter-derived carbon and microbe-derived organic carbon, we investigated the contribution of repeated microbial recycling to C-14 ages throughout the profile. The model-experiments for this site lead to the following implications: Without rejuvenation by DOC transport, SOC in the subsoil would be on average 1700 C-14 years older. Across the profile, SOC from microbial recycling is on average 1400 C-14 years older than litterderived SOC. Without microbial limitation of depolymerization, SOC in the subsoil would be on average 610 C-14 years younger. Sorptive stabilization is responsible for relatively high C-14 ages in the topsoil. The model-experiments further indicate that the high SOC concentrations in the Bh horizon are caused by the interplay between sorptive stabilization and microbial dynamics. Overall, the model-experiments demonstrate that the high C-14 ages are not solely caused by slow turnover of a single pool, but that the increase of C-14 ages along a soil profile up to ages >1000 years is the result of different mechanisms contributing to the overall persistence of SOC. The dominant reasons for the persistence of SOC are stabilization processes, followed by repeated microbial processing of SOC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Frequently, such mutualisms are reformed each generation, and where they involve close physiological contact, such as between mycorrhizal fungi and plants, they can be considered as examples of reciprocal parasitism. Here we place such interactions in the framework of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and examine the conditions for the spread of mutualism using a population genetics model analogous to that used for understanding the genetic and numerical dynamics of host-parasite interactions. Genetic variants within each of two species determine whether the interaction is mutualistic or selfish, the latter being represented by resistance to being exploited or parasitized. We assume that there are fitness costs to resistance which are present even in the absence of the interaction. Just as in host-parasite interactions, we examine the effect of assuming that encounter rates between potential mutualists (and therefore entry into the Prisoner's Dilemma 'game') depend on the density and frequency of the different types interacting individuals. These elements of ecological realism greatly facilitate the evolution of mutualism even in the absence of spatial structure or iterative encounters. Moreover, stable genetic polymorphisms for resistant (selfish) and susceptible (mutualistic) alleles can be maintained, something that is not possible with the classical Prisoner's Dilemma formulation. The sensitivity of the outcomes to levels of density-dependence and mortality rate suggests environmental as well as genetic processes are likely to be important in determining directions in this pathway to mutualism.","[Antonovics, Janis; Bergmann, Joana; Hempel, Stefan; Verbruggen, Erik; Veresoglou, Stavros; Rillig, Matthias] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Verbruggen, Erik] Univ Antwerp, PLECO, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Antonovics, J (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",ja8n@virginia.edu,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Veresoglou, Stavros D/D-5087-2011","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Veresoglou, Stavros D/0000-0001-6387-4109; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515",Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1115899],J.A. is grateful for support from the Humboldt Foundation and for NSF Grant DEB-1115899 as part of the joint NSF-NIH Ecology of Infectious Disease program.,,60,2,2,3,91,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) is an invasive plant, well known to excrete a suite of phytotoxic and antimicrobial allelochemicals, including allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC). While the effects of these chemicals on plant-mycorrhizae mutualisms are well documented, the effects on other plant-soil microbe interactions, such as the legume-rhizobia mutualism, have not yet been tested. Here, we performed laboratory and greenhouse experiments with both synthetic chemicals and leaf extracts to investigate the effects of allelochemicals in A. petiolata on a native leguminous plant, Amphicarpaea bracteata, and its rhizobia mutualists. We found that BITC reduced rhizobia growth rate in the lab, but had no effect on nodulation in the greenhouse when rhizobia were grown in the presence of plants. AITC did not directly harm either plants or rhizobia, though plants and rhizobia grown in the presence of AITC showed reduced nodulation, indicating that it disrupted the formation of the mutualism itself. We found no effects of A. petiolata allelochemical leaf extracts on plant performance or nodulation. Our data suggest that AITC causes mutualism disruption in this system by preventing the formation of nodules, which reduces plant growth and could threaten the long-term performance of rhizobia. Our study shows that the allelochemicals in A. petiolata disrupt the legume-rhizobia resource mutualism, adding another impact of these novel weapons in addition to their well-documented role in disrupting plant-mycorrhizae symbioses.","[Portales-Reyes, Cristina] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Van Doornik, Tina] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Schultheis, Elizabeth H.; Suwa, Tomomi] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Suwa, T (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",suwatomo@msu.edu,,,NSF-BEACON REU fellowship; George H.

These changes pose a challenge for Fagus sylvatica as the most common European deciduous tree species. We asked how different genotypes respond to drought conditions and paid particular attention to how soil moisture availability can be manipulated. We established a tube technique that allowed to add water horizontally at different rooting depths, which allowed to measure water contents and to observe root growth along the full length of 1-m deep tubes. Three F. sylvatica provenances were compared in their response to different depth of water supply with respect to growth, leaf stomatal conductance as well as root and leaf traits. There were short-lasting differences between the watering regimes in soil water content and depth of soil moisture maxima. Adding water to depths of 30-60 cm resulted in reduced leaf stomatal conductance and lower survival but increased root tip growth rates compared to watering the tubes at 10-20 cm. There were differences between the three provenances for specific leaf area and stem dry mass, which however, were independent of the watering regime and did not support the idea of local adaptation to drought of populations from dry or moist origins. The findings indicate that differences between provenances might have been caused by environmental factors other than drought. Technically, we demonstrated the high potential of using the tube technique for a fine-tuned manipulation of soil moisture in the rooting space.","[Baudis, Mathias; Premper, Thomas; Welk, Erik; Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Welk, Erik; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Baudis, M (reprint author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",mathias.baudis@botanik.uni-halle.de,,,"DFG Priority Program 1374 ""Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories'' [WE4598/3-1, GE1090/11-1, BR1698/16-1]","We are grateful to Carolin Shaper for drawing the sketch of the experimental growing tube (Fig. 1) and Gunnar Seidler for calculating the aridity index.

Better understanding of factors that directly influence post-disturbance forest biomass recovery is urgently needed to guide forest restoration and management. In this study, we examine changes in forest stand structure, wood density and biomass of forests recovering from different anthropogenic disturbances that represent forest land-use types in subtropical China: plantation, twice-logged and once-logged secondary forests, and compare them with undisturbed old-growth forest. Stand structure and wood density in all disturbed forests were evidently different from that of old-growth forest, even after 50-year regrowth. Forest biomass increased along plantation, twice-logged, once-logged and old-growth forests, with total living biomass (TLB) ranging from 150.8 +/- A 4.6 to 278.4 +/- A 1.5 Mg ha(-1), aboveground biomass from 111.8 +/- A 4.2 to 204.1 +/- A 1.5 Mg ha(-1) and coarse-root biomass from 33.0 +/- A 0.9 to 71.0 +/- A 0.8 Mg ha(-1). However, fine-root biomass was highest in plantation (5.99 +/- A 0.52 Mg ha(-1)) and lowest in once-logged forest (3.35 +/- A 0.19 Mg ha(-1)). Both changes in stand structure and functional trait (wood density) directly determine forest biomass recovery according to the result that 10.6, 35.5 and 8.2 % of variation in TLB over the disturbance gradient were independently explained by basal area (< 20 cm diameter), basal area (a parts per thousand yen20 cm diameter) and wood density, respectively. Our results suggest that recovery forest structure to the state associated with undisturbed forests will lead to large carbon sink in disturbed forests. In addition, trait-based managing approach should not be overlooked when maximizing carbon storage is a major management objective.","[Lin, Dunmei] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm 3, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dunmei; Lai, Jiangshan; Yang, Bo; Song, Piao; Li, Ning; Ren, Haibao; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dunmei] Chongqing Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Low Carbon & Green Bldg, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bo] Jingdezhen Univ, Key Lab Resource Plant & Biotechnol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Lin, DM (reprint author), Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm 3, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",lindunmei@cqu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Dunmei/0000-0001-6112-7783","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC31270496]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050204]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [106112015CDJXY210012]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [B13041]","We would like to thank Drs.

Understanding fungal response to climate is necessary in order to predict future fungal production in Mediterranean forests under climate change scenarios. We used a 15-year data set to model the relationship between climate and epigeous fungal abundance and productivity, for mycorrhizal and saprotrophic guilds in a Mediterranean pine forest. The obtained models were used to predict fungal productivity for the 2021-2080 period by means of regional climate change models. Simple models based on early spring temperature and summer-autumn rainfall could provide accurate estimates for fungal abundance and productivity. Models including rainfall and climatic water balance showed similar results and explanatory power for the analyzed 15-year period. However, their predictions for the 2021-2080 period diverged. Rainfall-based models predicted a maintenance of fungal yield, whereas water balance-based models predicted a steady decrease of fungal productivity under a global warming scenario. Under Mediterranean conditions fungi responded to weather conditions in two distinct periods: early spring and late summer-autumn, suggesting a bimodal pattern of growth. Saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi showed differences in the climatic control. Increased atmospheric evaporative demand due to global warming might lead to a drop in fungal yields during the 21st century.","[Agreda, Teresa] Genius Medioambiente, Almazan 42200, Soria, Spain; [Agreda, Teresa; Agueda, Beatriz; Olano, Jose M.] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Area Bot, Soria 42004, Spain; [Olano, Jose M.] Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Olano, Jose M.] INIA, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.] CSIC, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Fernandez-Toiran, Marina] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Prod Vegetal & Recursos Forestales, Soria 42004, Spain","Olano, JM (reprint author), Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Area Bot, Campus Duques Soria, Soria 42004, Spain.",jmolano@agro.uva.es,"Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.

This study aimed to assess value of the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)- or ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-related indices (BRIs) in relation to SRA. Soil samples collected from a Tibetan alpine meadow were amended with different amounts of glutamate to establish a SRA gradient. Several BRIs including 16S rDNA copies, rRNA copies, the ratio of 16S rRNA copies to 16S rDNA copies and 16S rDNA- or rRNA-based community structure were analysed using real-time PCR or terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Except 16S rRNA copies and the ratio of 16S rRNA copies to 16S rDNA copies, all of the BRIs significantly correlated with the SRA. However, the 16S rRNA-based bacterial community structure explained 72.7 % of the SRA variations, which clearly outperformed all other BRIs. The results imply that the 16S rRNA-based bacterial community structure provides a sensitive and robust BRI to support future studies on the relationships between SRA and microbial communities.","[Che, Rongxiao; Wang, Fang; Wang, Yanfen; Cui, Xiaoyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Che, Rongxiao; Wang, Weijin; Xu, Zhihong] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Deng, Yongcui] Nanjing Normal Univ, Nanjing 210097, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Deng, Yongcui] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Weijin] Dept Sci Informat Technol & Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4068, Australia","Cui, XY (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",cuixy@ucas.ac.cn,"Xu, Zhihong/B-3223-2009; Cui, Xiaoyong/B-3669-2016; Che, Rongxiao/J-4588-2019","Xu, Zhihong/0000-0002-6768-0720; Cui, Xiaoyong/0000-0001-7592-5866; Che, Rongxiao/0000-0001-7907-478X",Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010201]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41230750]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956000],"This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15010201), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 41230750) and the National Basic Research Program (2013CB956000).

Exotic plants may experience genetic changes in traits related to resource use, abiotic stress tolerance, and biotic interactions in response to such novel biotic and abiotic environments. We conducted a pot experiment in the native range to investigate how soil fertility, soil salinity and soil sterilization together determine the performances of native (China) and invasive (US) populations of the tree Triadica sebifera. Salinity decreased plant growth, and increased AMF colonization and root:shoot. Fertilization or an unsterilized soil biota reduced the negative effects of salinity on plant survival. Fertilization decreased AMFcolonization and root:shoot ratio. Biomass was positively related to AMF colonization in unfertilized soils only. Seedlings from invasive populations grew faster and had higher AMF colonization. Our results suggest that this invasive plant is able to persist in more saline environments when soil fertility is high or suitable AMF is present. The importance of the soil biota appears to be greater on low fertility soils where AMF provides significant benefits. The greater AMF association of plants from invasive populations suggests that resources, abiotic stress, and biotic interactions all may play a role in successful plant invasions.","[Yang, Qiang; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Li, B (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Inst Biodivers Sci, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",bool@fudan.edu.cn; siemann@rice.edu,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666",U.S. NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [2009S1-30]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30930019]; Ministry of Education [20120071110017],"We would like to thank colleagues at Nanjing Agricultural University, Wuhan Botanical Garden, and Rice University for help collecting soil (NAU) and seeds (NAU, WBG, RU).

However, little is known about how foliage and branch order-based root decomposition responds to increased N availability and the response mechanisms behind. The effects of different doses of N addition on the decomposition of needles and order-based roots of Pinus elliottii (slash pine) were monitored using the litterbag method for 524 days in a subtropical slash pine plantation in south China. The acid-unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) concentration and microbial extracellular enzymatic activities (EEA) in decomposing needles and roots were also determined. Our results indicate that the responses of needle and order-based root decomposition were N-dose-specific. The decomposition of both needles and lower-order roots was inhibited under the high N dose rate. The retarded decomposition of lower-order roots could be explained more by the increased binding of AUR to inorganic N ions, while the retarded decomposition of needles could be explained more by the reduced microbial EEA. Further, in contrast to lower-order roots, N addition had no effect on the decomposition of higher-order roots. We conclude that the decomposition of foliage and fine roots may fail to mirror each other at ambient conditions or in response to N deposition due to their contrasting decomposition microenvironments and tissue chemistry. Given the differential effects of N addition on order-based roots, our findings highlight the need to consider the tissue chemistry heterogeneity within branching fine root systems when predicting the responses of root decomposition to N loading.","[Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Zhang, Xinyu; Gao, Wenlong; Yang, Hao; Li, Dandan; Li, Shenggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Gao, Wenlong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Dandan] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China","Li, SG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lisg@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Li, Sheng-Gong/H-5101-2012",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31130009]; National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program [2013BAC03B03],This research is financially supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31130009) and the National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program (No. 2013BAC03B03).

Only a portion of the prokaryotes, the diazotrophics, has the ability to reduce atmospheric nitrogen to other forms available to plants. Bracatinga is an economically important arboreal species capable of establishing mutualistic symbiosis with diazotrophic organisms. Its main uses are: energy production, wood, forage, chemical industry of natural products, beekeeping, landscaping and shadowing and recovery of degraded areas and riparian zones. The present study aimed to establish relationship between cultural and morphological diversity and genetic variability from nodules of bracatinga isolated in different edaphoclimatic conditions. Root nodules randomly collected from seven areas between the Vale do Itajai, Plateau South and Midwest of the State of Santa Catarina. Broad cultural diversity was observed among the present diazotrophics, and there was a predominance of fast-growing isolates of colony with milky white coloration, round shape, flat edge and mucoid surface. Among the evaluated parameters, transparency of the colony, mucus production and pH modification were considered relevant to the differentiation of isolates. Taxonomic characterization of the isolates was performed by comparison of the sequenced fragments, being the isolated species of this sample set from the genera Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Pantoea and Rhizobium.","[Moraes Ehrhardt-Brocardo, Natalia Carolina; Tramontin, Antonio Luiz; Iunes Oliveira Filho, Luis Carlos] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Ctr Agrovet, Lages, SC, Brazil; [Stocco, Priscila] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Ctr Agrovet, Programa Posgrad Manejo Solo, Lages, SC, Brazil; [Pires Santos, Julio Cesar] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Ctr Agrovet, Dept Solos & Recursos Nat, Lages, SC, Brazil","Ehrhardt-Brocardo, NCM (reprint author), Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Ctr Agrovet, Lages, SC, Brazil.",biosapos@gmail.com; stocco.priscila@gmail.com; biosolos@gmail.com; iunes1981@gmail.com; bijagica@gmail.com,,"Ehrhardt-Brocardo, Natalia/0000-0002-0397-448X; Santos, Julio Cesar Pires/0000-0002-0414-9705; Oliveira Filho, Luis Carlos Iunes/0000-0002-9010-481X",,,,37,0,0,0,4,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

Results showed that the selected AMF and A. fruticosa had a strong symbiotic relation. Sixteen months after inoculation, the root colonization rate in A. fruticosa reached 88%. Inoculation with AMF was shown to promote the growth and root development of A. fruticosa and improve rhizospheric soil and fertilization of A. fruticosa. After the inoculation, the contents of organic matters and glomalin-associated proteins in the rhizospheric soil of A. fruticosa increased significantly. Sixteen months after the inoculation, the acidic phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of A. fruticosa in the inoculated plots increased by 44% compared with that of the control plot, and the content of available phosphorus was 2.5 times that of the control.

Here we used leaf and fine root litter of six tree species differing in chemical and morphological traits in a temperate forest and elucidated the effects of tree species on the relationships between litter-derived microbial respiration rates and decomposition rates and morphological traits, including specific leaf area (cm(2) g(-1)) and specific root length (m g(-1)) of litter at the same site. Litterbags set in forest soil were sequentially collected five times over the course of 18 months. During litter decomposition, microbial respiration from leaf and fine root litter differed among the six tree species. Temporal changes in the remaining mass and morphology (specific leaf area and specific root length) were observed, and the magnitude of these changes differed among species. Positive correlations were observed between respiration and mass loss or morphology across species. These results revealed that litter mass loss and morphological dynamics during decomposition jointly enhanced microbial respiration, and these carbon-based litter traits explained species differences in,decomposition of leaves and fine roots. In conclusion, tree species influenced the magnitude and direction of microbial respiration during leaf/fine root litter decomposition. Tree species also affected the relationship between microbial respiration and litter decomposition through direct effects of litter traits and indirect effects mediated by regulation of heterotroph requirements.

Current allometric models are mostly for mature trees, and few consider trees at the sapling stage. Over four years we monitored the growth rates, from seedling to the sapling stage, of 490 trees (five native species) in environmental plantings, in the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia. Our biomass estimates were greater by several orders of magnitude in the first year (6 x 10(-3) Mg ha(-1) cf. 4 x 10(-6) Mg ha(-1)), and two orders of magnitude less at four years than those derived from the national carbon accounting model (5 x 10(-1) Mg ha(-1) cf. 13 Mg ha(-1)). We destructively sampled 37 young trees to accurately estimate the variation in below-ground and above-ground biomass (AGB) with stem size, and to derive a best fit model for predicting sapling biomass: lnAGB = -5.092 + 0.786 ln(Diam.(base))(2)Height Biomass expansion factors for young tree species ranged from 1.71 to 2.44, higher than average for tropical forests. Root:shoot ratios are consistent with mean estimates for mature rainforest. Stem wood densities ranged from 0.444 to 0.683 Mg m(-3) for the five species measured, which was 6.5% lower than published estimates for three of the species, and 12% and 27% higher for two species. Relative growth rates were faster for species with lower wood density in the first four years, but these species also had the lowest survival over the same period. The findings are significant for a number of reasons. Ecologically, they indicate that young rainforest trees invest more in leaves and branches than in stem growth. From a survival perspective, in the context of rainforest restoration, it is best to invest in species with higher wood densities. From a carbon accounting point of view, refinements to the models used for national carbon accounting are required that include the contribution of the sapling stage. Sapling growth rates were significantly different from those assumed in the national model, requiring growth rates to be increased after four years (as opposed to after 2 years in the national model) before reaching an asymptote at some time in the future. This adjustment is essential to enable carbon farmers to judge the time it takes to receive returns from investment. Policies that encourage carbon plantings should take into account that young plantings grow slower than predicted by current national carbon accounting models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Lawson) forests in the southwestern United States. Interactions among native grasses and soil microorganisms generate feedbacks that influence the achievement of this objective. We examined soil chemical properties and communities of plants and soil microorganisms in clear-cuts and P. ponderosa stands thinned and maintained at low and medium tree densities for over 40 years along with high density (unthinned) stands. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in soils were analyzed to examine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and microbial communities in the three thinning treatments and the unthinned stands with and without a recent broadcast burn. Additionally, two native bunchgrasses, Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia wrightii were grown in containers filled with intact soil cores collected from each field plot to more thoroughly compare the abundance of AM fungi and microbial communities across different stand densities and burn treatments. Tree thinning decreased litter cover and increased the abundance and diversity and altered community composition of both herbaceous vegetation and AM fungi. In the mineral soil layer, the pH, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PLFA profiles did not differ significantly among the four stand density or burn treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization of the container grown grasses did not significantly differ with tree density or burn treatments; however, F. arizonica roots had a strong trend for decreased colonization when grown in soil from high density (unthinned) tree cover. Soil from the containers with F. arizonica had a greater abundance of AM fungal spores. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied with grass species. Concentration of biomarkers for bacteria were higher in soil that supported F. arizonica compared to soil in which M. wrightii was grown. Our results indicate that the creation of clear-cut openings in forests may increase the abundance and richness of AM fungal propagules and soil bacterial communities were surprisingly resilient to tree thinning and low-intensity fire treatments. These results suggest managing forests to create clear-cut openings generate conditions that favor understory native grasses and AM fungi that are linked to soil bacterial communities.

Nano-maghemite (NM) and an amorphous Mn oxide (AMO) were investigated for their stabilisation potential under simulated rhizosphere conditions in terms of their use during chemical stabilisation and aided phytostabilisation of metal(loid)s in contaminated soils. In order to understand the reactivity of these potential sorbents of contaminants in soils and subsequent mobility of metal(loid)s, a set of time-dependent batch leaching experiments was performed using a mix of acetic, lactic, citric, malic and formic acids simulating root exudates. Despite being relatively unstable under given conditions, the AMO proved to be an efficient amendment for rapid stabilisation of both metals and As compared to NM. Generally, low pH (similar to 4) and the presence of citrate complexes resulted in higher mobility of metals in the non- and NM-amended soil. In contrast, the presence of AMO in the soil accelerated the neutralisation reactions related to pH increase and (co-) precipitation of secondary Fe/Mn/Al oxyhydroxides. Mineralogical transformations of the AMO showed to be crucial for contaminant immobilisation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Species that offer similar or better levels of protection to those currently used are sought to meet future needs. Determining what plants to use and when they become effective is important for developing guidelines and policy for land management. This study aimed to obtain data on above-and below-ground plant growth for young exotic tree species considered potential candidates for future 'erosion control forests'. Methods: The above-and below-ground growth of nine exotic tree species was assessed annually for 3 years from planting in a randomised block field trial. Whole trees were excavated and destructively sampled and several below-ground metrics (total root length of all roots > 1 mm in diameter, lateral root spread, total root biomass) assessed. Results: Differences between species for most metrics at the time of planting carried through to Year 3. The best performing species across most metrics was alder, followed by blackwood, cherry, and cypress. Allometric models relating total root length and below-ground biomass to root collar diameter were established. Conclusion: Top performers with regard to root metrics were alder, cherry, and cypress followed by blackwood, radiata, and redwood. Root information contributes to improving our understanding of how and when, and at what planting density, plants become effective for controlling erosion in New Zealand.","[Phillips, Chris J.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Marden, Michael] Landcare Res, Gisborne 4010, New Zealand; [Lambie, Suzanne M.] Landcare Res, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Phillips, CJ (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",phillipsc@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Phillips, Christopher J/G-2691-2014","Phillips, Christopher/0000-0002-2034-1545","Future Forests Research and Scion via MBIE ""Forestry and Environment"" [C04X0806]","We thank Richard Hemming, Stephen Hough, interns Sophie Michel, Georg Richter and volunteer Alex Watson for assisting with plant extraction and processing during this trial; Guy Forrester for help in designing the trial; and Christine Bezar for editing services.

Theory predicts that species persistence and community stability are feasible when the beneficial effects of mutualisms are balanced by density-dependent negative feedbacks. Enemy-mediated negative feedbacks can foster plant species coexistence in diverse communities, but empirical evidence remains mixed. Disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results may arise from the effects of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we build a multiprey species/predator model combined with a bidirectional resource exchange system, which simulates mutualistic interactions between plants and fungi. To reach population persistence, (1) the per capita rate of increase of all plant population must exceed the sum of the negative per capita effects of predation, interspecific competition, and costs of mycorrhizal association, and (2) the per capita numerical response of enemies to mycorrhizal plants must exceed the magnitude of the per capita enemy rate of mortality. These conditions reflect the balance between regulation and facilitation in the system. Interactions between plant natural enemies and mycorrhizal fungi lead to shifts in the strength and direction of net mycorrhizal effects on plants over time, with common plant species deriving greater benefits from mycorrhizal associations than rare plant species.","[Bachelot, Benedicte; Uriarte, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [McGuire, Krista] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Bachelot, B (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",bmb2157@columbia.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-524989],"Benedicte Bachelot was partially supported with funds from National Science Foundation DEB-524989 to MU.

Seasonal variations of delta C-13 and content of phloem sap sugars, collected during the daylight period, reflected the changes in soil and plant water status. The correlation between delta C-13 and content of phloem sap sugars, collected from plants belonging to different social classes, was significantly positive only during the driest month of July. In this month, delta C-13 of phloem sap sugars was inversely related to the increment of trunk radial growth and positively related to delta C-13 of fine roots. We conclude that the relationship between delta C-13 and the amount of phloem sap sugars is affected by a combination of causes, such as sink strength, tree social class, changes in phloem anatomy and transport capacity, and phloem loading of sugars to restore sieve tube turgor following the reduced plant water potential under drought conditions. However, delta C-13 and sugar composition of fine roots suggested that phloem transport of leaf sucrose to this belowground component was not impaired by mild drought and that sucrose was in a large part allocated towards fine roots in July, depending on tree social class. Hence, fine roots could represent a functional carbon sink during the dry seasonal periods, when transport and use of assimilates in other sink tissues are reduced. These results indicate a strict link between above- and belowground processes and highlight a rapid response of this Mediterranean forest to changes in environmental drivers to regulate source-sink relationships and carbon sink capacity.","[Scartazza, Andrea; Matteucci, Giorgio] CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-00016 Monterotondo, RM, Italy; [Scartazza, Andrea; Moscatello, Stefano; Battistelli, Alberto; Brugnoli, Enrico] CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, I-05010 Porano, TR, Italy; [Matteucci, Giorgio] CNR, Ist Sistemi Agr & Forestali Mediterraneo ISAFoM, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy","Scartazza, A (reprint author), CNR, Ist Biol Agroambientale & Forestale, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00016 Monterotondo, RM, Italy.",andrea.scartazza@ibaf.cnr.it,"Matteucci, Giorgio/N-3526-2015","Matteucci, Giorgio/0000-0002-4790-9540",European Community's Potential Programme Netcarb [HPRN-CT-1999-00059]; European Union projects ForCast [EVK2-1999-00242]; CarboEuroflux [EVK2-1999-00229]; Italian Forest Monitoring Programme 'Conecofor'; National Forest Service of Italy (CFS),"This work was supported in part by the European Community's Potential Programme Netcarb (HPRN-CT-1999-00059), by the European Union projects ForCast (EVK2-1999-00242) and CarboEuroflux (EVK2-1999-00229), and by the Italian Forest Monitoring Programme 'Conecofor' coordinated by the National Forest Service of Italy (CFS).",,58,8,8,2,73,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2015,35,8,,,,,829,839,,10.1093/treephys/tpv048,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,CQ4QQ,WOS:000360590100004,26093372,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Zhuang, WW; Downing, A; Zhang, YM",,,,"Zhuang, WeiWei; Downing, Alison; Zhang, YuanMing",,,The influence of biological soil crusts on N-15 translocation in soil and vascular plant in a temperate desert of northwestern China,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,biological soil crusts; nitrogen translocation; Erodium oxyrrhynchum; temperate desert,SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; GURBANTUNGGUT DESERT; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; GRASSLAND; ECOSYSTEM; LICHENS; AVAILABILITY; GERMINATION; DISTURBANCE,"Aims Desert ecosystems are often characterized by patchy distribution of vascular plants, with biological soil crusts (BSC) covering interplant spaces. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the linkage between BSC and vascular plants through nitrogen (N) or element translocation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological roles of BSC on N translocation from soil to the dominant herb Erodium oxyrrhynchum Bieb. (Geraniaceae) in a temperate desert in China. Methods Isotopes (including N-15-Glu, N-15-NH4Cl and N-15-NaNO3) were used as a tracer to detect translocation of N in two types of desert soil (BSC covered; bare) to the dominant herb E. oxyrrhynchum. Three different forms of N-15-enriched N compounds were applied as a point source to small patches of BSC and to bare soil. And we measured isotopes (N-14 and N-15) and obtained the concentration of labeled-N-15 in both vascular plants and soils at different distances from substrate application Important Findings Plants of E. oxyrrhynchum growing in BSC-covered plots accumulated more delta N-15 than those growing in the bare soil. Similarly, soil from BSC-covered plots showed a higher concentration of labeled-N irrespective of form of isotope, than did the bare soil. The concentration of dissolved organic N (N-15-Glu) in E. oxyrrhynchum was higher than that of dissolved inorganic N (N-15-NH4Cl and N-15-NaNO3). Soil covered by BSC also accumulated considerably more dissolved organic N than bare soil, whereas the dominant form of N-15 concentrated in bare soil was dissolved inorganic N. Correlation analysis showed that the concentration of labeled-N in plants was positively related to the concentration of labeled-N in soils and the N% recorded in E. oxyrrhynchum. Our study supports the hypothesis that BSC facilitates N-15 translocation in soils and vascular plants in a temperate desert of northwestern China.","[Zhuang, WeiWei; Zhang, YuanMing] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, WeiWei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Downing, Alison] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Zhang, YM (reprint author), Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, 818 Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",zhangym@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954202]; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [RCPY201101]; Xinjiang Province Outstanding Youth Talent Project [2013711013],"National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954202), the West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (RCPY201101) and the Xinjiang Province Outstanding Youth Talent Project (2013711013).",,47,4,7,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Plants influence the composition of soil communities and soil communities in turn influence plant performance. Such a plant-soil feedback may incur selection pressure on plants and the associating soil community. However, the evolutionary consequences of these above-belowground feedback interactions remain largely speculative. Here we assess whether plant-soil feedback effects differ between intraspecific plant populations and between generations within the same plant population. We used two populations of Trifolium pratense and assessed their performance when grown in association with their home versus away soil biota. Both populations were colonized by distinct microbial communities and performed better with their own home soil communities than with the soil community from the other intraspecific population, demonstrating intraspecific positive feedback effects of home soil. In one of the two populations, we found that plant performance and the root associated microbiota community differed between parental and progeny plants when inoculated with their own home soil. Differences in root associated community characteristics could explain more than 80% of the variation in performance among the progeny and parental plants. Our results highlight that intraspecific differences in both plant and associated soil communities shape plant-soil feedback effects, and consequently indicate that plant-soil feedback can influence the direction of selection between intraspecific plant populations.","[Wagg, Cameron; Boller, Beat; Schneider, Salome; Widmer, Franco; van der Heijden, Marcel G.

One hypothesis is that decomposition rates decrease with increasing soil depth. We tested whether decomposition rates of beech fine root litter varied with depth for a range of soils using a litterbag experiment in German beech forest plots. In three study regions (Schorfheide-Chorin, Hainich-Dun and Schwabische-Alb), we buried 432 litterbags containing 0.5 g of standardized beech root material (fine roots with a similar chemical composition collected from 2 year old Fagus sylvatica L. saplings, root diameter < 2 mm) at three different soil depths (5, 20 and 35 cm). The decomposition rates as well as the changes in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations of the decomposing fine root litter were determined at a 6 months interval during a 2 years field experiment. The amount of root litter remaining after 2 years of field incubation differed between the study regions (76 +/- 2 % in Schorfheide-Chorin, 85 +/- 2 % in Schwabische-Alb, and 88 +/- 2 % in Hainich-Dun) but did not vary with soil depth. Our results indicate that the initial fine root decomposition rates are more influenced by regional scale differences in environmental conditions including climate and soil parent material, than by changes in microbial activities with soil depth. Moreover, they suggest that a similar potential to decompose new resources in the form of root litter exists in both surface and deep soils.","[Solly, Emily F.; Schoening, Ingo; Herold, Nadine; Trumbore, Susan E.; Schrumpf, Marion] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Solly, Emily F.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Solly, EF (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",emily.solly@wsl.ch,"Schoning, Ingo/D-3341-2009; Schrumpf, Marion/C-1671-2013","Schoning, Ingo/0000-0002-9830-5026; Solly, Emily/0000-0002-3157-1805","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1374, SCHR 1181/2-1]; Max-Planck-SocietyMax Planck Society","We thank Steffen Both, Jorg Hailer and Uta Schumacher for their help with the field work and technical organization.

ELP may confer an advantage in competition, and may interact with other invasion factors. For example, ELP may interact with allelopathy (release of toxins) if exposure to seasonal light influences allelochemical production. Here, we examine ELP and its interaction with glucosinolate (allelochemical) production in invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata). To test ELP's role in invasion, garlic mustard was grown in monoculture or polyculture with native species under natural and extended shade regimes. Consistent with an ELP invasion mechanism, garlic mustard survival was higher in natural shade than extended shade, although invader biomass and native responses did not differ between light treatments. While garlic mustard leaf glucosinolate concentration was higher in natural than extended shade during September of its first year, this pattern did not hold at three other time points. Stronger support for the role of ELP in driving garlic mustard invasion emerged from direct manipulation of germination phenology, with higher garlic mustard survival and biomass resulting when germination occurred earlier in the season. Analysis of allelochemical production across eight populations of garlic mustard revealed significant inter-population variation in glucosinolate responses to light availability. Overall, results of these three experiments indicate that ELP may facilitate garlic mustard's survival in invaded communities. We did not find strong evidence for a synergistic relationship between ELP and allelopathic potential, possibly due to high levels of inter-population variation in the relationship between allelopathy and light.","[Smith, Lauren M.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Reynolds, Heather L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN USA","Smith, LM (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",lauren.smith.ls922@yale.edu,,"Smith-Ramesh, Lauren/0000-0001-7520-9675",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1310750]; Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant; Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research; Indiana Native Plant and Wildflower Society; Indiana Academy of Sciences Senior Research Grant; Indiana University Department of Biology; SciFund Challenge project 'Alien Invaders: Armed and Dangerous',"Thanks to Therese Burkhard and Gerald Smith for extensive field and laboratory assistance throughout the duration of these experiments, and to Stephanie Dickinson of the Indiana University Statistical Consulting Center for assistance with data analysis.

Several studies showed that plant genotypes from the invasive areas had a better qualitative defense than genotypes from the native area but only a few studies have focused on the quantitative defenses and tolerance ability. We compared structural defenses, tolerance and growth between invasive and native plant populations from different continents using the model plant Jacobaea vulgaris. We examined several microscopical structure traits, toughness, amount of cell wall proteins, growth and root-shoot ratio, which is a proxy for tolerance. The results show that invasive Jacobaea vulgaris have thinner leaves, lower leaf mass area, lower leaf cell wall protein contents and a lower root-shoot ratio than native genotypes. It indicates that invasive genotypes have poorer structural defense and tolerance to herbivory but potentially higher growth compared to native genotypes. These findings are in line with the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability hypothesis and Shifting Defense Hypothesis. We also show that the invasiveness of this species in three geographically separated regions is consistently associated with the loss of parts of its quantitative defense and tolerance ability. The simultaneous change in quantitative defense and tolerance of the same magnitude and direction in the three invasive regions can be explained by parallel evolution. We argue that such parallel evolution might be attributed to the absence of natural enemies rather than adaptation to local abiotic factors, since climate conditions among these three regions were different. Understanding such evolutionary changes helps to understand why plant species become invasive and might be important for biological control.","[Lin, Tiantian; Doorduin, Leonie; Temme, Andries; Vrieling, Klaas] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Sect Plant Ecol & Phytochem, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Pons, Thijs L.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol, Plant Ecophysiol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lamers, Gerda E.

However, soil erosion has not been substantially reduced mainly because current restoration strategies lead to large areas of mono-specific vegetation, which are inefficient in reducing soil erosion because of their simple canopy and root structure. Therefore, an advanced understanding of how community functional composition affects soil erosion processes, as well as an improved restoration scheme to reduce soil erosion, is urgently needed. We investigated the effect of community functional composition on soil erosion in restored semi-arid grasslands on the Loess Plateau of China. Community functional composition of 16 restored grasslands was quantified by community-weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) trait values, which were calculated from nine plant functional traits of thirteen locally dominant plant species. Species richness and evenness were also measured. Soil erosion rates were measured using standard erosion plots. The multimodel inference approach was used to estimate the direction and the relative importance of these biodiversity indices in reducing soil erosion. A robust and strong negative effect of functional divergence (FDiv) on soil erosion was found. The prevalence of particular trait combinations can also decrease soil erosion. The greatest control over soil erosion was exerted when the community mean root diameter was small and the root tensile strength was great.Synthesis and applications: These findings imply that community functional diversity plays an important role in reducing soil erosion in semi-arid restored grasslands. This means that current restoration strategies can be greatly improved by incorporating community functional diversity into restoration design. We propose a trait-based restoration framework for reducing soil erosion, termed SSM' (Screening-Simulating-Maintaining). SSM aims to translate the target of community functional diversity into community assemblages that can be manipulated by practitioners. Based on this framework, a comprehensive procedure, highlighting functional diversity as the primary concern in determining optimal community assemblages, was developed to meet the pressing need for more effective restoration strategies to reduce soil erosion.

Predicting fungal symbiont distributions under future climates first requires knowledge of current distributions and their potential drivers. LocationWe documented colonization by fungal symbionts in perennial, cool-season grasses along altitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. MethodsAcross seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi. ResultsLevels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested possible synergisms between these fungal groups. Main conclusionsOur survey showed greater host specificity in patterns of fungal colonization than prior reports and revealed that different fungal symbiont groups do not share similar drivers. Conserving plant-fungal symbioses under future climates may require unique strategies for different plant species and fungal symbiont types.","[Ranelli, Luciana B.; Hendricks, Will Q.; Lynn, Joshua S.; Kivlin, Stephanie N.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Ranelli, Luciana B.] Univ Minnesota, Div Sci & Math, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Lynn, Joshua S.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Kivlin, Stephanie N.] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Rudgers, JA (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jrudgers@unm.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354972]; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory [NSF DBI-0753774, NSF OIA-0963529]; University of New Mexico Department of Biology","We thank Christine V.

However, the role of whole-plants' morphological traits in response to water level gradients in accounting for the distribution of marsh species is far from clear. Four typical dominant vascular plants with different distribution patterns (high-elevation species Deyeuxia angustifolia, mid-elevation species Carex lasiocarpa and Glyceria spiculosa, and low-elevation species Carex pseudocuraica) in freshwater marshes in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China were treated with four static water level conditions (-5, 0, +5, and +15 cm relative to the soil surface), and each plant's growth characteristics, biomass allocation and root traits were investigated. With the rising water level, the growth of D. angustifolia performed worse than other species, whereas the total biomass, plant height and relative growth rate (RGR) of C. pseudocuraica increased steadily. Compared with the other three species, C. pseudocuraica showed a distinct pattern with increasing water levels in the biomass allocation to photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs, as well as for coarse and fine roots. Flooding stress significantly reduced root diameter and C/N ratio but simultaneously increased the specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA) and root nitrogen concentration (RNC) for both coarse roots (1st order, >0.2 mm) and fine roots (2nd and 3rd orders, <0.2 mm). However, these root parameters of C. pseudocuraica exhibited an opposite response with the increase in the water level between such two different branching orders. Our results indicate that wetland plants could acclimate to flooding stress through resource trade-off among different tissues and trait-coordinated variation within the root system. Furthermore, species-specific shifts in above-and below-ground traits could help to better understand and predict the vegetation zonation patterns in temperate freshwater wetlands.

However, little is known about the functional divergence in AMF communities from contrasting climates. Ecotypes of Pennisetum flaccidum were grown in growth chambers with AMF communities originating from two elevations (3 105 and 4 176 m asl) on Mount Segrila in Tibet. The combinations were grown under two temperature regimes (7-12 degrees C and 14-19 degrees C), equivalent to the mean temperatures during the growing season at the two elevations. AMF communities from different elevations showed different fungal performance at both temperatures. In most cases, AMF from cold habitats developed higher intraradical and extraradical colonization at 7-12 degrees C than AMF from the warmer habitat, and vice versa. For mycorrhizal growth responses (MGR), there was no consistent local versus foreign effect, but AMF inoculum from colder habitats consistently led to a higher MGR than the other inoculum. These results provide strong evidence for functional differences among AMF communities from contrasting climates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

While the effects of these microbes on direct plant defense against insect herbivores are well described, knowledge of the effect of the microbes on indirect plant defense against insect herbivores is still limited. In this study, we evaluate the role of the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r in indirect plant defense against the generalist leaf-chewing insect Mamestra brassicae through a combination of behavioral, chemical, and gene-transcriptional approaches. We show that rhizobacterial colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots results in an increased attraction of the parasitoid Microplitis mediator to caterpillar-infested plants. Volatile analysis revealed that rhizobacterial colonization suppressed the emission of the terpene (E)-alpha-bergamotene and the aromatics methyl salicylate and lilial in response to caterpillar feeding. Rhizobacterial colonization decreased the caterpillar-induced transcription of the terpene synthase genes TPS03 and TPS04. Rhizobacteria enhanced both the growth and the indirect defense of plants under caterpillar attack. This study shows that rhizobacteria have a high potential to enhance the biocontrol of leaf-chewing herbivores based on enhanced attraction of parasitoids.","[Pangesti, Nurmi; Weldegergis, Berhane T.; Langendorf, Benjamin; van Loon, Joop J.

Here we explored variability in root morphology, histology and chemistry among fern species of temperate forest, and compared the observed patterns with those of seed plants. We sampled nine herbaceous fern species from temperate forest in northeastern China, and measured root morphological, histological and chemical characteristics across branch orders for each species. All nine fern species had 3 or 4 root orders. With increasing root order, diameter, tissue density, cortical thickness and vascular cylinder diameter increased, while specific root length (SRL) and tissue nitrogen concentration decreased. These were similar to the variability patterns that have been reported for seed plants, except for cortex. Like seed plants, nine fern species showed close relationships among root morphological, histological and chemical characteristics in first-order roots, such as diameter and cortex, tissue density and nitrogen concentration, suggesting that the general linkage between root structure and function exists in all vascular plants. The observed variation within fern root systems is comparable to the reported variation in seed plants, indicating that the same functional constraints control the evolution and development of root systems in vascular plants belonging either to the fern or seed plant lineages.","[Dong, Xueyun; Wang, Hongfeng; Gu, Jiacun; Wang, Yan; Wang, Zhengquan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xueyun] Harbin Univ, Sch Sci, Harbin 150086, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jiacun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Wang, ZQ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",wzqsilv@mail.nefu.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DL12CA06]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100470, 30130160]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitySichuan UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT1054]","The authors thank Guoyong Yan, Zhenyu Wang, Na Xu, Xuewei Zhang, Yue Zhang, and Liting Li for their help with the field and laboratory work, and Drs.

Root CO2 is usually sampled from excised roots, however, excision alters respiration rate and isolates the root sample from aboveground plant processes. To improve the integrity of root efflux delta(CO2)-C-13 measurements, we designed a chamber for sampling root-respired CO2 in situ from minimally disturbed tree roots. We compared root delta(CO2)-C-13 values from excised and attached roots in the field and we pruned mature Scots pine trees to induce a measureable change in root delta(CO2)-C-13. Excised root samples containing root wounds gave more C-13-depleted measurements of root-respired delta(CO2)-C-13 than intact roots by 1.8 aEuro degrees. Using chambers to sample CO2 from attached roots, we measured a diurnal change in root-respired delta(CO2)-C-13 of 3-4 aEuro degrees, triggered by pruning foliage from the trees. This chamber system permits high-frequency sampling of live root-respired delta(CO2)-C-13 that enables greater insight into plant respiratory processes and more accurate partitioning of soil-surface CO2 emissions.","[Snell, Helen S.

Mass loss, nitrogen (N) concentration, specific root area (SRA), root tissue density (RTD), and their remaining proportions were measured for initial and residual fine roots of two diameter classes (< 0.5 and 0.5-2 mm) of Quercus serrata and Ilex pedunculosa in a temperate forest. Litterbags were sequentially collected after 1 month of decomposition and then every 3 months for 27 months. N concentration dynamics during decomposition showed a significant interaction between species and diameter, and there was a greater convergence between diameter classes for Q. serrata than for I. pedunculosa. The remaining area and volume of the two diameters changed during decomposition in both species, but the degree of change was somewhat different between the species. The remaining surface area and volume in I. pedunculosa roots showed greater differences between diameter classes compared with Q. serrata roots. Remaining mass was positively correlated with the remaining C concentration and surface area and was negatively correlated with the remaining tissue volume and N concentration, according to principal component analysis analysis. Differences in morphological and chemical properties between diameter sizes of two species could indicate differences in decomposition processes.

We evaluated growth, root-to-shoot ratio (R/S), specific leaf area (SLA), needle nitrogen (N-mass), total non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and photosynthetic traits of 3-year-old seedlings in a greenhouse experiment using seed from six seed orchards (SO) representing the different regions where white spruce is reforested in Qu,bec. Height and total dry mass (TDM) were positively correlated with photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)). Total dry mass, but not height growth, was strongly correlated with latitude of seed origin (SO) and associated climate variables. A(max), g(s), g(m) and more marginally, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) were positively associated with the mean July temperature of the SO, while water use efficiency (WUE) was negatively associated. Maximum rates of carboxylation (V-cmax), maximum rates of electron transport (J(max)), SLA, N-mass, NSC and R/S showed no pattern. Our results did not demonstrate a higher A(max) for northern seed orchards, although this has been previously hypothesized as an adaptation mechanism for maintaining carbon uptake in northern regions. We suggest that g(s), g(m), WUE and PNUE are the functional traits most associated with fine-scale geographic clines and with the degree of local adaptation of white spruce populations to their biophysical environments. These geographic patterns may reflect in situ adaptive genetic differences in photosynthetic efficiency along the cline.","[Benomar, Lahcen; Villeneuve, Isabelle; Bousquet, Jean; Margolis, Hank A.] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Lamhamedi, Mohammed S.; Rainville, Andre] Minist Forets, Direct Rech Forestiere, Quebec City, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada; [Beaulieu, Jean] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, Stn St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Benomar, L (reprint author), Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Pavillon Abitibi Price, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",lahcen.benomar.1@ulaval.ca,"benomar, lahcen/Q-3080-2019","benomar, lahcen/0000-0001-9301-5655","Fonds de la Recherche du Quebec sur la Nature et les Technologies (FRQNT), Programme de recherche en partenariat sur l'amenagement et l'environnement forestiers; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Direction de la recherche forestiere (DRF) du ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs (MFFP)","This research was funded by grants to H.A.M. from the 'Fonds de la Recherche du Quebec sur la Nature et les Technologies (FRQNT), Programme de recherche en partenariat sur l'amenagement et l'environnement forestiers' and the Discovery Grant Program of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Important questions remain regarding the differences among species in early growth potential arising from shade tolerance. In addition, the role of leaf habit in shaping relationships underlying shade tolerance-related differences in seedling growth remains unresolved. In this study we examined variation in morphological and physiological traits among seedlings of 10 forest tree species of the European temperate zone varying in shade tolerance and leaf habit (broadleaved winter-deciduous species vs needle-leaved conifers) during a 10-week period. Seeds were germinated and grown in a controlled environment simulating an intermediate forest understory light environment to resolve species differences in initial growth and biomass allocation. In the high-resource experimental conditions during the study, seedlings increased biomass allocation to roots at the cost of leaf biomass independent of shade tolerance and leaf habit. Strong correlations between relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass fraction (LMF) indicate that physiology and biomass allocation were equally important determinants of RGR as plant structure and leaf morphology among these species. Our findings highlight the importance of seed mass- and seed size-related root morphology (specific root length-SRL) for shade tolerance during early ontogeny. Leaf and plant morphology (SLA, LAR) were more successful in explaining variation among species due to leaf habit than shade tolerance. In both broadleaves and conifers, shade-tolerant species had lower SRL and greater allocation of biomass to stems (stem mass fraction). Light-seeded shade-intolerant species with greater SRL had greater RGR in both leaf habit groups. However, the greatest plant mass was accumulated in the group of heavy-seeded shade-tolerant broadleaves. The results of our study suggest that the combinations of plant attributes enhancing growth under high light vary with shade tolerance, but differ between leaf habit groups.","[Modrzynski, Jerzy] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Forest Sites & Ecol, Fac Forestry, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Chmura, Daniel J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Tjoelker, Mark G.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia","Chmura, DJ (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Ul Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland.",djchmura@man.poznan.pl,"Chmura, Daniel J/H-6245-2011; Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016","Chmura, Daniel J/0000-0002-8776-1472; Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238","Department of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas AM University; Kosciuszko Foundation; Fulbright Program","The study was supported by the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management, Texas A&M University.

In this study, a total of 472 trees were harvested and measured for stem, root, branch, and foliage biomass from nine hardwood species in Northeast China. Two additive systems of biomass equations were developed, one based on tree diameter (D) only and one based on both tree diameter (D) and height (H). For each system, three constraints were set up to account for the cross-equation error correlations between four tree component biomass, two sub-total biomass, and total biomass. The model coefficients were simultaneously estimated using seemly unrelated regression (SUR). Likelihood analysis was used to verify the error structures of power functions in order to determine if logarithmic transformation should be applied on both sides of biomass equations. Jackknifing model residuals were used to validate the prediction performance of biomass equations. The results indicated that (1) stem biomass accounted for the largest proportion (62 %) of the total tree biomass; (2) the two additive systems of biomass equations obtained good model fitting and prediction, of which the model R (a) (2) was > 0.89, and the mean absolute percent bias (MAB %) was < 35 %; (3) the system of biomass equations based on both D and H significantly improved model fitting and performance, especially for total, aboveground, and stem biomass; and (4) the anti-log correction was not necessary in this study. The established additive systems of biomass equations can provide reliable and accurate estimation for individual tree biomass of the nine hardwood species in Chinese National Forest Inventory.","[Dong, Lihu; Li, Fengri] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianjun] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, SUNY ESF, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Li, FR (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",donglihu2006@163.com; lizhang@esf.edu; fengrili@126.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2012BAD22B02]; Scientific Research Funds for Forestry Public Welfare of China [201004026]","This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, Project# 2012BAD22B02 and the Scientific Research Funds for Forestry Public Welfare of China, Project# 201004026.

Two well-characterized strains of Mesorhizobium: Mesorhizobium loti NZP2213 and Mesorhizobium huakuii symbiovar loti MAFF303099 were assayed for their growth ability within the Neff strain of Acanthamoeba castellanii. Although the association ability and the initial uptake rate of both strains were similar, recovery of viable M. huakuii MAFF303099 after 4 h postinfection decreased markedly and that of M. loti NZP2213 increased. The latter strain was also able to survive prolonged co-incubation within amoebae and to self-release from the amoeba cell. The temperature 28 A degrees C and PBS were established as optimal for the uptake of Mesorhizobium by amoebae. The internalization of mesorhizobia was mediated by the mannose-dependent receptor.

Pruning did not alter temperature sensitivity of CO (2) efflux from stem and soil. Pruning is one of the common silvicultural practices for Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations to produce knot-free wood. However, little is known about the effects of pruning on stem and soil CO2 efflux in Chinese fir plantations. In this study, we experimentally manipulated the canopy of Chinese fir by pruning the lower 50 % of the green crown length in a Chinese fir plantation. We monitored the effects of pruning on the stem and soil CO2 efflux, stem radial growth, xylem sap flow, and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations. Our results showed that pruning resulted in the significant reduction of stem CO2 efflux, particularly during the growing season. Despite the removal of the lower 50 % of the green crown length, we did not observe a pronounced reduction in soil CO2 efflux and its components. Moreover, pruning had only little effect on sap flow. No significant difference was observed in the NSC concentrations between treatments in the stem cores and fine roots. We speculated that the different responses of stem and soil CO2 efflux to pruning in the Chinese fir (sprouting species) plantation may have resulted from the different carbon allocations between aboveground and belowground tissues. However, further studies are required to confirm if our findings could be applied to other tree species or ecosystems.","[Yang, Qingpeng; Liu, Lanlan; Zhang, Weidong; Wang, Silong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Huitong Expt Stn Forest Ecol, Shenyang 100016, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qingpeng; Zhang, Weidong; Wang, Silong] Huitong Natl Res Stn Forest Ecosyst, Huitong 418307, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lanlan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Ctr Remote Sensing & Spatial Anal, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Yang, QP (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Huitong Expt Stn Forest Ecol, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 100016, Peoples R China.",yqp226@gmail.com; slwang@iae.ac.cn,"Yang, qingpeng/B-3632-2014","Yang, qingpeng/0000-0003-2471-6233","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416905]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200302, 41030533]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050205]","This research was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, Grant no. 2012CB416905), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 31200302 and 41030533), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA05050205).

This study investigated the potential role of facilitation for the establishment of Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), a dominant Rocky Mountain tree species that is in decline due to an exotic blister rust disease (Cronartium ribicola), bark beetle outbreaks, and fire suppression. Surveys were conducted at five subalpine sites for spatial associations between naturally regenerating P. albicaulis seedlings and other plant species, and found that the cover of Vaccinium scoparium was higher in proximity to P. albicaulis seedlings. In transplant experiments, survival of P. albicaulis seedlings was higher when planted with V. scoparium and in shade cloth treatments, but neither survival nor growth rates were altered by clipping or rhizome severing of V. scoparium, suggesting a below-ground rather than above-ground facilitation mechanism. In contrast, Carex species reduced the survival and growth rates of P. albicaulis. In a fertilization experiment, no effect of nitrogen and/or phosphorous fertilization was found on Pinus albicaulis seedling growth, but seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and increased leaf phosphorus concentrations relative to seedlings growing in bare ground. In a microcosm experiment, P. albicaulis seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and leaf phosphorus concentrations than when grown alone, but only if P. albicaulis needles were added on the soil surface. My results suggest success of restoration plantings of greenhouse grown P. albicaulis seedlings may be improved by planting in areas where V. scoparium occurs, and avoiding areas dominated by Carex species. Removal of adjacent vegetation prior to planting seedlings may be ineffective in significantly altering either positive or negative effects of the neighboring plants. Selection of sites with adjacent shading elements, such as rocks, logs, stumps, or snags, may also improve seedling survival. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this regard, we evaluated the growth of six native species on three different artificial substrates. These species were Silene vulgaris, Silene secundiflora, Crithmum maritimum, Lagurus ovatus, Asteriscus maritimus, and Lotus creticus. A mixture of a green compost with a clay-loam soil (C + Soil), the same compost mixed with expanded clay (C + Clay), and the compost mixed with crushed bricks (C + Bricks) - all in 1:4 volumetric proportions - were the assayed substrates. Physichochemical and biochemical properties were studied in each mixture at the beginning and end of a three-month assay. Besides, the germination and growth of all plant species in each substrate type were evaluated. The mixtures C + Clay and C + Bricks showed greater porosity than C + Soil, leading to a high root: shoot biomass ratio in all species tested. Conversely, the mixture C + Soil possessed better biochemical properties (higher humic substances content and enzyme activity), but they decreased with experimental time. Contrarily, the humic substances and the dehydrogenase activity increased in the most porous mixtures. Regarding plant behaviour, S. vulgaris and L. ovatus showed greater germination and growth than the other species, especially above C + Clay and C + Bricks mixtures. Accordingly, we strongly recommend the use of lightweight and highly porous substrates as the basis for the growing of Mediterranean native herbaceous species, since they specially enhance their root development.

Symbiotic and non-symbiotic alfalfa plants were cultivated without or with low (1 mu M) Se addition at low (2mM) and adequate (10mM) N supply levels. The plants were analyzed for root nodulation, photosynthesis and growth parameters. The antioxidative defense and glutathione (GSH) redox state were also investigated. In the inoculated low-nitrogen (N) plants, Se markedly increased the number and fresh weight (FW) of the nodules without any effect on nitrogenase activity. Particularly in the nodulated low-N plants, it also significantly increased the net assimilation rate and soluble sugars, and enhanced protein synthesis. Though Se generally diminished the activity of antioxidative enzymes, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot -)) remained constant or even significantly diminished. This gives evidence that Se enhanced the protection of plants against oxidative damage. Se tended to increase GSH particularly in the leaves, and significantly increased the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) particularly in the low-N plants. We suggest that Se exerts its positive effect on the carbohydrate metabolism via modulation in the glutathione redox state.","[Hajiboland, Roghieh] Univ Tabriz, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Excellence Biodivers, Tabriz 5166614779, Iran; [Hajiboland, Roghieh; Rahmat, Somaieh] Univ Tabriz, Dept Plant Sci, Fac Nat Sci, Tabriz 5166614779, Iran; [Aliasgharzad, Naser] Univ Tabriz, Dept Soil Sci, Fac Agr, Tabriz 5166614779, Iran; [Hartikainen, Helina] Univ Helsinki, Dept Food & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Hajiboland, R (reprint author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Nat Sci, Ctr Excellence Biodivers, Tabriz 5166614779, Iran.",ehsan@tabrizu.ac.ir,"Hajiboland, Roghieh/Y-7332-2019","Hajiboland, Roghieh/0000-0003-0552-4156; Aliasgharzad, Nasser/0000-0003-3853-8917",,,,60,7,8,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Although we have a good understanding of the effects of laboratory-induced mutations on the molecular- and organismal-level phenotypes, the study of natural mutations has lagged behind. In this work, we explore the phenotypic space and the evolutionary history of a previously identified adaptive transposable element insertion. We first combined several tests that capture different signatures of selection to show that there is evidence of positive selection in the regions flanking FBti0019386 insertion. We then explored several phenotypes related to known phenotypic effects of nearby genes, and having plausible connections to fitness variation in nature. We found that flies with FBti0019386 insertion had a shorter developmental time and were more sensitive to stress, which are likely to be the adaptive effect and the cost of selection of this mutation, respectively. Interestingly, these phenotypic effects are not consistent with a role of FBti0019386 in temperate adaptation as has been previously suggested. Indeed, a global analysis of the population frequency of FBti0019386 showed that climatic variables explain well the FBti0019386 frequency patterns only in Australia. Finally, although FBti0019386 insertion could be inducing the formation of heterochromatin by recruiting HP1a ( Heterochromatin Protein 1a) protein, the insertion is associated with upregulation of sra in adult females. Overall, our integrative approach allowed us to shed light on the evolutionary history, the relevant fitness effects, and the likely molecular mechanisms of an adaptive mutation and highlights the complexity of natural genetic variants.","[Ullastres, Anna; Petit, Natalia; Gonzalez, Josefa] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Barcelona, Spain","Gonzalez, J (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Barcelona, Spain.",josefa.gonzalez@ibe.upf-csic.es,,"Petit Marty, Natalia/0000-0002-3810-1152; /0000-0001-9824-027X",European ComissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [Marie Curie CIG PCIG-2011-293860]; Spanish Government (Fundamental Research Projects) [BFU-2011-24397],"The authors thank Maite G.

We selected four very early-, seven early-, 11 middle-, and eight late-successional plant species from six different families and functional groups and grew them with and without a mixed fungal inoculum and compared root architecture, mycorrhizal responsiveness, and plant growth rate. Our results indicate mycorrhizal responsiveness increases with plant successional stage and that this effect explains more variation in mycorrhizal response than is explained by phylogenetic relatedness. The mycorrhizal responsiveness of individual plant species was positively correlated with mycorrhizal root infection and negatively correlated with average plant mass and the number of root tips per unit mass, indicating that both plant growth rate and root architecture trade off with investment in mycorrhizal mutualisms. Because late-successional plants are very responsive to mycorrhizal fungi, our results suggest that fungal community dynamics may be an important driver of plant succession.","[Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Koziol, L (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",ekoziol@indiana.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1050237, DEB-0919434]; SERDP [RC-2330]; IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant; Bever/Schultz laboratory group; Nature Conservancy","We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1050237 and DEB-0919434), the SERDP (RC-2330), and the IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant, the Bever/Schultz laboratory group, and The Nature Conservancy, with special thanks to P.

At the soil-root interface such mineral components are embedded by mucilaginous material that is secreted from continuously growing root cap cells. In order to determine the role of plant mucilages in As(V) sorption by iron oxy-hydroxides, we layered a calcium (Ca)-polygalacturonate network (CaPGA) on to amorphous iron (Fe) (III) hydroxide (ferrihydrite, Fh) particles. The scanning electron micrographs of the CaPGA network coating the ferrihydrite (Fh-CaPGA) show a regular structure with a honeycomb-like pattern where interlacing fibrils form a porous system. The FT-IR spectra of Fh-CaPGA suggest that CaPGA fibrils are retained by the surface Fe(III) nuclei of Fh through electrostatic interactions. The sorption experiments carried out at pH 4.3 and 5.8 indicated a smaller amount of As(V) sorbed by Fh-CaPGA than by Fh alone, being less after 3 and 24hours of reaction by about 70 and 30%, respectively. The sorption of As(V) by Fh was also studied in the presence of caffeic acid (CAF), an important root exudate. Simultaneous sorption kinetics show that As(V) sorption by Fh is almost independent of CAF concentration, indicating a greater affinity of arsenate ions towards the Fh surfaces. However, the amount of As(V) sorbed by the Fh coated by CaPGA, in the presence of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0mmCAF, is markedly smaller by about 20, 27 and 40%, respectively, than that found in the As(V)-CAF-Fh ternary systems. This is caused mainly by redox reactions involving CAF and the surface Fe(III) nuclei of Fh leading to the formation of CAF oxidation products which prevent As(V) sorption.","[Castaldi, P.; Garau, G.; Lauro, G.

The predictive power of such indirect measurement is useful for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of the Mediterranean species. Forest biomass estimation has been simplified by the availability of indirect methodologies for automatic measuring. However, most of the information on forest root systems is largely unexplored due to the difficulty in estimating belowground biomass (BGB) at large scale. A plausible approach to investigating forest BGB is to establish a relationship between a number of dendrometric parameters related to the aboveground vegetation (AGB) (e.g., tree diameter and height) and the belowground component of the total biomass. This work presents findings for indirect measurements of BGB in the typical Mediterranean landscapes focusing on sclerophyllous vegetation, specifically Phillyrea latifolia L. The purpose of the present study is twofold: (a) to develop a model explaining the BGB distribution of P. latifolia based on field data for dendrometric parameters, and (b) to understand how the ratio between BGB and AGB varies according to stem diameter as a proxy of plant growth. A total of 50 P. latifolia plants were randomly selected in the study areas and considered for excavation. Individual plants were analyzed to determine AGB and BGB development. A number of models were developed and tested to predict the BGB and root/shoot ratio using aboveground field measures. Allometric equations were employed to predict the AGB and BGB and relative partitioning in the Phillyrea community. Models for P. latifolia AGB and BGB estimation that include crown diameter and stem height measures augment the models' predictive power. When used alone, the predictive power of the root collar diameter appears to be overestimated, while its effect is stronger for a subset of observations with larger crown diameter and stem height. The root/shoot ratio values of plant species typically related to the Mediterranean context seem to be largely superior to the ratio values of trees and forests. The model is ideally suited to incorporate indirectly measured tree height for a rapid and reliable assessment of the biomass of single Mediterranean species. Further research might include replication of the same studies in different geographic areas of the Mediterranean and in-depth analyses of AGB.","[Marziliano, Pasquale A.] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Agr, Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Lafortezza, Raffaele; Medicamento, Umberto; Giannico, Vicenzo; Colangelo, Giuseppe; Sanesi, Giovanni] Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Lorusso, Leonardo] Municipal Monopoli, Apulia, BA, Italy","Sanesi, G (reprint author), Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",giovanni.sanesi@uniba.it,"Lafortezza, Raffaele/G-2104-2018; Marziliano, Pasquale A./L-9169-2015","Lafortezza, Raffaele/0000-0003-4642-8435; Marziliano, Pasquale A./0000-0003-1327-277X; sanesi, giovanni/0000-0002-4218-3605; Giannico, Vincenzo/0000-0002-9907-3730",,,,41,17,17,1,30,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

However, disentangling the precise factors that determine recruitment success in species that critically rely on mycorrhizal fungi represents a major challenge. In this study, we used seed germination experiments, 454 amplicon pyrosequencing and assessment of soil conditions to investigate the factors driving changes in local abundance in 28 populations of the orchid Neottia ovata. Comparison of population sizes measured in 2003 and 2013 showed that nearly 60% of the studied populations had declined in size (average growth rate across all populations: -0.01). Investigation of the mycorrhizal fungi in both the roots and soil revealed a total of 68 species of putatively mycorrhizal fungi, 21 of which occurred exclusively in roots, 25 that occurred solely in soil and 22 that were observed in both the soil and roots. Seed germination was limited and significantly and positively related to soil moisture content and soil pH, but not to fungal community composition. Large populations or populations with high population growth rates showed significantly higher germination than small populations or populations declining in size, but no significant relationships were found between population size or growth and mycorrhizal diversity. Overall, these results indicate that temporal changes in abundance were related to the ability of seeds to germinate, but at the same time they provided limited evidence that variation in fungal communities played an important role in determining population dynamics.","[Jacquemyn, Hans; Waud, Michael; Brys, Rein] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biol Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Waud, Michael; Lievens, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Merckx, Vincent S.

We characterized the belowground fungal community in a heavy metal polluted and a non-polluted soil using 454 pyrosequencing. The fungal communities at both study sites were shown to consist mainly of the same ectomycorrhizal species, but a consistent shift in the relative abundances of these species was observed, whereas no differences in fungal diversity were found. In metal polluted soil, root tips of young pines were initially largely colonized by stress-tolerant dark Ascomycota that were mostly replaced by metal-tolerant Basidiomycota within 2 years. Compared to older forests, a low belowground fungal diversity was observed in the two pioneer stands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we consider how historical contingencies might alter those responses because function depends on prior conditions or biota. Functional resilience can be driven by physiological, community or adaptive shifts; historical contingencies can result from the influence of historical environments or a combination of priority effects and biotic resistance. By modelling microbial population responses to environmental change, we demonstrate that historical environments can constrain soil function with the degree of constraint depending on the magnitude of change in the context of the prior environment. For example microbial assemblages from more constant environments were more sensitive to change leading to poorer functional acclimatisation compared to microbial assemblages from more fluctuating environments. Such historical contingencies can lead to deviations from expected functional responses to climate change as well as local variability in those responses. Our results form a set of interrelated hypotheses regarding soil microbial responses to climate change that warrant future empirical attention.","[Hawkes, Christine V.; Keitt, Timothy H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Hawkes, CV (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",chawkes@austin.utexas.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF 1064901],"The authors thank Stephanie Kivlin, Melanie Mayes, Gangsheng Wang and three anonymous reviewers for comments on previous drafts of this manuscript.

There is growing evidence that interactive effects of simultaneous herbivory also occur across the root-shoot interface. In our study, Brassica rapa roots were infested with root fly larvae (Delia radicum) and the shoots infested with Pieris brassicae, either singly or simultaneously, to study these root-shoot interactions. As an analytical platform, we used Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) to investigate VOCs over a 3 day time period. Our set-up allowed us to monitor root and shoot emissions concurrently on the same plant. Focus was placed on the sulfur-containing compounds; methanethiol, dimethylsulfide (DMS), and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), because these compounds previously have been shown to be biologically active in the interactions of Brassica plants, herbivores, parasitoids, and predators, yet have received relatively little attention. The shoots of plants simultaneously infested with AG and below-ground (BG) herbivores emitted higher levels of sulfur-containing compounds than plants with a single herbivore species present. In contrast, the emission of sulfur VOCs from the plant roots increased as a consequence of root herbivory, independent of the presence of an AG herbivore. The onset of root emissions was more rapid after damage than the onset of shoot emissions. The shoots of double infested plants also emitted higher levels of methanol. Thus, interactive effects of root and shoot herbivores exhibit more strongly in the VOC emissions from the shoots than from the roots, implying the involvement of specific signaling interactions.","[Danner, Holger; van Dam, Nicole M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Mol Interact Ecol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Brown, Phil; Harren, Frans J.

We conducted a thorough literature review in order to assess the state of the art in the scientific research that has been performed on Mexican coastal dunes. We found that 47% of the studies focused on plant ecology mostly along the Atlantic coast. The state of Veracruz has been the most studied (86). In addition, the spatial distribution of 844 plant species and 166 of animal species have been reported. Four hundred ecological interactions have demonstrated the relevance of different species for reproductive fitness in plants and plant succession processes. The studies highlight human activities as the main stressor on coastal dunes systems. We conclude that it is necessary to use biodiversity variables as ecological indicators for monitoring climate changes as well as the impacts of human activities on coastal dunes. The above will enable us to devise conservation and environmental management strategies where economic development and environmental impact are integrated within the ecological studies hypothesis.

For many grassland and savanna ecosystems, water limitation is a key regulator of individual plant, community and ecosystem processes. Maximum rooting depth is commonly used to characterize the susceptibility of plant species to drought. This rests on the assumption that deep-rooted plant species would have a greater total volume of soil water to exploit and should be less susceptible to episodic changes in water availability. 2. Independent of maximum rooting depth, rooting strategies based on differences in biomass allocation with depth, uptake plasticity in relation to water availability and variation in water transport capability may all influence growth responses and susceptibility to drought. Many examples from grasslands and savannas reflect these rooting strategies among coexisting grass, forb and woody species. 3. Here, we use a dynamic model of plant water uptake and growth to show how changes in root distribution, functional plasticity and root hydraulic conductivity have the potential to influence aboveground biomass and competitive outcomes, even when maximum rooting depth remains constant. We also show theoretically that shifts in root distribution to surface soils without changes in maximum depth can potentially outweigh the benefits of increased maximum rooting depth. 4. Combining our current reliance on biogeographic descriptions of maximum rooting depth with insights about other, more subtle aspects of root structure and function are likely to improve our understanding of ecosystem responses to dynamic water limitation.","[Nippert, Jesse B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Holdo, Ricardo M.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Nippert, JB (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, 106 Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nippert@ksu.edu,,"Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Program [DEB-0823341],We thank John Girvin III for artistic support and Kim O'Keefe for comments that improved this manuscript.

Using leaf functional traits (specific leaf area, photosynthetic rate, relative water content and stomatal conductance) and tree performance (mortality rate) in the field, we assessed how shade and drought tolerance of leaves are related to the species' positions along a successional gradient in moist tropical forest in Chiapas, Mexico. We quantified morphological and physiological leaf shade and drought tolerance indicators for 25 dominant species that characterize different successional stages. We found that light demand decreases with succession, confirming the importance of light availability for species filtering during early stages of succession. In addition, water transport levels in the leaves decreased with succession, but high water transport did not increase the leaf's vulnerability to drought. In fact, late successional species showed higher mortality in dry years than early successional ones, against suggestions from leaf drought tolerance traits. It is likely that pioneer species have other drought-avoiding strategies, like deep rooting systems and water storage in roots and stems. More research on belowground plant physiology is needed to understand how plants adapt to changing environments, which is crucial to anticipate the effects of climate change on secondary forests.","[Schonbeck, Leonie; Lohbeck, Madelon; Bongers, Frans; Sterck, Frank] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon; Martinez Ramos, Miguel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico","Schonbeck, L (reprint author), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",leonie.schoenbeck@wsl.ch; madelon.lohbeck@wur.nl; frans.bongers@wur.nl; mmartinez@cieco.unam.mx; frank.sterck@wur.nl,"Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Martinez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800","NSF-LTREBNational Science Foundation (NSF); Wageningen University and Research Centre; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific ResearchScience for Global Development) [W85-326]; MABOTRO projects [SEMARNAT-CONACYT 2002-C01-0597, SEP-CONACYT CB-2005-01-51043, SEP-CONACYT CB-2009-01-129740]; Alberta Mennega foundation","Our special thanks go to the people of Loma Bonita, Chiapas for their hospitality, and in particular to Gilberto Jamangape for practical support and species identification.

Matson's accuracy rate in estimating moose ages. To estimate ages, G. Matson counted annuli in the cementum of root tips using a Giemsa-staining technique and assumed a birth date of 1 June. We originally radiocollared moose at 9 months of age, and we extracted teeth upon death. Estimated moose ages averaged 7.0 years using canines and 6.9 using I1 teeth (range = 2-16 year), and known ages of each sample averaged 7.1 years. The accuracy rate among 76 canines was 74% and improved to 95% when ignoring errors within 1 year of the known age; comparative results among 77 I1 teeth were 66% and 94%. By far the most frequent error was a 1-year underestimate in age, particularly for moose that died in July and August, which included the seasonal transition period associated with completing peripheral annuli formation. After controlling for -1-year errors associated with the seasonal transition period, we found evidence for errors accumulating with age. We found no significant difference in accuracy based on which tooth was sectioned. However, G. Matson observed more individually distinct annuli and regular deposition patterns in canines, compared with incisors. Thus, we recommend the more easily extracted canine for estimating moose age.

While range shifts due to climate change have been typically modeled based on abiotic factors alone, interactions among species in diverse communities may alter these range dynamics by inhibiting or enhancing the establishment of propagules along the leading edge, or by increasing or decreasing tolerance to novel climates at the trailing edge. Here, we investigated how the rate of expansion at leading range margins, and contraction at trailing range margins of temperate tree species in response to both past and current climate change related to an important species interaction: whether temperate tree species associate with arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal symbionts. Mycorrhizal symbioses can mediate plant stress tolerance, and lack of EM fungal mutualists has been linked to establishment failures of EM tree species in new ranges. We found no difference in rates of leading edge expansion between the two guilds. However, EM tree taxa showed reduced contraction at their trailing edge compared to AM taxa in response to both past and current climate change. Since the mycorrhizal guild of the dominant trees may affect ecosystem properties, differential range dynamics between these functional groups of trees may have consequences for the functioning of future forests.","[Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Zhu, Kai] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhu, Kai] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ordonez, Alejandro] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lankau@wisc.edu,"Zhu, Kai/H-1022-2013; Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008; Ordonez, Alejandro/I-7950-2013","Zhu, Kai/0000-0003-1587-3317; Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X; Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551",NSF DEB Dimensions of Biodiversity awardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1045977]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC],R.

A major reason for this is that we don't know how snapshot data on rooting differences translate into ecologically relevant patterns of water use at seasonal scales. We used stable isotopes in soil and stem water to quantify functional rooting profiles in grasses and two tree species in a South African savanna. Concurrently, we measured tree sap-flow velocity, grass canopy temperature (a transpiration correlate), and soil moisture content at multiple depths over the course of a growing season. We used lasso regression to identify the dominant soil moisture layers driving daily variation in tree and grass water-use metrics while controlling for weather variables. We found clear rooting depth differences between grasses (shallow) and trees (deep) from the isotopic data, and these patterns were strongly supported by the water-use data, which showed that grasses and trees predominantly responded to soil moisture availability at 5 and 40 cm depth, respectively. Our results provide a rare example of mechanistic support for the resource partitioning hypothesis in savannas, with important implications for our understanding of tree-grass dynamics under altered precipitation regimes.","[Holdo, Ricardo M.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Nippert, Jesse B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Holdo, RM (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",holdor@missouri.edu,,"Nippert, Jesse/0000-0002-7939-342X",Andrew W.

To test this hypothesis, we manipulated establishment timing for four congeneric pairs of perennial plants and assessed trait plasticity. Because soil conditions can affect trait expression and competition, we grew the plants in field-collected soil from each congener. Competition was generally weak across species, but the order of establishment affected divergence in biomass between potmates for three congeneric pairs. The type of plastic response differed among genera, with trait means of early-establishing individuals of Rumex and Solanum spp. differing from late-establishing individuals, and trait divergence between potmates of Plantago and Trifolium spp. depending on which species established first. Consistent with adaptive trait plasticity, higher specific leaf area (SLA) and root-shoot ratio in Rumex spp. established later suggest that these individuals were maximizing their ability to capture light and soil resources. Greater divergence in SLA correlated with increased summed biomass of competitors, which is consistent with trait divergence moderating the strength of competition for some species. Species did not consistently perform better in conspecific or congener soil, but soil type influenced the effect of establishment order. For example, biomass divergence between Rumex potmates was greater in R. obtusifolius soil regardless of which species established first. These results suggest that plant responses to establishment timing act in a species-specific fashion, potentially enhancing coexistence in plant communities.","[Brandt, Angela J.; Leahy, S.

Currently, stands are growing near their physiological extreme, thus it is very important to understand the biology of the species to develop effective conservation strategies and plans. The intra-specific diversity of P. officinalis has been analyzed at different spatial scales, from the continental to the insular Caribbean areas, by using AFLP, chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, cpDNA, and nrITS markers. The genetic diversity of P. officinalis was higher from continental than from island populations. A similar pattern of genetic diversity resulted from Bradyrhizobial strains isolated from P. officinalis nodules. Bradyrhizobial strains associated with P. officinalis have positive effects on nodulation, N-acquisition, and plant growth. Pterocarpus officinalis is not a halophyte plant. However, it grew better in flooding due to the lenticels, adventitious roots, and aerenchyma that promote root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and N-fixing root-nodular bacteria. Furthermore, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and nodulation improve flooding tolerance in P. officinalis seedlings. The ecological, demographic, genetic, and physiological data that have been collected through the Caribbean populations of P. officinalis in combination with data from its associated microorganisms are providing the framework to develop better restoration efforts for the species.","[Ba, Amadou M.] Univ Antilles Guyane, Lab Biol & Physiol Vegetales, UFR Sci Exactes & Nat, LSTM,UMR113,IRD,CIRAD,UM2,INRA,SupAgro, F-97159 Pointe a Pitre 97159, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe; [Rivera-Ocasio, Elsie] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, Bayamon, PR 00959 USA","Ba, AM (reprint author), Univ Antilles Guyane, UFR Sci Exactes & Nat, LSTM,UMR113,IRD,CIRAD,UM2,INRA,SupAgro, Lab Biol & Physiol Vegetales, Campus Fouillole,BP 592, F-97159 Pointe a Pitre 97159, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe.",amadou.ba@univ-ag.fr,,,,,,59,3,3,5,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2015,35,3,,,,,433,442,,10.1007/s13157-015-0651-5,,,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CJ2WU,WOS:000355346200002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, YH; Niu, JZ; Zhu, WL; Du, XQ; Li, J",,,,"Zhang, Yinghu; Niu, Jianzhi; Zhu, Weili; Du, Xiaoqing; Li, Jiao",,,Effects of plant roots on soil preferential pathways and soil matrix in forest ecosystems,JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Preferential flow; Preferential pathways; Soil matrix; Root length density; Root biomass,SCOTS PINE STANDS; FLOW PATHS; SURFACE-AREA; WATER-FLOW; BIOMASS; TRANSPORT; TURNOVER; LENGTH; AGE; MACROPORES,"To characterize effects of plant roots on preferential flow (PF), we measured root length density (RLD) and root biomass (RB) in Jiufeng National Forest Park, Beijing, China.

Empirical (K-s) and theoretical (K-p) sapwood area-specific hydraulic conductivity, hydraulically weighted (d(h)) and simple (d) tracheid diameters as well as tracheid density (TD) in roots, stems, and branches were studied in Larix sibirica trees, the dominant conifer at the southern, drought-affected range limit of the boreal forest in Inner Asia. We compared the hydraulic architecture of L. sibirica in two stands in Mongolia to larch trees grown in Central Europe under moist conditions and related hydraulics to macroclimate (precipitation, temperature) and productivity (basal area increment, BAI). K-s, K-p, d(h), and d correlated positively, and TD negatively with precipitation, temperature, and also BAI. Mean growing season precipitation (MGSP) seemed to affect the hydraulic traits more than temperature. A meta-analysis covering data of 14 conifer species from the northern hemisphere revealed a general relationship between MGSP and hydraulic traits. In contrast to expectation, K-p and d(h) did not show a steady decline from roots through the stem to branches in L. sibirica, but were of similar size or larger in the stem. Our results suggest that considerable plasticity in the hydraulic architecture is an important element of the drought adaptation of L. sibirica. It combines with drought-induced fine root abscission (as reported from earlier work) which may help to protect larger roots and the stem from cavitation.","[Chenlemuge, Tselmeg; Schuldt, Bernhard; Dulamsuren, Choimaa; Hertel, Dietrich; Leuschner, Christoph; Hauck, Markus] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hauck, M (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mhauck@gwdg.de,"Yang, Da/L-6267-2013; Schuldt, Bernhard/O-4172-2015","Yang, Da/0000-0001-7306-3289; Hauck, Markus/0000-0002-8218-8400",Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council,"The study was supported by a grant from the Volkswagen Foundation to M.

Second, we tested whether deciduous woody species restrict water uptake to the shallow soil during the wet season and cease water uptake during the dry season. To address these questions, we measured water source use of two deciduous and three evergreen species over 13months using stable isotopes. As hypothesized in previous studies, we showed that leaflessness in deciduous plants is an important source of stem water isotopic fractionation. Therefore, we compared stable isotope ratios of stem water only when deciduous species had leaves and found that all species, except the evergreen Lyonia ferruginea, used proportionally the same water sources. Early dry season water use was based on water availability for all species except L. ferruginea, and deep soil (50-150cm) was the most important water source. During the late dry and wet seasons, water uptake from each soil layer was based on its respective proportion of fine roots. Nevertheless, deep water remained an important water source throughout the year. This study clearly demonstrates the limitations of using stable isotopes of stem water when comparing deciduous versus evergreen species. Further, this study is the first to directly quantify depth of water uptake via isotope analysis and couple these findings with root distribution.

Management methodologies include classical forestry approaches based on classification of the natural environment according to climatic zones, soil characteristics and composition of herbaceous as well as woody vegetation. One possibility for obtaining objective information came with the development of ecologically applicable instrumentation, allowing studies on the whole tree and stand levels to be undertaken anywhere in the field. Information may be derived at sites that are not permanently observed and are not equipped with additional constructions, such as towers, masts, or greenhouses. These field applicable methods are focused especially on tree and stand macrostructure, water relations and functional parameters of trees. In addition, problems associated with interactions between trees and different organisms are also discussed. A series of methods based on different principles is useful to measure mostly quantitative, operative or effective tree parameters as tree crowns and leaf distribution, stems (or large tree trunks) and root systems including skeleton and absorptive fine roots. This is sometimes possible to do with rather simple methods, but instrumental methods prevail especially for root studies. In addition to several classical measurement principles including anatomical or mechanical sensing, the methods work with sound speed (acoustic tomography) using electromagnetic rays of different wavelength (from radar to optical), electric conductivity or impedance, supersonic air stream and thermodynamics for example. Methods for data evaluation and examples of application are also included. The whole complex system approach should serve for different scientific fields (including hydrology, landscape care, horticulture, forensic engineering, etc.) and especially to support precise forestry.","[Cermak, Jan; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda; Trcala, Miroslav; Simon, Jaroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Cermak, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",jan.cermak@mendelu.cz,"Nadezhdina, Nadezhda/E-6075-2014; Trcala, Miroslav/E-3687-2014",,"Internal agency of the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology [73/2013, VZ MSM 6215648902]; OP Education for Competitiveness (European Social Fund) [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0017]; OP Education for Competitiveness (state budget of Czech Republic) [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0017]","The study was done within the framework of the project of Internal agency of the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology No. 73/2013: ""Ecophysiological behavior of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

In subtropical plantation forests, understory removal and fertilization have been widely applied; however, our understanding on how understory removal affects soil respiration and how the process is regulated by fertilization is limited. Here, we conducted an understory removal experiment combined with fertilization to evaluate the effects of the two forest management practices and their interactions on soil respiration in subtropical forest in southern China. Methods The study was conducted in a split-plot design with fertilization as the whole-plot factor, understory removal as the subplot factor and block as the random factor in subtropical Eucalyptus plantations. In total, there were four treatments: control with unfertilized and intact understory (CK), understory removal but without fertilization (UR), with fertilization but without understory removal (FT) and with fertilization + understory removal (FT + UR). Eucalyptus above-and belowground biomass increment, fine root biomass, soil temperature, soil moisture and soil respiration were measured in the present study. Understory respiration (RU) was quantified in different ways: R-u = R-CK - R-UR or R-u = R-FT - R(FT + UR); fertilization increased soil respiration (RFI) was also quantified in different ways: R-FI = R-FT - R-CK or R-FI = R(FT + UR) - R-UR. Important Findings Over a 2-year experiment, our data indicate that understory removal significantly decreased soil respiration, while fertilization increased soil respiration. Understory removal decreased soil respiration by 28.8% under fertilization, but only 15.2% without fertilization. Fertilization significantly increased soil respiration by 23.6% with the presence of understory vegetation, and only increased by 3.7% when understory was removed, indicating that fertilization increased soil respiration mainly by increasing the contribution of the understory. Our study advances our understanding of the interactive effects of understory management and fertilization on soil respiration in subtropical plantations.","[Wan, Songze; Chen, Yuanqi; Zhu, Xiaolin; Zhou, Lixia; Lin, Yongbiao; Liu, Zhanfeng; Fu, Shenglei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wan, Songze; Chen, Yuanqi; Zhu, Xiaolin] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chenlu] Henan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Plant Stress Biol, Kaifeng City 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianping] Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China","Fu, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Xingke Rd 723, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sfu@scbg.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31210103920, 30925010, 31100384]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05070301]","National Science Foundation of China (31210103920, 30925010, 31100384); Strategic Priority Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA05070301).",,47,3,5,5,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Little is currently known about the drivers of fungal population differentiation and subsequent divergence of species, particularly in symbiotic, mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we investigate the population structure and environmental adaptation in Suillus brevipes (Peck) Kuntze, a wind-dispersed soil fungus that is symbiotic with pine trees. We assembled and annotated the reference genome for Su.brevipes and resequenced the whole genomes of 28 individuals from coastal and montane sites in California. We detected two clearly delineated coast and mountain populations with very low divergence. Genomic divergence was restricted to few regions, including a region of extreme divergence containing a gene encoding for a membrane Na+/H+ exchanger known for enhancing salt tolerance in plants and yeast. Our results are consistent with a very recent split between the montane and coastal Su.brevipes populations, with few small genomic regions under positive selection and a pattern of dispersal and/or establishment limitation. Furthermore, we identify a putatively adaptive gene that motivates further functional analyses to link genotypes and phenotypes and shed light on the genetic basis of adaptive traits.","[Branco, Sara; Taylor, John W.; Bruns, Thomas D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gladieux, Pierre] Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Gladieux, Pierre] CNRS, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Ellison, Christopher E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kuo, Alan; LaButti, Kurt; Lipzen, Anna; Grigoriev, Igor V.] Joint Genome Inst, Dept Energy, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Liao, Hui-Ling; Vilgalys, Rytas] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Peay, Kabir G.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Branco, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sara.mayer.branco@gmail.com,"Gladieux, Pierre/D-1014-2014","Gladieux, Pierre/0000-0003-1929-1576; Vilgalys, Rytas/0000-0001-8299-3605; Peay, Kabir/0000-0002-7998-7412; Grigoriev, Igor/0000-0002-3136-8903","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI 1046115]; U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User FacilityUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231];  [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-IOF-No.273086]","We thank Holly Edes for technical assistance, the Computational Genomics Resource Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley for assistance with computational analysis, Joey Spatafora and the 1000 Fungal Genomes Project for the Suillus brevipes reference genome and annotation, Ben Wilson and Philipp Messer for sharing scripts to perform selective sweep analysis and Megan Phifer-Rixey for comments on an earlier draft.

Recent experimental studies show that increased exudate inputs may cause a net loss of soil carbon. This stimulation of microbial carbon mineralization ('priming') is commonly rationalized by the assumption that exudates provide a readily bioavailable supply of energy for the decomposition of native soil carbon (co-metabolism). Here we show that an alternate mechanism can cause carbon loss of equal or greater magnitude. We find that a common root exudate, oxalic acid, promotes carbon loss by liberating organic compounds from protective associations with minerals. By enhancing microbial access to previously mineral-protected compounds, this indirect mechanism accelerated carbon loss more than simply increasing the supply of energetically more favourable substrates. Our results provide insights into the coupled biotic-abiotic mechanisms underlying the 'priming' phenomenon and challenge the assumption that mineral-associated carbon is protected from microbial cycling over millennial timescales.","[Keiluweit, Marco; Kleber, Markus] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Keiluweit, Marco; Bougoure, Jeremy J.; Pett-Ridge, Jennifer; Weber, Peter K.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Bougoure, Jeremy J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Nico, Peter S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kleber, Markus] Leibnitz Zentrum Agrarlandschaftsforsch ZALF eV, Inst Bodenlandschaftsforsch, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany","Keiluweit, M (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, ALS Bldg 3017, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",keiluweit@umass.edu,"Kleber, Markus/M-1381-2019; Nico, Peter/F-6997-2010","Kleber, Markus/0000-0002-5681-2361; Nico, Peter/0000-0002-4180-9397","Lawrence Scholar Fellowship awarded through Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL); Institute of Soil Landscape Research, Leibniz-Center for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Muncheberg,Germany [2014-1918]; US Department of Energy by LLNLUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; LLNL LDRD 'Microbes and Minerals: Imaging C Stabilization'; US DOE Genomics Science program award [SA-DOE-29318]; LBNL from LLNL [IC006762]; DOE-BER Sustainable Systems SFA; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the US DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","The authors thank A.L.D.

We investigated belowground responses to short-term phosphorus (P) fertilization in a P-limited woodland. Methods Ten Eucalyptus tereticornis were randomly selected and five fertilized with superphosphate equivalent to 50 kg P ha(-1) over 6 months. We estimated aboveground (understory) and belowground plant biomass, and collected samples for soil chemistry, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization, soil fungal abundance and community composition, and extraction of nematodes and microarthropods. Results P-fertilization increased root biomass, abundance of non-AM fungi, and abundances of Collembola, and altered fungal community structure, but was associated with a decrease in predatory nematodes. Structural equation modelling indicated that effects on Collembola and fungal abundances were mediated by direct effects of the fertilizer treatment and/or indirect effects via root biomass responses. However, fungal community compositional changes and reductions in predatory nematodes resulted primarily due to fertilization-mediated changes in soil pH. Conclusion Our study shows that understory plant communities and soil biota are P-limited at the study site but that some biotic groups appear to be more sensitive to changes in soil pH than to increases in P availability.","[Nielsen, Uffe N.; Prior, Samantha; Delroy, Brendan; Walker, Jennifer K.

The aim of this research was to analyze ectomycorrhizal community structure and to determine root colonization rate with ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi of poplars growing on pyrite tailings contaminated site near the river Timok (Eastern Serbia). Materials and Methods: Identification of ectomycorrhizal types was performed by combining morphological and anatomical characterization of ectomycorrhizae with molecular identification approach, based on sequencing of the nuclear ITS rRNA region. Also, colonization of poplar roots with ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septated endophytic fungi were analysed with intersection method. Results and Conclusions: Physico-chemical analyses of soil from studied site showed unfavourable water properties of soil, relatively low pH and high content of heavy metals (copper and zinc). In investigated samples only four different ectomycorrhizal fungi were found. To the species level were identified Thelephora terrestris and Tomentella ellisi, while two types remained unidentified. Type Thelephora terrestris made up 89% of all ectomycorrhizal roots on studied site. Consequently total values of Species richness index and Shannon-Weaver diversity index were 0.80 and 0.43, respectively. No structures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were recorded. Unfavourable environmental conditions prevailing on investigated site caused decrease of ectomycorrhizal types diversity.

Despite the large amount of data available on the effects of herbivores on various plant groups, we still know very little information about the interactions of herbivores with individuals having different ploidy levels. We studied the relationship of diploid and tetraploid Centaurea phrygia in natural and experimental garden conditions to the community of pre-dispersal seed predators developing in flower heads of the plants. In addition, we collected a set of data on flowering phenology, and flower head morphology and chemistry to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the differences between cytotypes. The two cytotypes are strongly differentiated in their flower head morphology and chemistry as well as in their flowering phenology, with flower heads of diploids being larger, containing more secondary metabolites and flowering later. Also, the two cytotypes strongly differed in the composition of insect communities in the flower heads and tetraploids suffered higher seed damage than the diploids. The differences between cytotypes in seed damage were generally consistent across datasets, indicating that the differences are not due to differences in the habitats in which the cytotypes occur but are due to differences in particular biological characteristics of the plants. The diversity and composition of insect communities, however, strongly varied between years and environments. Flowering phenology could explain part, but not all of the differences observed between cytotypes, indicating that other factors such as flower head morphology or chemistry could also play a role. The study indicated that the differences between the two cytotypes are important determinant of the plant-herbivore interactions in the system. Although we identified multiple factors that could explain the different associations, further research is needed to assess the relative importance of each of these factors.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 270-287.","[Muenzbergova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic; [Muenzbergova, Zuzana] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Skuhrovec, Jiri] Crop Res Inst, Grp Funct Invertebrate & Plant Biodivers Agrosyst, Prague, Czech Republic; [Marsik, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Expt Bot, Prague, Czech Republic","Munzbergova, Z (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic.",zuzmun@natur.cuni.cz,"Skuhrovec, Jiri/E-9699-2016; Munzbergova, Zuzana/F-6321-2013; Marsik, Petr/G-6492-2014","Skuhrovec, Jiri/0000-0002-7691-5990; Munzbergova, Zuzana/0000-0002-4026-6220; Marsik, Petr/0000-0002-4387-0749",GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505-13-32048S];  [RVO 67985939];  [MSMT];  [RO0414];  [CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24014],"The study was supported by GACR P505-13-32048S.

As bacteroids are surrounded with peribacteroid membranes filled with peribacteroid solution (PBS), it is considered that PBS contains substances inducing differentiation of rhizobia into bacteroids. In this study, genome-wide expression profiles of Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells cultured in PBS purified from root nodule of soybean (Glycine max L.) were compared with those of bacteroids using macroarray. PBS treatment preferentially induced regions in a large symbiosis island including various symbiosis relevant genes such as nod, fix, nol and noe, in which 75% of regions were commonly induced in bacteroids, while general repressions outside of the symbiosis island seen in bacteroids were not observed in PBS treated cells.

Analyses of how plants and microbes interact above-and belowground in multi-symbiotic systems are key to understand community structure and ecosystem functioning. We performed an outdoor experiment in mesocosms to investigate the consequences of the interaction of a provider belowground symbiont of legumes (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) and a protector aerial fungal symbiont of grasses (Epichloe endophyte) on nitrogen dynamics and aboveground net primary productivity. Four plants of Trifolium repens (Trifolium, a perennial legume) either inoculated or not with Rhizobium leguminosarum, grew surrounded by 16 plants of Lolium multiflorum (Lolium, an annual grass), with either low or high levels of the endophyte Neotyphodium occultans. After five months, we quantified the number of nodules in Trifolium roots, shoot biomass of both plant species, and the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen fixation vs. soil nitrogen uptake to aboveground nitrogen in each plant species. The endophyte increased grass biomass production (+16%), and nitrogen uptake from the soil - the main source for the grass. Further, it reduced the nodulation of neighbour Trifolium plants (-50%). Notably, due to a compensatory increase in nitrogen fixation per nodule, this reduced neither its atmospheric nitrogen fixation - the main source of nitrogen for the legume - nor its biomass production, both of which were doubled by rhizobial inoculation. In consequence, the total amount of nitrogen in aboveground biomass and aboveground productivity were greatest in mesocosms with both symbionts (i.e. high rhizobia. high endophyte). These results show that, in spite of the deleterious effect of the endophyte on the establishment of the rhizobia-legume symbiosis, the coexistence of these symbionts, leading to additive effects on nitrogen capture and aboveground productivity, can generate complementarity on the functioning of multi-symbiotic systems.","[Garcia Parisi, Pablo A.; Grimoldi, Augustin A.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Catedra Forrajicultura, IFEVA,Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Omacini, Marina] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Catedra Ecol, IFEVA,Fac Agron, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lattanzi, Fernando A.] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrustuhl Grunlandlehre, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Parisi, PAG (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Catedra Forrajicultura, IFEVA,Fac Agron, Av San Martin 4453 C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",pgarcia@agro.uba.ar,"Lattanzi, Fernando Alfredo/A-5609-2009","Lattanzi, Fernando Alfredo/0000-0002-2682-3692; Garcia-Parisi, Pablo Adrian/0000-0001-7725-9553","CONICET (Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Univ. of Buenos AiresUniversity of Buenos Aires; ANPCyTANPCyT [PICT 1525]; MINCyT (Argentina) - BMBF (Germany)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [AL-1205, 01DN13006]","We are very grateful to Laura Ventura, Rudi Schaufele, Mirta Rabadan for technical assistance, and Cecilia Casas, Karl Auerswald, Gustavo Gonzalez Anta, Marta Telesnicki, Luis I.

We used an experiment at the Swiss tree line to investigate changes in vegetation biomass after 9years of free air CO2 enrichment (+200ppm; 2001-2009) and 6years of soil warming (+4 degrees C; 2007-2012). The study contained two key tree line species, Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata, both approximately 40years old, growing in heath vegetation dominated by dwarf shrubs. In 2012, we harvested and measured biomass of all trees (including root systems), above-ground understorey vegetation and fine roots. Overall, soil warming had clearer effects on plant biomass than CO2 enrichment, and there were no interactive effects between treatments. Total plant biomass increased in warmed plots containing Pinus but not in those with Larix. This response was driven by changes in tree mass (+50%), which contributed an average of 84% (5.7kgm(-2)) of total plant mass. Pinus coarse root mass was especially enhanced by warming (+100%), yielding an increased root mass fraction. Elevated CO2 led to an increased relative growth rate of Larix stem basal area but no change in the final biomass of either tree species. Total understorey above-ground mass was not altered by soil warming or elevated CO2. However, Vaccinium myrtillus mass increased with both treatments, graminoid mass declined with warming, and forb and nonvascular plant (moss and lichen) mass decreased with both treatments. Fine roots showed a substantial reduction under soil warming (-40% for all roots <2mm in diameter at 0-20cm soil depth) but no change with CO2 enrichment. Our findings suggest that enhanced overall productivity and shifts in biomass allocation will occur at the tree line, particularly with global warming. However, individual species and functional groups will respond differently to these environmental changes, with consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning.","[Dawes, Melissa A.; Philipson, Christopher D.; Bebi, Peter; Rixen, Christian] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Dawes, Melissa A.; Fonti, Patrick; Hagedorn, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Philipson, Christopher D.] ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Ecosyst Management, Zurich, Switzerland; [Haettenschwiler, Stephan] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS, CEFE,UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Dawes, MA (reprint author), WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",melissa.dawes@wsl.ch,"Bebi, Peter/L-8385-2016; Fonti, Patrick/B-7400-2011","Fonti, Patrick/0000-0002-7070-3292; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988; Philipson, Christopher/0000-0001-8987-7260","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31-061428.00, 315200-116861]; 'ANR-biodiversite' grantFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Velux Foundation [371]; WSL; CCES-ETH Project 'MOUNTLAND', Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [C07.0032, C07.0033, C14.0037]; University of Basel Botanical Institute; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment","We thank many colleagues at the SLF, WSL and University of Basel for their assistance with field measurements and technical support throughout the CO<INF>2</INF> enrichment and soil warming experiment.

In a long-term poplar plantation in Italy, a joint analysis of spatial variability of soil and plant properties was performed using geostatistical data fusion techniques. Soil samples were collected at 64 points and analyzed for pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorous and texture. Trunk diameter was measured for 446 trees. The analysis of the whole data set (soil and plant properties) revealed the presence of three main scales of variation: a nugget effect (micro-scale), 30 and 100 m. Most spatial variation (71 %) was observed at the longer range scale; soil spatial variability was reflected in the differences in plant growth and affected soil CO2 emissions significantly. The joint analysis of soil and plant properties allowed to model their spatial scale-dependent relationships. A map of a synthetic indicator of joint soil-plant variation can be used to choose the most representative plots for soil respiration monitoring.","[Ferre, Chiara; Comolli, Roberto] Milano Bicocca Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Castrignan, Annamaria] CRA SCA Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Unit Cropping Syst Dry Environm, I-70125 Bari, Italy","Ferre, C (reprint author), Milano Bicocca Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Piazza Sci 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",chiara.ferre@unimib.it,"Comolli, Roberto/M-8969-2016","Castrignano, Annamaria/0000-0003-2301-8118; COMOLLI, ROBERTO/0000-0003-1376-9153",,,,51,4,6,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,2015,390,2-Jan,,,,,95,109,,10.1007/s11104-014-2368-2,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,CG7IJ,WOS:000353476200007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wang, H; Liu, SR; Chang, SX; Wang, JX; Shi, ZM; Huang, XM; Wen, Y; Lu, LH; Cai, DX",,,,"Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Chang, Scott X.; Wang, Jingxin; Shi, Zuomin; Huang, Xueman; Wen, Yuan; Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong",,,Soil microbial community composition rather than litter quality is linked with soil organic carbon chemical composition in plantations in subtropical China,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Litter quality; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR); Organic carbon chemical composition; Plantation; Soil microbial biomass and community,FINE-ROOT DECOMPOSITION; LEAF-LITTER; MATTER STABILIZATION; EXTRACTION METHOD; FOREST; PLANT; DYNAMICS; SEQUESTRATION; BACTERIAL; NITROGEN,"Native broadleaf plantations are increasingly being developed as an alternative to coniferous plantations. This study examined the relationships among litter carbon (C) quality, soil microbial community composition, and soil organic C (SOC) chemical properties in plantations and how they were affected by tree species. The solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) technique was used to examine SOC chemical composition, and litter and fine root C quality in four plantations of native tree species (Pinus massoniana, Castanopsis hystrix, Michelia macclurei, and Mytilaria laosensis) in Pingxiang, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in subtropical China. Soil microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N) were determined by the chloroform fumigation-extraction method and soil bacterial and fungal biomass were measured with the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technique. The proportions of O-alkyl C, alkyl C, aromatic C, and carbonyl C in SOC and the alkyl/O-alkyl C ratio (A/O-A) in litter and fine root samples, soil microbial C and N, microbial C/N ratios, and the amount of PLFAs were significantly different among the four plantations of different species. SOC in the 0-10-cm layer had 43-49 % O-alkyl C, 24-34 % alkyl C, 14-17 % aromatic C, and 9-11 % carbonyl C in SOC. The microbial C/N ratio, the amount of total PLFAs, and bacterial and Gram-positive bacterial population sizes were linked to the proportion of alkyl C in SOC and the A/O-A ratio in soil. The proportion of alkyl C in SOC was not related to the proportion of alkyl C in litter or fine root samples. The microbial community composition rather than plant litter or fine root quality was linked to chemical composition of SOC in the studied subtropical plantations. Future research should place more emphasis on the processes involved in the formation of SOC and their association with the microbial community.","[Wang, Hui; Liu, Shirong; Shi, Zuomin; Huang, Xueman] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Chang, Scott X.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Wang, Jingxin] W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Wen, Yuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Ctr Landscape Ecol & Sustainabil Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lihua; Cai, Daoxiong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Trop Forestry, Pingxiang 532600, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, SR (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Chinas State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, 2 Dongxiaofu, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",liusr@caf.ac.cn,"Chang, Scott X/G-2029-2011","Chang, Scott/0000-0002-7624-439X","Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, Chinese Academy of Forestry [CAFRIFEEP201104]; China National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100380, 31290223]; Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2012BAD22B01, 2015DFA31440]; Lecture and Study Program for Outstanding Scholars from Home and Abroad [CAFYBB2011007]; CFERN&GENE Award Funds on Ecological Paper","We would like to thank the Guangxi Youyiguan Forest Ecosystem Research Station for assisting with research permits and providing logistical support; Jia Xu, Pizheng Hong, Jian Hao, Haolong Yu, Da Luo, Yi Wang, Riming He, Hai Chen, Angang Ming, Zhongguo Li, Lu Zheng, and Chaoying Li for assistance with field work and laboratory analysis; and Jiangming Mo and Yunting Fang for reviewing drafts of this manuscript.

However, relative to the plant response to grazing, belowground biota and process responses are more complex and often do not correlate with the aboveground responses. Ungulate grazing involves three mechanisms; defoliation (removal of plant shoot tissue), dung and urine return, and trampling. An evaluation of the relative roles of these mechanisms and their combinations in grazing can explain the causes of changes in grasslands, thereby explaining soil C sequestration in a steppe ecosystem. In this study, we examined changes in plant attributes, soil abiotic characteristics, and the soil microbial community in response to mowing (M), dung and urine addition (DU), simulated trampling (T), and their combinations by conducting a 3-yr experiment in a steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia, China. Most of the variation in the grazing effects on grasslands was explained by defoliation through decreased plant production and soil respiration and altered vegetation composition. Dung and urine return was second to defoliation in explaining grazing effects on grassland, and led to increasing plant C inputs to the soil, while simultaneously, potential loss of soil C due to the increase of the abundance of bacteria and soil respiration eventually accelerated soil C cycling. An interaction between defoliation and trampling on microbial growth was observed in our study: trampling increased the abundance of total bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) only in the no-mowing plots. Trampling led to plant allocation to belowground tissues and increased the abundance of fungi and AMF, which are critical for soil C sequestration, and trampling with defoliation further decreased the abundance of soil microbes, which may decelerate soil C cycling and increase its retention time. These results indicate that defoliation and dung and urine return play major roles in explaining grazing effects on grassland systems, including plant, soil, and microbial parameters, but the trampling effects and the interaction between defoliation and trampling are two key factors that contribute to explaining the overall effects of grazing on soil C sequestration in a typical steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia.","[Liu, N.; Kan, H.

Allocation patterns can differ through ontogeny, but also among coexisting species and among species adapted to different environments. While a variety of models dealing with biomass allocation exist, we lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying processes. This is partly due to the lack of suitable data sets for validating and parameterizing models. To that end, we present the Biomass And Allometry Database (BAAD) for woody plants. The BAAD contains 259 634 measurements collected in 176 different studies, from 21 084 individuals across 678 species. Most of these data come from existing publications. However, raw data were rarely made public at the time of publication. Thus, the BAAD contains data from different studies, transformed into standard units and variable names. The transformations were achieved using a common workflow for all raw data files. Other features that distinguish the BAAD are: (i) measurements were for individual plants rather than stand averages; (ii) individuals spanning a range of sizes were measured; (iii) plants from 0.01-100 m in height were included; and (iv) biomass was estimated directly, i.e., not indirectly via allometric equations (except in very large trees where biomass was estimated from detailed sub-sampling). We included both wild and artificially grown plants. The data set contains the following size metrics: total leaf area; area of stem cross-section including sapwood, heartwood, and bark; height of plant and crown base, crown area, and surface area; and the dry mass of leaf, stem, branches, sapwood, heartwood, bark, coarse roots, and fine root tissues. We also report other properties of individuals (age, leaf size, leaf mass per area, wood density, nitrogen content of leaves and wood), as well as information about the growing environment (location, light, experimental treatment, vegetation type) where available. It is our hope that making these data available will improve our ability to understand plant growth, ecosystem dynamics, and carbon cycling in the world's vegetation.",,"Falster, DS (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",daniel.falster@mq.edu.au,"Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto/E-4172-2016; Santa-Regina, Ignacio/L-6868-2014; Tissue, David T/N-1710-2019; Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008; , _______/V-6687-2019; domec, jean-christophe/P-9251-2019; Battles, John/G-8233-2012; O'Grady, Anthony/B-8148-2011; Tissue, David/AAA-8829-2019; Coll, Lluis/E-8724-2015; Battaglia, MIchael/A-5545-2011; Yanai, Ruth D./O-3250-2019; Laclau, Jean-Paul/O-2189-2019; Kenzo, Tanaka/AAC-6356-2019; Markesteijn, Lars/S-9744-2018; Hutley, Lindsay/A-7925-2011","Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto/0000-0002-4504-3050; Santa-Regina, Ignacio/0000-0002-7312-3605; Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; , _______/0000-0002-9032-7933; domec, jean-christophe/0000-0003-0478-2559; Battles, John/0000-0001-7124-7893; Tissue, David/0000-0002-8497-2047; Coll, Lluis/0000-0002-8035-5949; Battaglia, MIchael/0000-0003-0144-5442; Yanai, Ruth D./0000-0001-6987-2489; Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; Kenzo, Tanaka/0000-0002-4856-7204; Falster, Daniel/0000-0002-9814-092X; le Maire, Guerric/0000-0002-5227-958X; Baraloto, Christopher/0000-0001-7322-8581; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875; Vadeboncoeur, Matthew/0000-0002-8269-0708; Markesteijn, Lars/0000-0003-3046-3121; Camac, James/0000-0003-4785-0742; Hutley, Lindsay/0000-0001-5533-9886; R.

As a consequence, non-host species have the opportunity to colonize resulting gaps. In contrast to most grassland species, hemiparasites are generally short-lived and can reach high densities; as a consequence, vegetation gaps are left after their death. These gaps form microsites more suitable for seed germination and therefore might increase recruitment of other species. Which species suffer or profit from parasitism and is there a positive effect on seedling establishment? LocationSemi-natural grasslands in northern Belgium. MethodsWe selected two hemiparasitic plant species from contrasting vegetation types: Rhinanthus angustifolius growing in mesotrophic grassland and Pedicularis sylvatica growing in oligotrophic heath-grassland. A weeding experiment was set up at six sites in which the hemiparasite was repeatedly removed in half of the plots during three growing seasons. The abundance change of individual species was compared between weeded and control plots. After the second growing season, seeds of up to ten species were added. The number of seedlings in the third year was then compared between weeded and control plots. ResultsRhinanthus removal significantly affected the abundance of species relative to control plots, both positively and negatively, and decreased the species evenness. Pedicularis removal only increased the abundance of some species. Only Juncaceae (but no other graminoid families) increased after Rhinanthus and Pedicularis weeding, and there was considerable variation within functional groups. Moreover, based on our observations, we propose as a new hypothesis that species with persistent clonal spread are more vulnerable to parasitism. Once attached, resources are potentially drawn from a whole network of interconnected ramets. Finally, only half of the sown species successfully established seedlings; hemiparasite removal had a significantly negative effect on seedling number for two of these species. ConclusionsEffects of hemiparasites on species differ considerably, also within functional groups. Persistent clonal spread emerges as an important plant trait determining vulnerability to hemiparasites. Finally, our results suggest that hemiparasitic plants might have a limited positive effect on seedling establishment in these semi-natural grasslands where chances for successful establishment were shown to be low.","[Demey, Andreas; De Frenne, Pieter; Baeten, Lander; Verstraeten, Gorik; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium; [Baeten, Lander] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Boeckx, Pascal] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Demey, A (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium.",andreas.demey@ugent.be; Pieter.Defrenne@UGent.be; Lander.Baeten@UGent.be; Gorik.Verstraeten@UGent.be; Martin.Hermy@ees.kuleuven.be; Pascal.Boeckx@UGent.be; Kris.Verheyen@UGent.be,"De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014","De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943; Baeten, Lander/0000-0003-4262-9221",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)FWO; agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT-Vlaanderen)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); FWO-VlaanderenFWO,Special thanks to the six reserve managers and for help from colleagues with species sorting.

Building on the functional equilibrium' hypothesis, we hypothesize that co-existing species can each achieve balanced resource acquisition above vs below ground by trading off the biomass vs morphology of structures responsible for resource acquisition, i.e. leaves and fine roots. MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in a natural field setting by measuring plant above- and below-ground biomass and morphological traits associated with resource uptake - specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) - of 18 dominant angiosperm species from a sub-alpine plant community. LocationNew Zealand South Island. ResultsWe found a significant negative relationship between the species leaf mass to fine root mass ratio and the SLA to SRL ratio when we considered eudicot species only. The SLA to SRL ratio and plant size explained 31% and 34% of the total variation in the species leaf to fine root mass ratio respectively, and 45% when used in combination (P<0.05 in all cases). Within a given plant size, 90% of the variation among species in total leaf area was due to differences in SLA, whereas variation in the fine root mass fraction was responsible for 71% of the variation among species in fine root length. ConclusionsIn support of our hypothesis, part of the difference between co-occurring species in leaf and fine root biomass distribution could be explained by the variable morphologies of these organs as well as variation in plant size, independent of the plant economic strategy. We expect that this outcome may result from environmental and evolutionary constraints on plant species-average traits, as well as plastic responses to local environmental conditions. These findings help explain why a diversity of strategies for achieving balanced resource acquisition can co-exist within a single plant community.","[Freschet, Gregoire T.; Kichenin, Emilie; Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Freschet, GT (reprint author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",gregoire.freschet@cefe.cnrs.fr; emilie.kichenin@yahoo.fr; david.wardle@slu.se,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335",Wallenberg Scholars Award,"We are grateful to Duane Peltzer and Chris Morse for their contribution to field site characterisation and logistics, and to Saga Fogelberg for help with plant processing.

Our aim in this study was to test the flexibility of priority effects (colonization timing) by varying the timing of inoculum introduction (i.e., precolonization) and amount of inoculum (i.e., inoculum potential). We controlled these variables in soil-block microcosms using fungi with known competitive outcomes in similar conditions, tracking isolate-specific fungal biomass, and residue physiochemistry over time. In the precolonization trial (experiment I), a brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was given 1, 3, or 5 weeks to precolonize wood blocks (oak, birch, pine, and spruce) prior the introduction of a white rot fungus, Irpex lacteus, a more aggressive colonizer in this set-up. In the inoculum potential trial (experiment II), the fungi were inoculated simultaneously, but with eightfold higher brown rot inoculum than that of experiment I. As expected, longer precolonization duration increased the chance for the less-competitive brown rot fungus to outcompete its white rot opponent. Higher brown rot fungal inoculum outside of the wood matrix also resulted in competitive success for the brown rot isolate in most cases. These temporal shifts in fungal dominance were detectable in a 'community snapshot' as isolate-specific quantitative PCR, but also as functionally-relevant consequences of wood rot type, including carbohydrate depolymerization and pH. These results from a controlled system reinforce fungal-fungal interaction and suggest that relative inoculum availability beyond the wood matrix (i.e., soils) might regulate the duration of priority effects and shift the functional trajectory of wood decomposition.","[Song, Zewei; Schilling, Jonathan S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schilling, Jonathan S.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Vail, Andrew; Sadowsky, Michael J.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Biotechnol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Sadowsky, Michael J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Soil Water & Climate, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Schilling, JS (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, 2004 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",schillin@umn.edu,"Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016","Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781","Conservation and the Environment grants program of The Andrew W.

To explore this symbiosis from a community ecology perspective, we sampled ectomycorrhizal root tips over a 3-year period and used 454 pyrosequencing to identify the bacteria that live inside the ectomycorrhizal root tips. The results showed that fungal community composition within the same soil core and fungal taxonomic identity had a stronger effect on bacterial community composition than sample year or site. Members of the Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales were most highly represented, reflecting many previous reports of these bacteria in association with fungi.

Invasive fungi also provide excellent models to evaluate the generality of results based on other eukaryotes. We first consider here the reasons why fungal invasions have long been overlooked: they tend to be inconspicuous, and inappropriate methods have been used for species recognition. We then review the information available on the patterns and mechanisms of fungal invasions. We examine the biological features underlying invasion success of certain fungal species. We review population structure analyses, revealing native source populations and strengths of bottlenecks. We highlight the documented ecological and evolutionary changes in invaded regions, including adaptation to temperature, increased virulence, hybridization, shifts to clonality and association with novel hosts. We discuss how the huge census size of most fungi allows adaptation even in bottlenecked, clonal invaders. We also present new analyses of the invasion of the anther-smut pathogen on white campion in North America, as a case study illustrating how an accurate knowledge of species limits and phylogeography of fungal populations can be used to decipher the origin of invasions. This case study shows that successful invasions can occur even when life history traits are particularly unfavourable to long-distance dispersal and even with a strong bottleneck. We conclude that fungal invasions are valuable models to contribute to our view of biological invasions, in particular by providing insights into the traits as well as ecological and evolutionary processes allowing successful introductions.","[Gladieux, P.; Feurtey, A.; Snirc, A.; Giraud, T.] Univ Paris 11, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Gladieux, P.; Feurtey, A.; Snirc, A.; Giraud, T.] CNRS, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Hood, M.

R-s was studied by the trenching method in a seasonal dry diptercarp forest, western Thailand. An automated soil chamber system was used to produce hourly data of R-s during 2008-2011. Analysis of R-s in relation to both biotic and abiotic factors was carried out to understand its temporal variations at different timescales. R-m was the main contributor to overall magnitude and variability of R-s. Soil temperature alone was the main driver of diurnal variation, while the combination of soil moisture and soil temperature determined the seasonal variations. The amount of R-s was also related to the fine root (< 2 mm) and microbial biomass at seasonal timescales. Due to the small inter-annual variations in soil temperature and moisture, total soil respiration among the 4 years was not significantly different (p < 0.05). The annual totals for R-s during 2008-2011 were 3.20, 3.89, 3.52, 4.14 kgCO(2) m(-2) years(-1), respectively. The 4-year average ratio of R-m (trenched) to R-s (untrenched) was 66 +/- 4 %. R-m plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude (large ratio between R-m and R-s) and temporal variations of R-s. In this forest ecosystem, high seasonal variations in R-s were observed and were mainly attributed to the response of R-m to moisture.","[Hanpattanakit, Phongthep; Chidthaisong, Amnat] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, JGSEE, Bangkok, Thailand; [Hanpattanakit, Phongthep; Chidthaisong, Amnat] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Ctr Excellence Energy Technol & Environm, Bangkok, Thailand; [Leclerc, Monique Y.] Univ Georgia, Lab Environm Phys, Ctr Atmospher Biogeosci, Griffin, GA USA; [Mcmillan, Andrew M.

Exotic tree species were widely introduced and have been considered as a form of human-induced global change. However, how exotic tree species, as compared with native ones, affect SOC storage and soil respiration (R-s) has not been sufficiently investigated. Here we studied this issue in an even-aged (22 years) plantation composed by native Masson pine (Pious massoniana Lamb.) (MP) and exotic slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) (SP) in subtropical China. A trenching method was used to partition R-s into heterotrophic (R-h) and autotrophic respiration (R-a). R-s and R-h were measured approximately biweeldy during August 2007 to December 2009. Our results showed that seasonal patterns of R-s and R-h in both pine forests were mainly affected by soil temperature and moisture (R-2 = 0.56-0.78, P<0.001). There was no difference in SOC stock (forest floor + mineral soil of 0-40 cm), R-h and turnover rate (R-h/SOC stock) between MP and SP forests. However, annual R-s, R-a and R-a/R-s, of MP were significantly 24%, 119% and 74% higher than those of SP, respectively. In contrast, even though MP and SP had similar fine and coarse root biomass, MP had significant higher ratios of R-a/fine root biomass and R-a/coarse root biomass than SP, suggesting a higher respiration rate in native pine species on a root biomass basis. We concluded that the exotic SP, as compared with indigenous MP, did not alter SOC stock, R-h and turnover rate but depressed R-a and R-s. Therefore, both pine species were recommended in case of reforestation in terms of SOC sequestration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although seed predators commonly destroy the entire seed, partial seed consumption has been reported for many species; however, the degree to which seed mass loss affects germination dynamics and survival of new individuals has been poorly documented. We simulated seed damage in natural conditions to examine how different levels of cotyledonary reserve removal affect germination dynamics and seedling performance of Myrcianthes coquimbensis (Myrtaceae), a threatened Atacama Desert shrub. The experiment combined two levels of seed maturity with three levels of seed mass loss. Results: Removal of the cotyledon reserves and seed maturity negatively affected the odds and the temporality of seedling emergence; nonetheless, seedlings were able to emerge from seed fragments, of either mature or immature seeds, that lost up to 75% of their original mass. Removal of cotyledonary reserves had negative effects on seedling size but no effect on root: shoot ratios. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the loss of cotyledonary reserves in M. coquimbensis seeds is not necessarily lethal. Moreover, we posit that tolerance to partial seed consumption is likely a key reproductive strategy, which enables recruitment in this species.","[Loayza, Andrea P.; Gachon, Paloma R.; Garcia-Guzman, Patricio; Carvajal, Danny E.; Squeo, Francisco A.] Univ La Serena, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Loayza, Andrea P.; Garcia-Guzman, Patricio; Carvajal, Danny E.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, La Serena, Chile; [Garcia-Guzman, Patricio; Carvajal, Danny E.; Squeo, Francisco A.] Univ La Serena, Programa Doctorado Biol Ecol & Aplicada, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Squeo, Francisco A.] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena, Chile","Loayza, AP (reprint author), Univ La Serena, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile.",aloayza@userena.cl,,"Squeo, Francisco/0000-0003-3559-0250","Chilean Millennium Initiative [ICMP02-051-F]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PFB-23]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3120123]; CONYCIT [21140050, 21120854]","This research was supported by the Chilean Millennium Initiative (ICMP02-051-F) and CONICYT (PFB-23); a FONDECYT postdoctoral grant (APL, grant number 3120123); and CONYCIT doctoral fellowships (D.E.C., grant number 21140050), (P.G.G., grant number 21120854).",,40,2,2,0,22,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,0717-6317,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

A heavy metal ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) gene, HMA3, plays a key role in the plant's cadmium detoxification. To prove whether HMA3 also participates in mercury detoxification in plants, an experiment was designed to inhibit the expressions of HMA3 genes (NtHMA3a and NtHMA3b) in tobacco plants. Results showed that plants' tolerance to mercury ions had not changed after the expressions of NtHMA3a and NtHMA3b were inhibited. When mercury content was measured from the whole seedlings, no differences had been observed among wild-type, NtHMA3a-NtHMA3b-RNAi, and the empty-vector transgenic plants. HMA3 was not the key gene responsible for plants' mercury ion uptake from soil. Although the mercury content in the root was higher than that in the shoot for each seedling, in each treatment, neither in shoots nor in roots were statistical differences in mercury content found among NtHMA3a-NtHMA3b-RNAi, empty-vector transgenic, and wild-type plants. After the expressions of NtHMA3a and NtHMA3b were inhibited, the movement of mercury ions from root to shoot had not been affected. HMA3 was not the key gene responsible for mercury ion transportation from root to shoot. When mercury content was measured from the whole seedling, no significant difference had been found among wild-type, NtHMA3a-NtHMA3b-RNAi, and the empty-vector transgenic plants. For mercury ion translocation across tonoplast, the main pathway might not be HMA3, but ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters.","[Chang, S.; Shu, H.] Chinese Acad Trop Agr Sci, Haikou Expt Stn, Haikou 570102, Peoples R China; [Chang, S.; Shu, H.] Key Lab Hainan Banana Genet & Breeding, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Shu, H.] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Biol, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China","Shu, H (reprint author), Chinese Acad Trop Agr Sci, Haikou Expt Stn, Haikou 570102, Peoples R China.",plantfood772@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41201309, 31371696]",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41201309 and 31371696).,,38,2,3,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1088-9868,1547-6529,,BIOREMEDIAT J,Bioremediat.

This study examines the ectomycorrhizal and above-ground plant relationships in the metaliferous soil of an urban brownfield.

Plant productivity was assessed through Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurements taken from May through July 2012 and 2013. Results indicate that there were significant changes in EMF community composition and plant productivity based on their position along a total soil metal load gradient. Cenococcum geophilum was the dominant species in the soils where total soil metal load was below previously established threshold values, and Russula species were the dominant genera in soils where the total soil metal load was above the threshold value. Higher LAI values are seen in environments with higher soil metal levels. However, higher LAI could be due to multiple factors such as increased moisture and the dominance of metal-tolerant tree species. This study suggests that soil metal contamination affects plant productivity and EMF community composition and supports the idea that EMF species have varying levels of tolerance for metals.","[Evans, Jessica M.; Parker, Adam; Krumins, Jennifer Adams] Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol, Montclair, NJ USA; [Evans, Jessica M.] NY NJ Baykeeper, Keyport, NJ USA; [Gallagher, Frank] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA","Krumins, JA (reprint author), Montclair State Univ, Dept Biol, Montclair, NJ USA.",kruminsj@mail.montclair.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0638708],"J.M.E. received a grant (NSF GK-12 #0638708) from the National Science Foundation GK-12 Graduate Fellowship.

The influence of an accidental fire on the dynamics of these two grass species was quantified over a three-year period (2008/09 to 2010/11 growing seasons) in a semi-arid grassland. After burning, the production of C. pospischilii was 18% higher than that of the total production of the rest of the burned species for the third growing season. Production of E. muticus was lowered by fire by 82% for the first season. Three years after the fire, the density of C. pospischilii was 14.52 plants m(-2) versus an average for the unburned species of only 6.78 plants m(-2). Seedling emergence from the seed bank for C. pospischilii and E. muticus, at the end of the third growing season, was respectively 6.6 and 12.4 seedlings m(-2) more than that of unburned grassland - a reason for concern regarding plant composition stability of burnt semi-arid grasslands.

In this study we examined herbaceous vertical vegetation structure and diversity in plants, arthropods, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in three Great Lakes sand dune chronosequences. Plant species richness increased linearly across the primary successional gradients at the three sampling sites, while plant vertical structure remained constant. Total arthropod abundance and species richness were positively associated with plant vertical cover, while AMF spore abundance and morpho-type richness were positively associated with plant species richness. Carnivore and herbivore functional groups of arthropods responded differently to plant vertical cover and species richness. Diversity across early primary successional gradients does not consistently increase among different trophic levels, and the vertical structure of vegetation can be important in explaining richness and abundance in other trophic levels across a successional gradient.","[Emery, Sarah M.; Masters, Jeffery A.; Benanti, Sam; Gottshall, C.

We grew seedlings of three African savanna tree species either with or without grasses in a greenhouse experiment over 8 months. We measured soil moisture content at three depths throughout the course of the experiment and measured seedling height, root depth, and root allocation as a function of depth at the end of the experiment. The tree species differed markedly in their response to grass competition, ranging between a reduction > 50 % in relative growth rate to no effect. The species also differed in terms of relative root mass allocation with depth, despite a lack of maximum rooting depth differences. Against expectations, the species with the deepest rooting allocation was highly susceptible to competition from grasses. Grass presence led to a reduction of soil moisture in relation to controls and the reduction increased as a function of depth. Analysis of soil moisture reductions during dry periods indicated that grass uptake was dominant in the upper soil layers, suggesting that lower water availability at depth associated with the presence of grass was the result of reduced flow to deeper layers. We hypothesize that shallow-rooted tree species may be able to successfully engage in exploitative competition with grasses, but deep-rooted species may be exposed to interference competition when water is limiting.","[Holdo, Ricardo M.; Brocato, Emily R.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Holdo, RM (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 217 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",holdor@missouri.edu,,"Brocato, Emily/0000-0003-4429-8155",,,,48,10,10,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,APR,2015,216,4,,,,,577,588,,10.1007/s11258-015-0460-1,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,CG3VU,WOS:000353208500007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kula, AAR; Hartnett, DC",,,,"Kula, A.

However, few studies have explored the effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant-herbivore interactions. An understanding of the complex interactions between host plants, mycorrhizal fungi, and insect herbivores is enhanced by in situ examinations of the three parties acting simultaneously. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on insect herbivory and the host-plant community in tallgrass prairie. We used long-term mycorrhizal and fungicide-treated plots at Konza Prairie Biological Station (Manhattan, KS) to determine whether insect herbivory is altered by suppression of mycorrhizal fungi. Herbivory on plants in mycorrhizal control plots was greater than in fungicide-treated plots, and for one plant guild, C-3 graminoids, the difference was significant. In fungicide-treated plots, plant diversity was significantly greater and herbivory was negatively correlated with plant species diversity. Differences in productivity of plant functional groups due to mycorrhizal symbiosis may be a key factor in patterns of insect herbivory. The results indicate that mycorrhizal symbiosis has diverse consequences, influencing the abundance and the quality of host plants in tallgrass prairie, as well as their responses to consumers.","[Kula, A.

Fine root lengths (0-1.5mm in diameter) of both oak species were quantified after incubation at successive 30-day intervals up to 300days, for a total of 10 incubation periods. In addition, colony-forming units (CFU) of P.cinnamomi were quantified after white oak saplings were incubated in infested soilless potting mix at different temperature/duration combinations that reflect soil conditions present in the mid-Atlantic United States. Impact of P.cinnamomi on fine root lengths of red and white oak saplings varied considerably over time. Significant periods of fine root loss occurred primarily during spring, when bud break and leaf flush began for both oak species. Red oaks had 17% fine root loss on average, while white oaks appeared more resistant to P.cinnamomi infection with a 2% decrease in fine roots over the course of the experiment. Phytophthora cinnamomi CFU declined significantly with exposure to all incubation temperatures except 8 degrees C. This was in contrast to in vitro experiments, where the optimum temperature for mycelial growth was determined to be 21 degrees C and above. Significant fine root loss caused by P.cinnamomi depended on plant phenology and the oak species tested. Extreme soil temperatures have a significant adverse impact on temporal changes of P.cinnamomi population.","[McConnell, M.

We explored the effects of deterministic (soil characteristics, host plant life stage, neighbouring plant communities) and stochastic processes on AMF colonization, richness and community composition in roots of Knautia arvensis (Dipsacaceae) plants from three serpentine grasslands and adjacent nonserpentine sites. Methodically, the study was based on 454-sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA. In total, we detected 81 molecular taxonomical operational units (MOTUs) belonging to the Glomeromycota. Serpentine character of the site negatively influenced AMF root colonization, similarly as higher Fe concentration. AMF MOTUs richness linearly increased along a pH gradient from 3.5 to 5.8. Contrary, K and Cr soil concentration had a negative influence on AMF MOTUs richness. We also detected a strong relation between neighbouring plant community composition and AMF MOTUs richness. Although spatial distance between the sampled sites (c. 0.3-3km) contributed to structuring AMF communities in K.arvensis roots, environmental parameters were key factors in this respect. In particular, the composition of AMF communities was shaped by the complex of serpentine conditions, pH and available soil Ni concentration. The composition of AMF communities was also dependent on host plant life stage (vegetative vs. generative). Our study supports the dominance of deterministic factors in structuring AMF communities in heterogeneous environment composed of anedaphic mosaic of serpentine and nonserpentine soils.","[Kohout, Petr; Doubkova, Pavla; Suda, Jan; Sudova, Radka] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Kohout, Petr; Bahram, Mohammad; Tedersoo, Leho] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Kohout, Petr; Doubkova, Pavla] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Expt Plant Biol, Fac Sci, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Suda, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, CZ-12801 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Voriskova, Jana] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, CZ-14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic","Kohout, P (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",kohout4@natur.cuni.cz,"Sudova, Radka/N-8643-2019; Bahram, Mohammad/A-9766-2010; Kohout, Petr/B-4975-2011; Suda, Jan/D-3369-2013; Voriskova, Jana/H-1778-2013","Kohout, Petr/0000-0002-3985-2310; Suda, Jan/0000-0001-8964-9153; Voriskova, Jana/0000-0002-9328-7877","Charles University in Prague [GAUK 271011, NPUI LO1417 MSMT, SVV 260076/2014]; Czech Academy of Science within the long-term research development project [RVO 67985939]; ESF Doctoral Studies; Internationalization Program DoRa","This study was supported by Charles University in Prague (projects GAUK 271011, NPUI LO1417 MSMT and SVV 260076/2014) and by the The Czech Academy of Science within the long-term research development project no.

The biomass of S. senanensis in the canopy-gap area was twice that at the closed-canopy area. It equated to 12% of total biomass above ground but 41% below ground in the stand. The concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in the soil solution and soil respiration rates did not significantly change between cut and control plots, indicating that gap creation did not affect the C or N dynamics in the soil. Root-length density and PAI of S. senanensis were significantly greater at the cut plots, suggesting the promotion of S. senanensis growth following tree cutting. The levels of soil temperature and soil moisture were not changed following tree cutting. These results show that S. senanensis is a key component species in this cool-temperate forest ecosystem and plays significant roles in mitigating the loss of N and C from the soil following tree cutting by increasing its leaf and root biomass and stabilizing the soil environment.","[Fukuzawa, Karibu; Shibata, Hideaki; Takagi, Kentaro; Satoh, Fuyuki; Koike, Takayoshi; Sasa, Kaichiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Northern Forestry & Dev Off, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan","Fukuzawa, K (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Northern Forestry & Dev Off, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan.",caribu@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp,"Shibata, Hideaki/N-9974-2019; Shibata, Hideaki/A-6909-2008; Takagi, Kentaro/C-2222-2012","Shibata, Hideaki/0000-0002-8968-3594; ","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22248016]","This study was conducted in the Teshio Experimental Forest of Hokkaido University (Northern Hokkaido Forest), which is a JaLTER core site, as part of the CC-LaG (Carbon Cycle and Larch Growth) collaboration between the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Inc., and Hokkaido University.

In order to examine how above-ground litter inputs affect soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a temperate deciduous forest, we studied a 14-year-old small-scale litter manipulation experiment that included control, litter exclusion, and doubled litter addition at a mature Fagus sylvatica L. site. Total organic C (TOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP), total organic P (TOP), bioavailable inorganic P (Pi), microbial C, N and P, soil respiration and fine root biomass were analyzed in the A and in two B horizons. Our results showed that litter manipulation had no significant effect on TOC in the mineral soil. Litter addition increased the bioavailable Pi in the A horizon but had no significant effect on N in the mineral soil. Litter exclusion decreased TN and TP in the B horizon to a depth of 10 cm. In the A horizon of the litter exclusion treatment, TP, TOP and bioavailable Pi were increased, which is most likely due to the higher root biomass in this treatment. The high fine root biomass seems to have counteracted the effects of the excluded aboveground litter. In conclusion, our study indicates that aboveground litter is not an important source for C in the mineral soil and that P recycling from root litter might be more important than from above-ground litter.

Five Q. ilex forests in western Spain were selected, and ca. 40 000 root tips from 3 declining and 3 non-declining trees per forest were examined. Ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and P. cinnamomi root infections were quantified seasonally for 2 years, and an assessment was made of the water soil content and physiological status of trees during summer, the most stressful season. Seasonal changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance were higher for Tomentella spp. than those for Russula spp. and Cenococcum geophilum, but these changes were not influenced by topography, tree decline status and P. cinnamomi root infections. Seasonal variations of non-vital tips were conditioned significantly by the decline status of trees. A higher proportion of non-vital tips and a lower proportion of vital non-mycorrhizal tips were observed in declining than in non-declining trees. Abundance of C. geophilum and Tomentella spp. was not influenced by P. cinnamomi root infections but by topography. Abundance of Russula spp. was not influenced by P. cinnamomi root infections but by the decline status of trees. The relationships found between tree physiology and ectomycorrhizal abundance changed significantly depending on the decline status of trees. For the first time, seasonal variations in ectomycorrhizae in P. cinnamomi-infected Q. ilex forests are reported. The low diversity and abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with declining trees should be further studied in order to uncover causes or consequences of Q. ilex crown transparency.","[Corcobado, Tamara; Moreno, Gerardo; Solla, Alejandro] Univ Extremadura, Ingn Forestal & Medio Nat, Plasencia 10600, Spain; [Azul, Anabela Marisa] Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol CFE, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal","Solla, A (reprint author), Univ Extremadura, Ingn Forestal & Medio Nat, Ave Virgen Puerto 2, Plasencia 10600, Spain.",asolla@unex.es,"Solla, Alejandro/L-3096-2014; Moreno, Gerardo/K-7825-2012; Corcobado, Tamara/N-2315-2015","Solla, Alejandro/0000-0002-2596-1612; Moreno, Gerardo/0000-0001-8053-2696; ",Junta de Extremadura (Regional Government of Extremadura); Junta de Extremadura (IV-PRI regional project); European UnionEuropean Union (EU),The study was funded by the Junta de Extremadura (Regional Government of Extremadura; IV-PRI regional project) and the European Union and was conducted within the framework of COST Action FP0801 'Established and Emerging Phytophthora: Increasing Threats to Woodland and Forest Ecosystems in Europe'.,,50,15,15,2,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,APR,2015,88,2,,,,,257,266,,10.1093/forestry/cpu056,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,CF0BC,WOS:000352206500010,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Ren, BH; Wu, SL; Chen, BD; Wu, ZX; Zhang, X",,,,Ren Bai-Hui; Wu Song-Lin; Chen Bao-Dong; Wu Zhao-Xiang; Zhang Xin,,,Cr Stable Isotope Fractionation in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Dandelion and Cr Uptake by Extraradical Mycelium,PEDOSPHERE,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Cr contamination; Cr translocation; hyphae; mycorrhizal plant,FUNGUS GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; CHROMIUM TOXICITY; METAL UPTAKE; CONTAMINATED SOIL; HIGHER-PLANTS; HYPHAE; ROOTS; TOLERANCE; SYSTEM; ACCUMULATION,"As common soil fungi that form symbioses with most terrestrial plants mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play an important role in plant adaptation to chromium (Cr) contamination.

Oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) were measured for xylem water, soil water in different soil layers (0-300 cm), precipitation water and groundwater. Four potential water sources were identified: shallow (0-40 cm), middle (40-100 cm) and deep soil water (100-300 cm), as well as groundwater. The water sources used by the two species were calculated using the IsoSource model. When the upper soil water was abundant in early spring, H. ammodendron mainly used shallow soil water while H. persicum mainly used middle soil water; when the upper soil water was depleted in summer, H. ammodendron mainly used groundwater while H. persicum mainly used deep soil water. Both species were conservative in using shallow soil water following the relatively large summer precipitations. The two Haloxylon species had distinct water use patterns during the growing season, which reflects their adaptations to their specific habitats in this water-limited desert environment. Large precipitations in dry summer hardly altered their water use patterns, which mean that these species are rather conservative in water use strategy.","[Dai, Yue; Zheng, Xin-Jun; Tang, Li-Song; Li, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Dai, Yue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",liyan@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371079, 41171049]","This research was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41371079, 41171049).

Conversely, pivotal roots did not show hydrotropic growth. This was accompanied by root proliferation inside water patches, and biomass partitioning to shoot growth. Our results provide evidence that root hydrotropism is a relevant response that could occur in nature. Lateral and pivotal roots manifest different hydrotropic responses under the conditions assayed.

However, little has been done to quantify the linkages between understory vegetation cover, roots, and channel erosion, and such information can help assessing the role of the reforestation in soil erosion control. In this study, we evaluated the relationships between channel density, root density, and vegetation cover in forested hillslopes of southwestern China. Twelve locations (four slopes and three positions) of forested hillslopes with a wide range of understory degradation due to litterfall extraction and livestock grazing were selected for the study. Channel density as a measure of rill and (small) gully erosion, root density of different diameter classes, and vegetation cover of all types were determined using field measuring, soil coring and the line transect method, respectively. Soil loss rates were estimated using the caesium-137 (Cs-137) technique. Rills (depth < 0.3 m) with a width of 0.05-0.1 m were the dominate channel erosion in all hillslopes with understory-degradation, and small gullies (depth > 0.3 m) with a width 0.5-1.0 m were found at the locations of hillslopes with high understory-degradation. Channel density and soil loss rate increased with the increase in understory-degradation in the forested hillslopes. Simple correlation analysis indicated that channel density was negatively correlated with fine root density (diameter < 1 mm and 1-2 mm) and grass and shrub covers, but not with coarse roots (diam. 2-5 mm and 5-10 mm) and mulch and tree covers. The principal component regression revealed fine root density (diam. < 1 mm), shrub and grass covers were the most important predictors for channel density in the forested hillslopes. Tree cover, mulch cover and coarse root density were found to have much less influence on channel density. For the model established from this study using principle component regression, vegetation variables could explain 82 % variance of channel density. We conclude that fine root density and grass and shrub covers are the most important factors in controlling soil erosions in forested hillslopes. These parameters should be taken into consideration in assessing reforestation for soil erosion control in hilly areas such as that in southwestern China or other similar regions.","[Li, Y.; Yu, H.

For most invasive plants, however, little is known about the effects of their bioactive chemicals and how novel they are in invaded areas. From a methodological point of view, it also remains largely untested whether phytotoxicity found in vitro translates into allelopathic effects in more complex ecological settings. In this study, we tested for allelopathic effects of root exudates of the invasive plant Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed), its native congener Heracleum sphondylium (common hogweed) and two less-related native species. We also performed chemical analyses of the invader's root exudates to identify bioactive compounds. We found that root exudates of H. mantegazzianum contain allelopathic compounds which are not likely to be furanocoumarins, but other as yet unidentified molecules. Allelopathy of the invader detected in vitro conditions and in our garden experiment did not, however, differ from the allelopathy of the native species tested. A meta-analysis of two independent garden experiments indicated significantly negative, though similar, phytotoxic effects of H. mantegazzianum, its native congener and Dactylis glomerata in the absence of activated carbon. Our study thus indicates that allelopathy by producing unique compounds, as predicted by the novel weapons hypothesis, is not a principal driver of the invasion success of H. mantegazzianum.","[Jandova, Katerina; Cajthaml, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Jandova, Katerina; Dostal, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Cajthaml, Tomas] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Microbiol, CR-14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic","Jandova, K (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",katerina.jandova@gmail.com,"Jandova, Katerina/E-2515-2016; Dostal, Petr/B-5425-2019; Cajthaml, Tomas/I-1971-2014","Jandova, Katerina/0000-0002-3166-9175; Cajthaml, Tomas/0000-0002-3393-1333",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504/10/0132]; Charles University Grant Agency [GAUK512712],"This study was funded by grant P504/10/0132 from the Czech Science Foundation and grant GAUK512712 from the Charles University Grant Agency.

In this study, two types of coffee plants, namely Arabica and Robusta, were grown under different agroforestry management such as coffee under one specialized shade species, multi-story coffee systems with 2 shade tree species, and coffee with 3 or more tree species under moist deciduous and evergreen ecological conditions. Samples were collected from 36 points to include different coffee ecosystems. The highest number of infective propagules of AM fungi was encountered in Arabica coffee under evergreen conditions. Population of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes were higher under evergreen ecosystem compared to that of deciduous conditions. The population of nitrogen fixing bacteria was more than double in evergreen conditions compared to deciduous ecosystem. Number of lignin decomposing bacteria was higher in evergreen compared to deciduous conditions, but starch hydrolyzing bacteria and pectin-utilizing bacteria were more in deciduous ecosystem. Actinomycetes DAT2-1 isolated from deciduous ecosystem showed antagonistic activity against the root pathogen Fusarium chlamydosporum. It can be concluded that evergreen coffee system supports higher population of microorganisms. Of the two species of coffee, Arabica harboured more AM fungi, bacterial population, N fixers, P solubilizers and cellulose decomposing organisms while Robusta harboured higher number of fungi and actinomycetes. Of the three typologies, coffee grown under two shade tree species supported higher population of all microorganisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bagyaraj, D.

The fine root (d<2 mm) biomass, production, turnover rate and longevity of 13-, 32- and 45-year-old silver birch stands were determined by the ingrowth core method. Fine root production after the third year from the installation of cores was 0.89, 1.44 and 1.31 t ha (1) year (1) in the pole, middle-aged and premature silver birch stands, respectively. Soil respiration (R-s) was measured during the two growing seasons of 2010 and 2011; the trenching method was used to estimate the contribution of heterotrophic respiration (R-h) to total soil respiration. Soil temperature was the driving environmental factor of the temporal variation of R-s and R-h. Stand age affected significantly respiration rates. Annual Rs was 6.2, 9.7 and 8.2 t C ha (1) and annual R-h was 2.97, 4.21 and 3.61 t C ha (1) in the pole, middle-aged and premature silver birch stands, respectively. The annual contribution of R-h to R-s was similar in each stand ranging from 0.43 to 0.48. Total annual net primary production (NPP) of the ecosystems of 7.4, 7.9 and 8.5 t C ha (1) year (1) was estimated in the pole, middle-aged and premature stands. After balancing the C input and output fluxes in the silver birch stands of different development stages, it appeared that they all acted as effective C sinks. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was 4.4, 3.7 and 4.9 t C ha (1) year (1) in the pole, middle-aged and premature stands, respectively. In the premature stand the second layer of the spruce contributed significantly to the increased C input. The annual organic C input into the soil through above-and belowground litter occurred to be of the same magnitude as C loss via annual heterotrophic respiration. Thus, annual increment of woody biomass in fertile silver birch stands reflects annual organic C sequestration in the ecosystem. Among the studied stands, estimated NEP values were the lowest in the middle-aged stand and the highest in the oldest stand, indicating non-linear relationship between stand NEP and stand age.

However, we lack understanding of the drivers of forest carbon accumulation and loss, hampering our ability to predict carbon cycle responses to global change. In this study, we used CO2 flux and radiocarbon (C-14) measurements to investigate the role of seasonal drivers on soil respiration. Radiocarbon measurements of CO2 evolved during incubation of fine roots and root-free soils at the beginning and end of the growing season (April and August) showed that these two soil respiration sources (fine roots vis-A -vis soils) have different mean residence times that stayed constant between seasons. Radiocarbon measurements show that root respiration was made up of carbon fixed 3-5 years prior to sampling, and that heterotrophic respiration was made up of carbon fixed 7-10 years prior. The difference in radiocarbon signature between the two sources allowed us to partition autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration sources for soil respiration measurements in the field. We observed a small but significant increase in a dagger C-14 of soil respiration between April and August, suggesting an increase in heterotrophic respiration sources over the growing season. Using a two end-member mixing model, we estimate that 55 +/- A 22% of soil respiration originated from autotrophic (root) sources in April, but their contribution dropped to 38 +/- A 21% in August. These findings suggest that the contribution of root respiration increases at a time of high productivity and/or as a result of relatively low microbial respiration in the early spring in this old-growth coniferous forest.","[Taylor, Adam J.; Lai, Chun-Ta] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Hopkins, Francesca M.; Xu, Xiaomei] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Wharton, Sonia] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Bible, Ken] Univ Washington, Wind River Field Stn, Carson, WA 98610 USA; [Phillips, Claire] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crops & Soil Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Bush, Susan; Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Lai, CT (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",chun-ta.lai@mail.sdsu.edu,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010","Phillips, Claire/0000-0001-9072-6806",US Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0005266],The authors would like to thank James T.

A total of 15,323 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences (from five impala), representing 3,892 different phylotypes, were assigned to 1,902 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 20,124 methanogen 16S rRNA gene sequence reads (from four impala), of which 5,028 were unique, were assigned to 344 OTUs.

Most Bradyrhizobium clades utilized very divergent sets of legume hosts. This suggests that Bradyrhizobium spread across the major legume lineages early in its evolution, with only a few derived clades subsequently developing a narrower pattern of host use. Significant modularity existed in the network structure of recent host jumps (inferred from cases where closely related strain pairs were found on different legume taxa). This implies that recent host switching has occurred most often within particular subgroups of legumes. Nevertheless, the observed link structure would allow a bacterial lineage to reach almost any of the 75 legume host genera in a relatively small number of steps. However, permutation tests also showed that symbionts from certain host plant clades were significantly more similar than would be the case if bacteria were distributed at random on the trees. Related legumes thus harbored related sets of symbionts in some cases, indicating some degree of phylogenetic conservatism in partner selection.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Parker, MA (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",mparker@binghamton.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0640246],"For providing strains, I am very grateful to Alexis Andrus, Julie Ardley, Craig Barrett, John Bishop, Dulal Borthakur, Jeremy Burdon, Euan James, Christine Le Roux, Kristina Lindstrom, Wanda Malek, Stephen Mondo, Ingrid Parker, Alvaro Peix, Riley Pratt, Raul Rivas, Susana Rodriguez-Echeverria, Encarna Velazquez, Pablo Vinuesa, and Anne Willems.

Cd absorbed was more readily available for transport to the shoots by the HE roots than by the NHE roots, which is confirmed by a 6-fold higher Cd-113 concentration in xylem sap. Root Cd efflux originated mainly from the cell walls. The concentration of cell-wall polysaccharides and activity of pectin methylesterase were higher in the NHE than in the HE in the absence of Cd, and even higher in the presence of Cd. More pectins were methylated in the HE than in the NHE, indicating more free pectic acid residues in the NHE. The cell-wall-bound Cd was retained more tightly in the NHE than in the HE. Cadmium hyperaccumulation by HE of S. alfredii is associated with its enhanced Cd flux into the xylem, which is partly regulated by cell-wall polysaccharide modification in roots.","[Li, Tingqiang; Tao, Qi; Shohag, Md Jahidul Islam; Yang, Xiaoe; Liang, Yongchao] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Remediat & Ecol Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sparks, Donald L.] Univ Delaware, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Newark, DE 19717 USA","Liang, YC (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Remediat & Ecol Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",ycliang@zju.edu.cn,"Li, Tingqiang/B-2592-2017; Liang, Yongchao/D-5809-2012; Shohag, Jahidul Islam/K-8705-2019; Tao, Qi/AAC-2514-2019","Li, Tingqiang/0000-0003-4448-4871; Liang, Yongchao/0000-0002-0501-2823; Shohag, Jahidul Islam/0000-0002-8799-4401; Tao, Qi/0000-0003-1206-2105","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41271333, 21477104]; National Key Technology R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2012BAC17B04]","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271333, 21477104), and the National Key Technology R&D Program of China (2012BAC17B04).

In total, 654 isolates were obtained from 30 different plant species within the Faboideae legume subfamily. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a large diversity of different taxa from the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmibacteria, Flavobacteria and Sphingobacteria. Many of the isolates belonged to the genera Bach his (17.9%) and Pseudomonas (15.9%). No symbiosis (nodC) or nitrogen fixation related genes (nifH) could be detected amongst the isolates, which indicate the endophytic nature of the bacteria. Statistical analysis grouped the investigated plant species into six clusters according to the presence of particular NRE. However, no correlations could be found within these six clusters towards plant tribes or ecoregions the plants had been sampled from. Cluster analysis of the ecoregions according to the presence of NRE, revealed correlations between bacterial genera and those areas. However, groups present in the ecoregions did not correlate with the groups present in the different plant clusters. When combining our previous study on rhizobial, diversity recovered from the same sampling campaign (De Meyer et al., 2011) with the current study, 84.1% of the isolates belonged to the traditional rhizobia groups and only 15.9% were NRE. The Loamy ecoregion yielded the lowest number of culturable NRE (8.04%) and the Campine ecoregion the highest number (24.19%). The present study highlights the frequent presence of these NRE in root nodules. The occurrence of certain rhizobia was correlated with the presence of particular NRE, suggesting their presence may not be accidental, however their functions remain unclear at this point.

Although insight into the physical and chemical stabilization of soil organic matter (SUM) and into microbial community composition in these horizons is being gained, information on microbial functions of subsoil microbial communities and on associated microbially-mediated processes remains sparse. To identify possible controls on enzyme patterns, we correlated enzyme patterns with biotic and abiotic soil parameters, as well as with microbial community composition, estimated using phospholipid fatty acid profiles. Enzyme patterns (i.e. distance-matrixes calculated from these enzyme activities) were calculated from the activities of six extracellular enzymes (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-amino-peptidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, chitotriosidase, phosphatase and phenoloxidase), which had been measured in soil samples from organic topsoil horizons, mineral topsoil horizons, and mineral subsoil horizons from seven ecosystems along a 1500 km latitudinal transect in Western Siberia. We found that hydrolytic enzyme activities decreased rapidly with depth, whereas oxidative enzyme activities in mineral horizons were as high as, or higher than in organic topsoil horizons. Enzyme patterns varied more strongly between ecosystems in mineral subsoil horizons than in organic topsoils. The enzyme patterns in topsoil horizons were correlated with SUM content (i.e., C and N content) and microbial community composition. In contrast, the enzyme patterns in mineral subsoil horizons were related to water content, soil pH and microbial community composition. The lack of correlation between enzyme patterns and SUM quantity in the mineral subsoils suggests that SOM chemistry, spatial separation or physical stabilization of SUM rather than SUM content might determine substrate availability for enzymatic breakdown. The correlation of microbial community composition and enzyme patterns in all horizons, suggests that microbial community composition shapes enzyme patterns and might act as a modifier for the usual dependency of decomposition rates on SUM content or C/N ratios.

The importance of genetic versus environmental sources of intraspecific variation in resprouting traits is largely unknown. We conducted two genetic field trials, 400 m apart in altitude, in order to sequentially assess seedling resprouting in four environmentally contrasting Argentinean populations of Nothofagus obliqua Mirb. (Oerst). We also performed one nursery test to determine whether populations differed in early root/shoot biomass partition, a key trade-off affecting resprouting. Initial resprouting vigour and final survival were higher in our warmer test site, located 300 m below the core range of the species. The main contrasts between populations were found for pre-clipping seedling size and resprouting profusion, the latter trait showing a clear trade-off with resprouting vigour. Sitexpopulation interactions were due mainly to the behaviour of the highest altitude population, suggesting its divergent adaptive trajectory and higher plasticity for resprouting traits. Within populations, trait heritability was low, in general. Episodic frost, which may limit resprouting vigour and final success, had a lower incidence in the altitudinal and xeric limit populations. Overall, our work revealed genetic variation between populations of N. obliqua in traits that determine the success of seedling resprouting, probably associated with divergent selection. Low trait heritability suggests limited in situ micro-evolutionary capacities for resprouting traits under ongoing climate warming; phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in population persistence at the low positions of the elevation gradients N. obliqua currently inhabits.","[Gabriel Aparicio, Alejandro; Marta Azpilicueta, Maria; Juan Pastorino, Mario] INTA, INTA EEA Bariloche, Grp Genet Ecol & Mejoramiento Forestal, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Maximiliano Zuki, Sebastian; Alvaro Barbero, Fernando; Juan Pastorino, Mario] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Aparicio, AG (reprint author), INTA, INTA EEA Bariloche, Grp Genet Ecol & Mejoramiento Forestal, Modesta Victoria 4450, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",aparicio.alejandro@inta.gob.ar,,"Pastorino, Mario Juan/0000-0003-0120-7727",project 'INTA-Native tree species domestication program'; project 'Sustainable Forest Plantations' [BIRF LN 7520 AR],"We are deeply grateful to the reviewers of the first version of this article, who contributed very precise, constructive suggestions.

In two of the gaps and their surrounding areas, dolomite lime (3t ha(-1)) was applied. The study was designed to examine the long-term effects of lime application and canopy removal on element input via throughfall and output in seepage water at 80cm depth in this European beech forest. Throughfall and seepage water were collected in the unlimed gap center, the limed gap center and the undisturbed beech stand in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 2012. The canopy opening increased the seepage water acidity from 1991 to 1996. The pH values of the seepage water were higher in the limed gaps than in the unlimed gaps during the five study periods. The amount of annual throughfall and of seepage water were higher in the gaps during the study period; in 2012, the annual amounts of seepage water were significantly higher in the gaps than in the closed stand, whereas the input of most elements decreased from 1991 to 2012. The seepage water in the unlimed gaps had higher nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations, but lower sulfate sulfur (SO4-S) concentrations than in the limed gaps in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1996. The amount of leaching NO3-N and SO4-S in 2012 was, however, significantly higher in the limed gaps than in the unlimed gaps, while the input of nitrogen (N) and SO4-S was significantly lower in the limed gaps than in the closed stand. In general, the annual amounts of element input via throughfall were higher in the closed stand than in the gaps. However, the element output through leaching was much higher in the gap centers than in the closed stand. The net losses of aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) were higher in the unlimed gaps than in the limed gaps and the closed stand in 1991. In 2012, 23years after liming and canopy opening, the effects of gaps and liming, and the interaction of gap and liming on element leaching, were still significant compared to the untreated stand. Overall, canopy opening reduced N, sulfate, Al, and base cation deposition in the long run. Canopy opening in combination with liming affected the seepage water acidity and the leaching losses of base cations up to 23years after canopy removal and liming in this European beech forest.","[Lin, Na; Bartsch, Norbert; Heinrichs, Steffi; Vor, Torsten] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Lin, Na] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Lin, N (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, Busgenweg 1, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",na.lin@forst.uni-goettingen.de,,,China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; German Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"This research was financially supported by the China Scholarship Council from 2011 to 2014 and by the German Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) from 1991 to 1994 and from 1996 to 1999.

The mechanism underlying this P uptake enhanced by AM fungi is the increase in the surface area for absorption of available P. Little is known about utilization of unavailable P by AM fungi. We investigated whether extraradical hyphae of AM fungi release acid phosphatase (ACP). Sterilized Andosol was packed in pots that were separated into the mycorrhizal and hyphal compartments with a nylon net of 30-mu m pore size. Seeds of Allium fistulosum L. were inoculated or uninoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus clarus (Nicolson & Schenck) Walker & Schu ss ler. Mullite ceramic tubes were buried in the soil of each compartment, and soil solution was collected. A. fistulosum L. and Linum usitatissimum L. inoculated with R. clarus were grown in sand culture and in vitro monoxenic culture, respectively. Uninoculated A. fistulosum L was grown in hydroponic culture to collect root exudate. The soil solution, hyphal extracts, root extract and root exudates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Shoot P concentration, shoot P content and shoot dry weight were higher in the inoculated treatment than in the uninoculated treatment. Activity staining of the gel revealed that ACP activity at 187kDa was observed in the soil solution in the inoculation treatment, and in the hyphal extract collected from sand culture and in vitro monoxenic culture, but neither in the root exudate of non-mycorrhizal plant grown in the hydroponic culture nor in the root extracts irrespective of mycorrhizal status. Those results provide strong evidence that the corresponding activity in the soil solutions in soil culture is of R. clarus CK001 origin. These findings suggest that the fungus releases ACP from extraradical hyphae into the hyphosphere.","[Sato, Takumi; Cheng, Weiguo; Tawaraya, Keitaro] Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan; [Sato, Takumi] Iwate Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Morioka, Iwate 0208550, Japan; [Ezawa, Tatsuhiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Sato, T (reprint author), Yamagata Univ, Fac Agr, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 9978555, Japan.",tawaraya@tds1.tr.yamagata-u-ac.jp,", Tawaraya/R-1981-2019; Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/B-7735-2012","Ezawa, Tatsuhiro/0000-0001-6188-7635","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23580086]",This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 23580086) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).,,28,17,17,3,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

The production of good quality seedling material is essential for establishing an orchard, and association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can be very important in this respect. In Brazil, there are no studies related to the use of AMF in olive seedling production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of different AMF species on the development of seedlings of olive cultivars that may be grown in the region of southern of Minas Gerais. A greenhouse experiment was carried out evaluating three olive cultivars (Arbequina, Grappolo 541 - MGS GRAP541 and Maria da Fe - GS MARIENSE) and four treatments of inoculation with AMF (without inoculum and with inoculum of FMAs species Glomus clarum, Gigaspora rosea, or Scutelospora scrobiculata), according to a factorial combination 4 x 3. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. The AMF studied led to a greater shoot and root dry matter weight when compared to treatments without fungi, especially in the olive seedling cultivars Arbequina and Grappolo (MGS GRAP 541). The cultivar Maria da Fe (MSG MARIENSE) had low mycorrhizal dependency and lower production of shoot dry matter weight compared to the other cultivars.","[dos Reis Ferreira, Gustavo Magno] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Melloni, Rogerio; Martins, Fabrina Bolzan] Univ Fed Itajuba, Inst Recursos Nat, Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [de Oliveira da Silva, Luiz Fernando; Goncalves, Emerson Dias] Empresa Pesquisa Agr Minas Gerais, Fazenda Expt Maria Fe, Maria Da Fe, MG, Brazil","Melloni, R (reprint author), Univ Fed Itajuba, Inst Recursos Nat, Itajuba, MG, Brazil.",rmelloni@unifei.edu.br,,"Bolzan Martins, Fabrina/0000-0003-0401-6168",,,,29,5,5,0,14,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

Despite the known potential of forest plantations of fast growing species to store carbon in the biomass, there are relatively few studies including precise estimates of the amount of carbon in these plantations. In this study it was determined the carbon content in the stems, branches, leaves and roots of a clonal Eucalyptus grandis plantation in the Southeast of Brazil. We developed allometric equations to estimate the total amount of carbon and total biomass, and produced an estimate of the carbon stock in the stand level. Altogether, 23 sample trees were selected for aboveground biomass assessment. The roots of 9 of the 23 sampled trees were partially excavated to assess the belowground biomass at a single-tree level. Two models with DBH, H and (DBHH)-H-2 were tested. The average relative share of carbon content in the stem, branch, leaf and root compartments was 44.6%, 43.0%, 46.1% and 37.8%, respectively, which is smaller than the generic value commonly used (50%). The best-fit allometric equations to estimate the total amount of carbon and total biomass had DBH2H as independent variable. The root-to-shoot ratio was relatively stable (C. V. = 27.5%) probably because the sub-sample was composed of clones. Total stand carbon stock in the Eucalyptus plantation was estimated to be 73.38 MgC ha(-1), which is within the carbon stock range for Eucalyptus plantations.","[Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto] Univ Fed Acre, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Nat, Curso Engn Florestal, Rio Branco, AC, Brazil; [Boechat Soares, Carlos Pedro; Goncalves Jacovine, Laercio Antonio] Univ Fed Vicosa, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Engn Florestal, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Fehrmann, Lutz; von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Gottingen, Fac Ciencia Florestal & Ecol Florestal, Dept Inventario Florestal & Sensoriamento Remoto, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Ribeiro, SC (reprint author), Univ Fed Acre, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Nat, Curso Engn Florestal, Rio Branco, AC, Brazil.",sabina.ufac@gmail.com; csoares@ufv.br; lfehrma@gwdg.de; jacovine@ufv.br; kgadow@gwdg.de,"Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto/E-4172-2016; von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015","Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto/0000-0002-4504-3050; ",FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [CAG2327-07]; DAAD/CAPESCAPESDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"This research was funded by FAPEMIG (grant No. CAG2327-07), DAAD/CAPES (Ph.D. scholarship) and CNPq (productivity grants).

SEEDLINGS; QUERCUS-SUBER; FIELD PERFORMANCE; ROOT-GROWTH; REGENERATION; MORPHOLOGY; RESPONSES; CONTAINER; DROUGHT; DENSITY,"Soil compaction promoted either by inadequate management (pressure of livestock and machinery) or by soil natural conditions (podzolisation) can influence the growth of cork oak seedlings. We hypothesized that compaction could be related with the lack of natural regeneration and decline on cork oak stands. In this paper, we evaluated the response of cork oak seedlings growth in terms of area and biomass production for above and belowground parts at different compaction depths tested for a sandy-loam soil. This study was done in a greenhouse, with germinated seedlings. Three treatments were applied. One no-compaction treatment (control, C0) and two with a soil compacted layer at 60 cm (C1) and 30 cm depth (C2). The level of compacted layer was 1.37 MPa of mechanical resistance. Results show that tap root length is negatively affected by compaction at 60 and 30 cm depth. Below and aboveground biomass are affected by compaction at 30 cm depth. In addition, the leaf area results demonstrate that compaction is a sensitive factor for this parameter. In this 1-year stage, plants spend more energy in roots production. Due to soil formation and bad management of cork oak stands, soil compaction at depth could be a cause for the observed lack of natural regeneration, affecting the growth at earlier stages and probably for the decline of cork oak populations.","[Dinis, Cati; Ribeiro, Nuno; Oliveira, Maria R.

Expected future temperature increases due to global climate change may significantly affect growth of beech trees and consequently influence carbon cycling in beech forests. We tested the hypothesis that soil temperature influences the growth of both belowground and aboveground parts of beech seedlings. One-year-old seedlings were transferred into rhizotrons and subjected to two different soil temperatures for 2 years while the soil moisture level was kept constant. The main effect of the soil temperature was a changed biomass of the woody part of the seedlings. Soil temperature significantly influenced the biomass of shoots and roots and diameter of the stem, which were the highest for the seedlings grown in conditions of soil temperatures maintained in the range of summer soil temperatures from the site of origin of the seedlings. Increased soil temperature also resulted in increased specific root length and specific root tip density. Root-to-shoot ratio and leaf parameters (leaf mass, number of leaves, and specific leaf area), except for leaf area ratio, were not influenced by soil temperature.","[Straus, Ines; Mrak, Tanja; Ferlan, Mitja; Zeleznik, Peter; Kraigher, Hojka] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Mrak, T (reprint author), Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",tanja.mrak@gozdis.si,,"Mrak, Tanja/0000-0002-3228-367X","Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P4-0107, L4-2265, L4-4318]; Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment; FP7 Infrastructures project EUFORINNO (REGPOT) [315982]","The study was financed by the Slovenian Research Agency through Research Programme P4-0107, the Young Researcher's Project (I.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi are important players in the carbon cycle because they are a conduit into soil for carbon assimilated by the plant. It is hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal fungi can also be active decomposers when plant carbon allocation to fungi is low. Here, we reviewed the literature on ectomycorrhizal decomposition and we developed a simulation model of the plant-mycorrhizae interaction where a reduction in plant productivity stimulates ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our review highlights evidence demonstrating the potential for ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our model output suggests that ectomycorrhizal activity accounts for a portion of carbon decomposed in soil, but this portion varied with plant productivity and the mycorrhizal carbon uptake strategy simulated. Lower organic matter inputs to soil were largely responsible for reduced soil carbon storage. Using mathematical theory, we demonstrated that biotic interactions affect predictions of ecosystem functions. Specifically, we developed a simple function to model the mycorrhizal switch in function from plant symbiont to decomposer. We show that including mycorrhizal fungi with the flexibility of mutualistic and saprotrophic lifestyles alters predictions of ecosystem function.","[Moore, J. A. M.; Jiang, J.; Post, W.

The shade provided by nurse plants can reduce overheating, excessive transpiration, and photoinhibition in protege seedlings. The difference that a nurse plant microenvironment may provide on the physiological performance of succulent desert seedlings could be tested by measuring plant growth and photosynthesis. Specifically, in this study we measured the variables related to chlorophyll fluorescence: Quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (UPSII) and electron transport rate (ETR), as well as relative growth rate (RGR) and its components (net assimilation rate, NAR, and leaf area rate, LAR), root to shoot (R/S) ratio, and relative water content (RWC) for seedlings transplanted under nurse plants and seedlings transplanted under direct sunlight. We tested whether UPSII, ETR, LAR, R/S ratio, and RWC, were lower, and RGR and NAR were higher for seedlings of seven succulent species common to the Southern Chihuahuan Desert (Agave lechuguilla, A. salmiana, Echinocactus platyacanthus, Ferocactus histrix, Myrtillocactus geometrizans, Stenocactus coptonogonus and Yucca filifera) grown under direct sunlight than for those grown under nurse Mesquite trees. Although species responded differently to treatments, in general we found that seedlings grown under nurse plants had higher UPSII and lower ETR than those grown under direct sunlight. RWC, R/S ratio, and RGR and its components varied in response to microenvironments for some species but not consistently. The ecophysiology variables tested here were more clearly affected by solar radiation than the morphology variables. These results are the first field study including the ecophysiological and morphological mechanisms of seedlings of succulent species under nurse plants.","[Perez-Sanchez, Reyes M.; Jurado, Enrique] UANL, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Linares 67700, NL, Mexico; [Flores, Joel; Gonzalez-Salvatierra, Claudia] Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol, Div Ciencias Ambientales, San Luis Potosi 78216, SLP, Mexico","Perez-Sanchez, RM (reprint author), UANL, Fac Ciencias Forestales, AP 41,Carretera Nacl 85,Km 145, Linares 67700, NL, Mexico.",joel@ipicyt.edu.mx,,"Flores, Joel/0000-0001-8856-6022","CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [211824, CB-2010-156205]; PAICYT-UANL","R.

We aimed to understand how fine root structure enables sustained ecosystem metabolism through a summer of limited moisture and high heat and facilitates resource acquisition during the short period of high resource supply. An additional goal was to provide a basis for upscaling root biomass and soil carbon to the landscape scale. We sampled trees of different size and tree clusters via a stratified sampling scheme that accounted for spatial heterogeneity in root biomass and soil carbon with lateral distance from the tree bole, or cluster centre, and soil depth. We upscaled these estimates using site-specific information from a lidar survey. We found that fine roots and soil carbon are spatially heterogeneous in their landscape distribution and greatly increase with tree size. We also found that Q.douglasii possesses a dimorphic fine root architecture, uniquely suited to the region's climatic constraints and exhibits morphological plasticity among trees of different size and physical setting.

The evolutionary consequences of this global change have been largely ignored even though elevated N inputs are predicted to cause mutualism breakdown and the evolution of decreased cooperation between resource mutualists. Using a long-term (22 years) N-addition experiment, we find that elevated N inputs have altered the legume-rhizobium mutualism (where rhizobial bacteria trade N in exchange for photosynthates from legumes), causing the evolution of less-mutualistic rhizobia. Plants inoculated with rhizobium strains isolated from N-fertilized treatments produced 17-30% less biomass and had reduced chlorophyll content compared to plants inoculated with strains from unfertilized control plots. Because the legume-rhizobium mutualism is the major contributor of naturally fixed N to terrestrial ecosystems, the evolution of less-cooperative rhizobia may have important environmental consequences.","[Weese, Dylan J.] St Ambrose Univ, Dept Biol, Davenport, IA 52803 USA; [Weese, Dylan J.; Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Weese, Dylan J.; Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dentinger, Bryn T.

Attack to stems has the potential to be more detrimental to plant performance than attack to leaves. Here we asked how severe is the impact of insect stem herbivory on plant performance. We quantify the effect of insect stem herbivory via a meta-analysis of 119 papers in 100 studies (papers by the same authors were treated as the same study). These studies involved 92 plant species and 70 species of insect herbivore (including simulated herbivory). Attack to plant stems reduced plant performance by an average of approximately 22%. Stem herbivory had greatest impacts on plant and branch survival, which was reduced by 63%. Measures of plant reproduction and vegetative biomass were reduced by 33% and 16% respectively, while measurements of photosynthetic rate were not significantly different between plants with and without stem herbivore attack. Stem herbivory led to a decline in leader performance but an increase in performance of laterals, highlighting the importance of plant compensation. Juvenile plants were more severely affected by stem herbivory than adult plants, and studies conducted in greenhouses found more severe effects than studies conducted in the field. Stem herbivory did not have a significant effects on any of the non-performance responses measured (defence compounds, SLA, root:shoot, phenology and plant carbon and nitrogen).

In the rhizobium-legume interaction, early stages of root infection and nodule development have been well studied from a genetic standpoint. However, factors important for colonization of several surfaces by rhizobia, including soil particles and roots, have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was establishing of environmental factors affecting production of EPS by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain 24.2 and the role of this polysaccharide in bacterial surface properties and attachment ability. Besides the wild-type strain, its derivatives differing in the level of EPS produced were used to these analyses. The ability of attachment to abiotic and biotic surfaces of these strains were established using CFU counting experiments. Three-dimensional structure and other parameters of biofilms formed were characterized in confocal laser scanning microscopy. Electrokinetic (zeta) potential of rhizobial cells were determined using Laser Doppler Velocimetry. It was evidenced that the ability of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii to produce EPS significantly affected bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on both abiotic and biotic surfaces. In addition, the presence of this polysaccharide influenced the zeta potential of rhizobial cells. Mutant strains having a mutation in genes involved in EPS synthesis were significantly impaired in attachment, whereas strains overproducing this polysaccharide showed higher adhesion efficiency to all of the tested materials. EPS facilitated attachment of bacterial cells to the tested surfaces most probably due to hydrophobic interactions and heterogeneity of the envelope surface. EPS produced by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii plays a significant role in attachment and biofilm formation to both abiotic and biotic surfaces as well as bacterial surface properties.","[Janczarek, Monika; Rachwal, Kamila] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Genet & Microbiol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland; [Ciesla, Jolanta; Bieganowski, Andrzej] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agrophys, PL-20290 Lublin, Poland; [Ginalska, Grazyna] Med Univ Lublin, Chair & Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, PL-20093 Lublin, Poland","Janczarek, M (reprint author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",mon.jan@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl; rachwal.kamila@gmail.com; j.ciesla@ipan.lublin.pl; grazyna.ginalska@umlub.pl; a.bieganowski@ipan.lublin.pl,,"Ciesla, Jolanta/0000-0002-8038-3050; Janczarek, Monika/0000-0002-2250-6358; Bieganowski, Andrzej/0000-0002-3571-3241; Ginalska, Grazyna/0000-0002-9961-4226","National Centre of Science [DEC-2012/07/B/NZ1/00099, N303 092234]; Operational Program Development of Eastern Poland, Priority Axis I, Modern Economy Operations 1.3 Innovations Promotion [POPW.01.03.00-06-010/09-00]","This work was supported by the grant of the National Centre of Science no.

Plasticity may be induced by either the mean or variance in conditions; however, plant responses to variance in the environment remain largely unquantified. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in northeastern Ohio using two congeneric pairs of perennial species in a design that crossed two soil heterogeneity and two light heterogeneity treatments. Nested within the soil heterogeneity treatment were patches of congener and conspecific origin, which tests the effects of possible plant-soil feedbacks on trait expression. We used plant biomass to measure performance and root:shoot ratio and specific leaf area (SLA) to measure resource acquisition and allocation. Plant biomass responded to the origin of the soil, consistent with the literature demonstrating that plant-soil feedbacks influence plant performance. Soil and light heterogeneity interacted to significantly affect resource acquisition traits (i.e., SLA) demonstrating that plants integrated both above- and belowground resource variance. All four species showed light-dependent, non-additive effects of soil mixture, though these effects were only marginally significant (P < 0.10). This is important in the context of community assembly because studies find the variance in environmental drivers to be as, or more, important than the means in determining community structure. This study provides some of the first evidence that plant trait expression responds to the variance of environmental drivers, including those driven by plant-soil feedbacks, as well as the means.","[del Pino, Gaston A.; Brandt, Angela J.; Burns, Jean H.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Brandt, Angela J.] Landcare Res, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand","del Pino, GA (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",gad45@case.edu,"Brandt, Angela/V-5514-2019","Brandt, Angela/0000-0001-5980-9128",CWRU Summer Program in Undergraduate Research grant - Howard Hughes Medical Institute; CWRU; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1250170],"We thank the Case Western Reserve University's Squire Valleevue and Valley Ridge Farms, especially A.

We tested the co-invasion hypothesis by examining the EM fungal communities associated with a specialized host, Alnus glutinosa (black alder), and a generalist host, Salix fragilis (crack willow), in New Zealand, where both trees are invasive. We aimed to find out if these two hosts, which often co-occur on invaded riverbanks, (1) were forming novel EM fungal associations in New Zealand and (2) had potential to facilitate each other through shared EM fungi. LocationNew Zealand. MethodsWe collected root tip samples from both host plants at riparian sites on the North Island and South Island and used DNA sequence-based identification to characterize EM fungal communities. ResultsBoth trees relied upon exotic EM fungi from their indigenous ranges and did not associate with any known endemic New Zealand EM fungi. Alnus had highly similar communities on both islands, while the Salix communities were distinct. All EM fungi on South Island Alnus were also present on South Island Salix, while North Island Salix did not substantially share EM fungal associates with Alnus. Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that plant hosts with specialized and more generalist EM fungal communities can both successfully invade new habitats with non-indigenous EM fungi. While there may be some potential for facilitation between these two EM plants hosts via shared non-indigenous fungi, this outcome was context specific. Our findings suggest that the specificity of fungal mutualists is not a major barrier to the spread of invasive plants and cannot be taken as evidence an introduced plant will not become invasive.","[Bogar, Laura M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dickie, Ian A.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.] Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Kennedy, Peter G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, Biol Sci Ctr 250, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Bogar, LM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lbogar@stanford.edu,"Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Bogar, Laura/0000-0001-6121-2224","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1020735]; Bio-Protection Research Center, Lincoln University; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","The authors thank N.

We used a standard chamber equipped with an infrared gas analyzer and configured as an open system to measure R (fr) of intact roots (< 2 mm) of Caragana korshinskii in situ in November 2013. Rates of R (fr) in C. korshinskii were closely related to root morphological traits, including mean root diameter (D (fr), mm), specific root length (SRL, root length per unit root mass, m g(-1)), and root tissue density (RTD, root mass per unit root volume, g cm(-3)). During dormancy of C. korshinskii, smaller-diameter fine roots had higher respiration rates than larger diameter fine roots, and R (fr) increased with increasing SRL and decreasing RTD. Meanwhile, R (fr) rates increased exponentially with increasing root temperature. Soil temperature (especially in the subsoil layer) did not play a role in controlling changes in R (fr). The results indicated that changes in root temperature and D (fr) were likely to determine rates of R (fr) in C. korshinskii during dormancy.

In this study, we identified those plant characteristics (identity, specific functional traits, or resource acquisition strategy) that were the best predictors of nitrification and denitrification processes. Ten plant populations representing eight species collected from three European grassland sites were chosen for their contrasting plant trait values and resource acquisition strategies. For each individual plant, leaf and root traits and the associated potential microbial activities (i.e., potential denitrification rate [DEA], maximal nitrification rate [NEA], and NH4+ affinity of the microbial community [NHScom]) were measured at two fertilization levels under controlled growth conditions. Plant traits were powerful predictors of plant-microbe interactions, but relevant plant traits differed in relation to the microbial function studied. Whereas denitrification was linked to the relative growth rate of plants, nitrification was strongly correlated to root trait characteristics (specific root length, root nitrogen concentration, and plant affinity for NH4+) linked to plant N cycling. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) that commonly serves as an indicator of resource acquisition strategies was not correlated to microbial activity. These results suggest that the LES alone is not a good predictor of microbial activity, whereas root traits appeared critical in understanding plant-microbe interactions.","[Cantarel, Amelie A.

Here, we investigate how optimally competitive tree allocation should change in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 along a gradient of nitrogen and light availability, together with how those changes should affect carbon storage in living biomass. We present a physiologically-based forest model that includes the primary functions of wood and nitrogen. From a tree's perspective, wood is an offensive and defensive weapon used against neighbors in competition for light. From a biogeochemical perspective, wood is the primary living reservoir of stored carbon. Nitrogen constitutes a tree's photosynthetic machinery and the support systems for that machinery, and its limited availability thus reduces a tree's ability to fix carbon. This model has been previously successful in predicting allocation to foliage, wood, and fine roots along natural productivity gradients. Using game theory, we solve the model for competitively optimal foliage, wood, and fine root allocation strategies for trees in competition for nitrogen and light as a function of CO2 and nitrogen mineralization rate. Instead of down-regulating under nitrogen limitation, carbon storage under elevated CO2 relative to carbon storage at ambient CO2 is approximately independent of the nitrogen mineralization rate. This surprising prediction is a consequence of both increased competition for nitrogen driving increased fine root biomass and increased competition for light driving increased allocation to wood under elevated CO2.","[Dybzinski, Ray; Farrior, Caroline E.; Pacala, Stephen W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Dybzinski, R (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rdybzins@princeton.edu,,"Farrior, Caroline/0000-0001-8999-4264; Dybzinski, Ray/0000-0002-1712-1875",Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI); USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Afriflux; AmeriFlux; AsiaFlux; CarboAfrica; CarboEurope-IPEuropean Union (EU); ChinaFlux; Fluxnet-Canada; KoFlux; LBA (Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia); NECC (Nordic Centre for Studies of Ecosystem Carbon Exchange); OzFlux; TCOS (Terrestrial Carbon Observation System)-Siberia; USCCC (United States-China Carbon Consortium),"We thank S.

Most of these ecosystems have shallow soils over deep groundwater reserves. Understanding the functioning and functional plasticity of species-specific root systems and the patterns of or differences in the use of water sources under more frequent or intense droughts is therefore necessary to properly predict the responses of seasonally dry ecosystems to future climate. We used stable isotopes to investigate the seasonal patterns of water uptake by a sclerophyll forest on sloped terrain with shallow soils. We assessed the effect of a long-term experimental drought (12years) and the added impact of an extreme natural drought that produced widespread tree mortality and crown defoliation. The dominant species, Quercus ilex, Arbutus unedo and Phillyrea latifolia, all have dimorphic root systems enabling them to access different water sources in space and time. The plants extracted water mainly from the soil in the cold and wet seasons but increased their use of groundwater during the summer drought. Interestingly, the plants subjected to the long-term experimental drought shifted water uptake toward deeper (10-35cm) soil layers during the wet season and reduced groundwater uptake in summer, indicating plasticity in the functional distribution of fine roots that dampened the effect of our experimental drought over the long term. An extreme drought in 2011, however, further reduced the contribution of deep soil layers and groundwater to transpiration, which resulted in greater crown defoliation in the drought-affected plants. This study suggests that extreme droughts aggravate moderate but persistent drier conditions (simulated by our manipulation) and may lead to the depletion of water from groundwater reservoirs and weathered bedrock, threatening the preservation of these Mediterranean ecosystems in their current structures and compositions.","[Barbeta, Adria; Mejia-Chang, Monica; Ogaya, Roma; Penuelas, Josep] CSIC, Global Ecol Unit, CREAF CSIC UAB, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Barbeta, Adria; Mejia-Chang, Monica; Ogaya, Roma; Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Voltas, Jordi] Univ Lleida, AGROTECNIO Ctr, Dept Crop & Forest Sci, Lleida, Catalunya, Spain; [Dawson, Todd E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Barbeta, A (reprint author), CSIC, Global Ecol Unit, CREAF CSIC UAB, E-08193 Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain.",a.barbeta@creaf.uab.es,"Voltas, Jordi/D-3280-2013; Barbeta, Adria/F-9391-2016; Voltas, Jordi/N-9587-2019; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011","Barbeta, Adria/0000-0002-8357-1719; Voltas, Jordi/0000-0003-4051-1158; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150",Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2010-17172]; Consolider Ingenio Montes [CSD2008-00040]; Catalan Government [SGR 2009-458]; European Research Council Synergy [ERC-2013-SyG-610028]; FPI predoctoral fellowship from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"This research was supported by the Spanish Government projects CGL2010-17172 and Consolider Ingenio Montes (CSD2008-00040), by the Catalan Government project SGR 2009-458 and the European Research Council Synergy grant ERC-2013-SyG-610028 IMBALANCE-P.

Litter type rather than placement-depth controlled soil C and N retention after 5years in situ, with belowground fine root inputs greatly enhancing soil C (x1.4) and N (x1.2) retention compared with aboveground needles. While the proportions of added needle and fine root-derived C and N recovered into stable SOM fractions were similar, they followed different transformation pathways into stable SOM fractions: fine root transfer was slower than for needles, but proportionally more of the remaining needle-derived C and N was transferred into stable SOM fractions. The stoichiometry of litter-derived C vs. N within individual SOM fractions revealed the presence at least two pools of different turnover times (per SOM fraction) and emphasized the role of N-rich compounds for long-term persistence. Finally, a regression approach suggested that models may underestimate soil C retention from litter with fast decomposition rates.","[Hatton, Pierre-Joseph; Bird, Jeffrey A.] CUNY Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 11367 USA; [Castanha, Cristina; Torn, Margaret S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bird, JA (reprint author), CUNY Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 11367 USA.",jbird@qc.cuny.edu,"Torn, Margaret S/D-2305-2015; Bird, Jeffrey A/H-8751-2012; Castanha, Cristina/X-6352-2019; Castanha, Cristina/D-3247-2015","Torn, Margaret S/0000-0002-8174-0099; Bird, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-0939-0637; Castanha, Cristina/0000-0001-7327-5169; Castanha, Cristina/0000-0001-7327-5169; Hatton, Pierre-Joseph/0000-0002-0662-8734","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Science Division, of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","We are grateful to E.

However, little is known on root dynamics in response to changing rainfall in nature. In a rainout shelter experiment conducted in a semiarid shrub-steppe in south-eastern Spain, we manipulated both the amount (30% reduction all year round) and seasonal rainfall distribution according to climate change scenarios, with increases (30%) or subtle reductions (10%) in winter rainfall, and reductions in the remaining seasons (15% in spring and autumn or 40% in spring and autumn and 30% in summer). Minirhizotron tubes were used to monitor fine root dynamics beneath the canopy of the dominant shrub in a year that was above the average rainfall. We found higher root length density and enhanced root length production in the 30% reduction in annual rainfall compared to ambient (control) or any of the altered seasonality treatments. There were no differences among the three other treatments. By contrast, root length loss and root length turnover were not consistently influenced by rainfall treatments. These results evidence that moderate rainfall reductions all year round would have the largest impact on root dynamics in this arid shrubland. Increased or subtle rainfall reductions in rainy winters may have lower impact, due to moisture replenishment at the beginning of the growing season. These findings are stimulating for further research in larger time scales and in years with contrasting precipitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rooted cuttings of Tamarix ramosissima were individually grown in pots in a greenhouse for 416 days in the following five treatments: 0 (field water only), 50, 100, 200, and 400 mM NaCl. Irrigation water was applied from the bottom of the pots and the water table was kept constant during the experiment. Fine roots were scarce at the surface layer probably because of low moisture and/or high salinity concentrations. Fine-root biomass and length increased in layers with higher soil moisture availability in the control, 50, and 100 mM NaCl treatments. In contrast, the distribution of fine roots appeared to be influenced by salinity in the 200 and 400 mM NaCl treatments. Total biomass and total fine-root length were highest in the 100 mM NaCl treatment, and total biomass was positively correlated with total fine-root length under all conditions, suggesting that variation in fine-root length may have an important effect on the whole-plant biomass of the cuttings across a salinity gradient.

Growth and carbohydrate metabolism in leaves, roots and nodules of two alfalfa cultivars (Medicago sativa cv Apica and salt-tolerant cv Halo) in association with two rhizobial strains (A2 and salt-tolerant Rm1521) exposed to different levels of NaCl (0, 20, 40, 80 or 160 mM NaCl) were assessed under controlled conditions. For both cultivars, shoot and root biomasses and shoot to root ratio significantly declined with increasing NaCl concentrations. Under 80 mM NaCl, Halo plants yielded 20% more fresh shoot biomass than Apica while plants inoculated with Rm1521 allocated more biomass to the roots than to the shoots compared to A2. Halo plants maintained a steady shoot water content (about 80%) under the entire range of NaCl concentrations. Shoot water content was more variable in Apica. Apica in association with salt-tolerant strain Rm1521 maintained a better water status than with strain A2, as indicated by the higher shoot water content at 80 mM NaCl. Under salt stress, two major compatible sugars involved in plant osmoregulation, sucrose and pinitol, increased in leaves while a large accumulation of starch was observed in roots. In nodules, pinitol, sucrose and starch increased under salt stress and were much more abundant with strain Rm1521 than with A2. This suggests that there could be an active transport from the shoot to the nodules to help maintain nodule activity under NaCl stress and that strain Rm1521 increases the sink strength toward nodules. Our results show that combining cultivars and rhizobial strains with superior salt tolerance is an effective strategy to improve alfalfa productivity in salinity affected areas.

Illustrations were obtained with a digital camera mounted on a photomicroscope. The roots of examined species shared most of the anatomical characteristics observed in other species of the Catasetum genus, and many of them have adaptations to the epiphytic habit, such as presence of secondary thickening in the velamen cell walls, exodermis, cortex, and medulla. Some specific features were recognized as having taxonomic application, such as composition of the thickening of velamen cell walls, ornamentation of absorbent root-hair walls, presence of tilosomes, composition and thickening of the cortical cell walls, presence of mycorrhizae, endodermal cell wall thickening, the number of protoxylem poles, and composition and thickening of the central area of the vascular cylinder.

Independent spatial assessments and additional temporal measurements of coarse roots validated the empirical model, which predicted a wide range of rootstock and productivity values as a function of stand age, site index and tree dimension. In agreement with field measurements, the model predicted that the root to shoot ratio approach for estimating belowground biomass and productivity must include a correction factor in case forests under study miss measurements of stand age and site index parameters.

Observations of eddy flux, biometric variables, and chamber measurements from 1999 to 2006 and interannual variations in fine root net primary production (frNPP) were analyzed in conjunction with a terrestrial biosphere model simulation with multiple biometric constraints. Compared to the annual means (excluding 2002 and 2003), the low summer PPFD in 2003 reduced the annual gross primary productivity (GPP; 6%), soil respiration (SR; -11%), and ecosystem respiration (RE; -5%). Under the low summer PPFD, CO2 fluxes commonly decreased but components of the NPP were not affected. The low variation in NPP is explained by previous findings that NPP is more sensitive to climate conditions before or during the early stage of the growing season. The early spring warming in 2002 increased the GPP (8%) and woody tissue NPP (wNPP; 55%) and decreased the frNPP (-33%) and SR (-6%). Although early spring warming prolonged the growing season, the foliage NPP (fNPP) and litterfall were invariant. The increase in wNPP and the decrease in frNPP imply that the forest decreased frNPP in favor of wNPP under the high spring temperature. Although the frNPP was estimated by model-data integration, we argue that the decrease in frNPP is plausible because the decrease in SR cannot be explained without the contribution from fine root respiration. These results suggest that increasing or decreasing patterns of component fluxes cannot necessarily be inferred from the GPP. Factors such as the nature and duration of climate anomalies and allocation shift between components of the NPP may need to be considered when characterizing carbon allocation under anomalous climate events.

Concentrations of Mo are very low in sandy, acidic soils, and biologically available Mo is only a small fraction of the total pool. While several methods have been proposed to measure plant-available Mo, there has not been a recent comprehensive analytical study that compares soil extraction methods as predictors of plant Mo uptake. A suite of five assays [total acid microwave digestion, ethylenediamenetetraaacetic acid (EDTA) extraction, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protocol 3050B, ammonium oxalate extraction, and pressurized hot water] was employed, followed by the determination of soil Mo concentrations via inductively coupled mass spectroscopy. The concentrations of soil Mo determined from these assays and their relationships as predictors of plant Mo concentration were compared. The assays yielded different concentrations of Mo: total digest > EPA > ammonium oxalate >= EDTA > pressurized hot water. Legume foliar Mo concentrations were most strongly correlated with ammonium oxalate-extractable Mo from soils, but an oak species showed no relationship with any soil Mo fraction and foliar Mo. Bulk fine roots in the 10- to 30-cm soil horizon were significantly correlated with the ammonium oxalate Mo fraction. There were significant correlations between ammonium oxalate Mo and the oxides of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al). Results suggest that the ammonium oxalate extraction for soil Mo is the best predictor of plant-available Mo for species with high Mo requirements such as legumes and that plant-available Mo tracks strongly with other metal oxides in sandy, acidic soils.","[Duval, Benjamin D.; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Duval, Benjamin D.; Hungate, Bruce A.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Natali, Susan M.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA USA","Duval, BD (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bduval@wisc.edu,,,,,,27,4,4,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",24-Oct,1532-2416,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Cacao without contact with legumes in an adjacent plantation was used as the reference for N-2 fixation and direct N transfer calculations. Bulk and rhizospheric soils contained 72 and 20%, respectively, of whole-system N. No vegetation effect on delta N-15 in rhizospheric soil was detected, probably due to the high native soil N pool. Fine roots of the cacaos associated with inga contained similar to 35% of N fixed from the atmosphere (N-f) out of the total N. Leaves of all species had significantly higher delta N-15 than fine roots. Twenty percent of system N-f was found in cacao suggesting direct N transfer from inga via a common mycelial network of mycorrhizal fungi or recycling of N-rich root exudates of inga. Inga had accumulated 98 kg [N-f] ha(-1) during the 14-year history of the plantation. The conservative estimate of current N-2 fixation rate was 41 kg [N-f] ha(-1) year(-1) based on inga biomass only and 50 kg [N-f] ha(-1) year(-1) based on inga and associated trees.","[Nygren, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Leblanc, Humberto A.] EARTH Univ, San Jose, Costa Rica","Nygren, P (reprint author), Finnish Soc Forest Sci, POB 18, Vantaa 01301, Finland.",pekka.nygren@luke.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [111769, 129166]; EARTH University research committee","Academy of Finland (grants 111769, 129166) to P.N.; EARTH University research committee to H.A.L.",,54,10,10,0,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2015,35,2,,,,,134,147,,10.1093/treephys/tpu116,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,CI5EQ,WOS:000354776700004,25618898,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Chenlemuge, T; Dulamsuren, C; Hertel, D; Schuldt, B; Leuschner, C; Hauck, M",,,,"Chenlemuge, Tselmeg; Dulamsuren, Choimaa; Hertel, Dietrich; Schuldt, Bernhard; Leuschner, Christoph; Hauck, Markus",,,Hydraulic properties and fine root mass of Larix sibirica along forest edge-interior gradients,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hydraulic architecture; Xylem anatomy; Tree-ring width; Fine root mass; Stem density; Coarse roots,SCOTS PINE; XYLEM EMBOLISM; DROUGHT; BIOMASS; GROWTH; CARBON; CLIMATE; TREES; STAND; CONDUCTIVITY,"At its southernmost distribution limit in Inner Asia, the boreal forest disintegrates into forest fragments on moist sites (e.g. north-facing slopes), which are embedded in grasslands. This landscape mosaic is characterized by a much higher forest edge-to-interior ratio than in closed boreal forests. Earlier work in the forest-steppe ecotone of Mongolia has shown that Larix sibirica trees at forest edges grow faster than in the forest interior, as the more xeric environment at the edge promotes self-thinning and edges are preferentially targeted by selective logging and livestock grazing. Lowered stand density reduces competition for water in these semi-arid forests, where productivity is usually limited by summer drought. We studied how branch and coarse root hydraulic architecture and xylem conductivity, fine root biomass and necromass, and fine root morphology of L. sibirica respond to sites differing in water availability. Studying forest edge-interior gradients in two regions of western Mongolia, we found a significant reduction of branch theoretical (K-p) and empirical conductivity (K-s) in the putatively more drought-affected forest interior in the Mongolian Altai (mean precipitation: 120 mm yr(-1)), while no branch xylem modification occurred in the moister Khangai Mountains (215 mm yr(-1)). K-p and K-s were several times larger in roots than in branches, but root hydraulics were not influenced by stand density or mean annual precipitation. Very low fine root biomass: necromass ratios at all sites, and in the forest interior in particular, suggest that L. sibirica seeks to maintain a relatively high root conductivity by producing large conduits, which results in high root mortality due to embolism during drought. Our results suggest that L. sibirica is adapted to the semi-arid climate at its southernmost distribution limit by considerable plasticity of the branch hydraulic system and a small but apparently dynamic fine root system.

Sixteen root systems of O. echioides were obtained from two serpentine and two non-serpentine sites in the region of Tuscany (Italy) and the associated fungal communities were characterized by 454 pyrosequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicon libraries. Clustering analysis of 173,639 sequence reads yielded a total of 699 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with the number of non-singleton OTUs per fungal community varying between 65 and 225. The richness of the fungal communities did not appear to be affected by the edaphic conditions of serpentine soils but the compositions of the serpentine and non-serpentine communities differed significantly, even though community structures were mainly influenced by strong spatial effects at low-to-medium distance scales. Whereas non-serpentine communities were dominated, at least in terms of sequence read abundance, by OTUs assigned to the genera Rhizophagus and Glomus (Glomeromycota), serpentine communities were dominated by OTUs assigned to the genera Ceratobasidium and Coprinellus (Basidiomycota). The functional roles of these basidiomycetous species in the roots of serpentine O. echioides specimens are, however, unclear and although their presence may affect the serpentine tolerance of the host plant, they may also be opportunistic symbionts that benefited from the reduced abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to colonize the roots of O. echioides in serpentine environments.

By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been reported to promote seedling performance; however, it is unknown whether this is also distance dependent. Here, we investigate the distance dependence of seedling performance in the presence of both pathogens and AMF. In a subtropical forest in south China, we conducted a four-year field census of four species with relatively large phylogenetic distances and found no distance-dependent mortality for newly germinated seedlings. By experimentally separating the effects of AMF and pathogens on seedling performance of six subtropical tree species in a shade house, we found that soil pathogens significantly inhibited seedling survival and growth while AMF largely promoted seedling growth, and these effects were host specific and declined with increasing conspecific distance. Together, our field and experimental results suggest that AMF can neutralize the negative effect of pathogens and that the Janzen-Connell effect may play a less prominent role in explaining diversity of nondominant tree species than previously thought.","[Liang, Minxia; Liu, Xubing; Huang, Fengmin; Wang, Yongfan; Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Ecol, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xubing; Etienne, Rampal S.] Univ Groningen, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands","Yu, SX (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Ecol, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lssysx@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Etienne, Rampal/F-5835-2012","Etienne, Rampal/0000-0003-2142-7612; Yu, Shixiao/0000-0003-1943-0185","National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31230013, 30730021, 31170398]; Zhang-Hongda Science Foundation in Sun Yat-sen University; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)","We are grateful to Weinan Ye, Shaopeng Li, Shan Luo, Yi Zheng, Zhiming Zhang, and Yuxin Chen for their assistance in the field.

Among them, root traits and analyses of relations between above and below-ground traits in natural communities are scarce. Methods we characterized a set of above-and below-ground traits of three dominant shrub species in a semiarid shrub-steppe that had contrasting leaf phenological habits (deciduous, semideciduous and evergreen). We analysed if there was coordination among above-and below-ground resource economics patterns: i.e. patterns of biomass allocation, construction costs and lifespan. Important Findings Above-and below-ground traits and their resource economics relations pointed to species-specific functional strategies to cope with drought and poor soils and to a species ranking of fast to slow whole-plant strategies in terms of resource uptake, biomass construction costs and turnover. The deciduous shrub, Proustia cuneifolia, had relatively deep and even distribution of roots, and high proportion of short-lived tissues of low C construction costs: it had high fine to coarse root and high leaf-to-stem biomass ratios, high specific leaf area (SLA), and stems of low wood density. This strategy allows Proustia to maximize and coordinate above-and below-ground resources uptake as long as the most limiting factor (water) is available, but at the cost of having relative high plant biomass turnover. The evergreen Porlieria chilensis, instead, displayed a more conservative and slow strategy in terms of resource economics. It had similar to 80% of the roots in the 40 cm topsoil profile, low proportion of fine compared with coarse roots and low leaf-to-stem ratios, low SLA and stems of high wood density, i.e. it invested in C costly tissues that, overall, persist longer but probably at the cost of having lower plant resource uptake rates. Traits in the semideciduous Adesmia bedwellii were in between these two functional extremes. Our results revealed high functional diversity and above- and below-ground complementarity in resource economics among these three codominant species in the Chilean coastal desert.","[Morales, Joaquin; Squeo, Francisco A.; Tracol, Yann; Armas, Cristina; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Fac Ciencias, La Serena, Chile; [Squeo, Francisco A.; Armas, Cristina; Gutierrez, Julio R.] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Squeo, Francisco A.; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Ctr Adv Studies Arid Zones, La Serena, Chile","Armas, C (reprint author), Univ La Serena, Fac Ciencias, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile.",carmas@userena.cl,"Kulik, Cristina Armas/A-1128-2012","Kulik, Cristina Armas/0000-0003-0356-8075; Squeo, Francisco/0000-0003-3559-0250",Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity [ICM P05-002]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110228],C.A. was granted with a postdoctoral fellowship from the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity with the financial support of contract (ICM P05-002).

Despite this sustained interest, succession remains a central theme in ecological research and is positioned to continue that prominence in this era of expanding human impacts. Community ecology is currently experiencing a profound conceptual expansion, providing many new insights into succession. Here we present an existing conceptual framework of successional drivers that includes variation in site conditions, species availability and species performance, and expand it to include both evolutionary and geographic sources of variation. This framework is useful because it specifies relationships among individual drivers and is causally complete. While we generally think about succession as a within-site process, the inclusion of phylogenetic and geographic processes allows integration across broader scales. We use the conceptual framework to highlight several opportunities for successional research that have developed within community ecology, but have not been fully integrated into succession work. These ideas represent not only individual drivers of succession, but also potential synergistic processes operating through interaction with other drivers. The complexity of drivers in succession strongly argues for the need to move away from single factor studies towards combinatorial studies that incorporate multiple drivers. Utilizing a trait-based approach should allow researchers to address successional drivers at multiple ecological scales and lead to new insights that integrate ecological systems. Our ability to do this will depend on the availability of equivalent data across multiple systems, suggesting the need for more standardization in successional studies. Addressing the research opportunities highlighted here will not only produce insights into successional systems, but also expand our understanding of fundamental questions in community ecology as a whole. Of particular importance is the ability to address broader scale questions that go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual sites and systems. Understanding the dynamics of successional systems will remain critical to understanding, managing and predicting anthropogenic impacts on natural systems.","[Meiners, Scott J.] Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Charleston, IL 61920 USA; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Fridley, Jason D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Pickett, Steward T.

We harvested twenty palms including above- and below-ground parts in an old growth Amazonian forest in Brazil. The diameter at breast height D ranged from 3.9-12.7 cm, and the stem height H ranged from 2.3-16.4 m. The D, diameter at ground basis D-0, crown diameter CD, H, stem specific gravity rho, and number of fronds N-f were considered as independent variables and incorporated into a power function model. The best predictors were (DH)-H-2 rho for M-s and M-a, (DHNf)-H-2 for M-l, and D for M-r. Slender index (H/D) ranged from 0.56-1.46 m center dot cm(-1), and the D-H relationship suggested that the stem shape becomes more slender with increasing D. On the other hand, rho increased with D implying a stiffening of stem tissue. The average root/shoot ratio was estimated as 0.29 which was higher than that reported for the non-palm tree species in the Amazon. Comparisons of several models to estimate M-a of different palm species, suggested that the variations of the D-H relationship and rho should be considered to develop allometric models for estimating biomass in palm species. In particular the rho largely varied depending on individual size, which should be important to consider, when developing the allometric models for palms.","[Da Silva, Fernando; Higuchi, Niro; Kunert, Norbert] Brazilian Natl Inst Res Amazon, Lab Forest Management, BR-69060000 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Suwa, Rempei] Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Kajimoto, Takuya; Ishizuka, Moriyoshi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Kunert, Norbert] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Proc, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Suwa, R (reprint author), Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Fushimi Ku, 68 Nagaikyutaroh, Kyoto 6120855, Japan.",silvaflorestal@gmail.com; swrmp2005@yahoo.co.jp; tkaji@ffpri.affrc.go.jp; moriyoshi@jifpro.or.jp; niro@inpa.gov.br; nkunert@bgc-jena.mpg.de,,"Kunert, Norbert/0000-0002-5602-6221",Science and the Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Japan International Cooperation Agency,"The authors thank all members of the international cooperative research project of Carbon Dynamics of Amazonian Forests, and Susan Trumbore and Masahiro Saitoh for their valuable suggestions.

However, not the individual trait, but the whole plant with a set of coordinated traits responds to the environment or affects ecosystem properties. Here we argue that the correlation among traits of all major plant organs should be an integral part of response or effect studies. Plants allocate elements and biomass among roots, perennial clonal organs, stems, leaves and seeds to ensure growth and reproduction. Assessment of trait responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems is hardly possible without simultaneously considering all plant organs and the biological functions they perform, namely resource uptake, vegetative regeneration, support and hydraulic pathways, photosynthesis and generative reproduction. Suitable traits to indicate these functions include those of mass, density, size, volume, and element contents of the main plant organs. In principle, we do not propose to collect many traits, but those of similar significance across organs. For instance, specific leaf area should be complemented by specific root length and specific stem length. We present some thoughts on how coordinated allocation to biological functions sets boundaries to the range of trait expressions in successional series and consequently also to species responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems.

The current emphasis on biodiversity as a provider of ecosystem services throws the spotlight on the vast diversity of fungi, their crucial roles in terrestrial ecosystems, and the benefits of considering fungi in concert with animals and plants. We reviewed the role of fungi in ecosystems and composed an overview of the current state of conservation of fungi. There are 5 areas in which fungi can be readily integrated into conservation: as providers of habitats and processes important for other organisms; as indicators of desired or undesired trends in ecosystem functioning; as indicators of habitats of conservation value; as providers of powerful links between human societies and the natural world because of their value as food, medicine, and biotechnological tools; and as sources of novel tools and approaches for conservation of megadiverse organism groups. We hope conservation professionals will value the potential of fungi, engage mycologists in their work, and appreciate the crucial role of fungi in nature. Una Perspectiva Micotica de la Biologia de la Conservacion Resumen Hasta el momento, los hongos rara vez han sido considerados dentro de la Biologia de la Conservacion, pero esto esta cambiando conforme la disciplina cambia su enfoque en problemas de especies individuales hacia una estrategia integrada basada en los ecosistemas. El enfasis actual en la biodiversidad como proveedor de servicios ambientales enfoca la atencion en la amplia diversidad de hongos, sus papeles cruciales en los ecosistemas terrestres y los beneficios de considerar a los hongos en sintonia con las plantas y los animales. Revisamos el papel de los hongos en los ecosistemas y elaboramos un resumen del estado actual de su conservacion. Hay cinco areas en las cuales los hongos pueden integrarse inmediatamente en la conservacion: como proveedores de habitats y procesos importantes para otros organismos; como indicadores de tendencias deseadas o indeseadas en el funcionamiento del ecosistema; como indicadores de habitats con valor de conservacion; como proveedores de enlaces fuertes entre las sociedades humanas y el mundo natural debido a sus valores como alimento, medicinas y herramientas biotecnologicas; y como una fuente de herramientas y estrategias novedosas para la conservacion de grupos megadiversos de organismos. Esperamos que los profesionales de la conservacion valoren el potencial de los hongos, integren a los micologos en su trabajo y aprecien el papel crucial de los hongos en la naturaleza.","[Heilmann-Clausen, Jacob; Halme, Panu] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Barron, Elizabeth S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Boddy, Lynne] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Dahlberg, Anders] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Swedish Species Informat Ctr, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Griffith, Gareth W.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DD, Ceredigion, Wales; [Norden, Jenni] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Norden, Jenni] Univ Oslo, Sect Genet & Evolutionary Biol, Dept Biosci, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Ovaskainen, Otso] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Perini, Claudia] Univ Siena, BIOCONNET Biodivers & Conservat Network, Dept Life Sci, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Senn-Irlet, Beatrice] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Halme, Panu] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Heilmann-Clausen, J (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jheilmann-Clausen@snm.ku.dk,"Norden, Jenni/B-4800-2012; Griffith, Gareth W./A-1970-2009; Ovaskainen, Otso/D-9119-2012; Norden, Jenni/F-3835-2019","Norden, Jenni/0000-0001-8894-5815; Griffith, Gareth W./0000-0001-6914-3745; Ovaskainen, Otso/0000-0001-9750-4421; Norden, Jenni/0000-0001-8894-5815; Barron, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2926-765X; Boddy, Lynne/0000-0003-1845-6738; Heilmann-Clausen, Jacob/0000-0003-4713-6004",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1127269]; Aage V.

The root system of 106 adult trees from ten species was carefully extracted from French dikes. Root length and proximal diameter, length and diameter of root segments and branch insertion diameter were measured. Root branching and tapering rates, segment taper, classical (P) and new architectural parameters related to branching patterns were computed. Two contrasting root types called ""running"" (R) and ""short"" (S), were identified from growth and architectural parameters. Compared to S roots, R roots were longer for an equivalent proximal diameter and singled out with lower tapering rate, branching rate and segment taper and with smaller branches. Their main axis lost less in diameter at branching point for branches of the same size. Tree species had little influence on these architectural parameters. The effect of soil material (coarse vs fine) was significant mainly on root size, on branching rate in fine material, and only secondarily on some branching patterns for running roots and on segment taper. The new architectural parameters describe branching patterns more accurately than classical ones. This study provides an original insight in tree root architectural analysis, proposing a new root typology and innovative parameters for the description and modeling of root architecture.","[Vennetier, Michel] Irstea, UR Ecosyst Mediterraneens & Risques, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France; [Vennetier, Michel] Univ Aix Marseille, ECCOREV FR 3098, Marseille, France; [Zanetti, Caroline] ARBEAUSOLutions, F-13590 Meyreuil, France; [Zanetti, Caroline; Meriaux, Patrice; Mary, Benjamin] Irstea, UR Ouvrages Hydraul & Hydrol, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France; [Mary, Benjamin] LABEX OT Med, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France","Vennetier, M (reprint author), Irstea, UR Ecosyst Mediterraneens & Risques, 3275 Route Cezanne,CS 40061, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France.",Michel.vennetier@irstea.fr; c.zanetti@arbeausolutions.fr; patrice.meriaux@irstea.fr; benjamin.mary@irstea.fr,,"Mary, Benjamin/0000-0001-7199-2885","Irstea; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region (PHD grant)Region Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; French National Research Agency (ANR - ERINOH project)French National Research Agency (ANR); EDF; CNRItalian National Research Council; AD Isere-Drac-Romanche; DDT Nievre; SMAVD; Chambery Metropole; Conseil General de l'IsereRegion Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; Labex OT-Med [ANR-11-LABX-0061]; French Government ""Investissements d'Avenir"" through the A*MIDEX projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]","The authors are indebted to Caroline Brunel from IMBE for her help in multivariate analyses, to Frederic Danjon for his comments and suggestions from early stages of this study, to Peter Z.

Mechanisms regulating the responses of plants and their vascular tissues to environmental stimuli are mediated by continuously moving hormonal signals that enable continuous response to ecological cues. Auxin from young leaves is the primary hormonal signal that can induce vascular differentiation by itself. Its concentrations determine whether phloem or xylem is induced. Auxin produced in a parasitic plant induces continuous vessel system into its host with open perforation at their junction. Polar auxin gradients along trees regulate the gradual widening of vessel diameter and decrease in vessel density from leaves to roots. This basic mechanism also regulates vascular adaptation to the plant's environment. Gibberellin from mature leaves, in the presence of auxin, promotes cambial activity and woodiness, and is the specific signal inducing fibers. The evolutionary development of vessels and fibers from tracheids reflects their hormonal specialization; from the combined mechanism of auxin and gibberellin for tracheids in gymnosperms, to the specialized mechanisms of auxin inducing vessels, and gibberellin inducing fibers in angiosperms. Cytokinin from root tips promotes cambial activity and sensitivity enabling the extreme differentiation of ring-porous wood in temperate deciduous hardwood trees. These mechanisms are discussed for clarifying the role of the environment in vascular adaption and evolution.","Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Ecol Plants, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Aloni, R (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Ecol Plants, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",alonir@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,125,40,41,4,98,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

They are shown to be rigid under hydrodynamic loading, and deflection of the root tip caused by normal flow drag is less than 1 mm. An investigation into the characteristics of Sonneratia alba mangrove roots was performed to improve our understanding of physical processes in mangrove ecosystems. Field studies were carried out in mangrove areas along the coastline of Singapore where S. alba mangrove species are found. Geometrical properties, such as height, diameter and spatial density of the cone-shaped pneumatophores were assessed through the use of photogrammetric methods. Samples of these roots were harvested from mangrove swamps and their material properties, including the mass density, moisture content, Young's modulus and bending strength, were determined in the laboratory. The bending strength and Young's modulus of the woody core of the pneumatophores of the S. alba are found to be around 800 MPa, and these values are larger compared to those belonging to other lateral plant roots. It was observed that for the pneumatophores, the Young's modulus for tensile and flexural modulus under bending are approximately the same. Based on resonance and deflection calculations, our results indicate that S. alba pneumatophores in a mangrove environment under riverine hydrodynamic loadings can be regarded as rigid. The natural frequency of the pneumatophores is an order of magnitude larger than the forcing frequency of the flow during normal tidal current, suggesting that strong amplitudes are not likely to be observed because of the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) in water flow. The deflection of the root tip for S. alba pneumatophores (simulated as cylindrical cantilever) caused by normal flow drag is less than 1 mm, i.e., about 1/200 of the root height, and this suggests that the hydro-elastic model is not necessary for simulating pneumatophores in laboratory and numerical model under tidal flows.","[Zhang, Xiaofeng; Chua, Vivien P.; Cheong, Hin-Fatt] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Chua, VP (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Engn Dr 2, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",vivienchua@nus.edu.sg,,,"Singapore-Delft Water Alliance (SDWA) under the marine project ""Large-scale sediment transport and turbidity in Singapore's coastal waters''; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, P.

Soybean root exudates that include a variety of compounds are thought to act as signals to trigger the early symbiotic events between Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and soybeans, and thus they act as a key determinant of the competitiveness for nodulation. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of competitiveness at the level of protein expression, we compared the proteomic responses of two B. diazoefficiens strains that demonstrated completely different nodulation abilities, strain 4534 being the most competitive and strain 4222 being the least competitive in nodulation. In the proteomic analysis, 40 of the 65 and 22 of the 29 differential proteins were identified in response to soybean root exudates in strain 4534 and strain 4222, respectively. Compared to strain 4222, a higher amount and a number of differential proteins were detected in strain 4534, including S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS), PhyR-sigma(EcfG) regulon, ABC-type transporters, flagellar proteins, molecular chaperones, and proteins involved in redox state maintenance as well as several unknown proteins. Noteworthy was the induction of the PhyR-sigma(EcfG) regulon and flagellar proteins, recently demonstrated to be involved in the competitiveness for nodulation in Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Our results indicate that the role of root exudates can go far beyond inducing the expression of nodulation genes in B. diazoefficiens. Many other proteins/enzymes involved in the metabolism and environmental fitness were also upregulated when exposed to root exudates. More proteins were upregulated by the high nodulation competitive strain than that by the low, and the reasons for this need further investigation. The outcome of such study may contribute to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of different competitiveness in B. diazoefficiens as well as specific adaptation in the legume host.","[Liu, Yao; Guan, Dawei; Jiang, Xin; Ma, Mingchao; Li, Jun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Li; Cao, Fengming; Chen, Huijun; Shen, Delong; Li, Jun] Minist Agr, Lab Qual & Safety Risk Assessment Microbial Prod, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Li, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",jli@caas.ac.cn,,,"Special Fund for Establishment of Modern Agricultural RD System; Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Agriculture, China [CARS-04]; National Basic Research Program (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB150506]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31200388]; National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program) [2013AA102802-04]; National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CAAS [IARRP-2014-4]","This work was supported by the Special Fund for Establishment of Modern Agricultural R&D System; Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Agriculture, China (CARS-04); the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) (2015CB150506); the National Natural Science Foundation of China For Young Scholars (31200388); the National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program) (2013AA102802-04); and National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of CAAS (IARRP-2014-4).",,72,4,4,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2762,1432-0789,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

We were particularly interested in the biomass allocation patterns after the change from a single-stem (pre-coppice) to a multi-shoot (post-coppice) system, as well as in the fine root (Fr; 0< 2 mm) mortality after coppice for their implications in the belowground C cycle. The root system of selected trees from two poplar (Populus spp.) genotypes - Skado and Koster - were excavated for the determination of coarse (Cr, 0> 5 mm) and medium-sized (Mr, 02-5 mm) roots. After two 2-year rotations, the Cr biomass (dry mass, DM) was higher in the P. trichoccopa x P. maximowiczii genotype Skado (187.0 g DM m(-2)) than in the P. deltoides x P. nigra genotype Koster (155.4 g DM m(-2)). Both genotypes showed a relatively shallow, but extensive root system. Allometric equations were fitted between DM of Cr and Mr, and basal area. The root:shoot ratio decreased exponentially with basal area, showing the same trend for single-stem and multi-shoot trees. The soil coring technique was used to determine Fr mass at different dates and at different soil depths. The highest Fr biomass was detected in the upper 15 cm of the soil; no genotypic differences in Fr mass were detected at any soil depth. After coppice Fr mortality was significantly increased and weed root biomass significantly reduced. The coppice of the aboveground stems and shoots resulted in a high input of C into the soil and a large amount of C was stored in belowground tree biomass. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Both species possess a highly bioactive phytotoxin -(-) antofine in root tissues that causes pronounced inhibition in laboratory bioassays of native plant species co-located in habitats where swallow-wort is found. To further evaluate the allelopathic potential of -(-) antofine, we: determined its concentration in young plant tissues; used in situ approaches to assess antofine stability, potential activity of degradation products, activity in sterile and nonsterile soil; and determined accumulation and concentration in hydroponic cultivation and field collected soil samples. Extracts of seeds and young seedlings were found to have approximately 2-3 times the level of -(-) antofine in comparison to root extracts of adult plants. Breakdown products of antofine accumulated rapidly with exposure to light, but more slowly in the dark, at ambient temperatures, and these products did not retain biological activity. Extraction efficiencies of control soil spiked with -(-) antofine were low but easily detectable by HPLC. Soil samples collected over two growing seasons at four different sites where either pale swallow-wort or black swallow-wort populations are present were negative for the presence of -(-) antofine. Dose response curves using sterile and nonsterile soil spiked with -(-) antofine demonstrated a requirement for at least 20-55 x greater -(-) antofine concentrations in soil to produce similar phytotoxic effects to those previously seen in agar bioassays with lettuce seedlings. Sterile soil had a calculated EC50 of 686 mu M (250 mu g/g) as compared to nonsterile soil treatments with a calculated EC50 of 1.88 mM (640 mu g/g). When pale swallow-wort and black swallow-wort adult plants were grown in hydroponic cultivation, -(-) antofine was found in root exudates and in the growing medium in the nM range. The concentrations in exudate were much lower than that needed for biological activity (mu M) although they might be an underestimate of what may accumulate over time in an undisturbed rhizosphere. Based on these various results, it remains uncertain as to whether -(-) antofine could play a significant allelopathic role for invasive swallow-worts.","[Gibson, Donna M.; Vaughan, Richard H.; Milbrath, Lindsey R.] ARS, USDA, Biol Integrated Pest Management Res Unit, Robert W Holley Ctr Agr & Hlth, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Milbrath, LR (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Biol Integrated Pest Management Res Unit, Robert W Holley Ctr Agr & Hlth, Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Lindsey.Milbrath@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,51,3,3,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

We have measured the changes in NSC and N concentrations in leaves, branches, stems and all root branch orders at monthly intervals in control and girdled trees of larch (Larix gmelinii) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica). The biomass of each plant compartment was also determined to calculate the size of the NSC and N pools. In both species, 13-37 % of the NSC and N pools were mobilized at the beginning of the growing season. Among the mobilized pools, stems and non-absorptive roots (branch orders 4-9) acted as the largest NSC sources in larch and ash, respectively, while branches served as the largest N source in both species. After stem girdling, 22 and 50 % of the root NSC stores in larch and ash, respectively, were mobilized to maintain root activities during the growing season. Tree mortality was observed 1 year after girdling, at which time there was still an abundant NSC pool in the roots. We conclude that (1) different storage organs differ in their contribution to new tissue growth at the beginning of the growing season and that those storage organs holding higher fractions of the NSC or N pool are not necessarily those which mobilize more NSC or N; (2) tree growth may not be limited by carbon (C) availability; (3) C storage in non-absorptive roots plays an important role in maintaining tree survival after the termination of photosynthate flow from aboveground sources.","[Mei, Li] Huazhong Agr Univ, Minist Educ China, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Yanmei; Guo, Dali] Chinese Acad Sci, Qianyanzhou Ecol Stn, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jiacun; Wang, Zhengquan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Xiong, YM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Qianyanzhou Ecol Stn, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",xiongym@igsnrr.ac.cn; guodl@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Guo, Dali/G-2158-2014; Guo, Dali/C-3498-2012","Xiong, Yanmei/0000-0001-8050-5145","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416903]; One-Hundred Talent Project of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-TZ-11]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31021001, 31370627]","We thank Drs.

One proposal is that woody plant expansion into grasslands is driven in part by the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We have examined the effect of CO2 concentration on the competitive interactions between established C-4 grasses and woody plant seedlings in a model grassland system. Woody plant seedlings were grown in mesocosms together with established C-4 grasses in three competition treatments (root competition, shoot competition and root + shoot competition) under ambient and elevated CO2 levels. We found that the growth of the woody plant seedlings was suppressed by competition from grasses, with root and shoot competition having similar competitive effects on growth. In contrast to expectations, woody plant seedling growth was reduced at elevated CO2 levels compared to that at the ambient CO2 level across all competition treatments, with the most plausible explanation being reduced light and soil water availability in the elevated CO2 mesocosms. Reduced light and soil water availability in the elevated CO2 mesocosms was associated with an increased leaf area index of the grasses which offset the reductions in stomatal conductance and increased rainfall interception. The woody plant seedlings also had reduced 'escapability' (stem biomass and stem height) under elevated compared to ambient CO2 levels. Our results suggest that the expansion of woody plants into grasslands in the future will likely be context-dependent, with the establishment success of woody plant seedlings being strongly coupled to the CO2 response of competing grasses and to soil water availability.","[Manea, A.; Leishman, M.

For testing whether species richness increases below-ground biomass and production and thus complementarity between forest tree species in young stands, we determined fine root biomass and production of trees and ground vegetation in two experimental plantations representing gradients in tree species richness. Additionally, we measured tree fine root length and determined species composition from fine root biomass samples with the near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy method. We did not observe higher biomass or production in mixed stands compared to monocultures. Neither did we observe any differences in tree root length or fine root turnover. One reason for this could be that these stands were still young, and canopy closure had not always taken place, i.e. a situation where above- or below-ground competition did not yet exist. Another reason could be that the rooting traits of the tree species did not differ sufficiently to support niche differentiation. Our results suggested that functional group identity (i.e. conifers vs. broadleaved species) can be more important for below-ground biomass and production than the species richness itself, as conifers seemed to be more competitive in colonising the soil volume, compared to broadleaved species.","[Domisch, Timo; Finer, Leena] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Joensuu Unit, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Dawud, Seid Muhie; Vesterdal, Lars; Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Domisch, T (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Joensuu Unit, POB 68, Joensuu 80101, Finland.",timo.domisch@metla.fi,"Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten/E-8424-2015; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011; Dawud, Seid Muhie/E-3770-2015; Domisch, Timo/Q-4458-2018","Raulund-Rasmussen, Karsten/0000-0003-1573-1167; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Dawud, Seid Muhie/0000-0002-5587-945X; Domisch, Timo/0000-0001-7026-1087",European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [265171],"We would like to sincerely thank Ms. Sigrid Berger, Ms. Maria Martinez Otero, Mr. Raino Lievonen, Mr. Arto Saari and Mr. Ilkka Jussila for field assistance, as well as Ms. Eija Koljonen, Ms. Seija Repo, Ms. Anita Pussinen, Ms. Niina-Maria Erola, Ms. Sanna Kykkanen, Ms. Tiina Turunen, Ms. Heini Savola, Ms. Helena Tanskanen, Mr. Janne Hakkarainen, Mr. Miika Nokelainen, Mr. Tuomas Silvonen and Mr. Tapio Laakso for help in the laboratory.

This may reflect variation in limitation by different abiotic niche dimensions (realized niche shift) or phenotypic effects of biotic interactions that vary among ranges (realized niche expansion). Novel abiotic and biotic environments in the introduced range may also lead to genetic changes in exotic plant traits that enhance their abiotic stress tolerance (fundamental niche expansion). Here, we investigated how biotic interactions (aboveground herbivory and soil organisms) affect plant salinity tolerance using the invasive species Triadica sebifera from China (native range) and US (introduced range) populations grown in common gardens in both ranges. Simulated herbivory significantly reduced survival in saline treatments with reductions especially large at low salinity. Soil sterilization had a negative effect on survival at low salinity in China but had a positive effect on survival at low salinity in the US. Triadica survival and biomass were higher for US populations than for China populations, particularly in China but salinity tolerance did not depend on population origin. On average, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization was higher for US populations, US soils and low salinity. These factors had a significant, positive, non-additive interaction so that clipped seedlings from US populations in low saline US soils had high levels of AM colonization. Overall, our results show that phenotypic biotic interactions shape Triadica's salinity tolerance. Positive and negative biotic interactions together affected plant performance at intermediate stress levels. However, only aboveground damage consistently affected salinity tolerance, suggesting an important role for enemy release in expanding stress tolerance.","[Yang, Qiang; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci, CN-200433 Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Yang, Q (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci, 220 Handan Rd, CN-200433 Shanghai, Peoples R China.",bool@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666","US NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [2009S1-30]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30930019]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [10JC1400700, 12XD1400500]","Author contributions: QY, BL and ES designed the research, QY and ES implemented treatments and collected data, QY and ES analyzed the data, and QY, BL and ES wrote the paper.

For the first time, we separated the effects of tree identity and tree species diversity on the link between above and belowground communities in a near-natural forest. We established 100 tree clusters consisting of each three tree individuals represented by beech (Fagus sylvatica L), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), or lime (Tilia spec.) at two different sites in the Hainich National Park (Thuringia, Germany). The tree clusters included one, two or three species forming a diversity gradient. We investigated the microbial community structure, using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, in mineral soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in the centre of each cluster. The lowest total PLFA amounts were found in the pure beech clusters (79.0 +/- 23.5 nmol g(-1) soil dw), the highest PLFA amounts existed in the pure ash clusters (287.3 +/- 211.3 nmol g(-1) soil dw). Using principle components analyses (PCA) and redundancy analyses (RDA), we found only for the variables 'relative proportion of beech trees' and 'living lime fine root tips associated with ectomycorrhiza' a significant effect on the PLFA composition. The microbial community structure was mainly determined by abiotic environmental parameters such as soil pH or clay content. The different species richness levels in the clusters did not significantly differ in their total PLFA amounts and their PLFA composition. We observed a tendency that the PLFA profiles of the microbial communities in more tree species-rich clusters were less influenced by individual PLFAs (more homogenous) than those from species-poor clusters. We concluded that tree species identity and site conditions were more important factors determining the soil microbial community structure than tree species diversity per se. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the root system of four Hong Kong native shrubs (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa and Melastoma sanguineum) and trees (Schefflera heptaphylla and Reevesia thyrsoidea) with height that ranged between 1 and 1.5 m was sampled and their characteristics were studied. Methods: The distribution of roots and root area ratio (RAR) with depth, relationship between root tensile strength (T-r) and root diameter (d), and also the variation of root cohesion (c(r)) with depth of the four species were investigated and statistically compared. Results: Roots of the studied trees were found to extend deeper into the ground (up to 0.8 m) as compared to the shrubs (up to 0.4 m). RAR lies between 0.03 and 0.14% for the top 0.1 m soil and decreased with depth. The obtained T-r-d relationship of all the studied species fell into the same order as compared to some commonly reported European species. Besides, conventionally adopted power relationship between T-r and d was confirmed to be applicable for the studied. species. The variation of root cohesion with depth was investigated for each species. Root cohesion of less than 1.5 kPa was evaluated for even the top 0.2 m soil when roots with a diameter that ranged only between 1 and 10 mm were considered. The contribution of roots to slope stability was studied on infinite slopes with and without vegetation under two hydrological scenarios (dry and wet slopes). Conclusions and implications: It was found that the studied young vegetation can bring an unsafe slope to marginal safety (factor of safety slightly larger than unity). Moreover, the studied tree species did not outperform the shrubs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Leung, Flora T. Y.; Yan, W. M.; Tham, L.

However, microbes associated with plant roots can also impact the biology of above-ground insect herbivores through influencing various aspects of plant physiology, with effects dependent on the bacterial species. Because rhizobial seed inoculants can potentially affect densities of soybean herbivores, we investigated the performance of phloem-feeding soybean aphids (Aphis glycines Matsumura) on: (1) soybeans receiving one of four commercially available rhizobial seed inoculants, (2) non-inoculated soybeans associated with existing soil bacteria, or (3) non-inoculated soybeans receiving high levels of fertilizer to suppress N-fixation while still providing adequate N as nitrate. We quantified effects of inoculants and aphid presence on parameters associated with plant growth, N-fixation, and foliar N levels, and explored relationships between aphid densities and these plant parameters. Regardless of inoculation treatment, aphid presence negatively affected plant biomass, pod density, and total N concentration in aerial plant tissues, although, effects on the concentration of ureide N (primary products of N-fixation) were not significant. Inoculant identity significantly impacted aphid populations in both short- (1 week) and longer-term experiments (2 months), with pest densities negatively related to the number of root nodules per plant. This research indicates that nodulation status of soybeans can influence above-ground herbivores. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Brunner, S. M.; Swenson, S. J.; Foster, S.

To assess the effect of climate change on soil respiration (RS), it is crucial to understand individual responses of autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic (RH) components. We investigated the effect of continuously (20 months) reduced throughfall (TFR, -40%) and the influence of seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture on RS, RA and RI-I, partitioned by root exclusion, in a dry temperate broadleaved evergreen eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. TFR decreased mean RS from 4.7 +/- 0.1 (Control) to 3.8 +/- 0.1 (TFR) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (-19%) TFR indicated a strong decrease in RA from 2.5 +/- 0.1 (Control) to 1.5 +/- 0.1 (TFR) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (-40%), but had no effect on RH. The mean relative contribution of RH to RS was 47% in the Control and increased to 61% under TFR. RS was the result of distinct seasonal patterns and dependencies of RH and RA on environmental variables. Soil temperature was a good predictor of RH (Control: R-2 = 0.72, TFR: R-2 = 0.75), but not of RA. In contrast, RH was not limited by soil moisture, while RA was partly influenced by soil moisture (Control: R-2 = 0.29, TFR: R-2 = 0.56). The lack of response of RH to changes in soil moisture (seasonal and under TFR) was likely influenced by the high rainfall conditions such that soil moisture did not decrease to a point where it limited soil microbial decomposition processes. Our results show that TFR implied the strongest effect on RA and that changes in soil temperature and moisture alone do not sufficiently explain seasonal changes in RA and RS. This indicates that biotic factors, such as plant internal carbon allocation, may exert a stronger influence on RA and hence, RS. In short-term a reduction in rainfall will lead to a decrease of soil respiration in dry temperate broadleaved evergreen eucalypt forests. The magnitude of this decrease and its persistence under extended drought will be greatly influenced by seasonal and inter-annual climate variability and potential changes in plant carbon allocation.

We investigated the impact of light intensity and water column O-2 concentrations on radial oxygen loss (ROL), in young specimens of Z. marina and R. maritima. Planar optode imaging revealed that ROL of Z. marina was localized to the root tip, while R. maritima showed ROL along extensive root sections. The total root biomass of the 2 species was similar, but, while R. maritima had only 1 root, of which 33% of its length showed ROL, Z. marina had 2 to 5 individual roots, where only 2 to 3 exhibited O-2 leakage, but then only at root tips. ROL resulted in an oxic volume of 4.26 +/- 0.51 mm(3) plant(-1) for Z. marina and 5.39 +/- 0.47 mm(3) plant(-1) for R. maritima (n = 3). ROL per plant at light saturation was 2.32 +/- 0.30 and 2.89 +/- 0.38 nmol h(-1) for Z. marina and R. maritima, respectively. These values declined by 71 and 60% in darkness. However, both species were able to maintain ROL as long as ambient O-2 levels remained >50% air saturation. The calculated ROL integrated over a 24 h cycle was 48.8 +/- 10.6 nmol O-2 plant(-1) d(-1) (n = 3) for R. maritima and 30% less for Z. marina. The ability of R. maritima to maintain higher ROL than Z. marina could be an important feature defining its potential for colonizing and maintaining growth in eutrophic sediments.","[Jovanovic, Zeljko; Pedersen, Mia O.; Larsen, Morten; Kristensen, Erik; Glud, Ronnie N.] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Larsen, Morten; Glud, Ronnie N.] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dunstaffnage Marine Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Larsen, Morten; Glud, Ronnie N.] CO Greenland Inst Natl Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Nuuk 3900, Greenland; [Glud, Ronnie N.] Aarhus Univ, Artic Climate Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Glud, RN (reprint author), Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",rnglud@biology.sdu.dk,,"Glud, Ronnie N./0000-0002-7069-893X; Kristensen, Erik/0000-0001-7259-0132","Faculty of Science at the University of Southern Denmark; Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [FNU-12-125843, DNRF53]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2010-AdG-20100224]; Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland [GCRC6507]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F018614/1, NE/H017216/1]","We acknowledge financial support from the Faculty of Science at the University of Southern Denmark, the Danish Council for Independent Research (FNU-12-125843), the Danish Council for Independent Research (DNRF53), ERC Advanced Grants (ERC-2010-AdG-20100224) and The Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (GCRC6507).

Yet, their algal ancestors were poorly pre-adapted to such a life at the interface. We review the paleontological evidence that fungal symbioses which can exploit substrate resources, helped adaptation to land constraints. Diverse structures dating back to the Devonian present convincing evidence for lichens, (symbioses between fungi and microscopic algae) but fossils remain scarce, so that early lichen abundance and ecological relevance remain questionable. Several enigmatic but abundant fossils from the Siluro-Devonian, such as Spongiophyton or the giant Prototaxites (Nematophytes), likely represent fungus-algal symbioses, which shaped early terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, these taxa are fully extinct, and do not have clear affinities with extant groups. Finally, terrestrialization of Embryophyta (land plants), which currently dominate land ecosystems, is linked to a symbiosis with Glomeromycetes. Today, these fungi form arbuscular mycorrhizae, which help most Embryophyta to exploit soil, and molecular data combined with paleontological evidence support the idea that this type of association is ancestral. The role of symbiotic Mucoromycetes during terrestrialization is not fully understood and mycorrhizal association diversified later in the evolution of Embryophyta. Fungal-algal symbioses thus recurrently contributed to terrestrialization of phototrophs.","[Selosse, Marc-Andre] Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat EvolutBiodiversite ISYEB UMR CNRS, MNHN,UPMC,EPHE,CP 50, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France; [Strullu-Derrien, Christine] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England","Selosse, MA (reprint author), Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat EvolutBiodiversite ISYEB UMR CNRS, MNHN,UPMC,EPHE,CP 50, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",ma.selosse@wanadoo.fr,"Strullu-Derrien, Christine/P-4543-2019","Strullu-Derrien, Christine/0000-0003-1131-9546",,,,53,9,9,1,27,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,978-2-7598-1824-2,BIO WEB CONF,,,2015,4,,,,,,,,UNSP 00009,10.1051/bioconf/20150400009,,,12,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,BG6QH,WOS:000390793300009,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19B,"Zhu, K; Bi, YL",,"Hu, Z",,"Zhu, K.; Bi, Y.

In addition, plants experience different levels of water stress in which their adaptation and response will be different. In this paper, we sought to investigate the growth, development and water relations of both wild-type (Col-0) and vte(4) mutant Arabidopsis thaliana under different water frequencies. These water treatments, including control condition, 4 days of water withholding and 8 days of water withholding were imposed on the plants. Each water treatment was replicated three times in a complete randomized design with factorial arrangement. Wild type and mutant A. thaliana plants were subjected to the abiotic stress (water stress) for up to 24 days. The results indicated that under water stress, the performance of wild type plants were stronger than vte(4) mutants. Under control condition, specific leaf area, rosette dry weight and rosette dry weight at bolting of wild type A. thaliana scored the highest values of 47.66 mm(2)/mg, 13.67 mg and 201.5 mg, respectively in comparison with vte(4) mutant. However, both wild type and vte(4) mutant plants were negatively affected as the water treatments continued. The root mass fraction showed an increase in vte(4) mutant and wild type A. thaliana as they scored 0.136g/g and 0.17 g/g, respectively. Under the same treatment, water potential indicated a reduction for both plan types where vte(4) and wild type plants obtained the values of -1.4 and -1.3 MPa, respectively after 24 days of stress initiation. As a result, our findings suggested that different water treatments significantly differed in growth characters in which the absence of gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT) gene in vte(4) had an impact on the plant's response towards the water deficit.","[Khalatbari, A.

This paper studied the morphological and physiological response of rhizomes of Leymus chinensis, which grows rapidly and is highly tolerant to arid and saline-alkaline soils, to different levels of salinealkali stress. Biomass and density of rhizomes showed a variation along with the increase in saline-alkali stress; they show the maximum level in a saline-alkali medium. Rhizome internode length and specific root length gradually increased, while root biomass indicated a contrary tendency towards increase in saline-alkali stress. Under different saline-alkali stress, the root-shoot ratio showed no significant differences among groups. The variation in Na+ content was increased with the increase in saline-alkali stress. The contents of K+ and proline were the highest in a saline-alkali medium; under different levels of salt-alkali stress, the presence of organic acids (OAs) showed different changes. Citrate, malate and succinate were the dominant OAs accumulated in rhizomes. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase increased with incrementing salt-alkaline stress. In summary, L. chinensis is likely to exert a series of adaptable response on its physiology and morphology under different levels of salt-alkaline stress.

We examined the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmospheric warming and simulated grazing (clipping frequency) on aboveground and belowground tissue N concentrations and C : N ratios of a C3 pasture grass. Phalaris aquatica L. cv. 'Holdfast' was grown in the field in six transparent temperature gradient tunnels (18 x 1.5 x 1.5 meach), three at ambient atmospheric CO2 and three at 759 p.p.m. CO2. Within each tunnel, there were three air temperature treatments: ambient control, +2.2/+ 4.0 degrees C above ambient day/night warming and +3.0 degrees C continuous warming. A frequent and an infrequent clipping treatment were applied to each warming x CO2 combination. Green leaf N concentrations were decreased by elevated CO2 and increased by more frequent clipping. Both warming treatments increased leaf N concentrations under ambient CO2 concentrations, but did not significantly alter leaf N concentrations under elevated CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen resorption from leaves was decreased under elevated CO2 conditions as well as by more frequent clipping. Fine root N concentrations decreased strongly with increasing soil depth and were further decreased at the 10-60 cm soil depths by elevated CO2 concentrations. The interaction between the CO2 and warming treatments showed that leaf N concentration was affected in a non-additive manner. Changes in leaf C : N ratios were driven by changes in N concentration. Overall, the effects of CO2, warming and clipping treatments on aboveground tissue N concentrations were much greater than on belowground tissue.","[Volder, Astrid] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Gifford, Roger M.] CSIRO Agr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Evans, John R.] Australian Natl Univ, Div Plant Sci, Res Sch Biol, Linnaeus Bldg 134, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Volder, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",avolder@ucdavis.edu,"Evans, John Richard/C-8424-2009","Evans, John Richard/0000-0003-1379-3532","Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse AccountingAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, Australia","This work was funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Accounting and internal funding from CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, Australia.",,46,1,1,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2015,7,,,,,,,,plv094,10.1093/aobpla/plv094,,,15,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DC2CU,WOS:000369025600002,26272874,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Ifo, SA; Koubouana, F; Nganga, D; Bocko, Y; Mantota, A",,,,"Ifo, Suspense Averti; Koubouana, Felix; Nganga, Dominique; Bocko, Yannick; Mantota, Alima",,,Fine Roots Dynamics in a Tropical Moist Forest: Case of Two Forest Groves in the Congo Basin,BALTIC FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine roots; turnover; Teke Plateau; forest grove; Congo RC,EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS; SOIL-N; BIOMASS; TURNOVER; CARBON; ECOSYSTEMS; AVAILABILITY,"The paper contributes new data on fine root production in tropical forests from the Teke Plateau, an underexplored area of Africa that is dominated by grove forests. Importantly, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of the successional age of vegetation and the impacts of water availability on ecosystem functions, which may assist in predicting how tropical vegetation will change in the future due to climate change driven rainfall changes and more direct human interventions. We used ingrowth cores to study the influence of the forest structure on fine roots production and turnover in two different forests types, a gallery forest (GF) and a hill-slope forest clump (HF) in the Teke Plateau in Congo. We found a significant higher fine root biomass in the 0-20 cm horizon between the GF and HF; however, for the 20-40 cm horizons no significant differences were found between the two forest types. Nevertheless, there is a huge difference on the whole profile (0-40 cm), with 9.45 +/- 8.23 kg m(-2) for the GF and 4.26 +/- 1.28 kg m(-2) for the HF (p < 0.05). The annual production of fine roots was 0.46 +/- 0.24 and 0.36 +/- 0.02 kg m(-2) yr(-1) in the GF and the HF for the horizon 0-20 cm, and of 0.21 +/- 0.19 and 0.20 +/- 0.08 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the horizon 20-40 cm. These differences are not significant (p > 0.05). The differences in fine root biomass between the two types of forest are not explained by differences in production, but by differences in turnover. This difference between the two forest types can be explained by differences in forest structure. The measured basal area was 16.68 m(2) ha(-1) and 6.66 m(2).ha(-1) in the GF and the HF, respectively. We also noted a mean tree density of 640 stems per ha in the GF against 119 stems per ha in the HF.","[Ifo, Suspense Averti; Mantota, Alima] Univ Marien Ngouabi, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Sci Nat, BP 237, Brazzaville, Rep Congo; [Koubouana, Felix; Bocko, Yannick] Univ Marien Ngouabi, Ecole Natl Super Agron & Foresterie, Brazzaville, Rep Congo; [Nganga, Dominique] Univ Marien Ngouabi, Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Phys Sci Environm, Brazzaville, Rep Congo","Ifo, SA (reprint author), Univ Marien Ngouabi, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Sci Nat, BP 237, Brazzaville, Rep Congo.",averti.ifosuspens@umng.cg,,,International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science,The research was conducted on plots established and maintained with funding provided by the International Foundation for Science (IFS).

Root systems were sampled during autumn of 2008, 2009 and 2013 from spruces exposed to varying conditions (totalling 18 trees, 47 samples). The experiment involved six groups of three spruces each. Three groups were growing within the stand and three groups at the stand's edge. One tree from each group (total 6) was exposed to artificial drought using shelters deflecting rainfall away from the root system. For each sample, the number of active and non-active mycorrhizae on 20 root segments about 5 cm long was assessed. The densities of active and non-active mycorrhizae, proportion of active mycorrhizae, and root dry biomass weight were assessed. Factors' significances were determined using ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test or the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests. Samples from outside the sheltered area were characterized by higher numbers of active mycorrhizae than were those sampled within the sheltered area. Induced drought stress significantly influenced active mycorrhizae density. Significantly higher root dry biomass (roots <1 mm in diameter) was found at the stand's interior versus its edge.","[Peskova, V.; Lorenc, F.; Pokorna, V.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Modlinger, R.] Forestry & Game Management Res Inst, Prague 15604 5, Zbraslav, Czech Republic","Peskova, V (reprint author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",peskovav@fid.czu.cz,,,"National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (NAZV) [QH 81136]; Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [GA FLD CZU 20134339, GA FLD CZU A19/14]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic Resolution [5774/2015-MZE-17011, RO0115]","This research was conducted within National Agency for Agricultural Research of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic (NAZV) - the project project QH 81136, Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague - the projects GA FLD CZU 20134339 and GA FLD CZU A19/14, and GA FLD CZU A19/14, and the project of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic Resolution RO0115 (reference number 5774/2015-MZE-17011).

(Polygonaceae) being a climbing member increases their stem and root diameter by forming successive cambia. The first successive ring of cambium initiates as small segments from the parenchymatous cells located on the inner side of group of primary phloem fibres. These small arcs of cambia produced secondary xylem internally and phloem externally while portion between newly initiated cambial arcs exclusively produce thin walled parenchyma cells on either side. With the increase in age, vessel diameter and their frequency not only decreased in roots but also showed complete absence of wider vessels or observed occasionally in thick roots. In thick stems, strands of lignified derivatives once closely arranged became separated and appeared as embedded in parenchymatous ground mass. At this stage, these parenchyma cells underwent proliferation and formed small arcs of meristematic cells and produce vascular elements. Formation of xylem and phloem from these arcs appear like vascular bundles embedded in conjunctive tissue. Since, major portion of the stem is composed of parenchyma cells, presence of fibre with distinct bordered pits instead of wider vessels might be related with additional mechanical support and to provide additional path for the water conduction in absence of wider vessels in roots.

Spores were cultured for 20 days at 26 degrees C in agar medium containing either glucose or root exudates at different concentrations. Nitrogen was supplied in the form of 4 mM NaNO3, 4 mM NH4Cl, 4 mM NH4NO3 or 2 mM urea. Three different controls without added N were used: deionized water, glucose, and root exudates. After 20 days, Glucose concentrations of 10, 25, 40 and 50 g L-1 inhibited the spore germination; however, when the concentration of glucose was 5 g L-1, the mean hyphal length was longer than that in the control. Glucose plus different forms of N sources also has no positive effect on the germination as well as hyphal growth. The addition of root exudates significantly improved both the spore germination rate and hyphal lengths in all four media (root exudates + 4 mmol NaNO3, root exudates + 4 mmol NH4Cl, root exudates + 4 mmol NH4NO3 and root exudates + 2 mmol urea). After incubation for 20 days, the highest spore germination rates (80.33%) were detected in the root exudate + urea medium, while that in the root exudate + NaNO3 medium was lower than in the control. In all these four media, hyphal growth was initially rapid and slowed in the later stages of incubation. Finally, the greatest hyphal length (15. 15 mm spores(-1) was observed in the root exudate + NH4NO3 medium, while the lowest was observed in the exudate + NaNO3 medium.","[Wang, Y.; Tang, S.; Jin, H.] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Jin, H (reprint author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hrjin@zjnu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371291]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY12C01002]; Science and Technology Project of Jinhua [2014-2-011],The authors express their sincere thanks to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41371291) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province of China (Grant No. LY12C01002) and the Science and Technology Project of Jinhua (Grant No.2014-2-011).,,34,1,1,1,16,SOC CHILENA CIENCIA SUELO,TEMUCO,"CASILLA 54-D, TEMUCO, 00000, CHILE",0718-9516,,,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,J.

Soil disturbance, caused for example by site preparation or stump extraction, may increase decomposition and thus lead to higher CO2 emissions, contributing to global warming. The aim of this study was to quantify responses of soil-surface CO2 fluxes (R-s) and litter (needle and root) decomposition rates following various kinds of soil disturbance commonly caused by mechanical site preparation and stump harvest. For this purpose four treatments were applied in a clear-cut site in central Sweden: i) removal of the humus layer and top 2 cm of mineral soil, ii) placement of a humus layer and 2 cm of mineral soil upside down on top of undisturbed soil, forming a double humus layer buried under mineral soil, iii) heavy mixing of the humus layer and mineral soil, and iv) no disturbance (control). Rs measurements were acquired with a portable respiration system during two growing seasons. To assess the treatments' effects on litter decomposition rates, needles or coarse roots (empty set = 6 mm) were incubated in litterbags at positions they would be located after the treatments (buried, or on top of the soil). The results indicate that site preparation-simulating treatments have no effect or may significantly reduce, rather than increase, CO2 emissions during the following two years. They also show that buried litter decomposes more rapidly than litter on the surface, but in other respects the treatments have little effect on litter decomposition rates.","[Mjofors, Kristina; Stromgren, Monika; Nohrstedt, Hans-Orjan; Gardenas, Annemieke I.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, S-15007 Uppsala, Sweden","Mjofors, K (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, POB 7014, S-15007 Uppsala, Sweden.",kristina.mjofors@slu.se,,,Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy Agency; NL Faculty at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Formas strong research environment IMPRESS,"The study was part of the research program ""Tree-stump harvesting and its environmental consequences"" at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences with grants from the Swedish Energy Agency, the NL Faculty at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Formas strong research environment IMPRESS, and a consortium of forest companies.

Two datasets were used to conduct the tests. The first dataset (n=35) contained measured observations for PAW and PRD. A second dataset (n=173) contained measured observations for PRD only. A regression model found a weak relationship between measured values and FSL estimates for PAW and PRD (correlations ranged from -0.08 to 0.17). Additional FSL estimates provided in the form of class intervals were tested by calculating the proportion of observed values within the specified FSL class interval. The effect of estimate lineage (underlying data and estimation method) on the accuracy of the class intervals was assessed using a logistic regression.

Thus, we developed allometric equations, biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEF) for young European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). New data, including 100 sample of each tree species, were collected from central Slovakia. Stem diameter, volume and length were measured and individual tree components; roots, stem, branches and foliage were dried and weighed. Biomass models were constructed using diameter at stem base and/or tree height as independent variables and biomass structure in ash and maple were compared with existing European beech (Fagus sylvatica) data obtained previously from the same region. While relatively few interspecific differences were recorded in whole tree biomass, there is evidence of structural diversity in component biomass. The main differences were found in percentages of stem and branch biomass with beech results contrasting with ash and maple. Contributions of tree components to structural biomass change relative to tree size. These changes are possibly a consequence of progressive growth strategy from early to later tree growth stages. Proportions of stem and branches to whole tree biomass increase with tree size, while foliage and roots decrease. For instance, the smallest trees have a root to shoot ratio of nearly 1.0 while trees with a stem diameter of 70 mm demonstrate proportions of around 0.2. We showed differences between allometric equations and BCEF in both European ash and Sycamore maple. Moreover, our allometric models were compared with other models from Germany and UK.","[Konopka, Bohdan; Pajtik, Jozef; Seben, Vladimir] Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst Zvolen, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia; [Konopka, Bohdan; Pajtik, Jozef] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic","Konopka, B (reprint author), Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst Zvolen, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia.",bkonopka@nlcsk.org,"Seben, Vladimir/Q-9515-2019","Seben, Vladimir/0000-0003-3692-446X","Slovak Research and Development Agency in the Slovak Republic [APVV-0268-10, APVV-0707-12, APVV-0584-12]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [QJ 1220316]","The research was supported by projects APVV-0268-10, APVV-0707-12 and APVV-0584-12 from the Slovak Research and Development Agency in the Slovak Republic.

The research focus was on the main factors influencing the soil respiration (R-S) and microbial respiration in the forest floor (R-FFM) and in the soil (R-SM): soil temperature, moisture, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and pH; groundcover biomass (GC); forest floor mass, carbon and nitrogen; and fine root biomass. R-S was measured twice monthly with the soda-lime method, and the incubation method was used to measure R-SM and R-FFM separately. The results were evaluated annually and over the 2-year research period. Correlation and stepwise regression analyses were used for statistical evaluation. Annual mean R-S was significantly higher in thinned plots (1.92gCm(-2)day(-1)) than in the control plots (1.79gCm(-2)day(-1)). Over the 2-year research period, R-S was higher in the thinned plots, and had linear correlations with GC, soil temperature and fine root biomass. GC was found to be the main factor that determined R-S. The control plots had significantly higher R-SM in first year, whereas the thinned plots had significantly higher R-SM in second year; no significant difference was found over the 2-year research period. R-FFM was significantly higher in the control plots than in the thinned plots, by 84% in the second year and by 34% over the 2-year study period. R-SM had a linear correlation with soil N content and soil pH, whereas R-FFM had linear correlations with C concentration and the C:N ratio of the forest floor in the thinned plots.","[Akburak, Serdar; Makineci, Ender] Istanbul Univ, Soil Sci & Ecol Dept, Fac Forestry, TR-34473 Istanbul, Turkey","Akburak, S (reprint author), Istanbul Univ, Soil Sci & Ecol Dept, Fac Forestry, TR-34473 Istanbul, Turkey.",sakburak@istanbul.edu.tr,"AKBURAK, SERDAR/D-3776-2019","AKBURAK, SERDAR/0000-0002-9066-1595",Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Istanbul UniversityIstanbul University [9652],"The manuscript partly contains some results presented in the PhD thesis of Serdar Akburak under the advisory of Ender Makineci, completed in 2013 at Istanbul University, Science Institute.

Much less is known about the links between belowground and aboveground mutualisms, which have been studied separately for decades. It has not been until recently that these mutualisms-mycorrhizas and legume-rhizobia on one hand, and pollinators and seed dispersers on the other hand-have been found to influence each other, with potential ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here we review the mechanisms that may link these two-level mutualisms, mostly reported for native plant species, and make predictions about their relevance during alien plant invasions. We propose that alien plants establishing effective mutualisms with belowground microbes might improve their reproductive success through positive interactions between those mutualists and pollinators and seed dispersers. On the other hand, changes in the abundance and diversity of soil mutualists induced by invasion can also interfere with below-aboveground links for native plant species. We conclude that further research on this topic is needed in the field of invasion ecology as it can provide interesting clues on synergistic interactions and invasional meltdowns during alien plant invasions.","[Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, CFE, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Traveset, Anna] Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies CSIC UIB, E-07190 Esporles, Mallorca, Spain","Rodriguez-Echeverria, S (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, CFE, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.",susanare@ci.uc.pt,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/I-1730-2015; Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011","Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/0000-0002-2058-3229; ",project MUTUALNET - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008]; FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT); European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [IF/00462/2013],This work was partially supported by the project MUTUALNET (PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008) funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

Examples include stomatal conductance at short time scale (minutes), leaf area index and fine root distributions at longer time scales (days - months) and species composition and dominant growth forms at very long time scales (years - decades - centuries). As a result, the overall response of evapotranspiration to changes in environmental forcing may also change at different time scales. The vegetation optimality model simulates optimal adaptation to environmental conditions, based on the assumption that different vegetation properties are optimized to maximize the long-term net carbon profit, allowing for separation of different scales of adaptation, without the need for parametrization with observed responses. This paper discusses model simulations of vegetation responses to today's elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) at different temporal scales and puts them in context with experimental evidence from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. Without any model tuning or calibration, the model reproduced general trends deduced from FACE experiments, but, contrary to the widespread expectation that eCO(2) would generally decrease water use due to its leaf-scale effect on stomatal conductance, our results suggest that eCO(2) may lead to unchanged or even increased vegetation water use in water-limited climates, accompanied by an increase in perennial vegetation cover.","[Schymanski, Stanislaus J.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schymanski, Stanislaus J.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Sys, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Sivapalan, Murugesu] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [Sivapalan, Murugesu] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL USA","Schymanski, SJ (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",stan.schymanski@env.ethz.ch,"Roderick, Michael/C-9621-2009; Schymanski, Stanislaus/A-5303-2012","Roderick, Michael/0000-0002-3630-7739; Schymanski, Stanislaus/0000-0002-0950-2942","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021-113442]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120101676, CE11E0098]","This study was supported by Swiss National Science Foundation (S.J.S.: 200021-113442) and Australian Research Council (S.J.S.: DP120101676, M.L.R.: CE11E0098).",,57,10,10,4,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2015,7,,,,SI,,,,plv060,10.1093/aobpla/plv060,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CO0IR,WOS:000358834200001,26019228,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Jersakova, J; Traxmandlova, I; Ipser, Z; Kropf, M; Pellegrino, G; Schatz, B; Djordjevic, V; Kindlmann, P; Renner, SS",,,,"Jersakova, Jana; Traxmandlova, Iva; Ipser, Zdenek; Kropf, Matthias; Pellegrino, Giuseppe; Schatz, Bertrand; Djordjevic, Vladan; Kindlmann, Pavel; Renner, Susanne S.",,,Biological flora of Central Europe: Dactylorhiza sambucina (L.)

Soo is a polycarpic perennial herb occurring in the Central European, Eastern European, and Balkan floristic provinces. At the European scale, the IUCN considers it a species of ""least concern"". This paper reviews the taxonomic status, morphology, distribution, habitat requirements, mycorrhizal associations, and life cycle of D. sambucina, with special emphasis on its reproduction. We also summarize information on chromosome numbers and genetic variation. Our data from 12 years of monitoring D. sambucina in the Czech Republic show that three to four leaves have to be produced prior to flowering; plants with five and more leaves flower regularly. Juvenile plants near adult plants suggest recruitment from seeds. About 20% of our 450 monitored plants underwent dormancy (failure of mature plants to produce above-ground parts in one or more growing seasons), the maximum duration being eight years. After reappearance, these individuals were usually sterile for the next year. Mortality was highest (24%) at the seedling stage. Regarding the purple/yellow flower colour polymorphism that characterizes D. sambucina, we found no correlation between morph frequency and soil properties (pH, calcium content), population density, or altitude above sea level.

This labour-intensive process can limit sample throughput and therefore sampling intensity. We investigated the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on soil DNA extractions to determine live fine root DNA density (RDD, mg DNA m(-2)) for mango (Mangifera indica) trees. The specificity of the qPCR was tested against DNA extracted from 10 mango cultivars and 14 weed species. All mango cultivars and no weeds were detected. Mango DNA was successfully quantified from control soil spiked with mango roots and weed species. The DNA yield of mango root sections stored in moist soil at 23-28 degrees C declined after 15 days to low concentrations as roots decayed, indicating that dead root materials in moist soil would not cause false-positive results. To separate large roots from samples, a root separation method for field samples was used to target the root fragments remaining in sieved (minimum 2 mmaperture) soil for RDD comparisons. Using this method we compared the seasonal RDD values of fine roots for five mango rootstock cultivars in a field trial. The mean cultivar DNA yields by depth from root fragments in the sieved soil samples had the strongest relationship (adjusted multiple R-2 = 0.9307, P < 0.001) with the dry matter (g m(-2)) of fine (diameter <0.64 mm) roots removed from the soil by sieving. This method provides a species-specific and rapid means of comparing the distribution and concentration of live fine roots of trees in orchards using soil samples up to 500 g.","[Bithell, Sean L.; Tran-Nguyen, Lucy T.

However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species. Our study therefore identifies a symbiotic relationship as a potential mechanism facilitating the coexistence of two species, suggesting that symbiont effects on host niche may have community-level consequences.","[Kazenel, Melanie R.; Chung, Y.

We reviewed the information on the impacts of invasions on surface runoff and ground-water resources at stand to catchment scales and covering a full annual cycle. Most of the research is South African so the emphasis is on South Africa's major invaders with data from commercial forest plantations where relevant. Catchment studies worldwide have shown that changes in vegetation structure and the physiology of the dominant plant species result in changes in surface runoff and groundwater discharge, whether they involve native or alien plant species. Where there is little change in vegetation structure[ e.g. leaf area (index), height, rooting depth and seasonality] the effects of invasions generally are small or undetectable. In South Africa, the most important woody invaders typically are taller and deeper rooted than the native species. The impacts of changes in evaporation (and thus runoff) in dryland settings are constrained by water availability to the plants and, thus, by rainfall. Where the dryland invaders are evergreen and the native vegetation (grass) is seasonal, the increases can reach 300-400 mm/year. Where the native vegetation is evergreen (shrublands) the increases are similar to 200-300 mm/year. Where water availability is greater (riparian settings or shallow water tables), invading tree water-use can reach 1.5-2.0 times that of the same species in a dryland setting. So, riparian invasions have a much greater impact per unit area invaded than dryland invasions. The available data are scattered and incomplete, and there are many gaps and issues that must be addressed before a thorough understanding of the impacts at the site scale can be gained and used in extrapolating to watershed scales, and in converting changes in flows to water supply system yields.","[Le Maitre, D.

This is particularly true when models are applied to describe ecohydrology and vegetation function. However, there is yet limited knowledge of root distributions in semi-arid regions. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of fine roots for six typical afforestation tree species in Loess Plateau and its relationships with soil environmental factors. Area of study: Loess Plateau (NW of China). Material and methods: We quantified the fine root length density distribution of six typical afforestation tree species by soil core method, and the soil properties also were investigated. Main results: More than 50% of fine root length was concentrated at depths between 0 and 40 cm in vertical direction. In horizontal direction, most of fine roots concentrated near the trunk. Results showed a significant negative correlation between vertical distribution of FRLD and soil water content, a positive correlation between FRLD and organic matter and total N is significant, and a negative correlation with bulk density. No relationships were found with total C and particle size distribution in any soil layer for the six tree species.

This family is subject to a high risk of extinction in natural environments, such as natural parks and protected areas. Recent studies have shown the prevalence of many species of orchids to be linked to fungal soil diversity, due to their myco-heterotrophic behaviour. Plant communities determine fungal soil diversity, and both generate optimal conditions for orchid development. Area of study: The work was carried out in n the two most important natural parks in Alicante (Font Roja and Sierra Mariola), in South-eastern of Spain. Material and Methods: We designed a molecular tool to monitor the presence of Russula spp. in soil and orchids roots, combined with phytosociological methods. Main results: Using a PCR-based method, we detected the presence in the soil and Limodorum abortivum orchid roots of the mycorrhizal fungi Russula spp. The species with highest coverage was Quercus rotundifolia in areas where the orchid was present. Research highlights: We present a useful tool based on PCR to detect the presence of Russula spp. in a natural environment. These results are consistent with those obtained in different studies that linked the presence of the mycorrhizal fungi Russula spp. in roots of the species Limodorum and the interaction between these fungal species and Quercus ilex trees in Mediterranean forest environments.","[Larriba, Eduardo; Vicente Lopez-Llorca, Luis] Univ Alicante, Ramon Margalef Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, MIES, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Belda, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","Belda, A (reprint author), Univ Alicante, Dept Environm & Earth Sci, Aptdo 99, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",antonio.belda@ua.es,"Antoli, Antonio Belda/F-6427-2015; Llorca, Luis V.

In this type of environment, species called ""cushion plants"" can ameliorate the stressful conditions, acting as nurses for other plants. Of the several mechanisms proposed in the positive-interactions framework, plant-microorganism interaction may be one of the most common, but least documented. Here we show that the presence of endophytes isolated from the roots of cushion plants Laretia acaulis can play a fundamental role in the establishment, performance and survival of both native and exotic plant seedlings that are known to be facilitated by the cushion species. To test this, we measured survival and growth of two native and one invasive species at 3200 m in the Andes of Central Chile. Plants were grown inside artificial cushions filled with native soil, with or without sterilization, and with or without fungal endophytic inoculation to evaluate the role of fungal endophytes on survival and growth. In addition, we conducted a second experiment in a greenhouse with the invasive species to evaluate the effect of fungal endophytic infection/association on plant ecophysiological performance, dry biomass and seed output. Overall, our results showed a strong positive effect of fungal endophytes on the survival and growth of both native and invasive species, Moreover, maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), biomass accumulation and seed production were enhanced in the invasive species when soils were inoculated with endophytes. Thus, facilitation by root endophytic fungi on native and invasive alpine plants could determine survival and establishment in this harsh environment. Several studies have shown that direct facilitation by cushion plants in alpine environments improves the performance and fitness of both native and exotic plants. Our results suggest that there are indirect effects, mediated by microorganism associations that may also help to explain the successful establishment of native and invasive species in these environments. If indirect plant-plant facilitation through root fungal endophytes proves to be a widespread phenomenon in alpine ecosystems, it could be a key component in the structuring of plant communities in those stressful environments.

However, little is known about how biotic plant soil interactions influence the local dominance and abundance of plant species and whether specific taxonomic or functional groups of plants are differentially affected by such biotic soil-effects. In two greenhouse experiments, we tested the biotic soil-effects of 33 grassland species differing in individual size and local abundance. We hypothesized that large plants that are not locally dominant (despite their size-related competitive advantage enabling them to potentially outshade competitors) are most strongly limited by negative biotic soil-effects. We sampled soils at the opposite ends of a gradient in land-use intensity in temperate grasslands to account for putative modulating effects of land-use intensity on biotic soil-effects. As hypothesized, large, but non-dominant species (especially grasses) experienced more negative biotic soil-effects compared with small and abundant plant species. Land-use intensity had contrasting effects on grasses and herbs resulting in more negative biotic soil-effects for grasses in less intensively managed grasslands. We conclude that biotic soil-effects contribute to the control of potentially dominant plants and hence enable species coexistence and biodiversity especially in species-rich less intensively managed grasslands.

Evaluation of insoluble mineral solubilization activities of endophytic fungi revealed P. sclerotiorum as most efficient phosphate solubilizer (215.98 +/- 0.2 mu g/ml), A. niger as the highest potassium solubilizer (solubilization index 1.7 4 +/- 0.2) and P. sclerotiorum as the most efficient zinc solubilizer. It was also observed that plant growth promoting activities of the fungal endophytes increased up to a certain period of incubation and thereafter it decreased.

Hence, we studied the response of sandal seedlings to inoculation with cultures of three selected species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), subjected to four shade levels and two host species. The results showed an increase in seedling height, number of leaves, leaf area and shoot weight of sandal seedlings due to AMF inoculation, especially in those inoculated with Glomus mosseae. During initial phases of seedling growth, high shade (75%) was essential but in later stages 50% shade was better. Interactions between 50% shade and mycorrhizae were the best especially for seedlings inoculated with G. mosseae (average root colonisation 68%). Relative water content of inoculated seedlings grown under 50% shade was the best (89.5%). Sandal-AMF association had improved the growth of sandal seedlings.","[Binu, N. K.; Ashokan, P.

The role of novel ecological interactions between mammals, fungi and plants in invaded ecosystems remains unresolved, but may play a key role in the widespread successful invasion of pines and their ectomycorrhizal fungal associates, even where mammal faunas originate from different continents to trees and fungi as in New Zealand. 2. We examine the role of novel mammal associations in dispersal of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum of North American pines (Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii), and native beech trees (Lophozonia menziesii) using faecal analyses, video monitoring and a bioassay experiment. 3. Both European red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) pellets contained spores and DNA from a range of native and non-native ectomycorrhizal fungi. 4. Faecal pellets from both animals resulted in ectomycorrhizal infection of pine seedlings with fungal genera Rhizopogon and Suillus, but not with native fungi or the invasive fungus Amanita muscaria, despite video and DNA evidence of consumption of these fungi. 5. Native L. menziesii seedlings never developed any ectomycorrhizal infection from faecal pellet inoculation. 6. Synthesis. Our results show that introduced mammals from Australia and Europe facilitate the co-invasion of invasive North American trees and Northern Hemisphere fungi in New Zealand, while we find no evidence that introduced mammals benefit native trees or fungi. This novel tripartite 'invasional meltdown', comprising taxa from three kingdoms and three continents, highlights unforeseen consequences of global biotic homogenization.","[Wood, Jamie R.; Dickie, Ian A.; Peltzer, Duane A.; Bonner, Karen I.; Rattray, Gaye; Wilmshurst, Janet M.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dickie, Ian A.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Moeller, Holly V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wilmshurst, Janet M.] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1142, New Zealand","Wood, JR (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",woodj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wood, Jamie/A-9393-2008; Wilmshurst, Janet/C-2209-2009; Peltzer, Duane A/A-9463-2009; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013; Wilmshurst, Janet/O-8611-2019","Wood, Jamie/0000-0001-8008-6083; Wilmshurst, Janet/0000-0002-4474-8569; Peltzer, Duane A/0000-0001-7724-3738; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Wilmshurst, Janet/0000-0002-4474-8569; Moeller, Holly/0000-0002-9335-0039","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","We thank Duckchul Park, Kat Trought and Nicola Bolstridge for laboratory assistance and Nic Rawlence and Maria Zammit for field assistance, Rob Allen for providing infrared video cameras and Christine Bezar for manuscript editing.

Genetic variation for functionally important traits is ubiquitous in communities of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, and while some studies have described significant effects of diversity on the functioning of plant-associated microbial communities, we lack a systematic test of how rhizobial diversity influences plant productivity. 2. The complexity of potential interactions among rhizobia and plants complicates the development of general predictions regarding causal relationships between rhizobial diversity and plant productivity. For example, while rhizobial complementarity may result in positive associations between symbiont diversity and plant productivity, antagonistic competition may reduce rhizobial community function. 3. Using two widespread native Australian Acacia species (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and experimental rhizobial communities derived from 16 bacterial genotypes naturally associated with these hosts, we examined how the provision of mutualistic benefit varies with rhizobial identity, diversity and phylogenetic relatedness. 4. Analysis of plant performance in relation to rhizobial genotypic richness revealed that the presence of multiple rhizobial genotypes in the rhizosphere was associated with a general decrease in plant productivity compared to growth with single rhizobial genotypes. Importantly, these results appear to be robust in the face of variation in host identity and host diversity (i.e. one or two species mixtures). We also found that rhizobial genotypic identity and host species significantly influenced plant productivity in Acacia-rhizobia interactions, both in single-and multistrain inoculations. 5. Synthesis. Together, our data show that multiple rhizobia interacting with a single host species creates opportunities for emergent or higher-order effects that extend beyond those that could be simply predicted based upon outcomes of pairwise interactions and that increased mutualist diversity does not necessarily translate into positive effects on plant growth.","[Barrett, Luke G.; Bissett, Andrew; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Bever, James D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Barrett, LG (reprint author), CSIRO Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",luke.barrett@csiro.au,"Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP1097256],"Technical assistance for the glasshouse and laboratory studies was provided by C.

In this study, we sequenced the complete mtDNA of Rhizophagus sp. DAOM 213198, a close relative to Rhizophagus irregularis, a widespread, ecologically and economical relevant species belonging to Glomeromycota. Unlike all other known taxonomically close relatives harboring a full-length circular chromosome, mtDNA of Rhizophagus sp. reveals an unusual organization with two circular chromosomes of 61,964 and 29,078 bp. The large chromosome contained nine protein-coding genes (atp9, nad5, cob, nad4, nad1, nad4L, cox1, cox2, and atp8), small subunit rRNA gene (rns), and harbored 20 tRNA-coding genes and 10 orfs, while the small chromosome contained five protein-coding genes (atp6, nad2, nad3, nad6, and cox3), large subunit rRNA gene (rnl) in addition to 5 tRNA-coding genes, and 8 plasmid-related DNA polymerases (dpo). Although structural variation of plant mt genomes is well documented, this study is the first report of the presence of two circular mt genomes in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Interestingly, the presence of dpo at the breakage point in intergenes cox1-cox2 and rnl-atp6 for large and small mtDNAs, respectively, could be responsible for the conversion of Rhizophagus sp. mtDNA into two chromosomes. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that both mtDNAs have an equal abundance. This study reports a novel mtDNA organization in Glomeromycota and highlights the importance of studying early divergent fungal lineages to describe novel evolutionary pathways in the fungal kingdom.","[Nadimi, Maryam; Stefani, Franck O.

Conversely, their mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) have appeared to be homogeneous within isolates in all next generation sequencing (NGS)-based studies. Although several lines of evidence have challenged mtDNA homogeneity in AMF, extensive survey to investigate intraisolate allelic diversity has not previously been undertaken. In this study, we used a conventional polymerase chain reaction -based approach on selected mitochondrial regions with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase, followed by cloning and Sanger sequencing. Two isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis were used, one cultivated in vitro for several generations (DAOM-197198) and the other recently isolated from the field (DAOM-242422). At different loci in both isolates, we found intraisolate allelic variation within the mtDNA and in a single copy nuclear marker, which highlighted the presence of several nonsynonymous mutations in protein coding genes. We confirmed that some of this variation persisted in the transcriptome, giving rise to at least four distinct nad4 transcripts in DAOM-197198. We also detected the presence of numerous mitochondrial DNA copies within nuclear genomes (numts), providing insights to understand this important evolutionary process in AMF. Our study reveals that genetic variation in Glomeromycota is higher than what had been previously assumed and also suggests that it could have been grossly underestimated in most NGS-based AMF studies, both in mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, due to the presence of low-level mutations.","[Beaudet, Denis; de la Providencia, Ivan Enrique; Labridy, Manuel; Roy-Bolduc, Alice; Daubois, Laurence; Hijri, Mohamed] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada","Hijri, M (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, 4101 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.",mohamed.hijri@umontreal.ca,,"Hijri, Mohamed/0000-0001-6112-8372",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [328098-2012]; Genome CanadaGenome Canada; Genome Quebec,"This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) discovery grant to M.H.

We also extend previous analyses by calculating individual energy use (E) and test whether its bivariate and trivariate relationships with S and R are in agreement with expectations derived from the energetic equivalence rule. Carnivorous and scavenger species representing over 95% of sample abundance and biomass were studied. For each individual, body size (g) was measured and E was estimated following published allometric relationships. Data for each sample were tabulated into exponential body size bins, comparing species-averaged values with individual-based estimates which allow species to potentially occupy multiple size classes. For individual-based data, both the number of individuals and species across body size classes are fit by a Weibull function rather than by a power law scaling. Species richness is also a power law of the number of individuals. Energy use shows a piecewise scaling relationship with body size, with energetic equivalence holding true only for size classes above the modal abundance class. Species-based data showed either weak linear or no significant patterns, likely due to the decrease in the number of data points across body size classes. Hence, for individual-based size spectra, the SRA relationship seems to be general despite seasonal forcing and strong disturbances in Coliumo Bay. The unimodal abundance distribution results in a piecewise energy scaling relationship, with small individuals showing a positive scaling and large individuals showing energetic equivalence. Hence, strict energetic equivalence should not be expected for unimodal abundance distributions. On the other hand, while species-based data do not show unimodal SRA relationships, energy use across body size classes did not show significant trends, supporting energetic equivalence.","[Labra, Fabio A.] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest & Innovac Cambio Climat, Santiago 8370003, Chile; [Hernandez-Miranda, Eduardo; Quinones, Renato A.] Univ Concepcion, Programa Invest Marina Excelencia PIMEX, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile; [Hernandez-Miranda, Eduardo; Quinones, Renato A.] Univ Concepcion, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Concepcion, Chile","Hernandez-Miranda, E (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",eduhernandez@udec.cl,,,Programa de Investigacion Marina de Excelencia (PIMEX); Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR),Programa de Investigacion Marina de Excelencia (PIMEX) and Interdisciplinary Center for Aquaculture Research (INCAR).,,54,1,1,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The AMF colonization rate of T. ramosissima was determined as well as the water content, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), water-soluble cations, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus of the collected soil. AMF colonization was low at each site (2.4-12.3 %), and a low level of colonization (2.4 %) was even observed in high-salinity areas with a surface soil EC of 14.4 ds m(-1). AMF colonization increased with soil EC at low to medium soil salinity levels (0.4-4.3 dS m(-1)), but it decreased at high salinity levels (> 7 dS m(-1)).

A useful option to aid in the restoration of invaded areas after acacia removal is the revegetation of the newly open areas using appropriate native dune plants. A field experiment was performed to determine whether two shrubby legumes native to European Atlantic coastal dunes, Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC. and Ulex europaeus europaeus subsp. latebracteatus (Mariz) Rothm., are suitable to revegetate areas formerly invaded by A. longifolia. Plants of both species were grown for 5 months in a greenhouse and subsequently transplanted to three sites in a coastal dune ecosystem. We monitored survival and growth during 21 months. The effect of soil fertility at the nursery and of root nodulation on the performance of these species in the field was also analyzed. Soil fertility and nodulation had a significant effect on plant growth at the nursery, but only the symbiosis with root nodulating bacteria had a significant positive effect on the survival of both native legumes in the field and on final plant height of U. europaeus plants. We conclude that (1) both native legumes can successfully establish on sites where A. longifolia has been previously removed, thus providing a suitable tool to help in the restoration of invaded areas, and (2) the symbiosis with root nodulating bacteria is crucial for plant performance in the field.","[Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana; Crisostomo, Joao A.; Nabais, Cristina] Univ Coimbra, Dept Ciencias Vida, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Roiloa, Sergio R.] Univ A Coruna, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vexetal & Ecol, Fac Ciencias, Grp BioCost, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [de la Pena, Eduardo] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [de la Pena, Eduardo] Univ Malaga, Inst Hortofruticultura Subtrop & Mediterranea La, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Algarrobo Costa 29750, Malaga, Spain","Rodriguez-Echeverria, S (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Ciencias Vida, Ctr Funct Ecol, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.",susanare@ci.uc.pt,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/I-1730-2015; Crisostomo, Joao/E-1910-2016; de la Pena, Eduardo/B-8037-2015; Roiloa, Sergio/E-7739-2018","Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana/0000-0002-2058-3229; Crisostomo, Joao/0000-0001-7939-3553; de la Pena, Eduardo/0000-0002-6057-6664; Roiloa, Sergio/0000-0002-1838-9566",project ROBIN - European Union [POCI/BIA-BDE/56941/2004]; project MUTUALNET - European Union [PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [SFRH/BPD/79599/2011]; European Social Fund of the European Union; FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [IF/00462/2013]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF),"This work was supported by the projects ROBIN (POCI/BIA-BDE/56941/2004) and MUTUALNET (PTDC/BIA-BEC/103507/2008), both funded by the European Union and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

In six seashore mallow plantations, its well-developed perennial root system promoted the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus in the rhizosphere, where the fungus's activity produced total glomalin (TG, ranging from 0.85 to 2.43 mg g(-1) soil), with a high ratio of TG/SOC (soil organic carbon) up to 53.29% in six-year-old seashore mallow plantation. K. virginica ameliorated the condition of saline soils, promoted native species growth, and increased plant diversity in the plantation sites. Seashore mallow contains many bioactive compounds, e.g., polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids, etc. which have high bioactivity, and could be used as a fodder additive or for the development of health foods. The leaf, flower, stem and root of K. virginica, serve as raw materials for hierachical development of useful products according to their different properties. This study reviews and summarizes research on K. virginica in China during the past 20 years since its introduction from the USA. Also, we present guidelines for the planting and use of seashore mallow in China, in terms of an ecological engineering roadmap, which illustrates the process and strategy for the restoration of saline soils and designs for biomass industries based on its production.

Ecological characteristics of the species were considered, including tolerance to climate change. Inventories of shrubs were carried out in 17 semiarid shrubland fragments of xeric shrubland. The 46 species recorded were ordered using a principal component analysis, considering ecological characteristics such as frequency, land cover, sociability and interaction with mycorrhizal fungi. From these, the 10 species that presented the highest values of the desired characteristics were selected. The response of these species to climate change was evaluated using current potential distribution models and by applying climate change scenario A2, using MaxEnt. The species that presented suitable ecological qualities for restoration and maintained or increased their distribution under the climate change scenario were Acacia sthaffneri,Ageratina espinosarum, Bursera fagaroides, Dalea bicolor, Eysenhardtia polystachya and Karwinskia humboldtiana.

In the present work the tolerance to salinity of rhizobia, isolated from locations with contrasting climatic conditions, and the potential of strains to fix nitrogen symbiotically under saline conditions were investigated. Since plasmids may encode key genes related to growth and survival under environmental stress conditions, which will reflect on protein synthesis, both the plasmid and protein profiles were analyzed. A multivariate statistical approach related salt tolerance to the origin of the isolates, identifying rainfall and water availability as a possible factor explaining the differences in salt tolerance displayed by rhizobia isolates. The classification analysis allowed the subdivision of isolates in terms of salt tolerance into extremely sensitive (a parts per thousand currency sign0.15 %), sensitive (0.15-0.6 %), moderately tolerant (0.9-1.5 %), tolerant (2.1-3.6 %) and extremely tolerant (a parts per thousand yen5.4 %). Taken all together it was shown that plasmids are involved in salt tolerance and that the impact of salinity on the protein profile and nitrogen fixation varied according to the salt tolerance of the strains, evidencing the susceptibility of rhizobial communities to changes in rainfall regimes.","[Cardoso, Paulo; Freitas, Rosa; Figueira, Etelvina] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Freitas, Rosa; Figueira, Etelvina] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Figueira, E (reprint author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",pjcardoso@ua.pt; rosafreitas@ua.pt; efigueira@ua.pt,"Freitas, Rosa F/A-7539-2012; Figueira, Etelvina/M-6116-2013; Cardoso, Paulo/V-5260-2018","Freitas, Rosa F/0000-0003-4900-3897; Figueira, Etelvina/0000-0002-6763-2665; Cardoso, Paulo/0000-0002-1234-5861",,,,31,2,2,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0963-9292,1573-3017,,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Ecotoxicology,JAN,2015,24,1,,,,,143,152,,10.1007/s10646-014-1366-8,,,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,AY6RK,WOS:000347693100013,25318616,,,,10/31/19J,"Bartczak, A",,,,"Bartczak, Anna",,,The role of social and environmental attitudes in non-market valuation An application to the Bialowieza Forest,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Altruism; Choice experiment; Forest naturalness; Environmental attitudes; Number of visitors; WTP space model,REPORT ALTRUISM SCALE; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGICAL PARADIGM; CONTINGENT VALUES; PREFERENCES; HETEROGENEITY; PERSONALITY; BELIEFS,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of non-economic motivations such as altruism and environmental concerns on social preferences and hence willingness to pay (WTP) for changes in forest management strategies in the Bialowieza Forest in Poland. We used data from a discrete choice experiment (CE) with attributes describing changes in the quality of the forest and recreation. The choice experiment technique makes it possible to disentangle the effect of the trait of altruism and environmental concern with regard to different attributes and their levels. Environmental attitudes were measured using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, whereas the trait of altruism was determined using the Self-Reported Altruism (SRA) scale. The parameterization employed in the survey was a WTP space model. Results show that both altruism and environmental concerns have significant effects on the amount people are willing to pay for changes in forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To test the two hypothesized mechanisms, we selected plots near large L. maackii shrubs and control plots away from any large L. maackii shrubs in the forest understory. Within each plot we placed a trenched and an untrenched subplot and measured soil water content in each. We also measured precipitation above and below L. maackii canopies. We found that within 2 m of large L. maackii shrubs, this shrub accounted for a large fraction (22-25%) of the fine roots in the top 12 cm of soil. Reduced throughfall and soil moisture below shrubs supported the hypothesis that L. maackii competes with tree seedlings by interception. Findings were inconclusive regarding the hypothesis of competition by water uptake.","[Pfeiffer, Steven S.; Gorchov, David L.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Gorchov, DL (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",GorchoDL@miamioh.edu,,,Miami University Department of Botany; Academic Challenge Grant,"Dr. A.

Native-naturalized rhizobia strains present in soil are the basis for selecting and developing new inoculants. With this aim, we evaluated the diversity of red clover rhizobia in Uruguayan red clover pastures both historically inoculated with U204 and non-inoculated ones. Thirty-eight different enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR genomic fingerprints were identified, albeit surprisingly only one of 80 isolates showed an ERIC profile similar to U204. Under controlled conditions, red clover plants inoculated with one of the native isolates, strain 317, produced more biomass than those inoculated with the commercial U204. ERIC-PCR was also used to show that strain 317 competed for nodulation better than U204 in a field with previous history of inoculation. Moreover, both U204 and 317 were tagged with a gusA reporter gene and their competitiveness for nodulation assessed in various soil types. Again, strain 317 appeared more competitive than U204, particularly in soils with previous history of inoculation. Our results reinforce the long-known idea of assessing the actual needs of inoculation of legumes in different soils and suggest that the indigenous isolate 317 is an effective and competitive strain that can be used for development of a new red clover inoculant.","[Batista, Leticia; Irisarri, Pilar; Monza, Jorge] Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Lab Bioquim, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay; [Sanjuan, Juan] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Rebuffo, Monica; Jose Cuitino, Maria] INIA La Estanzuela, Inst Nacl Invest Agr, Colonia, Uruguay","Irisarri, P (reprint author), Univ Republica, Fac Agron, Lab Bioquim, Av Garzon 809, Montevideo 12900, Uruguay.",irisarri@fagro.edu.uy,,"Irisarri, Pilar/0000-0003-2824-5977; Sanjuan, Juan/0000-0002-6404-8754",FONTAGRO [FTG-787/2005]; European LOTASSA project [FP6-2005-INCO-DEV2-517617]; ANII (Magister grant),"Authors are grateful to the funding of grants from FONTAGRO FTG-787/2005 (LESIS), the European LOTASSA project (FP6-2005-INCO-DEV2-517617), and ANII (Magister grant for L.

Tree skeleton data were linked to the respective needle area, and as such, this work provides the background framework for modeling the tree hydraulic architecture and the carbon balance of the forest stand. Using validated allometric equations, we were able to calculate the amount of the volume, of the biomass and of the corresponding surface areas of individual trees in the stand. Total woody biomass of the 66-year-old forest stand was 155 Mg ha(-1), i.e., 126 Mg ha(-1) above ground and 29 Mg ha(-1) below ground. The total bio-volume of the woody mass of the stand was 314 m(3) ha(-1). The highest fraction of this value was the stem bio-volume, i.e., 236 m(3) ha(-1) or 75 % of the total. The total volume of all roots was 57 m(3) ha(-1) (18 % of the total volume), and the volume of branches was 20 m(3) ha(-1) (7 % of the total volume). The surface area of the roots ranged from 38,000 m(2) ha(-1) in the winter to 68,000 m(2) ha(-1) in the spring. The surface area of the stems was 2,700 m(2) ha(-1), and the surface area of all branches reached 4,400 m(2) ha(-1). The total above-ground water storage in the xylem was 94 m(3) ha(-1) (or 9.4 mm), while the accessible stored water was 2 mm of that quantity. A comparative analysis of the biometric parameters showed the balance between the different functionally connected, operational surface areas of the trees. The needle surface area was similar to the root surface area and in the same order of magnitude as the surface area of woody cambium. The results allow to link water uptake with transpiration and assimilation with respiration.","[Urban, J.; Cermak, J.] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Ceulemans, R.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Urban, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",josef.urban@email.cz; cermak@mendelu.cz,"Urban, Josef/A-8754-2013; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","Urban, Josef/0000-0003-1730-947X; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358",Sixth Framework Programme of the European Commission as Carbo-Europe IPEuropean Union (EU) [GOCE-CT-2003-505572]; Flemish-Czech Bilateral Scientific Cooperation project [UA-BOF-1-2006-19]; COST MSMT [LD13017]; Investments in Education Development [OPVK CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0017]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); state budget of the Czech Republic,"We thank I.

However, field surveys linking plant community structure with belowground fungal communities are missing. We investigated whether a selected number of abundant and relatively rare plants, either native or exotic, from an old-field site associate with different fungal communities. We also assessed whether these plants showed different symbiotic relationships with soil biota through their roots. We characterized the plant community and collected roots to investigate fungal communities using 454 pyrosequencing and assessed arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and enemy-induced lesions. Differences in fungal communities were considered based on the assessment of alpha- and beta diversity depending on plant 'abundance' and 'origin'. Plant abundance and origin determined the fungal community. Fungal richness was higher for native abundant as opposed to relatively rare native plant species. However, this was not observed for exotics of contrasting abundance. Regardless of their origin, beta diversity was higher for rare than for abundant species. Abundant exotics in the community, which happen to be grasses, were the least mycorrhizal whereas rare natives were most susceptible to enemy attack. Our results suggest that compared with exotics, the relative abundance of remnant native plant species in our old-field site is still linked to the structure of belowground fungal communities. In contrast, exotic species may act as a disturbing agent contributing towards the homogenization of soil fungal communities, potentially changing feedback interactions.","[Reininger, Vanessa; Martinez-Garcia, Laura B.; Sanderson, Laura; Antunes, Pedro M.] Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada; [Reininger, Vanessa] Agroscope, Inst Plant Prod Sci IPS, Schloss 1, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Reininger, Vanessa] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol Forest Pathol & Dendrol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Martinez-Garcia, Laura B.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Reininger, V (reprint author), Algoma Univ, Dept Biol, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2G4, Canada.; Reininger, V (reprint author), Agroscope, Inst Plant Prod Sci IPS, Schloss 1, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.; Reininger, V (reprint author), ETH, Inst Integrat Biol Forest Pathol & Dendrol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Vanessa.Reininger@env.ethz.ch,"Reininger, Vanessa/F-7014-2011",,Research Chair from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This study was funded by a Research Chair from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant awarded to P.M.A.,,74,5,5,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2015,7,,,,,,,,plv110,10.1093/aobpla/plv110,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DC2DK,WOS:000369027200001,26371291,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Wang, JQ; Bertness, MD; Li, B; Chen, JK; Lu, WG",,,,"Wang, Jin-qing; Bertness, Mark D.; Li, Bo; Chen, Jia-kuan; Lu, Wei-guang",,,Plant effects on burrowing crab morphology in a Chinese salt marsh: Native vs. exotic plants,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Helice tridens tientsinensis; Phragmites australis; Salt marshes; Sesarma dehaani; Spartina alterniflora; Uca arcuata,"UCA-ANNULIPES EDWARDS,H.MILNE; FIDDLER-CRAB; CHASMAGNATHUS-GRANULATA; BIOTURBATIVE ACTIVITIES; MANGROVE CRABS; RIVER ESTUARY; TIDAL FLAT; SEDIMENT; SPARTINA; DECAPODA","Burrowing crabs are conspicuous components of many salt marshes yet factors influencing burrow morphology have received little attention. We studied the effects of marsh plants on crab burrows and found significant variation of crab burrow morphology along a successional gradient from mudflat to vegetated marshes (either exotic Spartina alterniflora or native Phragmites australis marsh). Mudflat soil had lower water content, but higher bulk density than vegetated marshes. Burrows in vegetated marshes had more openings and branching and higher width-depth ratios, but smaller openings and lower depth, length, and total volume than on mudflats. S. alterniflora marshes had less rhizome biomass, but higher fine root biomass than P. australis marshes found at higher elevations, and burrows in S. alterniflora marshes were shallower, shorter, had smaller volumes, but had larger surface openings than P. australis marshes. Young S. alterniflora marshes had higher aboveground biomass, but lower stem density, rhizome and fine root biomass, and burrows were deeper, longer, and larger than in old S. alterniflora marshes. These data suggest that plant properties influence burrow morphologies and that burrow morphologies change during salt marsh succession due to changing root distributions and soil properties.

These were compared with the observed growth of sample P. jezoensis trees at the site. According to weather data and model calculations, the P. jezoensis stand at Mt. Gyebang was exposed to significant climate variations affecting growing season, carbon balance, and water balance. Although the length of growing season showed an increasing trend over time, the observed growth of P. jezoensis was unaffected by the length of growing season. Probably due to the site's shallow soil depths and species' shallow rooting depth, the modelled increase in productivity caused by climate variation was not manifested in an increase in growth of P. jezoensis.

The highest total biomass density (TBD) and total carbon density (TCD) were estimated at site III in the altitudinal range of 1800-2600 m as 108.26 and 53.45 Mg.ha(-1) followed by site II in the range of 1600-1800 m as 83.92 and 41.96 Mg.ha(-1), and the least at site I in the altitudinal range of 1000-1400 m as 57.22 and 28.61 Mg.ha(-1) with an average of 83.13 and 41.56 Mg.ha(-1), respectively. The study found average TBD and TCD of the BRF are 23% more when compared to forests located in the same ecoregion due to difference in diameter at breast height and height of tree species. It also found that the C stock increases with increasing altitude due to fine root area, fine root length growth, and decreasing temperature. The BRF was found to have 16.65 million tons of forest organic C stocks in the year 2014. Accordingly, the C transported to the reservoir from the catchment undergoes aerobic/anaerobic degradation to release greenhouse gases to atmosphere. The study also reveals that oak, devdar, and fir have greater C sequestration capacity compared to other species found in BRF.","[Kumar, Amit; Sharma, M.

We hypothesized that tropical plant species with different mycorrhizal associations reduce competition for soil phosphorus (P) by specializing to exploit different soil organic P compounds. We assayed the activity of root/mycorrhizal phosphatase enzymes of four tree species with contrasting root symbiotic relationships - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) (angiosperm and conifer), ectomycorrhizal (EM) and non-mycorrhizal - collected from one of three soil sites within a montane tropical forest. We also measured growth and foliar P of these seedlings in an experiment with P provided exclusively as inorganic orthophosphate, a simple phosphomonoester (glucose phosphate), a phosphodiester (RNA), phytate (the sodium salt of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) or a no-P control. The EM tree species expressed twice the phosphomonoesterase activity as the AM tree species, but had similar phosphodiesterase activity. The non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree had markedly greater activity of both enzymes than the mycorrhizal tree species, with root clusters expressing greater phosphomonoesterase activity than fine roots. Both the mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal tree species contained significantly greater foliar P than in no-P controls when limited to inorganic phosphate, glucose phosphate and RNA. The EM species did not perform better than the AM tree species when limited to organic P in any form. In contrast, the non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae tree was the only species capable of exploiting phytate, with nearly three times the leaf area and more than twice the foliar P of the no-P control. Our results suggest that AM and EM tree species exploit similar forms of P, despite differences in phosphomonoesterase activity. In contrast, the mycorrhizal tree species and non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae appear to differ in their ability to exploit phytate. We conclude that resource partitioning of soil P plays a coarse but potentially ecologically important role in fostering the coexistence of tree species in tropical montane forests.","[Steidinger, Brian S.] Indiana Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Turner, Benjamin L.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Corrales, Adrianna; Dalling, James W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Steidinger, BS (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bsteidi2@gmail.com,"Turner, Benjamin L/E-5940-2011; Corrales, Adriana/P-2413-2018","Turner, Benjamin L/0000-0002-6585-0722; Corrales, Adriana/0000-0001-9885-4634",Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; ENEL Fortuna; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Government of Panama SENACYT fund [COLO08-003],"We thank Arturo Morris, Carlos Espinoza, Tania Romero, Kelly Andersen, Mike O'Mara, and McKenna Kelly for their contributions.

So, I respond four main answers about AMF, their biological characteristics, how AMF colonize the plant roots, and finally I describe their molecular characteristics. Basically, AMF are obligate root symbionts that establish a mutualistic symbiosis with several plants and have key role in increasing plant growth, resistance, and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. They are incapable of independent growth (in nature or axenic culture) without host plants and their main structures are: arbuscules, vesicles, auxiliary cells, hyphae and spores. Root colonization is mediated by genetic, morphological and functional interactions between partners of the symbiosis that begins even before the physical contact between the host-plant and AMF species. For their molecular characteristic we can explain that they have a large variation in their genome (varying greatly between species). For example, Rhizophagus intraradices has a small genome, close to 16.54 Mb (of which 88.36 % are single copy DNA, 1.59 % are repetitive sequences and 10.05 % foldback DNA), while other species, like Scutellospora pellucida and Racocetra gregaria have genomes with much larger size may vary 127.4 Mb in the 1058.4 Mb respectively.","[Souza, Tancredo] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil","Souza, T (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil.",,,"Souza, Tancredo/0000-0001-8729-5478",,,,39,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-24850-9; 978-3-319-24848-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1,8,,10.1007/978-3-319-24850-9_1,,,8,Ecology; Mycology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mycology,BJ9KI,WOS:000429434400003,,,,,10/31/19B,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, S","Souza, T",,,"Rodriguez-Echeverria, Susana","Souza, T",,Handbook of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Foreword,HANDBOOK OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,,English,Editorial Material; Book Chapter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-24850-9; 978-3-319-24848-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,VII,VII,,,,,1,Ecology; Mycology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mycology,BJ9KI,WOS:000429434400001,,,,,10/31/19B,"Souza, T","Souza, T",,,"Souza, Tancredo","Souza, T",,Handbook of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Preface,HANDBOOK OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,,English,Editorial Material; Book Chapter,,,,,,,,,"[Souza, Tancredo] Univ Fed Paraiba, Esperanca, PB, Brazil","Souza, T (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Esperanca, PB, Brazil.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-24850-9; 978-3-319-24848-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,IX,IX,,,,,1,Ecology; Mycology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mycology,BJ9KI,WOS:000429434400002,,,,,10/31/19B,"Souza, T","Souza, T",,,"Souza, Tancredo","Souza, T",,An Old Relationship,HANDBOOK OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,Murocales; Endogonales; Glomales; Glomeromycota,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LA-GRAN-SABANA; SP-NOV; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS; ACAULOSPORA ENDOGONACEAE; WEST-VIRGINIA; NATIONAL-PARK; SP.

So, to explain the evolutionary history of AMF and the several proposed AMF classifications between 1800 and the present day, I divided this long period in six phases. Phase I (1800-1900)-Characterized for the first AMF taxonomy classification, and the first description of genus Glomus, Rhizophagus and Sclerocystis. Phase II (1901-1975)-this phase was characterized for two important events: Genus Geosiphon was proposed, and important keys to identify Endogonaceae species were proposed. Phase III (1976-1990)-This phase was characterized: the standardized terminology about concepts of spore wall characteristics and murographs, and the new classifi cation proposed by Morton and Benny in 1990. Phase IV (1991-2000)-In this phase, the first PCR primer (VANS1) to perform molecular analysis was developed. Phase V (2001-2010)-The most important event of this phase was the study done Schussler and co-workers in 2001, where they proposed a new monophyletic phylum for AMF. They transferred all AMF species from Zygomycota to Glomeromycota, and their study was base for other studies until 2009. Phase VI (2011-present day)-This phase is characterized by two important works: (1) the new phylogenetic data for systematics and phylotaxonomy of AMF proposed by Kruger and co-workers in 2012, and the new classification of Glomeromycota proposed by Redecker and co-workers in 2013.","[Souza, Tancredo] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil","Souza, T (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil.",,,"Souza, Tancredo/0000-0001-8729-5478",,,,175,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-24850-9; 978-3-319-24848-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,9,41,,10.1007/978-3-319-24850-9_2,,,33,Ecology; Mycology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mycology,BJ9KI,WOS:000429434400004,,,,,10/31/19B,"Souza, T","Souza, T",,,"Souza, Tancredo","Souza, T",,Spores: A Special Tool to Survive,HANDBOOK OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,Glomeromycota spores; Acaulosporoid spores; Entrophosporoid spores; Gigasporoid spores; Glomoid spores; Radial-glomoid spores,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TAXONOMIC CONCEPTS; SCLEROCYSTIS GLOMACEAE; ENDOGONACEAE; GLOMEROMYCOTA; GLOMALES; SCUTELLOSPORA; ACAULOSPORA; REVISION; GENUS,"I discuss in this chapter all spore characteristics, structures and functions. AMF spores are composed by several walls, and each wall has its own function and characteristics to help AMF to survive. Each spore produces one outer wall, which is originated from the fertile hypha on which the spore is borne. Within it a number of layers between one and three layers (although rarely more than three) are synthesized. Usually, these layers are numbered from outermost to innermost (L1, L2, L3, etc.). Spores also produce an inner wall that is described as a flexible germinal wall composed by two bilayered walls groups (Gw1 and Gw2). Sometimes, AMF spores produces different structures, such as subtending hypha, sporiferous saccule, sporogenous cell, pre-germination structures, peridium, cicatrix, or pedicel. These structures are unique, and just occur in same AMF genus, such as Acaulospora, Ambispora, Claroideoglomus, Diversispora, Funneliformis, Glomus, Paraglomus, Rhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Septoglomus.","[Souza, Tancredo] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil","Souza, T (reprint author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Soil, Esperanca, Paraiba, Brazil.",,,"Souza, Tancredo/0000-0001-8729-5478",,,,40,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-24850-9; 978-3-319-24848-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,65,86,,10.1007/978-3-319-24850-9_4,,,22,Ecology; Mycology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mycology,BJ9KI,WOS:000429434400006,,,,,10/31/19B,"Souza, T","Souza, T",,,"Souza, Tancredo","Souza, T",,Glomeromycota Classification,HANDBOOK OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,Glomeromycota; Archaeosporales; Diversisporales; Glomerales; Paraglomerales,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; SP.

Historically, mutualisms have been considered to be less important than antagonisms in affecting the composition of ecological communities. In plant communities, beneficial microbes may feature as keystone mutualists in structuring community composition. Understanding the direction and magnitude of mutualist effects at the community scale may be critical for making accurate predictions on plant responses to climate change, particularly for mutualists that ameliorate climate-induced stressors. Such mitigation could shift outcomes between mutualist-enhanced species diversity and mutualist-reduced diversity, depending on whether a mutualist accelerates habitat modification or competitive exclusion by its partner species. 2. Here, we tested the relative importance and interactive effects of altered precipitation and symbiosis between an epichloid fungal endophyte and a dominant grass species for dune plant communities along the Great Lakes, USA. In 2010, we imposed field manipulations of endophyte presence in the foundation dune grass Ammophila breviligulata in combination with rainout shelters and rainfall additions. We monitored natural rates of colonization by new plant individuals over 3 years. 3. Under the current precipitation regime, endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata reduced colonizing plant diversity, species richness and evenness. This effect depended on the amount of precipitation, with the symbiosis having weaker effects on plant diversity under both augmented and reduced rainfall treatments. 4. Despite the overall negative effect of endophyte symbiosis on plant diversity, plant responses to the endophyte were species specific. A federally threatened forb, Cirsium pitcheri, increased in abundance when the symbiosis was present, regardless of precipitation regime. Endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata caused minor reductions in the abundance of other grass species; however, augmented precipitation benefited other grasses. 5. Synthesis. We show that microbial mutualisms can have strong effects on community structure in a native ecosystem and that the amount of precipitation has the potential to alter how these keystone species interactions affect community composition. Predictions on future plant community structure, for both restored and native dunes, can be improved by accounting for the presence of fungal symbionts in the foundation plant species.","[Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Bell-Dereske, Lukas] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Crawford, Kerri M.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Emery, Sarah M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Rudgers, JA (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jrudgers@unm.edu,,"Crawford, Kerri/0000-0003-4421-2243","NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0918267, 1145588]; NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [0940902]; George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF PRFB; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0919093]","This work has been funded by NSF DEB#0918267 and #1145588 to J.A.R., NSF GRFP #0940902 and the George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship to L.B.D., an NSF DDIG and NSF PRFB to K.M.C., and NSF #0919093 to S.M.E.

Some orchids re-establish quickly, others are slow to return while some remain absent for at least several decades after disturbance. Orchid seed is minute, has been found to be readily dispersed and is not regarded as a limiting factor provided adequate rates of pollination occurs. A case study in the jarrah forest of Western Australia showed that compatible symbiotic fungi were present in a restored bauxite mine site, but inoculum levels were low and patchily distributed in soils. Comparative studies of orchids in disturbed ecosystems revealed key functional differences between early colonisers (disturbance opportunists) and disturbance intolerant species, especially concerning the degree of pollinator and fungus specificity. However more research is required to resolve the impact of microhabitats defined by soil and vegetation on orchid colonisation and how these factors change over time. In particular, there is a paucity of data on the ecological roles and habitat preferences of the fungi, and insects on which terrestrial orchids depend. Orchids that are early re-colonisers are indicators of disturbed habitats, while those that are disturbance intolerant and recolonise slowly are useful as indicators of habitats in excellent condition.","[Collins, Margaret] Univ Western Australia, Fac Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Brundrett, Mark] Dept Pk & Wildlife, Australia 2 Dr, Crawley, WA 6000, Australia; [Brundrett, Mark] Bentley Delivery Ctr, Locked Bag 104, Bentley, WA 6983, Australia","Collins, M (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Fac Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",,,,,,,73,2,2,0,1,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-643-10636-9; 978-0-643-10635-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,141,158,,,,,18,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BJ8CM,WOS:000427975100008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cesarz, S; Reich, PB; Scheu, S; Ruess, L; Schaefer, M; Eisenhauer, N",,,,"Cesarz, Simone; Reich, Peter B.; Scheu, Stefan; Ruess, Liliane; Schaefer, Matthias; Eisenhauer, Nico",,,"Nematode functional guilds, not trophic groups, reflect shifts in soil food webs and processes in response to interacting global change factors",PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nematodes; Food web complexity; Global change; Grassland; Soil processes; Taxonomical resolution,AIR CO2 ENRICHMENT; ELEVATED CO2; PLANT DIVERSITY; NITROGEN LIMITATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; DECOMPOSITION PATHWAYS; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FAUNAL ANALYSIS,"Soils store 80% of global terrestrial organic carbon and alterations in fluxes into and out of this pool may interact with ongoing climate change. Belowground food webs drive soil C dynamics, but little is known about their responses to co-occurring global change agents. We investigated open-air experimental grassland communities at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, ambient and enriched nitrogen input, and ambient and reduced summer precipitation to evaluate how these agents interactively affect soil nematodes, which are often used as an indicator group for soil food web structure and soil health. The aim of the study was to elucidate the response of the functional diversity of soil nematodes to changing environmental conditions by using nematode functional guilds and indices as indicators. The results suggest that nematode functional guilds surpass nematode trophic groups as soil indicators, suggesting that more detailed data on nematode community structure is essential to capture functional changes in response to environmental change. For instance, the density of opportunistic fungal feeders increased due to N addition with the response being more pronounced at elevated CO2, whereas densities of sensitive fungal-feeders were increased at ambient N and elevated CO2, illustrating opposing responses within one trophic group. Opportunistic bacterial feeders increased at elevated N, but did not respond to other environmental factors studied. Root-feeding Longidoridae were significantly reduced at elevated CO2 and elevated N compared to ambient conditions, whereas other plant feeders were little affected by the manipulations. Predacious nematodes were less abundant at elevated N, and the Structure Index (which indicates food web structure) suggested reduced top-down forces and simplified soil food webs, although omnivores did not vary significantly. Elevated CO2 buffered the effect of reduced precipitation on the Enrichment Index (which indicates increased resource availability) and the Channel Index (which indicates changes in decomposition channel) probably due to reduced stomatal conductance at elevated CO2. Further, the results suggest that the decomposer community switched from a bacterial-dominated to a fungal-dominated system at elevated N, indicating shifts in the microbial community as well as in the functioning of belowground food webs. Overall, the studied global change agents interactively and differentially affected functional guilds of soil nematodes, suggesting complex changes in soil processes.

The impact of the large group of microarthropods, e.g. Collembola and Acari, is nearly unknown and hence underrepresented in the literature. Here we propose and discuss potential direct and indirect mechanisms of how microarthropods could influence this process with the focus on collembolans, which are in general a relatively well studied taxon. Indirect mechanisms are likely to have larger impacts on soil aggregation than direct effects. The variety of indirect mechanisms based on the provision of organic material like fecal pellets, molts and necromass as food source for microorganisms is high and given available evidence we propose that these mechanisms are the most influential. We highlight the need for overcoming the challenges of culturing and handling of these animals in order to be able to design small scale experiments and field studies which would enable us to understand the role of the different functional groups, their interaction with other soil fauna and the impact of land use practices on soil aggregation.

However, few studies have used biocrusts, which are specialized soil communities of autotrophic cyanobacteria, mosses, lichens and non-photosynthetic fungi and bacteria that are prevalent in drylands worldwide. These communities largely influence ecosystem functioning, and can be used as a model system for studying above-belowground interactions. In this study, we evaluated how biocrusts affect the functional diversity and biomass of microbial diversities beneath biocrusts. We performed two microcosm experiments using biocrust-forming lichens where we manipulated their biotic attributes to test independently the effects of species richness (from two to eight species), composition, evenness (maximal and low evenness) and spatial pattern (clumped and random distribution) on the microbial catabolic profile and microbial functional diversity. Microcosms with a random pattern had a higher microbial catabolic profile than those with a clumped pattern. Significant richness x evenness x pattern and richness x evenness interactions were found when analyzing microbial catabolic profile and biomass, respectively. Microcosms with a random pattern, intermediate number of species, and maximal evenness level had higher microbial catabolic profile. At the maximal evenness level, assemblages had higher microbial catabolic profile and microbial biomass when they contained four species. The richness x evenness x pattern interaction was the most informative predictor of variations in microbial catabolic profile. Our results indicate that soil microorganisms are influenced by biocrusts, just as they are influenced by plants, and highlight the importance of higher order interactions among species richness, evenness, and spatial pattern as drivers of microbial communities. The results also emphasize the importance of studying several biotic attributes simultaneously when studying biocrust-soil microorganism interactions, as in nature, community properties do not exert their influence in isolation.","[Castillo-Monroy, Andrea P.; Maestre, Fernando T.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Castillo-Monroy, Andrea P.] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Nat, Loja, Ecuador; [Bowker, Matthew A.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Garcia-Palacios, Pablo] CEFE CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Castillo-Monroy, AP (reprint author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Nat, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja, Ecuador.",apcastillo4@utpl.edu.ec; Matthew.Bowker@nau.edu; pablogpom@yahoo.es; fernando.maestre@urjc.es,"Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/K-7567-2014; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008","Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/0000-0002-6367-4761; Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856",Fundacion BBVA [BIOCON06/105]; British Ecological Society [231/607]; European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [242658],"We thank David Elliott and two anonymous reviewers for comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

Problems are solved in relation to climatic fluctuation comprising dry periods and potential shortage of soil water for trees with particularly superficial spread of fine roots. Solution proceeds as amendment of water balance research in young spruce, beech, and beech spruce stands on long-term experimental objects in the Orlicke hory Mts., Czech Republic. It proceeds from continuous measuring volume content of soil water in soil profile layers by 45 soil moisture sensors. Scientific findings from the Degtenska strap (DS) experimental area and U Dvou louek (UDL) experimental watershed show, during dry periods, different intake of water by spruce and beech trees, and on the DS potential water redistribution in beech stand soil from deeper layers into upper layer of soil profile, so called hydraulic lift. On the basis of results from the DS, the method for estimating of hydraulic lift potential of beech in favour of spruce was devised. The estimate was carried out by proportional superposition of beech into a spruce stand. Thirty percent admixture of beech into the spruce stand increased model volume moisture of the upper soil layer (0-10 cm) in dry periods above value beyond range of decrease availability of soil water for plants (4-11%). Consequently, we were able to recommend model tree species composition of mountain woods in relation to hydraulic lift of beech: 70% spruce and 30% beech. In the mixed young spruce stand interplanted with beech (the UDL experimental watershed), the hydraulic lift of temporarily suppressed beech interplantation has not yet appeared.","[Sach, Frantisek; Cernohous, Vladimir] Vyzkumny Ustay Lesniho Hospodarstvi & Myslivosti, Vyzkumna Stanice Opocno, Olive 550, CZ-51773 Opocno, Czech Republic","Sach, F (reprint author), Vyzkumny Ustay Lesniho Hospodarstvi & Myslivosti, Vyzkumna Stanice Opocno, Olive 550, CZ-51773 Opocno, Czech Republic.",sach@vulhmop.cz,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,FORESTRY & GAME MANAGEMENT RESEARCH INST,JILOVISTE,"STRNADY 136, JILOVISTE, 25202, CZECH REPUBLIC",0322-9688,1805-9872,,REP FOR RES,Rep.

Whilst its effect on C and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils has been investigated previously, this has usually either focussed on the bulk soil organic matter, or a single compound such as glucose. Five low molecular weight dissolved organic C (LMWDOC) substrates (three sugars, one amino acid, one organic acid) were selected for a C-14-CLPP experiment from which turnover rate (t(1/2)) and immediate carbon use efficiency (CUE) of the substrate were estimated. We demonstrated that whilst soil type had the greatest effect on soil microbial function, the addition of biochar also influenced microbial turnover and CUE of the substrates, most notably in the lowest fertility soil. We also identified that the relationship between turnover and CUE of the five substrates differed substantially, and the effect of biochar and soil type was more pronounced in the amino acid than the organic acid. This effect tended to be greatest in biochars produced at 450 degrees C, and less pronounced with the addition of biochars produced at 550 degrees C, though these trends were not consistent for all compounds in all soils tested. We conclude biochars and soils interact to manifest non-systematic differences in turnover rates of LMWDOCs, and thus a variety of mechanisms are likely responsible for this observation. As these compounds are most commonly found in the rhizosphere and can contribute a significant portion of photosynthetically-fixed C, and plant roots have been observed to grow preferentially around biochar particles, it is apparent that biochar may significantly affect the flow of LMWDOC through the microbial community in soils.

In the trial, as salt concentration increased, total phenolics and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA) content) increased compared to the control. The effects of salt concentration and experimental applications on total phenolic content reached their maximum on day 45, while their effects on MDA reached a maximum on day 30. In terms of applications, the mycorrhizal application decreased both total phenolics and MDA content. When the interaction of salt and applications was examined, the highest MDA content (3.568 mu M g(-1) FW) and total phenolics amount (0.343 mg g(-1)) were observed with the 60 mM/L NaCl concentration in the control application.

We hypothesized that juvenile individuals of four native pioneer tree and two native pioneer grass species have a drought resistance comparable to two exotic reference species. Our results confirm this hypothesis: even under drought, native trees had a higher biomass and root : shoot ratio than exotic trees, although their maximum relative elongation rate and biomass were reduced more strongly than for exotic trees with respect to well-watered conditions. Native grasses had a higher root length density and a similar drought-induced reduction of stomatal conductance compared to exotic trees. In spite of a higher biomass reduction, native grasses produced more biomass under drought in absolute terms. Notwithstanding that further investigations of other adverse environmental factors need to be performed, our results indicate with respect to drought resistance that native pioneer species are a potential alternative to exotic species for the ecological restoration of subtropical post-mining areas, which may accelerate secondary succession.","[Winkler, N.; Auge, H.; Klotz, S.; Finkenbein, P.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Weymann, W.; Heilmeier, H.] TU Bergakad Freiberg, Interdisciplinary Ecol Ctr, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany","Winkler, N (reprint author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany.",nicole.winkler@ufz.de,"Klotz, Stefan/J-5866-2017; Auge, Harald/D-4802-2015","Klotz, Stefan/0000-0003-4355-6415; Auge, Harald/0000-0001-7432-8453",project RAME - Research Association Mining and Environment [02WB0957]; German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),This work was framed within the project RAME - Research Association Mining and Environment (02WB0957) - and funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF).

The six selected plants - Hypericum maculatum (Hypericaceae), Alchemilla xanthochlora (Rosaceae), Cynosurus cristatus (Poaceae), Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae), Dactylis glomerata (Poaceae) and Acer pseudoplatanus (Sapindaceae) - show variable Cd contents among the species and among individuals from the same family (Poaceae). Average Cd concentrations in the selected plants are in the 2-6 mg.kg(-1) range and exceed the maximal Cd concentration tolerated in vegetal feed for animals, which is established at 1 mg.kg(-1). High Cd concentrations in the soil result in a reduction of Cd accumulation in the shoots and a corresponding increase in the roots. This implies that Cd transfer coefficients from the soil/rhizosphere to the plant are inversely proportional to the total Cd concentrations in soils and do not depend on plant species but instead on soil type. Sequential chemical extractions reveal that variations in Cd distribution between the bulk soil and the corresponding rhizospheric soil occur mainly in the Cd-bearing phases, which are exchangeable, bound to carbonates, and associated with organic matter. This is principally due to the incorporation of root exudates, which modify pH and redox conditions of the rhizosphere. Elevated Cd concentrations in the shoots of A. xanthochlora (up to 8 mg.kg(-1)), C. cristatus (9 mg.kg(-1)) and H. maculatum (3 mg.kg(-1)) may represent a long-term hazard for livestock and human health since these plants are used either by grazing cattle or for medicinal purposes. On the contrary, R. acris, A. pseudoplatanus, and especially D. glomerata show lower Cd concentrations and are of minor concern with regards to their environmental impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, limited information is available regarding the impact of root-secreted low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the release of bound PAH residues in soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the LMWOA-influenced release of soil bound PAH residues. An n-butanol extraction procedure was used to evaluate the release of soil bound PAH residues. LMWOAs can dramatically promote the release of bound PAH residues and enhance the extractability and availability of PAHs in soil. The addition of LMWOAs significantly increased the extractable concentrations of Sigma PAH and each individual PAH in soils containing bound PAH residues in a LMWOA-concentration dependent manner. Compared with control treatments without addition of LMWOA, the concentrations of butanol-extractable Sigma PAH and each PAH in soils following the addition of 10-100 mmol/kg LMWOAs were 54-745% and 58-605% larger after 40 and 80 days, respectively. Citric acid always generated the largest PAH release from soil bound PAH residues, while malic acid generated the lowest release among the three LMWOAs tested. The results of this work provide important information regarding the fate of bound PAH residues in the soil environment, and will be useful for the risk assessment of PAH-contaminated soils and the development of remedial strategies for contaminated sites.

The investigation was conducted in air equilibrated titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspensions at 25 degrees C and pH 1 employing UV light within a closed-loop flow-through reactor. Varying the sodium chloride concentration, according to speciation data, individual solutions of rhodium(III) chloro-aqua complexes were prepared at those Cl--concentrations coinciding with the maximum of a specific species, and to that regard the photocatalytic reduction behaviour of Rh(III) was related to the complex present in greater abundance. The fastest photocatalytic reduction rate was observed for those solutions having neutral and anionicrhodium(III) chloro-aqua complexes dominant in solution. No photocatalytic reduction, of any of therhodium(III) chloro-aqua complexes, was effected in the absence of an organic SRA, which is in contrast to [PdCln(H2O)(4-n)](2-n) (n = 0-4) and [PtCln(H2O)(4-n)](2-n) (n = 0-4) that do show photocatalytic reduction in the absence of an added organic SRA. At low concentrations sucrose was found to be a superior SRA compared to both ethanol and formic acid. This behaviour is attributed to the structural differences of the SRAs as sucrose has more oxidizable electron donor sites, in the form of hydroxyl groups, compared to both ethanol and formic acid. However, at higher concentrations ethanol was found to be a more effective SRA than both formic acid and sucrose. This is due to coagulation of the photocatalyst (TiO2) setting in at higher sucrose concentrations, which causes the photocatalyst to settle out from suspension. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ecologically these two parameters have different temporal variations and thus their optimization in ecosystem models poses a challenge. To minimize the temporal scale effect, we propose a three-stage approach to optimize these two parameters using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), based on observations of latent heat (LE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) fluxes at three flux tower sites in 2009. First, the EnKF is applied daily to obtain precursor estimates of V-cmax and f(w). Then, V-cmax is optimized at different time scales, assuming f(w) is unchanged from the first step. The best temporal period is then determined by analyzing the coefficient of determination (R-2) of GPP and LE between simulation and observation. Finally, the daily f(w) value is optimized for rain-free days corresponding to the V-cmax curve from the best temporal period. We found that the variations of optimized f(w) are largely explained by soil water content in the summer. In the spring, the optimized f(w) shows a smooth increase following the rise of soil temperature, indicating that f(w) may respond to the development of fine roots, which is related to the amount of accumulated heat in the soil. The optimized V-cmax generally follows a pattern of a rapid increase at the leaf expansion stage in the spring, small variation in summer, and an abrupt decrease at foliage senescence. With eddy covariance fluxes data, data assimilation with a EnKF can retrieve the seasonal variations of water uptake and photosynthetic parameters in an ecosystem model, and such gives clues on how to model forest responses to water stress.

Despite the theoretical importance of mutualism-stabilizing mechanisms, we have little empirical evidence to infer their evolutionary dynamics in response to exploitation by non-beneficial partners. Using a model mutualism-the interaction between legumes and nitrogen-fixing soil symbionts-we tested for quantitative genetic variation in plant responses to mutualistic and exploitative symbiotic rhizobia in controlled greenhouse conditions. We found significant broad-sense heritability in a legume host's preferential association with mutualistic over exploitative symbionts and selection to reduce frequency of associations with exploitative partners. We failed to detect evidence that selection will favour the loss of mutualism-stabilizing mechanisms in the absence of exploitation, as we found no evidence for a fitness cost to the host trait or indirect selection on genetically correlated traits. Our results show that genetic variation in the ability to preferentially reduce associations with an exploitative partner exists within mutualisms and is under selection, indicating that micro-evolutionary responses in mutualism-stabilizing traits in the face of rapidly evolving mutualistic and exploitative symbiotic bacteria can occur in natural host populations.","[Simonsen, Anna K.; Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Ctr Anal Genome Evolut & Funct, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Simonsen, AK (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",anna.simonsen@gmail.com,"Stinchcombe, John/A-2941-2008","Stinchcombe, John/0000-0003-3349-2964",NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CFICanada Foundation for Innovation,Grants from NSERC Canada (A.

A series of ecological restoration strategies have been implemented to enhance the ecosystem services of China's grasslands. To understand the response of ecosystem C and N to grazing exclusion within a nationwide conservation project-Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands (RGLG), the C and N storages in different parts of the plant-soil system as well as soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) contents were determined and compared between three grazing exclusion sites (6 years) and the paired adjacent grazing sites in the Hulunbuir grassland of Inner Mongolia. Our results showed that the exclusion of grazing for 6 years resulted in significant increases of ecosystem biomass and soil C and N contents, leading to a substantial restoration of ecosystem C and N storage. The average C and N accumulation rates in the whole ecosystem were 173.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 19.8 g N m(-2) year(-1), respectively. The accumulation of C and N in soil contributed to more than 87.6% and 98.2% of the increases in ecosystem C and N, respectively, indicating that the restoration of ecosystem C and N were mainly due to the increase of C and N in soil after exclusion of grazing. The higher MBC and MBN in exclosure sites than grazing sites might be partly because of the enhanced organic matter inputs from plant litter and root exudates. The significant correlations between soil organic matter and microbial biomass suggested that soil microbial biomass could be a sensitive indicator of the soil C and N dynamics. These results indicated that exclusion of grazing pressure within the RGLG project is an effective restoration approach to control grassland degradation in this region. However, more comprehensive multidisciplinary studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the RGLG project and to improve the management strategies for grassland restoration.

These processes have only recently been examined in microbial communities. Instead, microbial dispersal has mostly been measured as community composition change over space (i.e., distance decay). Here we directly examined fungal composition in airborne wind currents and soil fungal communities across a 40 000 km(2) regional landscape to determine if dispersal limitation or abiotic factors were structuring soil fungal communities. Over this landscape, neither airborne nor soil fungal communities exhibited compositional differences due to geographic distance. Airborne fungal communities shifted temporally while soil fungal communities were correlated with abiotic parameters. These patterns suggest that environmental filtering may have the largest influence on fungal regional community assembly in soils, especially for aerially dispersed fungal taxa. Furthermore, we found evidence that dispersal of fungal spores differs between fungal taxa and can be both a stochastic and deterministic process. The spatial range of soil fungal taxa was correlated with their average regional abundance across all sites, which may imply stochastic dispersal mechanisms. Nevertheless, spore volume was also negatively correlated with spatial range for some species. Smaller volume spores may be adapted to long-range dispersal, or establishment, suggesting that deterministic fungal traits may also influence fungal distributions. Fungal life-history traits may influence their distributions as well. Hypogeous fungal taxa exhibited high local abundance, but small spatial ranges, while epigeous fungal taxa had lower local abundance, but larger spatial ranges. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly sample air dispersal and soil fungal communities simultaneously across a regional landscape. We provide some of the first evidence that soil fungal communities are mostly assembled through environmental filtering and experience little dispersal limitation.

Several studies have examined the possibility of AM fungal spores being moved by wind vectors without observing spores taken from the air environment. For the first time this study observed the presence of AM fungal spores in the air. The frequency of AM fungal spores in the air was determined in six North American biomes composed of 18 ecoregions. Multiple samples were taken from both the air and the soil at each location. AM fungal spores were found in high abundance in the soil (hundreds of spores per gram of soil), however, they were rarely found in the air (most samples contained no AM fungal spores). Furthermore, only the Glomus morphotype was found in the air, whereas spores in the soil were taxomomically more diverse (Glomus, Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Scutellospora morphotypes were observed). The proportion of Glomus spores in the air relative to Glomus spores in the soil was highest in more arid systems, indicating that AM fungi may be more likely to be dispersed in the air in such systems. Nonetheless, the results indicate that the air is not likely a dominant mode of dispersal for AM fungi.

At the microsite scale, hyphae, spores, and glomalin-related soil protein were more abundant underneath shrub canopies, but unvegetated shrub interspaces had similar amounts of viable propagules, spore diversity, and spore community composition compared to canopies. Significant local and regional scale variation in abundance, diversity, and community composition were correlated with variation in soil organic matter, climate, and soil phosphorus concentration. We observed high alpha, beta, and gamma spore diversity and significant spatial autocorrelation of communities. This study demonstrates how multiple indicators of Glomeromycotan abundance and diversity vary differentially in natural systems and how soil and climate factors are important drivers of spatial patterns.

In this study, nine common herbs in northeast China were selected and compared to study soil-conservation effects by using an undisturbed-soil trough scouring method for soil anti-scourability enhancement and hydrostatic collapse method for soil anti-erodibility. Further, principal components analysis was used to identify significant root features that affected soil erosion resistance. Results indicated that different herbs had distinct enhancement effects on soil erosion resistance. Soil anti-scourability enhancement index decreased with increases of soil depth, slope gradient and rainfall amount. Relationship between soil anti-erodibility enhancement index (S) and immersion time (t) is a cubic spline in each different herb type (R (2) a parts per thousand yen 0.88). Herb root features such as micro-aggregates, organic matter, net leaf weight, thick root length, fine root length and biomass contributed a leading role in soil erosion resistance enhancement effect, and all their common factor variances were more than 0.81. Descending order of soil erosion resistance enhancement effect in soil anti-scourability for nine herbs is Poa pratensis, Medicago sativa, Viola philippica, Rudbeckia hirta, Clematis heracleifolia, Kalimeris indica, Cosmos bipinnata, Hemerocallis fulva and Sedum elatinoides, while the sequence of soil anti-erodibility is M. sativa, S. elatinoides, P. pratensis, R. hirta, H. fulva, V. philippica, C. heracleifolia, C. bipinnata and K. indica. Therefore, we concluded that P. pratensis and M. sativa were the most suitable herbs for resisting soil erosion and recommended to be widely planted for road vegetation recovery in this region.","[Wang, X.; Liu, Y.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Xu, W.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Y.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Xu, W (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",littles0747@sina.com,,,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-120810]; National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2011BAD37B01]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitySichuan UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT1054]; Scientific and technological project of Communication Department of Heilongjiang Province [2008WJ037],"This research was supported by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-120810), the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2011BAD37B01), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT1054), and the Scientific and technological project of Communication Department of Heilongjiang Province (2008WJ037).",,41,1,2,1,37,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",1064-2293,1556-195X,,EURASIAN SOIL SCI+,Eurasian Soil Sci.,DEC,2014,47,12,,,,,1274,1282,,10.1134/S1064229314120114,,,9,Soil Science,Agriculture,AW0EU,WOS:000345964300011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kwan, H; Swanson, S",,,,"Kwan, Hilda; Swanson, Sherman",,,"PREDICTION OF ANNUAL STREAMBANK EROSION FOR SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, CALIFORNIA",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,streambank erosion; BEHI; NBS; Rosgen; prediction; bank height; root depth; root density; near-bank stress,CATTLE; BANKS; FREQUENCY; IMPACTS; CURVES; OREGON; RIVERS,"Many bank erosion models have limitations that restrict their use in wildland settings. Scientists and land managers at the Sequoia National Forest would like to understand the mechanisms and rates of streambank erosion to evaluate management issues and post-wildfire effects. This study uses bank erosion hazard index (BEHI) and near-bank stress (NBS) methods developed in Rosgen (2006 Watershed Assessment of River Stability and Sediment Supply [WARSSS]) for predicting streambank erosion in a geographic area that is dominated by colluvium and in which streambank erosion modeling has not been previously evaluated. BEHI evaluates bank susceptibility to erosion based on bank angle, bank and bankfull height, rooting depth and density, surface protection, and stratification of material within the banks. NBS assesses energy distribution against the bank measured as a ratio of bankfull near-bank maximum depth to mean bankfull depth. We compared BEHI classes and NBS to actual bank erosion measured from 2008 to 2012. This index predicted streambank erosion with clear separation among BEHI ratings with R-2 values of 0.76 for extreme, 0.37 for high/very high, 0.49 for moderate, and 0.70 for low BEHI. The relationships between measured erosion and BEHI extend the application of BEHI/NBS to a new region where they can inform management priorities, afforestation, stream/riparian restoration projects, and potentially burned area rehabilitation.","[Kwan, Hilda] USDA, Mendocino Natl Forest, Upper Lake, CA 95485 USA; [Kwan, Hilda] Sequoia Natl Forest, Porterville, CA 93257 USA; [Swanson, Sherman] Univ Nevada Cooperat Extens & Scientist, Nevada Agr Expt Stn, Reno, NV 89557 USA","Kwan, H (reprint author), USDA, Mendocino Natl Forest, 10025 Elk Mt Rd, Upper Lake, CA 95485 USA.",hkwan@fs.fed.us,,,,,,36,8,8,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

Some studies suggest that soil microarthropods play an important role in fungi dispersion, but little is still known about the interaction between truffle and soil microarthropods. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of the truffle Tuber aestivum to modify soil biogeochemistry (i.e. create a zone of scarce vegetation around the host plant, called a burn or brule) and to highlight the effects of the brule on the soil fauna community. We compared soil microarthropod communities found in the soil inside versus outside the T. aestivum brule with the chemistry of soil collected inside versus outside the brule. The study was carried out in three Mediterranean areas, two in Italy and one in Spain. The results confirmed the ability of T. aestivum to modify soil biogeochemistry in the brule: pH was higher and total organic carbon tended to be lower inside the brule compared to outside. Soil fauna communities showed some interesting differences. Some groups, such as Symphyla and Pauropoda, adapted well to the soil; some Collembolan families, and biodiversity and soil quality indices were generally higher outside the brule. Folsomia sp. showed higher abundance in the soil of the brule compared to outside. The results suggest that some Collembola groups may be attracted by the fungal metabolites produced by T. aestivum, while other Collembola and other microarthropods may find an unfavourable environment in the soil of the brule. The next steps will be to confirm this hypothesis and to extend the study to other keys groups such as nematodes and earthworms and to link fluctuations of soil communities with the biological phases of truffle growth.

However, an increasing number of studies are pointing out the selectivity potential of plant hosts. Plant life form, determined by plant life history traits, seems to drive the AM fungal community composition. The AM fungi also exhibit a wide diversity of functional traits known to be responsible for their distribution in natural ecosystems. However, little is known about the role of plant and fungal traits driving the resultant symbiotic assemblages. With the aim of testing the feedback relationship between plant and fungal traits on the resulting AM fungal community, we inoculated three different plant life forms, i.e. annual herbs, perennial herbs and perennial semi-woody plants, with AM fungal communities sampled in different seasons. We hypothesized that the annual climate variation will induce changes in the mean traits of the AM fungal communities present in the soil throughout the year. Furthermore, the association of plants with different life forms with AM fungi with contrasting life history traits will show certain preferences according to reciprocal traits of the plants and fungi. We found changes in the AM fungal community throughout the year, which were differentially disrupted by disturbance and altered by plant growth form and plant biomass. Both plant and fungal traits clearly contributed to the resultant AM fungal communities. The revealed process can have implications for the functioning of ecosystems since changes in dominant plant life forms or climatic variables could influence the traits of AM fungal communities in soil and hence ecosystem processes.","[Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion; Barea, Jose M.] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst Dept, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Lopez-Garcia, A (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Sect Terr Ecol, Dept Biol, Univ Pk 15,Bldg 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",lopez.garcia.alvaro@gmail.com,"Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/J-9190-2014; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015; Azcon, Concepcion/H-5873-2015","Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/0000-0001-8267-3572; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718; Azcon, Concepcion/0000-0003-3041-8566","Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Spanish governmentSpanish Government [CGL-2009-08825]","Dr Alvaro Lopez-Garcia thanks the Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain) for financial support.

Deep-rooting trees at military sites have been found to take-up contaminants from groundwater, and the extensive root and endosphere provide ideal niches for microbial TNT-transformations. Methods We characterised the rhizosphere, root endosphere and endo-phyllosphere bacteria of Acer pseudoplatanus growing at a historically TNT-contaminated location, using 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting, bacteria isolation, oxidoreductase gene-cloning, in planta growth-promotion (PGP) tests, inoculation, plant physiology measurements and microscopy. Results Based on terminal-restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism analysis, bulk soil and rhizosphere samples were highly clustered. Proteo-and Actinobacteria dominated the rhizosphere and root endosphere, whereas Alphaproteobacteria were more abundant in shoots and Actinobacteria in leaves. We isolated multiple PGP-bacteria and cloned 5 flavin-oxidoreductases belonging to the Old Yellow Enzyme family involved in TNT-reduction from 3 Pseudomonas spp., the leaf symbiont Stenotrophomonas chelatiphaga and the root endophyte Variovorax ginsengisola. Conclusions The inoculation with a selection of these strains, consortium CAP9, which combines efficient TNT-transformation capabilities with beneficial PGP-properties, has the ability to detoxify TNT in the bent grass (Agrostis capillaris) rhizosphere, stimulate plant growth and improve plant health under TNT stress.","[Thijs, Sofie; Sillen, Wouter; Truyens, Sascha; Holtappels, Michelle; Carleer, Robert; Weyens, Nele; Vangronsveld, Jaco] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Van Dillewijn, Pieter] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [D'Haen, Jan] IMO, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Ameloot, Marcel] Transnat Univ Limburg, Hasselt Univ, Biomed Res Inst, Sch Life Sci, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Ramos, Juan-Luis] Abengoa Res, E-41014 Seville, Spain","Thijs, S (reprint author), Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",sofie.thijs@uhasselt.be,"van Dillewijn, Pieter/O-3728-2014; D'Haen, Jan/K-1938-2016","van Dillewijn, Pieter/0000-0001-7626-0958; D'Haen, Jan/0000-0003-4487-3885; Vangronsveld, Jaco/0000-0003-4423-8363; Ramos, Juan L./0000-0002-8731-7435","FWO-Flanders, BelgiumFWO; Methusalem project [08M03VGRJ]; Spanish Ministry of Competitiveness [BIO2010-17227]; FEDEREuropean Union (EU)","This work was supported by a grant from FWO-Flanders, Belgium, the Methusalem project 08M03VGRJ and partially by grant BIO2010-17227 of the Spanish Ministry of Competitiveness and FEDER.

G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa . Thus, C. speciosa is more appropriate for the reforestation of degraded areas with potential excess light or water deficit. Reforestation programs in tropics are necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the preservation of biodiversity and for recovery of degraded areas. However, little is known about the abiotic stress tolerance of the major tropical tree species used in reforestation. This study was aimed at evaluating antioxidant defenses and photoprotective pigments against excess light and water deficit in Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. and Ceiba speciosa (A.St.-Hil) Ravenna. Plantlets of 6-month-old were exposed to progressive water deficit by withholding water under high and low irradiance growth conditions and then re-irrigated. G. ulmifolia leaves under high irradiance showed increased photo-oxidative damage, as indicated by a decreased Fv/Fm ratio and 5-12-fold increases in MDA levels, which correlated with a 14-fold increase in SOD activity, a 90 % decrease in POD activity and a 3-4-fold increases in hydrogen peroxide levels. Water deficit combined with high irradiance caused stronger chronic photoinhibition, indicating a synergistic effect that cannot be counterbalanced by antioxidant or photo-protective mechanisms. In contrast, to avoid photo-oxidative damage, C. speciosa enhanced SOD activity, maintained POD and CAT activities, and increased xanthophyll cycle pool size and DPS and beta-carotene accumulation. These results indicate that G. ulmifolia is more sensitive to high irradiance than C. speciosa at early stages of development.

Positive growth trend in outgrown coppices no longer harvested on short rotations now drives natural forest restoration on wide areas, and it represents a potential carbon sink in view of global warming. Our goals were to estimate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content per compartment in two deciduous oak outgrown coppice forests, aged differently and growing under unequal site quality, to verify whether C concentration across compartments is in agreement with the conventional conversion rate of 0.5. Ecosystem C and N pools were assessed by multiplying the whole coppice mass (combining specific allometric functions, root-to-shoot ratio, and soil sampling) by respective C and N concentrations. The results point out that the largest percentage of N was stored in 15-cm topsoil (84.06 and 73.34 % at the younger and older site, respectively), whereas the proportion of organic ecosystem C pool was more variable, as a consequence of the amount and allocation of phytomass. We found that, in most cases, C concentration was less than the conventional conversion rate of 0.5, especially in deadwood, O layer, and root compartments. The findings provide further knowledge of C and N storage into these new built-up forest types and the evidence that a detailed analysis may get higher accuracy in the pools estimate, producing a more reliable outlook on dynamics and climate change mitigation ability of these systems.","[Di Matteo, Giovanni; Nardi, Pierfrancesco] CRA CMA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Res Unit Climatol & Meteorol Agr, I-00186 Rome, Italy; [Tunno, Irene] Univ Viterbo, Dept Agr Forests Nat & Energy, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [De Angelis, Paolo] Univ Viterbo, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst, DIBAF, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Bertini, Giada; Fabbio, Gianfranco] CRA SEL, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Forestry Res Ctr, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy","Di Matteo, G (reprint author), CRA CMA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Res Unit Climatol & Meteorol Agr, I-00186 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.dimatteo@entecra.it,"De Angelis, Paolo/A-6863-2012","De Angelis, Paolo/0000-0001-8310-8831; Di Matteo, Giovanni/0000-0002-5310-6509; Nardi, Pierfrancesco/0000-0002-0305-6558; Tunno, Irene/0000-0002-9842-1326","Italian Ministry of Agriculture Food and Forest Policy [3.2, 3.2.1]; Regione ToscanaRegione Toscana; EU AIR2 project MEDCOP, Improvement of Coppice Forests in the Mediterranean Region","Funds for this study were provided by the (i) Italian Ministry of Agriculture Food and Forest Policy under the programme Ri.Selv.Italia (Project 3.2 managed by CRA-SEL and Research unit 3.2.1, DIBAF, University of Viterbo), (ii) Regione Toscana under the project Sustainable Forestry into Coppice System managed by CRA-SEL, and (iii) EU AIR2 project MEDCOP, Improvement of Coppice Forests in the Mediterranean Region managed by CRA-SEL.",,38,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

To test the effects of soil fungi from different forest fragment sizes on native and invasive plants, we conducted a greenhouse factorial experiment combining soil source (i.e., small and large forest fragments) and fungicide application (with and without fungicide) on two ruderal congeneric Euphorbia (E. acerensis and E. dentata, native and invasive, respectively). Soil fungi from small forest fragments promoted lower rates of mycorrhizal colonization than soil from large forest fragments in both plant species. In general, the source of soil fungi had no effect on vegetative and reproductive growth of both plant species. Fungicide application positively affected plant height and dry mass of the native host, while the fungicide application negatively affected height and neutrally affected growth of the invasive plant species. Reproductive traits were in general positively affected by fungicide application, although in some cases, they were dependent on soil source. Forest fragmentation might promote changes in soil conditions that negatively affect mycorrhizal colonization at levels without functional consequences for plant growth. However, landscape modifications that contribute to a more severe reduction in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization might certainly have important consequences on native and invasive plant growth.","[Grilli, G.; Urcelay, C.; Longo, M.

However, it is unknown if the frequent rotation of a compartment has any side-effects that may hinder attributing findings to AMF. We set up an experiment with the presence/absence of a non-AMF microbial community, where each pot contained a rotated and a non-rotated soil core. The results show that within our rotation design soil parameters such as water content, soil structure, pH, and C and N concentrations are not influenced by the regular rotation in the absence of AMF. Our study therefore clearly underlines the validity of the rotated hyphal in-growth core as an experimental control for AMF growth and activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Kin selection, from evolutionary theory, predicts that competition between relatives will likely be weaker. The niche partitioning hypothesis, from ecological theory, predicts that competition between close relatives will likely be stronger. We tested for evidence consistent with either of these predictions by growing an annual legume in kin and nonkin groups in the greenhouse. We grew plant groups in treatments of symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria differing in strain identity and composition to determine if differences in the microbial environment can facilitate or obscure plant competition patterns consistent with kin selection or niche partitioning. Nonkin groups had lower fitness than expected, based on fitness estimates of the same genotypes grown among kin. Higher fitness among kin groups was observed in mixtures of N-fixing bacteria strains compared to single inoculations of bacteria strains present in the soil, which increased fitness differences between kin and nonkin groups. Lower fitness in nonkin groups was likely caused by increased competitive asymmetry in nonkin groups due to genetic differences in plant size combined with saturating relationships with plant size and fitness- i.e. Jensen's inequality. Our study suggests that microbial soil symbionts alter competitive dynamics among kin and nonkin. Our study also suggests that kin groups can have higher fitness, as predicted by kin selection theory, through a commonly heritable trait (plant size), without requiring kin recognition mechanisms.","[Simonsen, Anna K.; Chow, Theresa; Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Ctr Anal Genome Evolut & Funct, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","Simonsen, AK (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",anna.simonsen@gmail.com,"Stinchcombe, John/A-2941-2008","Stinchcombe, John/0000-0003-3349-2964; Simonsen, Anna/0000-0002-5091-261X",NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; CFICanada Foundation for Innovation,"Grants from NSERC Canada, and CFI made this study possible.",,61,9,10,0,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We found phylogenetic signal in both net whole-soil feedback and feedback with AMF of conspecifics; conservatism was especially strong among native plants but absent among exotics. The abundance of plants in the field was also conserved, a pattern underlain by shared plant responses to soil biota.

Previous research has revealed links between groundwater depth and tree condition; however, critical thresholds which might indicate ecological 'tipping points' associated with rapid and potentially irreversible change have been difficult to quantify. This study collated data for two dominant floodplain species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum) and E. populnea (poplar box) from 118 sites in eastern Australia where significant groundwater decline has occurred. Boosted regression trees, quantile regression and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis were used to investigate the relationship between tree condition and groundwater depth. Distinct non-linear responses were found, with groundwater depth thresholds identified in the range from 12.1 m to 22.6 m for E. camaldulensis and 12.6 m to 26.6 m for E. populnea beyond which canopy condition declined abruptly. Non-linear threshold responses in canopy condition in these species may be linked to rooting depth, with chronic groundwater decline decoupling trees from deep soil moisture resources. The quantification of groundwater depth thresholds is likely to be critical for management aimed at conserving groundwater dependent biodiversity. Identifying thresholds will be important in regions where water extraction and drying climates may contribute to further groundwater decline. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We studied the impact of current forest expansion on mountain grassland on changes in physical soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions along a landuse and management gradient, focusing on changes in aggregate stability and particulate organic matter (POM). Methods Four successional stages were investigated: managed grassland, two transitional phases in which grassland abandonment led to colonization by Picea abies (L.) Karst., and old mixed forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica L. and P. abies. Soil samples collected from the mineral soil (05 cm, 510 cm, 1020 cm) were fractionated following two procedures: 1) aggregate size fractionation, separating aggregates based on their dimension, and 2) sizedensity fractionation, separating stable aggregates from nonoccluded POM. Results The dimension of aggregates assessed by aggregate size fractionation tended to increase, whereas SOC allocation to stable aggregates assessed by sizedensity fractionation decreased following conversion of grassland to forest (e. g. from 81 to 59 % in the 05 cm layer). The amount of SOC stored in POM increased by 3.8 Mg ha(-1) in the integrated 020 cm layer from managed grassland to old forest. Conclusions The combination of two physical SOC fractionation procedures revealed that natural forest succession on abandoned grasslands led to a decline in physical SOC stability in the mineral soil, suggesting that SOC can become more susceptible to management and environmental change.","[Guidi, Claudia; Rodeghiero, Mirco; Gianelle, Damiano] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sustainable Agroecosyst & Bioresources, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Guidi, Claudia; Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Magid, Jakob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Gianelle, Damiano] Foxlab Joint CNR FEM Initiat, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy","Guidi, C (reprint author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Sustainable Agroecosyst & Bioresources, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",claudia.guidi@fmach.it,"Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011; Magid, Jakob/C-4558-2013; Gianelle, Damiano/G-9437-2011; Rodeghiero, Mirco/G-8559-2011","Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Magid, Jakob/0000-0001-5867-0910; Gianelle, Damiano/0000-0001-7697-5793; Rodeghiero, Mirco/0000-0003-3228-4557",Fondazione Edmund Mach [AM08],"We thank Matteo Girardi, Preben Frederiksen, Xhevat Haliti, Mads Madsen Krag for their support in laboratory work, Jonas Duus Stevens Lekfeldt and Sander Bruun for their helpful collaboration.

The large number of parameters makes the calibration computationally expensive and is complicated by the dependence of several parameters on other parameters. Calibration can be simplified by first identifying those parameters for which GPP and NPP are most sensitive. For an appropriate application of a PBS, a sensitivity analysis is an essential step. Sensitivity analysis based on local derivatives (i.e., one-at-a-time analysis) does not examine the PBS behaviour over the whole parameter space. This study therefore implements a variance-based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) addressing the full range of PBS input. A VBSA is also independent of non-linearity in a PBS. This paper performs a VBSA of the process-based simulator BIOME-BGC for GPP and NPP output in a Douglas-fir stand at the Speulderbos forest site, The Netherlands. The results show that GPP and NPP are highly sensitive to the following parameters: fraction of leaf nitrogen in Rubisco, the ratio of fine root carbon to leaf carbon, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in leaf and fine root, the leaf and fine root turnover, the water interception coefficient and soil depth. GPP and NPP are particularly sensitive to the ratio of fine root carbon to leaf carbon that is responsible for leaf area index development. The study concludes that a VBSA analysis provides a reliable and useful approach for a sensitivity analysis of process-based simulators with a complicated structure in the parameters.

For complex ecosystems such as forests, these demands can in some cases not be met by field observations only, especially at larger scales. Additionally, methodological requirements include comparability and transparency. To satisfy these needs, models can provide an important supplement or alternative. We examined the validity of the litter decomposition and soil carbon model Yasso07 in Swiss forests based on data on observed decomposition of (i) foliage and fine root litter from sites along a climatic and altitudinal gradient and (ii) of 588 dead trees from 394 plots of the Swiss National Forest Inventory. Our objectives were to (i) examine the effect of the application of three different published Yasso07 parameter sets on simulated decay rate; (ii) analyze the accuracy of Yasso07 for reproducing observed decomposition of litter and dead wood in Swiss forests; and (iii) evaluate the suitability of Yasso07 for regional and national scale applications in Swiss forests. From the three examined parameter sets, the set was identified which resulted in the best agreement between Yasso07 results and observed decomposition. No significant differences were found between simulated and observed remaining C in foliage and fine root litter after 10 years and in lying dead trees after 14-21 years. The model overestimated the decomposition of standing dead trees. We concluded that Yasso07 can provide accurate information on temporal changes in C stocks in litter and deadwood in Swiss forests in a transparent manner that is valid for, e.g., reporting purposes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.

This work uses the root bundle model to assess the sensitivity of root-reinforcement estimation to the variability in both root mechanical properties and root distribution. We used a large data set of root tensile tests and root distributions of an important alpine species, Picea abies (L.) Karst., collected in a wide range of altitudinal and climatic ranges on both north and south sides of the alpine mountain range. The results demonstrate that the site-specific characterization of mechanical properties and root distribution is fundamental for the quantification of root reinforcement at the stand scale. Root diameter distribution plays a dominant role in influencing the root-reinforcement model's output; however, in contrast with results from other works, differences in root diameter-force functions are significant and cannot be ignored. Model results also show that coarse roots contribute significantly more to the reinforcement of soil than fine roots, underlying the need of additional data for roots with diameters larger than 5 mm.","[Vergani, C.; Bischetti, G.

We measured root and leaf traits on 14 species of calcareous grasslands in a restoration experiment. We aimed at identifying intraspecific differences in biomass allocation and functional plant traits under contrasting soil conditions by comparing plants growing in ancient grassland and two restored grasslands on ex-arable land, one of them with topsoil removal. Relative importance of trait variation within and among species, and among site was assessed by variance partitioning. Interspecific variation was more important than intraspecific variation, but the contribution of the latter to total variation was considerable, especially for specific leaf area. Changes in soil properties due to topsoil removal resulted in lower values of plant height, specific leaf area and specific root length compared to the control (ancient grassland). Soil fertility found in the treatment without top soil removal did not affect plant plasticity compared to the control. The study species showed two allocation strategies in relation to resource stress, while the responses of individual traits to the soil treatments were consistent across species. We conclude that caution must be taken when using mean trait values for plastic species or when working with environmental gradients.","[Andrade, Bianca O.; Overbeck, Gerhard E.; Boldrini, Ilsi I.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Bot, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Andrade, Bianca O.; Pilger, Gabriele E.; Hermann, Julia-Maria; Conradi, Timo; Kollmann, Johannes] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Restorat Ecol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Andrade, BO (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Grad Program Bot, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",andradebo@gmail.com,"Andrade, Bianca Ott/M-4030-2017; Kollmann, Johannes/B-4255-2012; Overbeck, Gerhard/D-8695-2013","Andrade, Bianca Ott/0000-0003-2945-1510; Kollmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4990-3636; Overbeck, Gerhard/0000-0002-8716-5136","CNPq ('Science without Borders Program'); German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KO 1741/2-1, KO 1741/2-2]","The study was supported by a CNPq ('Science without Borders Program') scholarship to BOA and additional funding, and a German Research Foundation grant to JK (KO 1741/2-1,2).

If root and shoot competition affect reproductive output in a population differently, this will influence the evolution of plant populations growing under various competitive regimes. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of root, shoot and full competition from naturally occurring surrounding vegetation on growth and reproduction of an annual plant, Chenopodium acuminatum, under low and high soil fertility. Root competition was eliminated by inserting a PVC pipe vertically into the soil around target individuals, and shoot competition was removed by installing inverted wire cones above-ground. Plants were measured after 11weeks of growth. The relationships between reproductive (R) and vegetative (V) biomass among treatments were compared. Without fertilizer, the competitive response of target plants to root competition was greater than that to shoot competition, while in the fertilized treatment, the opposite was the case. Fertilization increased target plant size under no or root competition, but did not affect mean plant size for individuals experiencing shoot or full competition. Variation in size among target plants was highest under shoot competition at high fertility. The slope of log R-log V relationship under fertilized conditions was significantly higher than without fertilizer addition. The slope was higher under shoot and full competition than under root or no competition at both fertility levels. There were many more small individuals when competition was for light than for soil resources. These small individuals developed more slowly and had fewer flowering branches and lower reproductive allocation at harvest than large individuals.Synthesis. Our results demonstrated that shoot competition affects the observed pattern of reproductive allometry among individuals in the field, and this has implications for the fitness of competing plants. The steeper log R-log V slope of populations competing above-ground may intensify the role of directional selection under light competition, making the effects of shoot competition more important than those of root competition for the evolution of weeds in fertile environments.","[Wang, Ping; Bian, Hong Feng; Sheng, Lian Xi] NE Normal Univ, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ping; Bian, Hong Feng; Sheng, Lian Xi] NE Normal Univ, Vegetat Restorat Sch Environm, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Weiner, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Zhou, Dao Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Song, Yan Tao] NE Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China","Wang, P (reprint author), NE Normal Univ, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.",wangp744@nenu.edu.cn,"Weiner, Jacob/E-1839-2011; Cahill, James F/B-6147-2015","Weiner, Jacob/0000-0002-0736-7943; Cahill, James F/0000-0002-4110-1516",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30970542]; National Environmental Protection Public Welfare Industry Research Fund [2011467032]; University of Copenhagen Program of Excellence,"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30970542), the National Environmental Protection Public Welfare Industry Research Fund (2011467032) and the University of Copenhagen Program of Excellence.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a nursery inoculation on Pinus pinaster growth and on the fungal communities established when reforesting burned areas. Inoculated P. pinaster saplings showed 1.5-fold higher stem height than the non-inoculated controls after a 5 year growth period, suggesting that fungal inoculation could potentiate tree growth in the field. Ordination analysis revealed the presence of different ECMF communities on both plots. Among the nursery-inoculated fungi, Laccaria sp., Rhizopogon sp., Suillus bovinus and Pisolithus sp. were detected on inoculated Pinus saplings on both sampling periods, indicating that they persisted after field establishment. Other fungi were also detected in the inoculated plants. Phialocephala sp. was found on the first assessment, while Terfezia sp. was detected on both sampling periods. Laccaria sp. and Rhizopogon sp. were identified in the control saplings, belonging however to different species than those found in the inoculated plot. Inocybe sp., Thelephora sp. and Paxillus involutus were present on both sampling periods in the non-inoculated plots. The results suggest that ECMF inoculation at nursery stage can benefit plant growth after transplantation to a post-fire site and that the inoculated fungi can persist in the field. This approach has great potential as a biotechnological tool to aid in the reforestation of burned areas.","[Franco, Albina R.; Sousa, Nadine R.; Ramos, Miguel A.; Oliveira, Rui S.; Castro, Paula M.

Plants from five families of Asclepias syriaca, a perennial forb, were grown under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Foliar herbivory by either lepidopteran caterpillars or phloem-feeding aphids was imposed. Mycorrhizal colonization, below-ground biomass, root biomass, and secondary defensive chemistry in roots were quantified. We observed substantial genetic variation among A. syriaca families in their mycorrhizal colonization levels in response to elevated CO2 and herbivory treatments. Elevated CO2 treatment increased root biomass in all genetic families, whereas foliar herbivory tended to decrease root biomass. Root cardenolide concentration and composition varied greatly among plant families, and elevated CO2 treatment increased root cardenolides in two of the five plant families. Moreover, herbivores differentially affected the composition of cardenolides expressed below ground. Increased atmospheric CO2 has the potential to influence interactions among plants, herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi and intraspecific variation suggests that such interactions can evolve.","[Vannette, Rachel L.; Hunter, Mark D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vannette, Rachel L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hunter, Mark D.] Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Vannette, RL (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 488 Herrin Labs,371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",raleva@stanford.edu; mdhunter@umich.edu,,"Vannette, Rachel/0000-0002-0447-3468; Hunter, Mark/0000-0003-3761-8237",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0814340]; NSF-IGERT (BART) Fellowship; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF),"The authors thank S.

Cours.) G. Don is an invasive legume that displaces populations of native N. American congeners. Our aims are to determine the growth benefits of different rhizobacterial strains for L. cuneata and native Lespedeza virginica (L.) Britton, and to determine if these strains influence competition between these plants. Plants were grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions in sterilized soil in pairs consisting of two L. cuneata, two L. virginica, or one of each species, and then plants were inoculated with one of seven rhizobial isolates, or with a no-strain control. After 3 months, plants were harvested for determination of biomass and nodulation rate. Five of the assayed stains improved L. cuneata biomass over uninoculated controls, but none of the strains benefited L. virginica. L. cuneata plants had more biomass and root nodules when grown in competition with L. virginica than with a conspecific. Asymmetrical benefits from these symbionts accrued to invasive L. cuneata but not to native L. virginica, and this may provide the invader with a growth advantage in the field. Changes in the availability of effective symbionts in the soils of invaded sites can shape performance of native and invasive plants.","[Hu, Lingzi; Yannarell, Anthony C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Busby, Ryan R.; Gebhart, Dick L.] US Army Engn Res & Dev Ctr, Construct Engn Res Lab, Champaign, IL USA","Yannarell, AC (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",acyann@illinois.edu,"Yannarell, Anthony/AAA-1720-2019",,"U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center [Army W9132T-09-2-0011]; Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [ILLU-875-317]","The authors acknowledge A.

Even though ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to be as important as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and saprotrophic fungi in contributing to soil structure, there are few experimental studies on this topic. Here we quantified how nine ectomycorrhizal fungi in association with Pious sylvestris seedlings affected soil aggregation and soil water repellency (SWR) of a sandy loamy soil. Water-stable aggregates (>0.25 mm diameter) increased by 6-12% when plants were associated with Laccaria bicolor, Laccaria laccata, Lactarius theiogalus, Paxillus involutus and Suillus bovinus. Mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates also increased, primarily in the 2-4 mm diameter size class. However, Suillus granulatus increased water-stable aggregates but not MWD, conversely Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus luteus increased MWD but not water-stable aggregates. We also found Lt. theiogalus, R. roseolus and S. luteus promoted SWR. Furthermore, hyphal length was weakly correlated with MWD (R = 0.27, P < 0.05), especially with aggregate mass in the 2-4 mm size class (R = 0.32, P < 0.05). However, we could not identify clear soil effects (soil pH, soil protein content) serving as explanation for either soil aggregation or SWR. Thus, we conclude that interactions between fungi and soil structure are a species-dependent processes based on yet to be characterized fungal traits. Our results have added further evidence from direct experimentation that ectomycorrhizal fungi can contribute to soil aggregation and SWR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a buried pot experiment that constructed two different systems for carbon (C) availability. We used two types of pots with or without a C. obtusa seedling. The former pots were used to make a system with soil including living roots (i.e. a system based on root-derived and litter-derived C), while the latter was equivalent to soil system without living roots (i.e. a system based on litter-derived C). After 8 months, we harvested the pots and examined the collembolan community and environmental factors. The presence of living roots affected collembolan abundance and species-specific responses. These changes could be explained in terms of leaf biomass of the seedlings, indicating a possible linkage between above-ground productivity and collembolan community. Given the possibility that root-derived C is associated with aboveground plant mass, we speculate that collembolan community responds to root-derived C. The three dominant species, which are widespread in Japanese temperate forests, were more abundant in the presence of living roots. Moreover they were positively correlated with leaf biomass in the system with a seedling, again suggesting the fundamental importance of living roots for the organisation of the collembolan community.

Here, we examined composition of bacterial communities associated with rhizosphere microsites located at the root tips and mature root zones of Lolium perenne when grown in Chilean ash-derived volcanic soils (Andisols: Freire and Piedras Negras soil series). Community structures were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes followed by in silico analysis for phylogenetic assignments (MOTHUR and Visualization tool for Taxonomic Compositions of Microbial Community (VITCOMIC)). Analysis of the community structure revealed significant differences in community structures in relation to the soil series, which differed particularly in the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. However, no significant differences were observed with respect to root microsite location in the same Andisol series. Predominant taxa included members of the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Analysis by VITCOMIC showed that dominant bacterial groups comprised only 5 to 10 % of the total bacterial community and the remaining majority of bacteria included low-abundant taxa (Fusobacteria, Thermotogae, Lentisphaerae, Tenericutes, Deferribacteres Spirochaetes, Planctomycetes, Thermotogae, and Deinococcus-Thermus), most of which have not been previously reported or associated with the plant rhizosphere according to GenBank database. The results indicate that most of bacteria in the Chilean Andisols have not been described to the rhizosphere plants and their functional traits are still largely unknown.","[Lagos, Lorena M.; Cid, Fernanda P.] Univ La Frontera, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Recursos Nat, Temuco 01145, Chile; [Navarrete, Oscar U.] Univ La Frontera, Programa Magister Ciencias Ingn Menc Biotecnol, Temuco 01145, Chile; [Maruyama, Fumito] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138510, Japan; [Crowley, David E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Mora, Maria L.; Jorquera, Milko A.] Univ La Frontera, Temuco 01145, Chile","Jorquera, MA (reprint author), Univ La Frontera, Ave Francisco Salazar, Temuco 01145, Chile.",milko.jorquera@ufrontera.cl,"Maruyama, Fumito/F-6875-2016; JORQUERA, MILKO/O-3038-2019","JORQUERA, MILKO/0000-0003-4760-6379; Crowley, David/0000-0002-1805-8599; Maruyama, Fumito/0000-0003-2347-616X","FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120505, 1141247]; supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC at Centro de Modelacion y Computacion Cientifica at Universidad de La Frontera (CMCC-UFRO) [ECM-02]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21120698]",This study was supported by FONDECYT Project no. 1120505 and 1141247.

Since the beginning of the study, atmospheric CO2 increased 18%, sea level rose 20cm, and growing season temperature varied with approximately the same range as predicted for global warming in the 21st century. This review looks back at this study for clues about how the effects of rising sea level, temperature, and precipitation interact with high atmospheric CO2 to alter the physiology of C3 and C4 photosynthetic species, carbon assimilation, evapotranspiration, plant and ecosystem nitrogen, and distribution of plant communities in this brackish wetland. Rising sea level caused a shift to higher elevations in the Scirpus olneyi C3 populations on the wetland, displacing the Spartina patens C4 populations. Elevated CO2 stimulated carbon assimilation in the Scirpus C3 species measured by increased shoot and root density and biomass, net ecosystem production, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, and methane production. But elevated CO2 also decreased biomass of the grass, S.patens C4. The elevated CO2 treatment reduced tissue nitrogen concentration in shoots, roots, and total canopy nitrogen, which was associated with reduced ecosystem respiration. Net ecosystem production was mediated by precipitation through soil salinity: high salinity reduced the CO2 effect on net ecosystem production, which was zero in years of severe drought. The elevated CO2 stimulation of shoot density in the Scirpus C3 species was sustained throughout the 28years of the study. Results from this study suggest that rising CO2 can add substantial amounts of carbon to ecosystems through stimulation of carbon assimilation, increased root exudates to supply nitrogen fixation, reduced dark respiration, and improved water and nitrogen use efficiency.","Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Drake, BG (reprint author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",drakeb@si.edu,,,"US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG05-85ER60374, DE-FG05-87ER13652, DE-FG02-95ER61993]; NSF-LTREBNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0950080]; Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0008339]","I wish to gratefully acknowledge the guidance of Dr Lee-Ann Hayek on statistical analyses and manuscript preparation and Dr Lu Meng for assistance with data records.

The study system was a semi-arid grassland with high plant diversity and a steep environmental gradient in pH, C, N, P and soil water content. The AMF community in roots and rhizosphere soil were analyzed separately and consisted of 74 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in total. Community-level variance partitioning showed that the role of environmental factors in determining AM species composition was marginal when controlling for spatial autocorrelation at multiple scales. Instead, phylogenetic distance and spatial distance were major correlates of AMF communities: OTUs that were more closely related (and which therefore may have similar traits) were more likely to co-occur. This pattern was insensitive to phylogenetic sampling breadth. Given the minor effects of the environment, we propose that at small scales closely related AMF positively associate through biotic factors such as plant-AMF filtering and interactions within the soil biota.","[Horn, Sebastian; Verbruggen, Erik; Rillig, Matthias C.; Hempel, Stefan] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Okol Pflanzen, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Horn, Sebastian; Verbruggen, Erik; Rillig, Matthias C.; Hempel, Stefan] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany; [Caruso, Tancredi] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland","Hempel, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol Okol Pflanzen, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",hempel.stefan@gmail.com,"Verbruggen, Erik/A-5351-2012; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Caruso, Tancredi/0000-0002-3607-9609; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515; Horn, Sebastian/0000-0001-7812-5813",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG),"We thank Janis Antonovics for his insightful and inspiring comments on the manuscript, as well as the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for their generous financial support.",,70,55,55,0,120,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1751-7362,1751-7370,,ISME J,ISME J.,NOV,2014,8,11,,,,,2231,2242,,10.1038/ismej.2014.72,,,12,Ecology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,AS7SB,WOS:000344454000007,24824667,Green Published,,,10/31/19J,"Olmo, M; Lopez-Iglesias, B; Villar, R",,,,"Olmo, Manuel; Lopez-Iglesias, Barbara; Villar, Rafael",,,Drought changes the structure and elemental composition of very fine roots in seedlings of ten woody tree species.

Climate change predictions for many areas suggest an intensification of water limitation. The ability of a plant to modify its root characteristics can be an important mechanism for preventing drought stress. We studied the drought response of seedlings of 10 woody species and compared the biomass allocation, vertical root distribution across different root diameters, and the key traits of very fine roots (root diameter < 0.5 mm) under two water regimes (no water limitation and severe drought). Under drought conditions, the very fine roots had a higher specific root length (SRL, root length: biomass ratio), smaller root diameter and higher root tissue mass density, as well as a lower nitrogen concentration. A higher value of the mean root plasticity index was related to higher drought resistance. A quantitative literature review showed that there was a wide variation in the effect of the drought on SRL, thus there was not a clear effect of drought on SRL. Certain species have the necessary root traits and plasticity to survive drought. We have identified plasticity in root characteristics as a whole-plant trait which plays a significant role in separating out species into those which are vulnerable and those which are resistant to drought.","[Olmo, Manuel; Lopez-Iglesias, Barbara; Villar, Rafael] Univ Cordoba, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, Cordoba 14071, Spain","Villar, R (reprint author), Univ Cordoba, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",bv1vimor@uco.es,"Villar, Rafael/F-7507-2010","Villar, Rafael/0000-0002-3895-9984","FPI-MEC pre-doctoral fellowship [BES-2009-016985]; Spanish MECMinistry of Education and Science, Spain [CGL2008-04503-CO3-02, CGL2011-30285-C02-02]; ANASINQUE project [PGC2010-RNM-5782]; Life + Biodehesa Project [11/BIO/ES/000726]; FEDEREuropean Union (EU)Instituto de Salud Carlos III","This study was supported by an FPI-MEC pre-doctoral fellowship awarded to BL (BES-2009-016985), the coordinated Spanish MEC projects INTERBOS (CGL2008-04503-CO3-02) and DIVERBOS (CGL2011-30285-C02-02), the ANASINQUE project (PGC2010-RNM-5782), the Life + Biodehesa Project (11/BIO/ES/000726) and FEDER funding.

Due to the longevity and larger dimensions of tree species, pot experiments with trees raise more problems than studies with herbaceous plants. We analysed 93 studies on pot experiments with woody forest species and provide an overview of their practical implementation. The literature review revealed that various factors should be taken into account in providing good growing conditions for pot experiments, including pot size, substrate, plant age and origin, and transplanting effects. Many studies did not follow existing recommendations, e. g. an appropriate pot size. Therefore, the transferability of the experimental results to natural conditions is limited and could be improved. We propose that investigation of tree response in pot experiments should be combined with additional measurements under natural conditions. Unfortunately, many papers using pot experiments did not provide complete information on the experimental set-up, making an evaluation on the quality of pot experiments difficult. We conclude that authors should provide more detailed information on the methodology that can be used to repeat or design future pot experiments.","[Kawaletz, Heike] Thunen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Moelder, Inga] Energieagentur Reg Gottingen EV, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Annighoefer, Peter; Terwei, Andre] Univ Gottingen, Dept Silviculture & Forest Ecol Temperate Zones, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Zerbe, Stefan; Ammer, Christian] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy","Kawaletz, H (reprint author), Thunen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany.",heike.kawaletz@ti.bund.de,,"Ammer, Christian/0000-0002-4235-0135",Marianne and Dr Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft,This research was funded by the Marianne and Dr Fritz-Walter Fischer Foundation within the Stifterverband fur die Deutsche Wissenschaft.,,81,13,13,0,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,1464-3626,,FORESTRY,Forestry,OCT,2014,87,4,,,,,482,491,,10.1093/forestry/cpu017,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,AQ8EF,WOS:000343055800002,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Veresoglou, SD; Powell, JR; Davison, J; Lekberg, Y; Rillig, MC",,,,"Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Powell, Jeff R.; Davison, John; Lekberg, Ylva; Rillig, Matthias C.",,,The Leinster and Cobbold indices improve inferences about microbial diversity,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Bootstrapping; Hill numbers; Phylogenetic taxa similarity,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITIES; EVENNESS; SCALE,"An increasing number of ecological studies compare the diversity of microbial taxa along environmental gradients or between imposed treatments. Estimates are often based on analysis-of-variance of taxon-richness inferred from pyrosequencing data. We conducted a reanalysis of three 454-pyrosequencing studies on arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungal diversity to evaluate the suitability of using the Leinster and Cobbold diversity-indices (LCdis) to assess diversity. We expected that the potential of LCdis to consider phylogenic relationships could resolve problems arising from ambiguous species-delineation in microbial-systems. Our reanalysis showed that comparisons between studies differing considerably in sequencing depth may be risky. Moreover, we show that LCdis not only reproduce the results of analyses of variance but can also resolve issues connected to variation in sequence read number, while additionally representing a less conservative metric of diversity than analysis-of-variance of taxa-richness. Based on these results we advocate the use of inclusive diversity indices in ecological studies targeting microbial communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Investigation on RSA holds potentials for studying the adaptation of plants to environmental stresses and to interspecific competitions. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has provided a non-invasive method for studying in situ RSA. However, previous GPR method relied on manually connecting root points detected between radargrams to restore each root branch, resulting in limited accuracy and efficiency of reconstructing RSA. The objective of this study is to improve the effectiveness of 3D RSA reconstruction using GPR root detection data. A total of 213 coarse root sections (with diameter > 0.5 cm) were extracted from a distribution map of a reference shrub (Arctostaphylos pungens) root system to simulate the coarse roots identified by GPR. An automatic method was established to trace each root point to its optimum growing source point. Connections between discrete root points recovered the topology of the reference RSA. A spline curve smoothing method was applied to restore the 3D morphology of the reference RSA. The proposed protocol was then tested to rebuild the 3D RSA of a shrub (Caragana microphylla) growing in the sandy soils after in situ GPR survey. The accuracy of RSA reconstruction was quantitatively evaluated by a relationship matrix method and qualitatively assessed by direct comparisons between the reconstructed and the actual RSAs after in situ excavation. For both simulated and field collected GPR detection datasets, the reconstructed RSAs strongly corresponded to the real topology of the actual root systems. When adapting the best strategy, 186 of the 213 (87.32 %) root points on the reference root system of A. pungens were interlinked with correct topology, and the relationship matrix method detected an overall similarity of 82.75 % between the reconstructed and the actual RSAs. The proposed automatic RSA reconstruction method greatly enhances the interpretation of GPR detection data regarding coarse roots, making in situ non-invasive and long-term mapping and monitoring of RSA possible.","[Wu, Yuan; Cui, Xihong; Chen, Jin; Cao, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Guo, Li; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lin, Henry] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Cui, XH (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cuixihong@bnu.edu.cn,"Guo, Li/B-7820-2016; Lin, Henry/E-8234-2011; Guo, Li/P-2690-2014; Cao, Xin/P-3814-2014; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; cui, xihong/E-8735-2015","Guo, Li/0000-0003-3821-4058; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; ",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41001239]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities by Beijing Normal University [2013NT39]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41001239), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities by Beijing Normal University (Grant No. 2013NT39), and the State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology.

While monocultures have dominated forest research and practice in the past, in face of growing resource scarcity and climate change, mixed-species stands are on the advance. Long-term observations show that mixed-species stands frequently over-yield monocultures, and they further suggest that the over-yielding is often higher on poor than on fertile sites and in low-growth than in high-growth years. However, the underlying causes have not yet been clarified. We start with a review of, among others, hydraulic redistribution, complementary eco-physiological traits, and ectomycorrhizal networks as possible causes behind the observed productivity gains in mixed-species stands. Then, we develop guiding hypotheses for further exploration of synergies in mixed-species stands. Finally, we introduce into the concept and model approach of the rainfall exclusion experiment for examining the role of water supply in mixed versus pure forest stands of spruce and beech. At the Kranzberg site, six plots are equipped with water retention roofs, which only close during rain events. The remaining six plots serve as non-roofed control. Together with the rainfall exclusion experiment, an ecological gradient with five sites extending through SE-Germany forms the ""Kranzberg Roof Experiment"" (in short KROOF). Kranzberg Forest is a part of this gradient from moist to dry conditions, with each site providing mixed and pure associations each of spruce and beech. The ecophysiological approach will be complemented by tree ring analysis and modelling of productivity of the tree associations under intense drought.","[Pretzsch, H.; Roetzer, T.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Bavaria, Germany; [Matyssek, R.; Grams, T.

We used C-13-labelled glucose as a model C compound representing root exudates to follow the incorporation of root-derived C into the soil animal food web of a temperate grassland over a period of 52 weeks. We investigated variations in glucose C incorporation with fertilizer addition and sward composition, i.e. variations in plant functional groups. The approach allowed the differentiation of trophic chains based on primary decomposers feeding on litter and phytophagous species feeding on roots (i.e. not incorporating glucose C) from those based on secondary decomposers feeding on microorganisms (thereby assimilating glucose C). Each of the studied soil animal species incorporated glucose C, indicating that the majority of grassland soil animal species rely on microorganisms as food resources with microorganisms being fuelled by root exudates. However, incorporation of glucose C into soil animal species varied markedly with species identity, suggesting that detritivorous microarthropods complement each other in channelling microbial C through soil food webs. Fertilizer addition markedly reduced the concentration of glucose C in most soil animal species as well as the absolute transfer of glucose C into oribatid mites as major secondary decomposers. The results suggest that fertilizer addition shifts the basis of the decomposer food web towards the use of unlabelled resources, presumably roots, i.e. towards a herbivore system, thereby lessening the link between microorganisms and microbial grazers and hampering the propagation of microbial C to higher trophic levels.","[Lemanski, Kathleen; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Lemanski, K (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Berliner Str 28, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",klemans@gwdg.de,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015","Lemanski, Kathleen/0000-0002-8496-9796",Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony; Niedersachsisches Vorab,"The study formed part of the Cluster of Excellence Functional Biodiversity Research funded by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony and the Niedersachsisches Vorab.

One-year-old seedlings were sampled in six study sites: three mature fir forests and three pine forests. ECM fungi were identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of rDNA. The mean mycorrhizal colonization exceeded 90 %. Thirty-six ectomycorrhizal taxa were identified in fir stands and 23 in pine forecrops; ten out of these species were common to both stands. The fungal communities were different between study sites (R = 0.1721, p = 0.0001). Tomentella stuposa was the only species present at all sites. Silver fir seedlings in Scots pine forecrops supported smaller ECM fungal communities than communities identified in mature silver fir stands. Nevertheless, fungal colonization of seedling roots was similar in both cases. This suggests that pine stands afforested on formerly arable land bear enough ECM species to allow survival and growth of silver fir seedlings.","[Wazny, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland","Wazny, R (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Malopolska Ctr Biotechnol, Ul Gronostajowa 7A, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.",rafal.wazny@uj.edu.pl,"Wazny, Rafal/U-4360-2018","Wazny, Rafal/0000-0002-3213-3583",University of Agriculture in Krakow (Department of Forest Pathology) [BZ 573/KFL]; Jagiellonian University in Krakow funds [DS/758/UJ],"The present research was supported by the University of Agriculture in Krakow (Department of Forest Pathology), Project BZ 573/KFL (2008-2011).

Here, we used the model system Plantago lanceolata, which grows along steep elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps, to investigate the effect of elevation, herbivore pressure, mycorrhizal inoculation and temperature on plant resistance. Over a 1200 m elevation gradient, the levels of herbivory and iridoid glycosides (IGs) declined with increasing elevation. By planting seedlings at three different elevations, we further showed that both low-elevation growing conditions and mycorrhizal inoculation resulted in increased plant resistance to herbivores. Finally, using a temperature-controlled experiment comparing high- and low-elevation ecotypes, we showed that high-elevation ecotypes are less resistant to herbivory, and that lower temperatures impair IGs deployment after herbivore attack. We thus propose that both lower herbivore pressure, and colder temperatures relax the defense syndrome of high elevation plants.","[Pellissier, Loic] Univ Fribourg, Unit Ecol & Evolut, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Roger, Aurelien] Res Stn Agroscope ACW Changins Wadenswil, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Bilat, Julia; Rasmann, Sergio] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, UNIL Sorge, Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Pellissier, L (reprint author), Univ Fribourg, Unit Ecol & Evolut, Ch Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",srasmann@uci.edu,"Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015; Rasmann, Sergio/T-5376-2017","Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259; Rasmann, Sergio/0000-0002-3120-6226",National Science Foundation Ambizione grant [PZ00P3_131956/1]; Danish FNUDanish Natural Science Research Council [12-126430],"We are grateful to Julien Leuenberger and Quentin Aeberli for help with data collection and to Will Petry, Scott McArt, and Anurag Agrawal for commenting on previous versions of the manuscript.

To determine how live biomass and C pools in montane forests vary along an elevation gradient, the biomass and C content of fir trees (Abies georgei), the most widespread forest type on the Tibetan Plateau, were measured from 3100 m asl to 4400 m asl. The total live biomass of the forest nonlinearly declined by 66.2% with the elevation gradient, with most of the biomass reduction (covering almost 94% of the total reduction) occurring at altitudes lower than 3400 m asl and at altitudes above 3900 m asl, and the C concentration of the aboveground components (stems, leaves and branches) of A. georgei were positively correlated with the biomass variation along an elevation gradient. The total C pool of A. georgei (stand and root C) decreased from 259.73 +/- 11.75 t C/ha at 3100 m asl to 87.29 +/- 8.21 t C/ha at 4300 m asl, whereas the biomass C pool allocation in the roots increased by 2.5% at the same altitude. A possible explanation for these marked shifts in the biomass and C allocation from above to belowground along an increasing elevation gradient is discussed, including the limitation of the N supply and the effect of lower temperatures. The annual air temperature and precipitation were positively correlated with the live biomass and C stocks along an elevation gradient. The live biomass C is allocated more to aboveground components with increasing temperature and precipitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, stresses such as drought and aboveground herbivory might lead to conflicting resource allocation patterns and pronounced shifts in shoot vs. root defenses. In the present study, the effects of water availability and leaf herbivory by caterpillars of a generalist on various shoot and root traits of the aromatic plant Tanacetum vulgare L. were investigated. This species contains terpenoids in leaves and roots, which can differ in composition among individuals, forming so-called chemotypes. To test for intraspecific variation, responses were investigated in two chemotypes, the thujone and the carvyl acetate chemotype. Furthermore, effects of differences in plant quality on the herbivores were studied. Shoot biomass significantly decreased due to drought and herbivory, whereas the root/shoot ratio increased following drought but was unaffected by herbivory. No shifts in C/N ratios were found. In contrast to our expectation, leaf terpenoid concentrations decreased only slightly due to drought, whereas root terpenoids were significantly induced by both drought and herbivory. Chemotypes showed distinct responses to drought at least in the root/shoot ratio, with a higher drought sensitivity of the carvyl acetate chemotype. The body mass of the caterpillars was unaffected by the irrigation treatment but depended on chemotype and terpenoid concentration of the plants. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative defenses strongly affect herbivore development. The present results offer new insights into the above- and belowground organ-specific responses of plants.

An artificial exudation system was also set up in which octopine was brought at four ratios. The density of octopine-degrading bacteria directly correlated with the input of octopine. Bacterial diversity was analysed by rrs amplicon pyrosequencing. Ensifer and Pseudomonas were significantly more frequently detected in soil amended with artificial exudates.

We hypothesized plant species that survived in different karst habitats had some other rooting characteristics rather than deep penetration. To test the hypothesis, coarse root systems of two widely distributed woody species (one tree and one shrub) growing in three typical rocky karst habitats (shallow soil, loose rocky soil and exposed rock) were excavated in karst region of southwest China. Root systems were investigated based on four parameters: maximum rooting depth, maximum radial extent, root tapering pattern and root curvature. In all the three habitats, maximum rooting depths were no deeper than 120 and 40 cm for the tree and shrub species, respectively. Maximum radial extents were extremely large compared with maximum rooting depth, indicating that rooting characteristics were dominated by horizontal extension rather than deep penetration. Roots of both species growing in shallow soil habitat tapered gradually and curved slightly, which was consistent with the specific characteristics of this habitat. On the contrary, roots of the tree species growing in the other two habitats tapered rapidly but curved slightly, while roots of the shrub species tapered gradually but curved strongly. It was speculated that limited depths and rapid tapering rates of the tree roots were likely compensated by their utmost radial extensions, while the shrub species might benefit from its root curvature as the associated root tropisms may increase the ability of root to encounter more water and contribute to potentially high resource absorption efficiency. Our results highlight the importance of taking shallow-rooted species into account in understanding the distribution of natural plant communities and predicting future vegetation dynamics in karst regions.","[Nie, Yun-peng; Chen, Hong-song; Wang, Ke-lin; Ding, Ya-li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Nie, Yun-peng; Chen, Hong-song; Wang, Ke-lin; Ding, Ya-li] Chinese Acad Sci, Huanjiang Observat & Res Stn Karst Ecosyst, Huanjiang 547100, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Chen, HS (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hbchs@isa.ac.cn,,"Chen, Hongsong/0000-0002-0310-0088","Chinese Academy of Sciences Action Plan for Development of Western China [KZCX2-XB3-10]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41171187, 31100294]; ""Western Light"" Program of Talent Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [ISACX-LYQY-QN-1201]","This research was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Action Plan for Development of Western China (KZCX2-XB3-10), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41171187 and 31100294), the ""Western Light"" Program of Talent Cultivation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Knowledge Innovation Program (ISACX-LYQY-QN-1201) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Despite this, very little is known about how microbes respond to changes in soil structure and vegetation with land use and land cover change. This study aimed to identify relationships between microbial community composition and the distribution of SOM among soil aggregate fractions to answer the following research questions: (1) Are different microbial groups associated with different SOM pools? and (2) How do these relationships differ with changes in vegetation during tropical forest succession? We measured microbial composition via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and C and nitrogen (N) concentrations on physically separated aggregate fractions of soils from pastures, secondary forests (40 and 90 years old) naturally regrowing on abandoned pastures, and reference or primary forests in Puerto Rico. We found different microbial communities associated with different soil aggregate fractions. Fungal to bacterial ratios decreased and gram-positive to gram-negative bacterial ratios increased with decreasing physical fraction size (from the macroaggregates to the silt and clay fractions). Microbial composition also varied with land cover type and forest successional stage, with consistent trends among soil fractions. These results show that the soil matrix and soil microsite properties play an important role in the spatial distribution of fungal and bacterial-dominated communities. The similarities in land cover effects on microbial communities at different spatial scales suggest similar controls may be influencing microbial composition with potential implications for SOM storage and turnover. In addition, the majority of C and N (relative to total soil C and fraction mass) was isolated in the macroaggregate-occluded silt and clay-sized fractions, suggesting that association with mineral surfaces, and not occlusion of particulate organic matter within aggregates, is the dominant stabilization mechanism for SOM in these highly-weathered, fine-textured soils. These results highlight the importance of soil aggregation in C storage but through mechanisms different than those reported for temperate grassland soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Loss of carbon from root-exuded organic acids, which are derived from plant net photosynthetic products, is generally considered negligible. The present study aimed to study the characteristics of root-exuded organic acids, extraction of phosphorus (P extraction) in calcareous soil and the expression of organic carbon from root-exuded organic acids in two woody Moraceae plants (Broussonetia papyrifera L. Vent and Morus alba L.) and two herbaceous cruciferous plants (Orychophragmus violaceus L. Schulz and Brassica napus L.) under two P levels (P-normal and P-deficient). P extraction and the amount of root-exuded organic acids simultaneously and disproportionately increased in the four plant species tested under P deficiency. The maximum P-extracting capability of the four plant species was observed after 40days of treatment. Additionally, the response of root-exuded organic acids induced by P deficiency was species-specific. B. papyrifera extracted more P in calcareous soil, and expended less organic acid for the same P-extraction than M. alba. Similarly, O. violaceus extracted more P in calcareous soil, and consumed less organic acid for the same level of P-extraction than B. napus. Root-exuded oxalic and malic acids accounted for most of the increment of P extraction in woody Moraceae plants, while root-exuded citric acid accounted for most of the increment in P extraction in herbaceous cruciferous plants. B. papyrifera and O. violaceus exhibited the strongest P-extracting capability at lower expense of organic carbon over the treatment duration in the four plant species. O. violaceus had the most rapid response of root-exuded organic acids to P deficiency, while B. napus had the slowest response. Thus, rapid response with low organic carbon cost and high efficiency of extraction on P in calcareous soil may underlie the strong adaptability of B. papyrifera and O. violaceus to a Karst environment.","[Zhao, Kuan; Wu, Yanyou] Jiangsu Univ, Key Lab Modern Agr Equipment & Technol, Chinese Minist Educ, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanyou] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China","Wu, YY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China.",wuyanyou@vip.gyig.ac.cn,,,National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956701]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31070365]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Graduate Innovative Cultivation of Jiangsu University [CXLX11-0596],"This research was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB956701), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31070365), the Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions and the Project Funded by Graduate Innovative Cultivation of Jiangsu University (No. CXLX11-0596).",,40,6,10,2,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

This article presents a trait-based multi-criteria framework to evaluate and predict the performance of 17 plant seedlings to improve ecological restoration of marly eroded areas in the French Southern Alps. The suitability of these species to limit soil erosion was assessed by studying both their response to erosive forces and their effect on erosion dynamics. We assumed that species efficiency could be explained and predicted from plant traits and we looked for trait-performance relationships. Our results showed that root slenderness ratio, the percentage of fine roots and root system topology, were the three root morphology traits best describing anchorage strength. Root system characterized by a long and thin tap root and many fine lateral ramifications would be the best to resist concentrated runoff. Species response to burial mainly depended on growth form and morphological flexibility. The abilities of species in reinforcing the soil and reducing erosion rates were negatively correlated to root diameter and positively to the percentage of fine roots. Moreover, root system density and root tensile strength also influenced root reinforcement. Finally, the ability to trap sediment was positively correlated to leaf area and canopy density. Species were then scored and classified in four clusters according to their global performance. This method allows identifying species that possess both response and effect traits related to the goal of preventing erosion during ecological restoration.","[Burylo, Melanie; Rey, Freddy] Irstea Grenoble, UR EMGR, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Dutoit, Thierry] IUT Avignon, UMR CNRS, IMBE, F-84911 Avignon 09, France","Rey, F (reprint author), Irstea Grenoble, UR EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",freddy.rey@irstea.fr,"Dutoit, Thierry/AAB-7398-2019","Dutoit, Thierry/0000-0001-9461-9215","Electricite de France (EDF); Mediterranee et CorseRegion Corse; Region Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'AzurRegion Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; European Union (FEDER program ""L'Europe s'engage en PACA avec le Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional"")European Union (EU); Agence de l'eau Rhone","We thank S.

Although predominately comprised of planted forest, post-1989 forest also contains a component of natural vegetation amounting to less than 10% by area. New Zealand undertook a national inventory of this natural stratum of post-1989 forest to provide estimates of carbon stocks and stock change in woody species over the first commitment period (2008-2012) of the Kyoto Protocol. Plots were installed on a 4-km grid, and the basal diameters and heights of trees and shrubs were measured for the first time from November 2012, to March 2013. Carbon stocks in 2012 were calculated using allometric functions developed from biomass samples from each site. Basal disc samples provided data on diameter increment and shrub and tree age annually from 1990 to 2012. These were used to predict carbon stocks per ha for individual plots in 2008 and to provide annual predictions by pool back to 1990. Carbon stocks summed across live and dead biomass pools (excluding soil) averaged 3.04, 16.70 and 28.73 t C/ha in 1990, 2008 and 2012, respectively. The disposition by pool was 2.25, 12.54 and 21.84 t C/ha in aboveground biomass, 0.56, 3.13 and 5.46 t C/ha in belowground biomass (using a root/shoot ratio of 0.25), 0.03, 0.17 and 0.23 t C/ha in deadwood, and 0.18, 0.86 and 1.21 t C/ha in litter in 1990, 2008 and 2012, respectively. In 1990, the woody biomass stock estimate per plot ranged from zero to 40 t C/ha and averaged 3.04 t C/ha across all plots. The methodology used to predict annual carbon stocks required an assumption concerning stem annual mortality. Sensitivity analysis suggested that varying this assumption had only a minor impact on predicted carbon stocks and changes. Plant age varied markedly within and between the natural forest plots, and therefore, the mean age of woody vegetation at each site was obtained by setting a threshold woody biomass carbon stock that needed to be achieved, and vegetation age was calculated as years since the threshold was achieved. This threshold approach facilitated the development of a yield table for predicting carbon (t/ha) as a function of vegetation mean age.","[Beets, Peter N.; Kimberley, Mark O.; Paul, Thomas S.

This can displace males and females from their respective fitness optima, and negative intersexual correlations (rmf) for fitness are the unequivocal indicator of this evolutionary conflict. It has recently been suggested that intersexual fitness correlations can vary depending on the segregating genetic variation present in a population, and one way to alter genetic variation and test this idea is via inbreeding. Here, we test whether intersexual correlations for fitness vary with inbreeding in Drosophila simulans isolines reared under homogenous conditions. We measured male and female fitness at different times following the establishment of isofemale lines and found that the sign of the association between the two measures varied with time after initial inbreeding. Our results are consistent with suggestions that the type of genetic variation segregating within a population can determine the extent of intralocus sexual conflict and also support the idea that sexually antagonistic alleles segregate for longer in populations than alleles with sexually concordant effects.","[Duffy, Eoin; Joag, Richa; Radwan, Jacek] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Wedell, Nina; Hosken, David J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Tremough TR10 9FE, Penryn, England","Hosken, DJ (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Tremough TR10 9FE, Penryn, England.",d.j.hosken@exeter.ac.uk,,"Radwan, Jacek/0000-0001-8503-5701",Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)Foundation for Polish Science; NERC (UK)NERC Natural Environment Research Council,Funded by the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP) and with the support of NERC (UK).,,80,6,6,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Soil aggregate stability is one of the drivers of gully erosion and needs to be studied, especially in the context of both tree encroachment and gully erosion. This study compared the effects of tree encroachment [paperbark thorn; Vachellia sieberiana (DC.) Kyal. & Boatwr. previously called Acacia sieberiana DC.] and soil surface horizon properties on the aggregate stability (as measured by mean weight diameter, MWD) in a degraded semihumid grassland in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Soil properties from under trees (UT) and open areas (OA) of both an Entisol within deep gullies (locally called dongas) and Alfisol from grasslands outside the gullies (grassland). The MWD values were higher in the grassland (3.06 +/- 0.21 mm) than in the dongas (1.84 +/- 1.03 mm). In the grassland, the MWD was significantly higher in the OA than UT, associated with more fine roots in the OA. In the donga, soil properties UT were not significantly different than those in OA. The soil aggregate stability showed strong local variability that depends on the age of the donga and the nature of the material that composes the pediments. Illite was associated with higher MWD values. The presence of interstratified illite-vermiculite located in active donga increases the shrink-swell potential of the aggregates, exacerbating their dispersion reflected in the low MWD values measured, especially when C and root contents were also low. These results suggest that the local soil clay mineralogy controls the orientation and extension of gullies rather than soil chemistry, topography, or the size of the drainage area.","[Podwojewski, Pascal; Grellier, Seraphine] IRD UMR 242 IEES Paris, F-93143 Bondy, France; [Podwojewski, Pascal; Grellier, Seraphine; Mthimkhulu, Sandile; Titshall, Louis] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa; [Grellier, Seraphine] Univ Sci & Technol Hanoi, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Titshall, Louis] Inst Commercial Forestry Res, ZA-3209 Scottsville, South Africa","Podwojewski, P (reprint author), IRD UMR 242 IEES Paris, 32 Ave H Varagnat, F-93143 Bondy, France.",pascal.podwojewski@ird.fr,"Titshall, Louis/P-8099-2019; Titshall, Louis/F-3879-2012","Titshall, Louis/0000-0001-6958-6335; Titshall, Louis/0000-0001-6958-6335; PODWOJEWSKI, Pascal/0000-0002-0812-5751",Institute of Research and Development (IRD)Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF),We would like to thank the Institute of Research and Development (IRD) for its financial support as well as the University of KwaZulu-Natal for its technical support.

Quantification of major inputs and losses of autochthonous SOC through process-based measurements would allow for better comparisons between riparian and upland systems. In this study, we quantified major soil C fluxes within five paired headwater riparian and upland sites in Rhode Island. The difference between total C inputs and losses were used to construct net annual landscape-scale SOC sequestration rates. Annual SOC inputs were statistically similar between landscapes, with the exception of those from understory herbaceous vegetation, which were significantly greater (p < 0.001) in riparian zones than uplands. Mean annual C losses via soil respiration were also statistically similar between landscapes, but estimates of microbial respiration (actual loss of SOC) were significantly less (p < 0.01) in riparian ecosystems. Thus, riparian forests had greater net annual SOC sequestration (range 2.4-3.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) than paired upland sites (range 0.4-2.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our results suggest that process-based SOC sequestration measures can yield similar results to traditional methods, such as chronosequences, but our averaged estimates (2.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were greater than those typically reported using alternate approaches.","[Ricker, Matthew C.] Bloomsburg Univ Penn, Dept Environm Geog & Geol Sci, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA; [Stolt, Mark H.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Zavada, Michael S.] Seton Hall Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA","Stolt, MH (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",mstolt@uri.edu,,"Ricker, Matthew/0000-0002-0837-7588",USDA National Research Initiative Competitive Grants ProgramUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2007-35107-17799],"The authors are grateful for field and laboratory assistance provided by Mathew Lautenberger, Alex Salisbury, Chrissy Pruett, David Millar, and Kimberly Devlin.

For these reasons, understanding the changes in size, distribution and tissue chemistry of roots is central to predicting the ability of forests to capture anthropogenic CO2. We sampled 8000 cm(3) soil monoliths in a pine forest exposed to 14 years of free-air-CO2-enrichment and 6 years of nitrogen (N) fertilization to determine changes in root length, biomass, tissue C : N and mycorrhizal colonization. CO2 fumigation led to greater root length (98%) in unfertilized plots, but root biomass increases under elevated CO2 were only found for roots <1 mm in diameter in unfertilized plots (59%). Neither fine root [C] nor [N] was significantly affected by increased CO2. There was significantly less root biomass in N-fertilized plots (19%), but fine root [N] and [C] both increased under N fertilization (29 and 2%, respectively). Mycorrhizal root tip biomass responded positively to CO2 fumigation in unfertilized plots, but was unaffected by CO2 under N fertilization. Changes in fine root [N] and [C] call for further study of the effects of N fertilization on fine root function. Here, we show that the stimulation of pine roots by elevated CO2 persisted after 14 years of fumigation, and that trees did not rely exclusively on increased mycorrhizal associations to acquire greater amounts of required N in CO2-enriched plots. Stimulation of root systems by CO2 enrichment was seen primarily for fine root length rather than biomass. This observation indicates that studies measuring only biomass might overlook shifts in root systems that better reflect treatment effects on the potential for soil resource uptake. These results suggest an increase in fine root exploration as a primary means for acquiring additional soil resources under elevated CO2.","[Taylor, Benton N.; Strand, Allan E.; Cooper, Emily R.; Beidler, Katilyn V.; Schoenholz, Marcos; Pritchard, Seth G.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA","Pritchard, SG (reprint author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, 58 Coming St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",pritchards@cofc.edu,,,"Office of Science (BER), US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-95ER62083]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1020691]","Resources to maintain the Duke FACE site were provided by the Office of Science (BER), US Department of Energy, Grant no.

It has been hypothesized that population temporal stability could be driven by functional trade-offs in resource acquisition and growth rate strategies. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing a 13-year data set from a mown grassland community in a factorial experiment with fertilization and dominant removal as the main treatment effects. Population temporal stability, measured as a coefficient of variation of species' biomass over time, was related to plant traits covering different functional trade-offs. These included plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area, seed mass, leaf delta C-13, and rooting depth. Three of the traits (LDMC, rooting depth, and leaf delta C-13) had significant relationships with population temporal stability, even after accounting for species' phylogenetic relatedness. Higher values of LDMC, the best predictor, were consistently associated with greater population temporal stability across all experimental conditions. This suggests a functional trade-off along the leaf economics spectrum, with more conservative, slow-growing species being more stable over time. Incorporating functional trade-offs into the assessment of population temporal dynamics will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that sustain the stability of ecosystems and species coexistence.","[Majekova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Soil Sci, SK-84215 Bratislava, Slovakia; [Majekova, Maria; de Bello, Francesco; Dolezal, Jiri; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco; Dolezal, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Entomol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Majekova, M (reprint author), Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Soil Sci, SK-84215 Bratislava, Slovakia.",maria.majekova@gmail.com,"Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Leps, Jan/U-8967-2019; Dolezal, Jiri/H-1583-2014","Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051",GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-17118S]; Research and Development Operational Program - (ERDF) [ITMS 26240120004],"We thank all the people that helped with harvesting and sorting of biomass during the years, mostly students of Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia led in the last years by Alena Vitova.

Mixed-species forests generally sequester and store more carbon in above-ground woody biomass compared to species-poor systems. However, the mechanisms driving the positive relationship between diversity and above-ground wood production (AWP) remain unclear. 2. We investigate the role of competition for light and water as possible sources of complementarity among Iberian pine and oak species. Using tree core data from permanent plots, we test the hypotheses that (i) contrasting abilities of pines and oaks to tolerate shade will promote AWP in mixtures, while (ii) drought stress results in less room for complementarity. 3. We found that pine species receive more light, develop larger crowns and grow 138-155% faster when in mixture with oaks. However, this positive effect of species mixing on growth was severely reduced under drought conditions due to increased competition for water with neighbouring oaks. In contrast to pines, oak trees were less responsive to mixing, primarily as a result of their ability to tolerate shade and water shortage. 4. Mixed pine-oak forests produce an average 48% more above-ground woody biomass compared to monocultures each year. However, the magnitude of the diversity effect on AWP fluctuates with time, decreasing noticeably in strength during drought years. 5. Synthesis. Complementary light use strategies among neighbouring trees are critical in explaining why above-ground wood production (AWP) increases in mixed-species stands. In contrast, drought causes trees in mixture to compete more fiercely for below-ground resources, leaving less room for complementarity and causing positive diversity effects to lessen in strength. Together, these two mechanisms provide much needed context for AWP-diversity relationships in Mediterranean forests. Whether or not managing for mixed pine-oak forests proves to be beneficial for AWP is likely to depend on how climate changes in the Iberian Peninsula.","[Jucker, Tommaso; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Bouriaud, Olivier; Avacaritei, Daniel; Danila, Iulian; Duduman, Gabriel] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Fac Forestry, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Jucker, T (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",tj272@cam.ac.uk,"Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Danila, Iulian Constantin/J-1996-2016; Daniel, Avacaritei/E-9101-2019; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Danila, Iulian Constantin/0000-0002-4877-1782; Daniel, Avacaritei/0000-0002-7680-7017; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X",European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [265171],"We are very grateful to Adam Benneter, Cristina Crespo and Raquel Benavides for their technical support in the field.

Why some herbaceous plant species refrain from sprouting in some years is a longstanding puzzle in plant ecology. When vegetatively 'dormant', the plant lives as a rootstock, but does not produce or maintain photosynthetic tissue. During this time, energy may be remobilized from resource reserves or acquired from mycorrhizal fungi, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. If vegetative dormancy is adaptive, it may be in response to a harsh environment, to life-history costs, or as a bet-hedge against unpredictable environmental variability. 2. We tested whether vegetative dormancy is adaptive via game theoretical analysis of deterministic and stochastic ahistorical and historical life-history models parameterized with long-term census data for two long-lived plants, Anemone americana and Cypripedium parviflorum. The ahistorical deterministic model provided a test of the hypothesis that dormancy is adaptive in response to a generally harsh environment and/or short-term life-history costs, while the historical model tested whether long-term costs drove the evolution of dormancy. The stochastic ahistorical model provided a test of whether dormancy is a bet-hedging trait. 3. We found that vegetative dormancy is an adaptive consequence of life-history costs of growth to survival and that these costs may be operating under a variable but generally harsh environment. Such costs led to sprouting and survival probabilities that generally increased with size in adults but never reached unity and decreased with size in juveniles. Historical deterministic models particularly predicted observed sprouting frequencies, while deterministic ahistorical and stochastic models did not, suggesting although the environment is likely stressful and fluctuates between harsh and mild states, short-term costs and temporal stochasticity alone do not explain observed sprouting frequencies. 4. Synthesis. Life-history costs can drive the evolution of seemingly paradoxical traits. In particular, growth can lead to survival costs that may become significant in future years. These costs may be incurred via the use of stored reserves that, once used, cannot be used in the next several years. Such costs are the currency favouring the evolutionary maintenance of vegetative dormancy in two distantly related perennial plant species and may account for dormancy throughout the plant kingdom.","[Shefferson, Richard P.; Pulliam, H.

Rhizobial inoculants are not always used in soybean production in the Midwestern USA because of high naturalized soil populations, but drought conditions experienced in the region during the 2012 growing season may have led to a decline in numbers resulting in the need for inoculation the following growing season. Therefore, the effect of drought on B. japonicum population size was investigated in this study. Drought conditions, 8 weeks long or 4 weeks long preceded (STOP) or followed (START) by 4 weeks of normal watering, were simulated in two contrasting soil types in a greenhouse setting with soybeans as host plants. Drought conditions were monitored by measuring water content. Population size of B. japonicum was quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and most probable number (MPN) methods and compared to population from non-drought treatment. Using both quantification methods, the response of B. japonicum to drought treatments was minimal.

We tested whether plant-soil feedback in this habitat is affected by competition and whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are involved in plant-soil feedback. We used a standard two-phase plant-soil feedback experiment run concurrently for each of three invasive shrub species, measuring feedback effects on AMF colonization, aboveground biomass, and the responses of native plant species in greenhouse mesocosms. Lonicera maackii and Ligustrum vulgare reduced AMF colonization of native roots, both with legacy effects (prior growth in soil) and direct effects (current growth in soil). Elaeagnus umbellata grown with natives left a legacy of increased AMF colonization of native communities.

Cheating need not entail parasitism; selection favours cheating as a quantitative trait whenever less-cooperative partners are more fit than more-cooperative partners. Mutualisms might be stabilised by mechanisms that direct benefits to more-cooperative individuals, which counter selection for cheating; however, empirical evidence that natural selection favours cheating in mutualisms is sparse. We measured selection on cheating in single-partner pairings of wild legume and rhizobium lineages, which prevented legume choice. Across contrasting environments, selection consistently favoured cheating by rhizobia, but did not favour legumes that provided less benefit to rhizobium partners. This is the first simultaneous measurement of selection on cheating across both host and symbiont lineages from a natural population. We empirically confirm selection for cheating as a source of antagonistic coevolutionary pressure in mutualism and a biological dilemma for models of cooperation.","[Porter, Stephanie S.; Simms, Ellen L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Porter, SS (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 1001 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",stephanie.porter@ucr.edu,,,,,,53,36,37,2,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

At a regional scale, silver fir seems to be vulnerable to drought, and at a forest stand scale, tree death seems to be distributed according to soil water availability. To understand the vulnerability of silver fir to drought, factors involved in the regulation of transpiration were assessed with respect to soil properties in order to document the spatial distribution of death rates. Soil properties were characterized by electric resistivity measurements. Sap flow density and predawn needle water potential were recorded on sampled trees during several years, and crown specific transpiration was estimated. In addition, the vulnerability of coarse roots and branches to cavitation was quantified. Trees growing on soils with a large water storage capacity were the most vulnerable to drought induced soil water deficits. Transpiration was down-regulated as soon as predawn water potential decreased. The vulnerability to cavitation was low, which protected the trees from run-away xylem embolism. Severe soil water deficits led to a rapid decrease of transpiration, which was still visible the following year. The drop-off in transpiration was mainly due to inner sap flow that almost ceased after the drought on all monitored trees. Our results suggest that root dynamic and the ability of roots to take up water were modified by soil water deficit over several years. Such a regulation scheme needs to be better documented and included in models to address silver fir forest responses to drought.","[Nourtier, Marie; Chanzy, Andre; Xie Yingge] INRA, UMR1114, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Nourtier, Marie; Chanzy, Andre; Xie Yingge] Univ Avignon & Pays Vaucluse, UMR1114, EMMAH, F-84000 Avignon, France; [Cailleret, Maxime; Huc, Roland; Davi, Hendrik] INRA, UR629, F-84914 Avignon, France; [Xie Yingge] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chanzy, A (reprint author), INRA, UMR1114, Site Agroparc, F-84914 Avignon, France.",achanzy@avignon.inra.fr,,,Agence Nationale de RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-06-VULN-004]; Office National des Forets (ONF),The research was funded by the project ANR-06-VULN-004 (Agence Nationale de Recherche) and by the Office National des Forets (ONF) through a PhD grant.,,44,13,13,2,57,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

However, relatively little is known about how native communities will reassemble after a dominant invader has been removed from the system. Legacy effects of invasive plants on soil microbial communities may alter native plant community reassembly long after the invader is gone. Here we found that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities have shown some recovery in experimental plots following 6 years of removal of the invasive Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard, a species known to degrade AMF communities) in terms of taxonomic richness and community composition. However, despite this recovery, the density of A. petiolata at the beginning of the experiment (in 2004) still correlated with lower AMF richness and altered community composition after 6 years of annual weeding, suggesting long-term legacies of dense A. petiolata infestations. Because native plant and mycorrhizal fungal communities may show interdependence, reassembly of one community may be limited by the reassembly of the other. Restoration may be more effective if practices address both communities simultaneously.","[Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30606 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Bauer, Jonathan T.; Anderson, M.

We used high-throughput sequencing to examine the large-scale distributions of soil fungi and their relation to evolutionary history. We tested the Tropical Conservatism Hypothesis, which predicts that ancestral fungal groups should be more restricted to tropical latitudes and conditions than would more recently derived groups. We found support for this hypothesis in that older phyla preferred significantly lower latitudes and warmer, wetter conditions than did younger phyla. Moreover, preferences for higher latitudes and lower precipitation levels were significantly phylogenetically conserved among the six younger phyla, possibly because the older phyla possess a zoospore stage that is vulnerable to drought, whereas the younger phyla retain protective cell walls throughout their life cycle. Our study provides novel evidence that the Tropical Conservatism Hypothesis applies to microbes as well as plants and animals.","[Treseder, Kathleen K.; Maltz, Mia R.; Hawkins, Bradford A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Stajich, Jason E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [McGuire, Krista L.] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA","Treseder, KK (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",treseder@uci.edu,"Treseder, Kathleen/E-5148-2011; Stajich, Jason Eric/C-7297-2008","Treseder, Kathleen/0000-0003-2847-6935; Stajich, Jason Eric/0000-0002-7591-0020; FIERER, NOAH/0000-0002-6432-4261",,,,50,36,38,5,139,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

At present, plant responses to recurrent extreme events have been sparsely examined and the role of stress history on subsequent stress response has been widely neglected. In a long-term field experiment, we investigated the response of grassland and heath communities to a very severe drought event, which exceeded the duration of projected drought scenarios. During the preceding 6 years, the plant communities experienced scenarios of varying water supply, including annually recurring drought, heavy rain, regular watering, and natural drought periods. Single species and plant communities that were regularly watered in the preceding years revealed the highest tissue die-back under a very severe drought when compared to plants that experienced mild or severe drought stress before. Contrary to expectations, the root to shoot ratio did not increase due to previous recurrent drought occurrences. Furthermore, pre-exposure effects on Vaccinium myrtillus and Plantago lanceolata tissue die-back and reproductive biomass (P. lanceolata) were altered by community composition. Recurrent mild drought stress seems to improve drought resistance of plant communities and species. Potential reasons could be epigenetic changes or soil biotic legacies. Morphological legacies such as altered root to shoot ratio did not play a role in our study. Imprinting events which trigger this ecological stress memory do not have to be extreme themselves. Thresholds, longevity of effects, and the role of biodiversity shown by the importance of community composition require further attention.","[Backhaus, Sabrina; Grant, Kerstin; Walter, Julia; Jentsch, Anke] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Kreyling, Juergen; Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Backhaus, S (reprint author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",sabrina.backhaus@uni-bayreuth.de,"Kreyling, Juergen/G-4697-2018","Kreyling, Juergen/0000-0001-8489-7289; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628",Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Public Health [ZKL01Abt7 18456],"This study was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Public Health (ZKL01Abt7 18456).

We monitored changes in biomass storage of young Aleppo pine stands naturally regenerated after wildfires, with a diachronic approach from 5 to 16 years old, including pine and understory strata, at two different quality sites (dry and semiarid climates). At each site, we set 21 permanent plots and carried out different thinning intensities at two ages, 5 and 10 years after fires. We found similar post-fire regeneration capacity at both sites in terms of total above-ground biomass storage similar to 6 Mg ha(-1) (3 Mg ha(-1) of the above-ground pine biomass plus 3 Mg ha(-1) of the above-ground understory biomass), but with a contrasting pine layer structure. Generally, across the diachronic study, the earlier thinning reduced biomass stocks at both sites, except for the best quality site (the dry site), where the earliest thinning (applied at post-fire year 5) enlarged carbon storage by 11 % as compared to non-thinned plots. We found root:shoot ratios of an average 0.37 for the pine layer and 0.45 for the understory layer. These results provided new information which not only furthers our understanding of carbon sequestration in low timber productivity Mediterranean forests, but will also help to develop new guidelines for sustainable management adapted to the high-risk terrestrial carbon losses of fire-prone areas.","[Alfaro-Sanchez, Raquel; Lopez-Serrano, Francisco R.; Moya, Daniel; De Las Heras, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Plant Prod & Agr Technol, ETSIA, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Rubio, Eva] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Appl Phys, Sch Ind Engn, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Sanchez-Salguero, Raul] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Sanchez-Salguero, Raul] Univ Cordoba, Dept Ingn Forestal, Lab Dendrocronol, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain","Alfaro-Sanchez, R (reprint author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Plant Prod & Agr Technol, ETSIA, Campus Univ S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",r.alfarosanchez@gmail.com,"Sanchez, Raquel Alfaro/K-6836-2017; Moya, Daniel/B-5979-2015; Rubio, Eva/L-4411-2017; De las Heras, Jorge/I-1033-2015; SANCHEZ-SALGUERO, RAUL/J-7886-2013; Moya, Daniel/N-1616-2019; LOPEZ-SERRANO, FRANCISCO/L-9625-2014","Sanchez, Raquel Alfaro/0000-0001-7357-3027; Moya, Daniel/0000-0002-1909-1200; Rubio, Eva/0000-0003-4148-9845; De las Heras, Jorge/0000-0003-2374-7097; SANCHEZ-SALGUERO, RAUL/0000-0002-6545-5810; Moya, Daniel/0000-0002-1909-1200; LOPEZ-SERRANO, FRANCISCO/0000-0002-3351-9023","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Ministry of Education and Science, Spain [2008-03602/FOR, 2011-27747/FOR, CSD 2008-00040]; University of Cordoba-Campus de Excelencia ceiA3",We thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for its funding and support to the Forest Ecology Researching Group in Projects CYCIT-AGL 2008-03602/FOR; AGL 2011-27747/FOR and CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010: MONTES (CSD 2008-00040).

However, little is known about the elevational patterns of microbial communities at high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, a region that is very sensitive to global change. We investigated the microbial community composition and functional patterns along an elevational gradient (3100-4600 m above sea level) on Mount Segrila using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and community level physiological profiles (CLPP). Soil microbes were abundant even at higher altitudes and ranged from 1.52 to 3.53 mu mol per g organic carbon (OC) by total PLFAs. Soil microbial biomass (expressed as Total PLFAs) declined at higher elevations, and the highest abundance was observed at the low-elevation site. Fungal to bacterial ratio decreased with increasing elevation. While no consistent elevational pattern was observed for PLFA profiles, richness and diversity of carbon source utilization by the microbial community decreased significantly at higher altitudes. Soil microbes at higher altitudes had the potential to metabolize relatively more recalcitrant carbon components while microbes at lower altitudes tended to utilize labile carbon sources. The results were in line with the chemical composition of soil organic matter. Increasing O-alkyl C and decreasing alkyl C content indicate slow decomposition at higher elevations. Variations in structure and activity of microbial community were mainly attributable to MAT, pH, and litter C:N. Our results indicate that pH is a major factor affecting microbial communities, and the impact of soil pH is closely correlated with temperature and vegetation changes along the elevational gradient. As future climate warming may lead to temperature increases and an upward migration of vegetation, our results provide fundamental knowledge of soil microbial communities in the Tibetan alpine region and may help to predict responses of the below-ground community to global climate change.

Here, we investigated the richness of taxa of soil fungi and their phylogenetic diversity across a wide range of grassland types along a 2800 m elevation gradient at a large number of sites (213), stratified across a region of the Western Swiss Alps (700 km(2)). We used 454 pyrosequencing to obtain fungal sequences that were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTU diversity-area relationship revealed uneven distribution of fungal taxa across the study area (i.e. not all taxa are everywhere) and fine-scale spatial clustering. Fungal richness and phylogenetic diversity were found to be higher in lower temperatures and higher moisture conditions. Climatic and soil characteristics as well as plant community composition were related to OTU alpha, beta and phylogenetic diversity, with distinct fungal lineages suggesting distinct ecological tolerances. Soil fungi, thus, show lineage-specific biogeographic patterns, even at a regional scale, and follow environmental determinism, mediated by interactions with plants.","[Pellissier, L.; Dubuis, A.; Ndiribe, C.; Salamin, N.; Goudet, J.; Sanders, I.

However, intrinsic biases and insufficient quality control in next-generation methods can lead to difficult-to-detect errors in estimating fungal community richness, distributions and composition. The aim of this study was to examine how tissue storage prior to DNA extraction, primer design and various quality-control approaches commonly used in 454 amplicon pyrosequencing might influence ecological inferences in studies of endophytic and endolichenic fungi. We first contrast 454 data sets generated contemporaneously from subsets of the same plant and lichen tissues that were stored in CTAB buffer, dried in silica gel or freshly frozen prior to DNA extraction. We show that storage in silica gel markedly limits the recovery of sequence data and yields a small fraction of the diversity observed by the other two methods. Using lichen mycobiont sequences as internal positive controls, we next show that despite careful filtering of raw reads and utilization of current best-practice OTU clustering methods, homopolymer errors in sequences representing rare taxa artificially increased estimates of richness c. 15-fold in a model data set. Third, we show that inferences regarding endolichenic diversity can be improved using a novel primer that reduces amplification of the mycobiont. Together, our results provide a rationale for selecting tissue treatment regimes prior to DNA extraction, demonstrate the efficacy of reducing mycobiont amplification in studies of the fungal microbiomes of lichen thalli and highlight the difficulties in differentiating true information about fungal biodiversity from methodological artefacts.","[U'Ren, Jana M.; Riddle, Jakob M.; Arnold, A.

Ecologically important mutualistic associations such as mycorrhizae and lichens have evolved in this group, which are regarded as key innovations that supported the evolution of land plants. Only a few attempts have been made to date the origin of Ascomycota lineages by using molecular clock methods, which is primarily due to the lack of satisfactory fossil calibration data. For this reason we have evaluated all of the oldest available ascomycete fossils from amber (Albian to Miocene) and chert (Devonian and Maastrichtian). The fossils represent five major ascomycete classes (Coniocybomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Laboulbeniomycetes, and Lecanoromycetes). We have assembled a multi-gene data set (18SrDNA, 28SrDNA, RPB1 and RPB2) from a total of 145 taxa representing most groups of the Ascomycota and utilized fossil calibration points solely from within the ascomycetes to estimate divergence times of Ascomycota lineages with a Bayesian approach. Our results suggest an initial diversification of the Pezizomycotina in the Ordovician, followed by repeated splits of lineages throughout the Phanerozoic, and indicate that this continuous diversification was unaffected by mass extinctions. We suggest that the ecological diversity within each lineage ensured that at least some taxa of each group were able to survive global crises and rapidly recovered. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We assessed monthly soil respiration and its components, litterfall input, fine root production and mortality under 19-year-old native coniferous Cunninghamia lanceolata and broadleaved Mytilaria laosensis plantations in sub-tropical China. Total soil respiration from October 2011 to March 2013 was significantly lower under the C. lanceolata than the M. laosensis plantation. The difference in respiration rates derived from fine roots and the litter layer explained much of the variation of total soil respiration between the two tree species. We used an exponential equation and base temperature (10 A degrees C) to normalize soil respiration rate and its components (R-10) and determined the correlation between R-10 and soil moisture. Although soil moisture had a positive relationship with R-10 derived from roots or litter under both C. lanceolata and M. laosensis forests, these positive correlations were masked by negative relationships between soil moisture and R-10 derived from root-free soil, which resulted in a neutral correlation between total R-10 and soil moisture under C. lanceolata forests. Monthly litterfall input was associated with variation in concurrent total soil respiration rate under the M. laosensis plantation and respiration rate lagging 3 months behind under the C. lanceolata plantation, which may suggest that litterfall input from M. laosensis can more rapidly produce C substrates for microbial respiration than litterfall from C. lanceolata. This study highlighted that tree species-induced variation in the quality and quantity of fine roots and litterfall can impact not only the soil respiration rate but also the seasonal variation model of forest soil respiration.","[Huang, Zhiqun; Yu, Zaipeng; Wang, Minghuang] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China","Huang, ZQ (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",zhiqunhuang@hotmail.com,"Huang, Zhiqun/E-7386-2011","Yu, Zaipeng/0000-0001-5215-5627; Wang, Minhuang/0000-0002-4247-6125","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371269]; National ""973"" Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954002]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET); Science Foundation for Excellent Talents of Fujian Province, China","We thank Mr. X Wen of the Xiayang forest farm for assistance in the field and Mr. Murray Davis from Scion Research in New Zealand for his helpful comments and suggestions.

The link between rosemary tolerance/accumulation of As, Pb, Sb, and Zn and root symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and/or dark septate endophytes (DSE) was examined. Eight sites along a gradient of contamination were selected for soil and root collections. TMM concentrations were analyzed in all the samples and root symbioses were observed. Moreover, in the roots of various diameters collected in the most contaminated site, X-ray microfluorescence methods were used to determine TMM localization in tissues. Rosemary accumulated, in its roots, the most labile TMM fraction in the soil. The positive linear correlation between TMM concentrations in soil and endophyte root colonization rates suggests the involvement of AM fungi and DSE in rosemary tolerance to TMM. Moreover, a typical TMM localization in root peripheral tissues of thin roots containing endophytes forming AM and DSE development was observed using X-ray microfluorescence.

We hypothesised that these differences increase over the plant growth period because roots occupy larger soil volumes and release more rhizodeposits. We tested how such medium-term responses of the microbial community can be explained by the short-term utilisation of root exudates. To test this we analysed N-15 incorporation into microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition and C-13 incorporation into the PLFAs of specific microbial groups in soil under white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L) following leaf-labelling with C-13-bicarbonate and N-15-urea. In this way microbial N and N-15 and the composition of PLFAs reflect the medium-term (two months) response of microorganisms to rhizodeposits, whereas the C-13-label of the PLFAs reflects the short-term (one week) utilisation of root exudates following labelling of shoots. In the medium term, microbial biomass N and N-15 were greater under the ryegrass, whereas total PLFA was higher under white clover. The relative abundance of fungi and actinomycetes was unaffected by plant species, but pool of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was greater under white clover at the 10 percent significance level. In the short term, microorganisms more actively utilised fresh exudates (C-13-labelled) of ryegrass than of white clover. We expected ryegrass exudates initially to be incorporated into bacterial PLFA and into fungi over time, but surprisingly fungi had the highest utilisation of ryegrass-derived C over the week. At 0-5 cm soil depth, white clover exudates were utilised only by bacteria, whereas fungi dominated at 5-15 cm. This reflects differences in the quality of white clover exudates or differences in the microbial community composition at the two depths. We conclude that despite clear short-term differences in microbial response to the exudates of white clover and ryegrass, this is only to a limited extent transferred into medium-term defects on the composition of the microbial communities under the two plant species. Hence, our study showed that different short-term C utilisation patterns may lead to similar medium-term responses of the microbial community. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore conducted an N-fertilization experiment in a subtropical evergreen forest in eastern China to better understand the short-term response of Rs to increased N availability. N additions stimulated Rs compared to control plots, yet the magnitude of the increase depended on the amount of N added, with Rs being greater in the low-N treatment (50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) than the high-N treatment (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Differences in Rs among treatments correlated with changes in fine root biomass, suggesting increases in Rs reflect those in autotrophic respiration. Our findings challenge the dogma that N fertilization often reduces soil respiration and highlights the need to better understand the effects of low N additions, so as to reliably predict how projected climate change scenarios may affect the cycling of soil carbon (C) in tropical and subtropical forests.

The nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) Dechloromonas exhibited the greatest corrosion inhibition by inducing the redox cycling of iron to enhance the precipitation of iron oxides and formation of Fe3O4 in the AR with UV/Cl-2, while the rhizobia Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium, and the NRB Sphingomonas, Brucella producing siderophores had weaker corrosion-inhibition effect by capturing iron in the AR with Cl-2. These results indicated that the microbial redox cycling of iron was possibly responsible for higher corrosion inhibition and lower effect of water Larson-Skold Index (LI) changes on corrosion. This finding could be applied toward the control of water quality in drinking water distribution systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We traced a pulse of C-13 from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs. Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to global changes that alter proportional tree C allocation belowground.

Our objectives were to determine the effect of elevated atmospheric humidity on soil respiration in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) plantations in a Free Air Humidity Manipulation experimental facility (FAHM). Soil respiration was monitored monthly from May to October, in 2008 and 2009 in three control and in three misting plots; soil temperature and soil moisture were measured simultaneously. Fine-root and rhizome biomass of the understory was measured by sequential soil cores. Soil microbial biomass and basal respiration were measured using manometric respirometers. After the first two years of manipulation, humidification led to lower soil respiration. Soil temperature was the main factor influencing seasonal dynamics of soil respiration, describing up to 75% of the total variation of soil respiration. Soil moisture had a weak negative effect on soil respiration. Humidification caused a remarkable increase in below-ground biomass and the production of the understory, and a 28% increase in the basal respiration of microbes. However, above-ground biomass and root turnover rate of the understory were almost unchanged. Hence, elevated atmospheric humidity significantly affects carbon cycle of deciduous forest. However, further studies are necessary for a better understanding of soil respiration response to changes in atmospheric humidity, in order to predict carbon balance in changing climate conditions.

Concern has been raised that planting seedlings on mounded microsites may influence the spatial distribution of lateral roots and lead to potential windthrow. The objective of this study was to examine root symmetry for container white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings planted on disc trenched berms and no disc trenched sites compared to naturally regenerated seedlings in mixedwood forest of Saskatchewan. No significant differences were found between treatments for root cross sectional area index (CSAI) at radii of 25, 50 and 100 cm from the stem center. Values of CSAI for planted seedlings on disc trenching, no disc trenching and natural regeneration sites all exhibited a degree of root asymmetry (range of 0.63-0.92) rather than being symmetrical (0.25) for all three radii. Disc trenching site preparation only impacted the direction of root development on <50% of planted container white spruce seedlings, for which the center of diameter (COD) positions were located on the berm side leading to a potential root asymmetry. However, the magnitude of this potential asymmetry was within the range observed on no disc trenching and natural regeneration sites. Rooting depth at 25-100 cm radii from the stem, was significantly shallower in planted container seedlings (<6 cm) compared to naturally regenerated white spruce seedlings (>38 cm). Container seedlings exhibiting both shallow rooting depth and root asymmetry on disc trenched microsites suggests an increased risk for potential windthrow as the trees mature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the belowground C input from the fine root litter of trees and understorey vegetation in relation to their aboveground litterfall in two Norway spruce (Picea abies L) stands located in northern and southern Finland. The production of fine roots was estimated by using turnover and biomass data from minirhizotrons and soil cores. The foliage litter production of trees was estimated from litter traps, and that of the understorey vegetation from its annual growth and coverage. Finally, we augmented the data with four spruce plots in Sweden in order to study the above- and belowground litter ratios along latitudinal and soil fertility gradients. The fine root biomass of spruce trees per stand basal area was almost double in the northern site compared to the southern site. Furthermore, spruce fine roots in the north persisted significantly longer (97 +/- 2 weeks) than spruce roots in the south (89 +/- 2 weeks) or understorey fine roots at both sites. The annual production of tree foliage litter was higher in the southern stand, but the total amount of litter (including trees and understorey, above- and belowground) was similar at both sites, as was the ratio between the above- and belowground litter production. The role of understorey vegetation was greater in the northern site where it was responsible for 23% and 33% of below- and aboveground litter production, respectively, compared to 11% and 15% in the south. Thus, both below- and aboveground understorey C input is substantial and should be taken into account in ecosystem C cycle models. The regression between the aboveground:belowground litter production-ratio and the C:N-ratio of the organic layer (combined data from Finland and Sweden), showed that the share of belowground litter production increased when site fertility decreased. This shift in the litter production pattern from above-to belowground in the least fertile sites may have an impact on litter C quality and soil C storage. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, the dispersal of fungal spores by animals has received comparatively little attention. In this study, the dispersal of spores of a selected fetid fungus, Lysurus mokusin, via feces of mycophagous insects was explored by: collecting volatiles emitted by the fungus using dynamic headspace extraction and analyzing them by GC-MS; testing the capacity of mycophagous insects to disperse its spores by counting spores in their feces; comparing the germinability of L. mokusin spores extracted from feces of nocturnal earwigs and natural gleba of the fungus; and assessing the ability of L. mokusin volatiles to attract insects in bioassays with synthetic scent mixtures. Numerous spores were detected in insects' feces, the bioassays indicated that L. mokusin odor (similar to that of decaying substances) attracts diverse generalist mycophagous insects, and passage through the gut of Anisolabis maritima earwigs significantly enhanced the germination rate of L. mokusin spores. Therefore, nocturnal earwigs and diurnal flies probably play important roles in dispersal of L. mokusin spores, and dispersal via feces may be an important common dispersal mechanism for fungal reproductive tissue.","[Chen, Gao; Zhang, Rui-Rui; Sun, Wei-Bang] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Bot Garden, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650204, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang] Shenzhen Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Sun, WB (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Bot Garden, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650204, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",wbsun@mail.kib.ac.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31100177]; West Doctor Foundation of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences,"The authors thank staff of Sees-editing Ltd.

We surveyed 21 plots in southwestern Colorado and categorized each plot by the mean percentage of recent crown loss (RCL) into three SAD levels: low SAD (0%-25% RCL), moderate SAD (25.1%-50% RCL), and high SAD (50.1%-100% RCL). Our research quantified the effects of SAD on microclimate and understory vegetation at the individual species and community level. Mean day surface, day subsurface, and night subsurface temperatures were warmer in high SAD stands than in low ones. High SAD stands had lower soil moisture, lower litter and duff depth, higher bare soil cover, higher photosynthetically active radiation, higher arbuscular mycorrhizal propagule densities, and higher grass biomass. Indicator plant species were uniquely associated with low and high SAD. Our study illustrates that SAD has multiple ecological effects on aspen understories, including a potential positive feedback in which warmer temperatures and decreased soil moisture, consequences of SAD, may lead to increased branch dieback and tree mortality, which would alter microclimate-making conditions more favorable to SAD and escalate the effects of SAD on understory vegetation.","[Korb, J.

After 20 and 39 years of N additions, two of the long-term N addition treatments were terminated, thereby providing a unique opportunity to examine the temporal recovery of EM sporocarps after cessation of high N loading. 3 In general, increasing N availability significantly reduced EM sporocarp production, species richness, and the amount of N retained in EM sporocarps. However, these general responses were strongly dependent on the application rate and duration of N additions. The annual addition of 20 kg.N.ha(-1) for the past 6 years resulted in a slight increase in the production and retention of N in EM sporocarps, whereas the addition of 100 kg.N.ha(-1).yr(-1) during the same period nearly eliminated EM sporocarps. In contrast, long-term additions of N at rates of ca. 35 or 70 kg.N.ha(-1).yr(-1) for the past 40 years did not eliminate tree carbon allocation to EM sporocarps, although there was a decrease in the abundance and a shift in the dominant EM sporocarp taxa. Despite no immediate recovery, EM sporocarp abundance and species richness approached those of the control 20 years after terminating N additions in the most heavily fertilized treatment, suggesting a recovery of carbon allocation to EM sporocarps after cessation of high N loading. 4 Our results provide evidence for a tight coupling between tree carbon allocation to and N retention in EM sporocarps and moreover highlight the potential use of delta N-15 in EM sporocarps as a relative index of EM fungal sink strength for N. However, nitrogen additions at high dosage rates or over long time periods appear to disrupt this feedback, which could have important ramifications on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in these forested ecosystems.","[Hasselquist, Niles J.; Hogberg, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Hasselquist, NJ (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",niles.hasselquist@slu.se,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719",research council VRSwedish Research Council; research council FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; MISTRA; Kempe foundation,"Thanks to Carl Olof Tamm and his coworkers who established the long-term N addition experiment at Norrliden, to Asa Bengtsson and Jonas Lundholm for carrying out the IRMS analyses, and to John Marshall for comments that improved the manuscript.

We studied the morphological traits of Impatiens glandulifera in the native (Indian Himalayas) and introduced (UK) range and evaluated what influences natural enemies and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have on plant performance. We compared height, total leaf area, root: shoot ratio, natural enemy damage and the colonisation of AMF from individual plants within and between ranges twice in 2010 during the months of June and August. In addition, in August 2010, we estimated the number of reproductive units (expressed as the sum of flowers, seed capsule and seeds) at each site. We found that all morphological traits varied between populations and countries, though in general introduced populations, and the semi-natural population in India, showed higher performance compared to natural native populations. There was only an indication that natural enemy damage, which was significantly higher in the native range, negatively affected reproductive units. Within the introduced range, the percentage colonisation of AMF was negatively associated with plant performance indicating that I. glandulifera may associate with an incompatible AMF species incurring a cost to invasive populations. We conclude that species which are heavily regulated in the native range, though still show high levels of performance, should be considered undesirable introductions into similar ecoclimatic ranges due to the potential that these species will become highly invasive species.","[Tanner, Robert A.; Shaw, Richard; Murphy, Sean T.] CABI, Egham TW20 9TY, Surrey, England; [Jin, Liang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China; [Jin, Liang; Gange, Alan C.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Tanner, RA (reprint author), CABI, Bakeham Lane, Egham TW20 9TY, Surrey, England.",r.tanner@cabi.org,,"Shaw, Richard/0000-0003-0805-1841","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Scottish Executive","This work was supported by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Scottish Executive.

Studies have found that plants are able to differentiate among self- versus non-self and among sibling (kin) competitors. Here, we present data for the dioecious grass Distichlis spicata on seedling recognition of kin and sex. D. spicata exhibits extreme spatial segregation of the sexes (SSS) in the field, and previous work has shown that intra-sexual competition is less than inter-sexual competition in the field. In this experiment, we conducted experiments in the lab, exposing the seedlings to liquid media in which seedlings had been previously grown, rather than have the seedling physically contact one another. We found that inter-sexual interactions caused a decrease in the total dry weight and an increase in root/shoot ratio of the plants compared with intra-sexual interactions. These findings suggest that D. spicata plants can recognize and respond to plant sex and that inter-sexual competition contributes to SSS, even when additional interactions, such as mycorrhizal fungi are controlled, and physical interactions between plants are removed. In the kin recognition analysis, we found that plants paired with another plant from the same mother had significantly greater lateral root number and length than plants paired with non-kin, suggesting that in this highly clonal grass, kin recognition may be an important mechanism in competitive interactions.","[Mercer, Charlene A.; Eppley, Sarah M.] Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Life Extreme Environm, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Eppley, SM (reprint author), Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Life Extreme Environm, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",eppley@pdx.edu,,,,,,37,5,13,3,65,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,AUG,2014,215,8,,,,,845,852,,10.1007/s11258-014-0336-9,,,8,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,AO1RP,WOS:000341091600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Montagnoli, A; Terzaghi, M; Scippa, GS; Chiatante, D",,,,"Montagnoli, A.; Terzaghi, M.; Scippa, G.

The data collected show that when a fine root has an apical diameter equal or bigger than the mesh size, the degree of difficulty in passing through the net determines a response that arrests growth or deviation from the initial direction of growth. Both reactions prevent the root from crossing the net and induce the fine root to produce new laterals with thinner diameters. The investment in biomass necessary to form the new laterals is smaller than that needed to support the parental fine root and this leads to determines an underestimation of FRP. In particular, a considerable reduction of fine-root biomass in the area outside the netting was detected with a mesh size below 1.5 mm. The choice of net mesh size to be used for FRP measurement cannot be arbitrary, but should be evaluated through a preliminary analysis of fine-root morphology of experimental species prior to net installation.

Water-use efficiency (lambda) is a measure of carbon assimilation per evapotranspiration. Here, a was compared among three different grassland ecosystems in eastern KS, USA, by using the eddy covariance technique. Variation in lambda was examined at multiple timescales and across different burning regimes. Site-specific variations in lambda were more readily observed at seasonal and inter-annual timescales rather than daily and monthly averages. Annually burned grassland with homogeneous C-4 grass cover had less negative values of lambda [lower water-use efficiency (WUE)] than infrequently burned grassland that is presently undergoing woody encroachment and a transition to a shrub-dominated ecosystem. The most likely explanation for differences in lambda are differences in rooting depth and source-water acquisition between encroaching woody plants and the native grass community. Reliance on a deeper water source by the woody community may buffer the negative consequences of forecasted climate variability and drought, resulting in greater landscape WUE and reduced susceptibility to water stress when compared with the coexisting grass species.

In this study, we estimated coarse root biomass using ground penetrating radar (GPR) of 25-year-old trees inclusive of five species (Populus deltoides x nigra clone DN-177, Juglans nigra L., Quercus rubra L., Picea abies L. Karst, and Thuja occidentalis L.) at a TBI site in Southern Ontario, Canada. Subsurface images generated by GPR were collected in grids (4.5 x 4.5 m) centred on tree stems. The predictive relationship developed between GPR signal response and root biomass was corrected for species effects prior to tree-scale estimates of belowground biomass. Accuracy of the tree-scale estimates was assessed by comparing coarse root biomass measured from complete excavations of the corresponding tree. The mean coarse root biomass estimated from GPR analysis was 54.1 +/- A 8.7 kg tree(-1) (mean +/- A S.E.; n = 12), within 1 % of the mean coarse root biomass measured from excavation. Overall there was a root mean square error of 14.4 kg between measured and estimated biomass with no detectable bias despite variable conditions within the in-field and multi-species study. Root system C storage by species, calculated with species-specific root carbon concentrations, is estimated at 5.4 +/- A 0.7-34.8 +/- A 6.9 kg C tree(-1) at this site. GPR is an effective tool for non-destructively predicting coarse root biomass in multi-species environments such as temperate TBI systems.","[Borden, Kira A.; Thomas, Sean C.] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Borden, Kira A.; Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Thevathasan, Naresh V.; Gordon, Andrew M.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Isaac, ME (reprint author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",marney.isaac@utoronto.ca,,"Borden, Kira/0000-0002-9835-4151",Faculty of Forestry at the University of Toronto; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Agricultural Greenhouse Gases ProgramAgriculture & Agri Food Canada,"We would thank the faculty, staff, and students at the University of Guelph Agroforestry Research Station.

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of Eucalyptus urograndis hybrids grown under different water availability conditions. Area of study: The study was performed in south-eastern of Brazil Material and methods: We evaluated five commercial hybrids cultivated in pots with the substrate maintained at 65, 50, 35 and 20% maximum water retention capacity. The evaluation was based on the following characteristics: total height (cm), diameter (mm), number of leaves, leaf area (dm(2)), and dry weight (g plant(-1)) of leaf, stem +branches, root, shoot and total and root/shoot ratio. Main results: All the characteristics evaluated were adversely affected by reduced availability of water in the substrate. The hybrids assessed performed differently in terms of biometric characteristics, irrespective of water availability. Water deficit resulted in a greater reduction in the dry weight production compared to number of leaves, diameter and height. Hybrids H2 and H5 have favorable traits for tolerating drought. The hybrid H2 shows a stronger slowdown in growth as soil moisture levels drop, although its growth rate is low, and H5 increases the root/shoot ratio but maintains growth in terms of height, even under drought conditions. Research highlights: The results obtained in our experiment show that productive hybrids sensitive to drought could also perform better under water deficit conditions, maintaining satisfactory growth despite significant drops in these characteristics.","[Silva, Claudia D.; Paula, Rinaldo C.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Prod Vegetal, Fac Ciencias Agr & Vet, UNESP, BR-14884800 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Nascimento, Janiele S.] Fac Sao Luis Jaboticabal, BR-14870370 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Scarpinati, Edmar A.] Fibria Celulose & Papel, BR-79620970 Tres Lagoas, MS, Brazil","Silva, CD (reprint author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Prod Vegetal, Fac Ciencias Agr & Vet, UNESP, Campus Jaboicabal, BR-14884800 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.",claudiadenises@yahoo.com.br,"Paula, Rinaldo/K-9837-2016","Paula, Rinaldo/0000-0001-9088-3924",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES,We are indebted to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for awarding scholarship to the first author and by Fibria provide the genetic material.,,19,1,1,0,12,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

To analyze (i) the genetic diversity and (ii) the symbiotic properties of its associated nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, root nodules were collected from P. officinalis distributed in 16 forest sites of the Caribbean islands and French Guiana. The sequencing of the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) showed that all bacteria belonged to the Bradyrhizobium genus. Bacteria isolated from insular zones showed very close sequence homologies with Bradyrhizobium genospecies V belonging to the Bradyrhizobium japonicum super-clade. By contrast, bacteria isolated from continental region displayed a larger genetic diversity and belonged to B. elkanii super-clade. Two strains from Puerto Rico and one from French Guiana were not related to any known sequence and could be defined as a new genospecies. Inoculation experiments did not show any host specificity of the Bradyrhizobium strains tested in terms of infectivity. However, homologous Bradyrhizobium sp. strain-P. officinalis provenance associations were more efficient in terms of nodule production, N acquisition, and growth than heterologous ones. The dominant status of P. officinalis in the islands may explain the lower bacterial diversity compared to that found in the continent where P. officinalis is associated with other leguminous tree species. The specificity in efficiency found between Bradyrhizobium strains and host tree provenances could be due to a coevolution process between both partners and needs to be taken in consideration in the framework of rehabilitation plantation programs.","[Le Roux, Christine; Muller, Felix; Galiana, Antoine] CIRAD, UMR LSTM, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Muller, Felix; Ba, Amadou M.] Univ Antilles Guyane, Lab Biol & Physiol Vegetales, UFR Sci Exactes & Nat, Pointe a Pitre 97159, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe; [Muller, Felix; Bouvet, Jean-Marc] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Dreyfus, Bernard; Bena, Gilles; Ba, Amadou M.] IRD, UMR LSTM, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France","Galiana, A (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR LSTM, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA A-82-J, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",antoine.galiana@cirad.fr,,"Bena, Gilles/0000-0003-3080-8441",French Ministry MEDD (Ministere de L'Ecologie et du Developpement Durable); Guadeloupe Archipelago Region; Social European FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); French Ministry MEDD (Ministere de L'Ecologie et du Developpement Durable); Guadeloupe Archipelago Region; Social European FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF),"We would like to thank the French Ministry MEDD (Ministere de L'Ecologie et du Developpement Durable) for the financial support to implement the Pterocarpus officinalis project.

In this study, genetic variation was investigated in 98 full- and half-sib radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) families, representing Chilean coastal and interior populations, subjected to two water regimes: well-watered and drought-stressed. Assessed traits, in 5-month-old seedlings, included height (H), diameter (D), height-to-diameter ratio (HDR), dry biomass of needles (NDW), stem (SDW), roots (RDW), and total (TDW), root-to-shoot ratio (RSR), and survival (SUR). After 115 days of treatment, growth, biomass, and survival were nearly two times higher under the well-watered regime than under the stressed one. Families differed significantly in most traits, with individual tree heritabilities ranging from 0.14 for SUR to 0.63 for D in the well-watered treatment. Families from the interior showed the highest heritability for D, SDW, RDW, and TDW when grown in the water-stress treatment. The genetic correlations between treatments were moderately strong, which suggests the presence of a genotype by watering regime interaction. Most traits were strongly correlated (genetic correlations often exceeded 0.40). Compared to the first generation families from coastal sites, the third generation families from the interior sites showed an increase in SUR and RSR. Thus, potential exists to screen families at the seedling stage for drought hardiness and to identify parents from the interior sites with potential to produce a more drought-resistant breed with satisfactory growth rates and yields in dry environments.","[Espinoza, Sergio E.; Santelices, Romulo E.; Cabrera, Antonio M.] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Desarrollo Secano Interior, Talca, Chile; [Martinez, Victor A.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago, Chile; [Magni, Carlos R.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Santiago, Chile; [Ivkovic, Milos] CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Guerra, Fernando P.] Univ Talca, Inst Biol Vegetal & Biotecnol, Talca, Chile","Espinoza, SE (reprint author), Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Desarrollo Secano Interior, Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile.",espinoza@ucm.cl,"Guerra, Fernando/B-7164-2018","Guerra, Fernando/0000-0001-7174-9738",National Fund for Scientific & Technological Development (FONDECYT) from the National Commission for Scientific & Technological Research (CONYCIT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121484],"Funding for this study was provided by the National Fund for Scientific & Technological Development (FONDECYT) from the National Commission for Scientific & Technological Research (CONYCIT) (Initiation into Research Project No. 11121484 ""Identification of Pinus radiata D.

We selected representative plant patches of the natural vegetation arrangement consisting of one isolated plant of the dominant shrub Larrea divaricata (Ld), grass patches formed by one or more bunches of the dominant grass Nassella tenuis (Nt), and mixed patches consisting of one individual of L. divaricata with bunches of N. tenuis under its canopy (LdNt). We assessed the biomass and temporal changes in fine roots of each species in the upper soil (50 cm depth) of each patch type at three-month intervals during 2 years. The temporal series of fine-root biomass were compared among patch types and in relation to above-ground phenology, as well as climate variables (precipitation, arid index and air temperature). Seasonal changes in fine-root biomass showed similar cycles in the three plant patches with a maximum in spring. The maximum increase in root biomass in Ld and Nt patches occurred during the onset of reproductive growth in winter and spring, respectively. Fine-root changes in LdNt patches mimicked that in Ld patches. Precipitation inputs were significantly positively and temperature negatively related to fine-root changes in Nt patches. Fine-root changes in Ld and LdNt patches were related to the aridity index (positively) and temperature (negatively). We concluded that the observed asynchronies in the date of the largest increases in root biomass and its climate control between the studied grass and shrub species could contribute to the coexistence of plants of both life forms when they overlap their root systems growing in mixed patches. Mechanisms underlying the root patterns observed should be further explored.","[Victoria Rodriguez, Maria; Beatriz Bertiller, Monica] Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Beatriz Bertiller, Monica] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina","Rodriguez, MV (reprint author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Blvd Brown 2825, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",rodriguezv@cenpat.edu.ar,,,"National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion of ArgentinaANPCyT [PICT 6027, PICT 20454, PICT 1349]; CONICET (National Research Council of Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","We thank Gustavo Zamora for their help in the fieldwork and Analia Carrera for her suggestions in an early version of this manuscript.

Despite potentially large inputs of belowground OM from fungal cell walls and invertebrate exoskeletons, studies of the decomposability of their major constituent, chitin, are scarce. To explore effects on soil C dynamics of chitin, in comparison with two plant-derived chemicals, cellulose and lignin, I conducted a field-based chemical-addition experiment. The design contained three chemical treatments plus a control, with four replicates in each of two species of tropical trees grown in plantations. The chemicals were added in reagent-grade form at a rate that doubled the natural detrital C inputs of 1000 g C m(-2) y(-1). Despite its purported recalcitrance, chitin was metabolized quickly, with soil respiration (R (soil)) increasing by 64% above the control within days, coupled with a 32% increase in soil extractable ammonium. Cellulose, which was expected to be labile, was not readily decomposed, whereas lignin was rapidly metabolized at least partially in one of the forest types. I examined effects of stoichiometry by adding to all treatments ammonium nitrate in a quantity that adjusted the C:N of cellulose (166) to that of chitin (10), using both field and in vitro experiments. For cellulose, CO2 release increased more than five- to eightfold after N addition in root-free soil incubated in vitro, but only 0-20% in situ where roots were intact. By the end of the 2-year-long field experiment, fine-root biomass tended to be higher in the chitin treatment, where R (soil) was significantly higher. Together these findings suggest that soil N availability limited cellulose decomposition, even in this Neotropical forest with high soil N stocks, and also that trees successfully competed for N that became available as chitin decomposed. These results indicate that the major constituent of cell walls of soil fungi, chitin, can decompose rapidly and release substantial N that is available for plant and microbial growth. As a consequence, soil fungi can stimulate soil OM decomposition and N cycling, and thereby play a disproportionate role in ecosystem C and N dynamics.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Russell, AE (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",arussell@iastate.edu,"Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0703561, 1119223]","Jim Raich provided advice throughout all stages of this study and bench space for the laboratory incubations, for which I am very grateful.

We quantified mycorrhizal sporocarp and hyphal respiration, as well as growing season net hyphal production, under ambient and elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O-3) in relation to natural temperature and moisture variation. Hyphal respiration did not respond significantly to elevated CO2 and O-3. Sporocarp respiration was affected by temperature and moisture content while hyphal respiratory response to temperature was undetected over the narrower range of soil temperatures captured. Hyphal respiration comprised 31 % of soil respiration, and the ratio of hyphal respiration to soil respiration declined with elevated CO2. Hyphal biomass was reduced under all treatments though not statistically significant. Given the large fraction of soil respiration represented by mycorrhizal fungi and its sensitivity to climate, a small change in fungal respiration could strongly affect carbon budgets and cycling under climate change.

Mycorrhizal fungi comprise a large fraction of that pool but are highly dynamic. We utilized an in situ soil observatory to study fungal dynamics of a California mixed-forest ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) ecosystem. Across 2011, we observed fungal hyphae daily using an automated minirhizotron. Simultaneously, we made continuous temperature, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and sap flow measurements. From the hyphal observations, we estimated hyphal net primary production. We then estimated total net primary production (NPP) and root NPP using DayCENT, an ecosystem model of carbon exchange parameterized for daily to annual output, for the calendar year 2011. Total NPP was 600 g C m(-2) with 200 g C m(-2) fine roots. The estimated NPP allocated to EMF was 162.6 g C m(-2) or 27 % of the total NPP. The proportion of the total NPP allocated to EMF based on the Hobbie and Hobbie (2006) N fractionation model, was 34 %. These differing techniques provided similar estimates that can be refined with additional research and can be used to improve regional and global models of C dynamics. (C) 2014 The Authors.

These highly dynamical systems are ideal to study soil structure development in the short to medium term, a process in which soil biota and plants play a substantial role. We investigated soil structure development on islands along a 40 year chronosequence within a 3 km island-braided reach of the Tagliamento River, Northeastern Italy. We used several parameters to capture different aspects of the soil structure, and measured biotic (e.g., fungal and plant root parameters) and abiotic (e.g. organic carbon) factors expected to determine the structure. We estimated models relating soil structure to its determinants, and, in order to confer statistical robustness to our results, we explicitly took into account spatial autocorrelation, which is present due to the space for time substitution inherent in the study of chronosequences and may have confounded results of previous studies. We found that, despite the eroding forces from the hydrological and geomorphological dynamics to which the system is subject, all soil structure variables significantly, and in some case greatly increased with site age. We interpret this as a macroscopic proxy for the major direct and indirect binding effects exerted by root variables and extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Key soil structure parameters such as percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA) can double from the time the island landform is initiated (mean WSA = 30%) to the full 40 years (mean WSA = 64%) covered by our chronosequence. The study demonstrates the fundamental role of soil biota and plant roots in aggregating soils even in a system in which intense short to medium term physical disturbances are common.

In-situ root uptake of isotopically-labeled ammonium, glycine and glutamine were compared between low-nitrogen (N)-availability and high-N-availability temperate forests. Comparable immediate C-13- and N-15-enrichment of fine roots indicated that short-term uptake of amino-acids by tree roots was similar between the two sites. Over the remainder of the experiment, recovery of amino-acid N-15 in fine roots was greater, and recovery of C-13 lower, in the high-N-availability site. Together with greater rates of conversion of amino-acid-derived N-15 into inorganic forms, this indicates that a greater proportion of amino-acid-derived N was taken up after it was converted to inorganic forms by soil microorganisms in the high N availability site. Results from this study suggest that capacity for amino acid uptake by tree roots did not differ between high- and low-N availability sites, but differences in microbial mineralization drove strong differences in the availability of inorganic forms of N between sites.

We explore this question with a novel four-year high-temporal-resolution data set of carbon allocation from two forest plots in the Bolivian Amazon. The forests show strong seasonal variation in tree wood growth rates, which are largely explained by shifts in carbon allocation, and not by shifts in total productivity. At the deeper soil plot, there was a clear seasonal trade-off between wood and canopy NPP, while the shallower soils plot showed a contrasting seasonal trade-off between wood and fine roots. Although a strong 2010 drought reduced photosynthesis, NPP remained constant and increased in the six-month period following the drought, which indicates usage of significant nonstructural carbohydrate stores. Following the drought, carbon allocation increased initially towards the canopy, and then in the following year, allocation increased towards fine-root production. Had we only measured woody growth at these sites and inferred total NPP, we would have misinterpreted both the seasonal and interannual responses. In many tropical forest ecosystems, we propose that changing tree growth rates are more likely to reflect shifts in allocation rather than changes in overall productivity. Only a whole NPP allocation perspective can correctly interpret the relationship between changes in growth and changes in productivity.","[Doughty, Christopher E.; Malhi, Yadvinder; Arroyo, Luzmila; Heredia, Juan P.; Pardo-Toledo, Erwin; Mendizabal, Luz M.; Rojas-Landivar, Victor D.; Vega-Martinez, Meison; Flores-Valencia, Marcio; Sibler-Rivero, Rebeca; Moreno-Vare, Luzmarina; Viscarra, Laura Jessica; Chuviru-Castro, Tamara; Osinaga-Becerra, Marilin; Ledezma, Roxana] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Araujo-Murakami, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Gabriel Rene Moreno, Museo Hist Nat Noel Kempff Mercado, Santa Cruz, Bolivia; [Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Silva-Espejo, Javier E.] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Cuzco, Peru","Doughty, CE (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",chris.doughty@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,"Doughty, Christopher/0000-0003-3985-7960; Silva Espejo, Javier Eduardo/0000-0003-1954-3817",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation,"This work is a product of the Amazon Forest Inventory Network (RAINFOR) consortium, and the Global Ecosystems Monitoring (GEM) network, and was funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

This study synthesizes data from manipulative studies and from studies contrasting ecosystem processes in different vegetation microsites (that is, shrub or herbaceous canopy versus intercanopy microsites), to assess how changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 affect biogeochemical cycles by altering plant and microbial physiology and ecosystem structure. Further, we explore how ecosystem structure impacts on biogeochemical cycles differ across a climate gradient. We found that: (1) our ability to project ecological responses to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 is limited by a dearth of manipulative studies, and by a lack of measurements in those studies that can explain biogeochemical changes, (2) changes in ecosystem structure will impact biogeochemical cycling, with decreasing pools and fluxes of C and N if vegetation canopy microsites were to decline, and (3) differences in biogeochemical cycling between microsites are predictable with a simple aridity index (MAP/MAT), where the relative difference in pools and fluxes of C and N between vegetation canopy and intercanopy microsites is positively correlated with aridity. We conclude that if climate change alters ecosystem structure, it will strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, with increasing aridity leading to greater heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling among microsites. Additional long-term manipulative experiments situated across dry shrublands are required to better predict climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycling in deserts.","[de Graaff, Marie-Anne; Campos, Xochi] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Throop, Heather L.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Verburg, Paul S.

The link between species' functional traits and competitive abilities has been described as a major factor structuring plant communities. However, two diverging hypotheses have been proposed to explain this process: competition-trait similarity and competition-trait hierarchy. 2. We performed a greenhouse experiment to determine whether grasses' root foraging strategies, from acquisitive or conservative functional groups, are linked to plant competitive ability and to test which hypothesis better explains interactions during the early stage of grass establishment under contrasting growth conditions. 3. Two grass species of each functional group were grown with and without a neighbour under two levels of water and phosphorus supplies. Three functional traits related to plant competitive ability were measured on all plants grown without neighbours: specific root length (SRL), root phosphorus use efficiency and root length density. Above-ground biomass was measured on plants grown with and without neighbours to evaluate the intensity of plant interaction. 4. We demonstrated that for the three traits the intensity of interaction is driven mainly by hierarchical trait distance, that is, trait distance between target and neighbour, and not by trait similarity. Growth conditions strongly affected the significance of the relation between hierarchical distances and competition intensity. For the SRL hierarchical distance, this effect may be due to the most competitive species (with high SRL) being strongly impacted by water shortage, which modified the competitive hierarchy. Trait plasticity in response to stresses also appeared an important factor influencing the competitive ability of species, that is, species with the most plastic SRL in response to P stress were also the most competitive under P stress. 5. A strong hierarchy exists among grasses' competitive abilities in non-limiting growth conditions that is linked to their root functional traits and investment in the root system. Consequently, our results support the trait hierarchy hypothesis in its ability to describe competitive interaction among grasses during early stages of establishment. 6. Our study provides evidence that root functional hierarchical trait distance and plasticity explain how grasses interact with their neighbours. This distance enables species to be ranked according to their competitive ability; however, this ranking may be influenced by the growth conditions and traits considered.","[Fort, Florian; Cruz, Pablo; Jouany, Claire] INRA, UMR AGIR 1248, Ctr Rech Toulouse, CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France","Fort, F (reprint author), INRA, UMR AGIR 1248, Ctr Rech Toulouse, CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",florian.fort@toulouse.inra.fr,"Fort, Florian/H-4827-2019","Fort, Florian/0000-0001-7983-6254",ANR project O2LAFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-STRA-09]; French Ministry of Education and Research,"This work was funded by the ANR project O2LA (ANR-09-STRA-09).

Combined, these shifts in environmental conditions impact many ecosystem properties and services. Long-term climate change experiments, such as the Rainfall Manipulation Plots (RaMPs), can be used to address soil community responses to simultaneous manipulation of temperature and temporal variability in precipitation. The RaMPs experiment is located in a native tallgrass prairie at the Konza Prairie Biological Station and has been operational since 1998 providing the potential to address responses to long-term environmental manipulations. To test whether community composition, richness, or diversity respond to environmental change, more than 40 000 fungal amplicons were analyzed from soil samples collected in 2006. The data suggest that soil fungal communities are compositionally resilient to predicted environmental change. This is the case both for the community composition overall as inferred from ordination analyses as well as analyses of variance for each of the most common Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). However, while this study suggests compositional resilience, further studies are required to address functional attributes of these communities and their responses to environmental manipulations.

Here, we report results from an extensive sampling of plant biomass and soil conducted at the conclusion of the experiment that enabled us to estimate ecosystem carbon (C) content and cumulative net primary productivity (NPP). Elevated CO2 enhanced ecosystem C content by 11%, whereas elevated O-3 decreased ecosystem C content by 9%. There was little variation in treatment effects on C content across communities and no meaningful interactions between CO2 and O-3. Treatment effects on ecosystem C content resulted primarily from changes in the near-surface mineral soil and tree C, particularly differences in woody tissues. Excluding the mineral soil, cumulative NPP was a strong predictor of ecosystem C content (r(2) = 0.96). Elevated CO2 enhanced cumulative NPP by 39%, a consequence of a 28% increase in canopy nitrogen (N) content (g N m(-2)) and a 28% increase in N productivity (NPP/canopy N). In contrast, elevated O-3 lowered NPP by 10% because of a 21% decrease in canopy N, but did not impact N productivity. Consequently, as the marginal impact of canopy N on NPP (Delta NPP/Delta N) decreased through time with further canopy development, the O-3 effect on NPP dissipated. Within the mineral soil, there was less C in the top 0.1 m of soil under elevated O-3 and less soil C from 0.1 to 0.2 m in depth under elevated CO2. Overall, these results suggest that elevated CO2 may create a sustained increase in NPP, whereas the long-term effect of elevated O-3 on NPP will be smaller than expected. However, changes in soil C are not well-understood and limit our ability to predict changes in ecosystem C content.","[Talhelm, Alan F.; Pregitzer, Kurt S.] Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Kubiske, Mark E.; Dickson, Richard E.; Isebrands, J.

Moose are large, browsing ruminants in the deer family, which subsist on fibrous, woody browse, and aquatic plants. Subspecies exist which are distinguished by differing body and antler size, and these are somewhat geographically isolated. Seventeen rumen samples were collected from moose in Vermont, Alaska, and Norway, and bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with titanium chemistry. Overall, 109,643 sequences were generated from the 17 individual samples, revealing 33,622 unique sequences. Members of the phylum Bacteroidetes were dominant in samples from Alaska and Norway, but representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were dominant in samples from Vermont. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae was the dominant family in all three sample locations, most of which belonged to the genus Prevotella. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the family Lachnospiraceae was the most prevalent in all three sample locations. The data set supporting the results of this article is available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), available through NCBI [study accession number SRP022590]. Samples clustered by geographic location and by weight and were heterogenous based on gender, location, and weight class (p < 0.05). Location was a stronger factor in determining the core microbiome than either age or weight, but gender did not appear to be a strong factor. There were no shared operational taxonomic units across all 17 samples, which indicates that these moose may have been isolated long enough to preclude a core microbiome among moose. Other potential factors discussed include differences in climate, food quality and availability, gender, and life cycle.","[Ishaq, Suzanne L.; Wright, Andre-Denis] Univ Vermont, Dept Anim Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Wright, Andre-Denis] Univ Vermont, Dept Med, Burlington, VT 05401 USA","Ishaq, SL (reprint author), Univ Vermont, Dept Anim Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, 203 Terrill Bldg,570 Main St, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",slpelleg@uvm.edu,,"Ishaq, Suzanne/0000-0002-2615-8055; Sundset, Monica/0000-0002-4850-262X",,,,41,24,25,0,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

However, the interactive effect of warming and nitrogen enrichment on soil microbial community is unclear. In this study, individual and interactive effects of experimental warming and nitrogen addition on the soil microbial community were investigated in a long-term field experiment in a temperate steppe of northern China. The field experiment started in 2006 and soils were sampled in 2010 and analyzed for phospholipid fatty acids to characterize the soil microbial communities. Some soil chemical properties were also determined. Five-year experimental warming significantly increased soil total microbial biomass and the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria in the soils. Long-term nitrogen addition decreased soil microbial biomass at the 0-10 cm soil depth and the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soils. Little interactive effect on soil microbes was detected when experimental warming and nitrogen addition were combined. Soil microbial biomass positively correlated with soil total C and N, but basically did not relate to the soil C/N ratio and pH. Our results suggest that future global warming or nitrogen enrichment may significantly change the soil microbial communities in the temperate steppes in northern China.","[Shen Rui-Chang; Chi Yong-Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shen Rui-Chang; Chi Yong-Gang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xu Ming] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Ctr Remote Sensing & Spatial Anal, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Yu Shen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Wan Shi-Qiang] Henan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Plant Stress Biol, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China","Xu, M (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Ctr Remote Sensing & Spatial Anal, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",mingxu@crssa.rutgers.edu,"Yu, Shen/C-2750-2009; Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009; Shen, Ruichang/O-4305-2017; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019; CAS, KLUEH-Cooperation/E-1148-2017","Yu, Shen/0000-0002-7543-6082; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232; Shen, Ruichang/0000-0003-0055-8058; /0000-0002-3418-1992","National Key Research and Development Program (973 Program) of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB417103]; Forestry Department of Qinghai Province, China [Y22LO300AJ]","Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (973 Program) of China (No. 2012CB417103) and the Forestry Department of Qinghai Province, China (No. Y22LO300AJ).",,68,20,22,15,172,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1002-0160,2210-5107,,PEDOSPHERE,Pedosphere,AUG,2014,24,4,,,,,427,436,,10.1016/S1002-0160(14)60029-1,,,10,Soil Science,Agriculture,AL4YY,WOS:000339141900001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hogberg, MN; Blasko, R; Bach, LH; Hasselquist, NJ; Egnell, G; Nasholm, T; Hogberg, P",,,,"Hogberg, Mona N.; Blasko, Robert; Bach, Lisbet Holm; Hasselquist, Niles J.; Egnell, Gustaf; Nasholm, Torgny; Hogberg, Peter",,,"The return of an experimentally N-saturated boreal forest to an N-limited state: observations on the soil microbial community structure, biotic N retention capacity and gross N mineralisation",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ectomycorrhizal fungi; N-15 natural abundance; Pinus sylvestris; Recovery; Reduced nitrogen deposition; Root nitrogen uptake,CHRONIC NITROGEN ADDITIONS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TREE GROWTH; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBON; DEPOSITION; BACTERIAL; BIOMASS,"To find out how N-saturated forests can return to an N-limited state, we examined the recovery of biotic N sinks under decreasing N supply. . We studied a 40-year-old experiment in Pinus sylvestris forest, with control plots, N0, three N treatments, N1-N3, of which N3 was stopped after 20 years, allowing observation of recovery. In N3, the N concentration in foliage was still slightly elevated, but the N uptake capacity of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots in N3 was no longer lower than in N0. Per area the amount of a biomarker for fungi, here mainly attributed ECM, was higher in N3 and N0 than in N1 and N2. Retention of labeled (NH4)-N-15 (+) by the soil was greater in the control (99 %) and N3 (86 %), than in N1 (45 %) and N2 (29 %); we ascribe these differences to biotic retention because cation exchange capacity did not vary. Gross N mineralisation and retention of N correlated, negatively and positively, respectively, with abundance of ECM fungal biomarker. .

Furthermore, soil CO2 flux - including plant root and microbial respiration - is a key feedback to ecosystem carbon (C) cycling that links ecosystem processes to climate, yet few studies have investigated the effects of N enrichment on belowground processes in water-limited ecosystems. In this study, we conducted two-level N addition experiments to investigate the effects of N enrichment on microbial and root respiration in a grassland ecosystem on the Loess Plateau in northwestern China. Two years of high N additions (9.2 g N m(-2) y(-1)) significantly increased soil CO2 flux, including both microbial and root respiration, particularly during the warm growing season. Low N additions (2.3 g N m(-2) y(-1)) increased microbial respiration during the growing season only, but had no significant effects on root respiration. The annual temperature coefficients (Q(10)) of soil respiration and microbial respiration ranged from 1.86 to 3.00 and 1.86 to 2.72 respectively, and there was a significant decrease in Q(10) between the control and the N treatments during the non-growing season but no difference was found during the growing season. Following nitrogen additions, elevated rates of root respiration were significantly and positively related to root N concentrations and biomass, while elevated rates of microbial respiration were related to soil microbial biomass C (SMBC). The microbial respiration tended to respond more sensitively to N addition, while the root respiration did not have similar response. The different mechanisms of N addition impacts on soil respiration and its components and their sensitivity to temperature identified in this study may facilitate the simulation and prediction of C cycling and storage in semiarid grasslands under future scenarios of global change.

Such compounds, for example root exudates or decaying fine roots, are easily available for microorganisms, and can alter the decomposition of older SUM (""priming effect""). We here report on a SUM priming experiment in the active layer of a permafrost soil from the central Siberian Arctic, comparing responses of organic topsoil, mineral subsoil, and cryoturbated subsoil material (i.e., poorly decomposed topsoil material subducted into the subsoil by freeze-thaw processes) to additions of C-13-labeled glucose, cellulose, a mixture of amino acids, and protein (added at levels corresponding to approximately 1% of soil organic carbon). SUM decomposition in the topsoil was barely affected by higher availability of organic compounds, whereas SUM decomposition in both subsoil horizons responded strongly. In the mineral subsoil, SUM decomposition increased by a factor of two to three after any substrate addition (glucose, cellulose, amino acids, protein), suggesting that the microbial decomposer community was limited in energy to break down more complex components of SOM. In the cryoturbated horizon, SUM decomposition increased by a factor of two after addition of amino acids or protein, but was not significantly affected by glucose or cellulose, indicating nitrogen rather than energy limitation. Since the stimulation of SUM decomposition in cryoturbated material was not connected to microbial growth or to a change in microbial community composition, the additional nitrogen was likely invested in the production of extracellular enzymes required for SUM decomposition. Our findings provide a first mechanistic understanding of priming in permafrost soils and suggest that an increase in the availability of organic carbon or nitrogen, e.g., by increased plant productivity, can change the decomposition of SUM stored in deeper layers of permafrost soils, with possible repercussions on the global climate.

However, there have been few reports on root exudates from field-grown plants or mature trees in situ, especially when exposed to experimental warming. In this study, we adopted and modified a culture-based cuvette system developed especially for root exudation collection in the field to collect soluble root exudates of a subalpine coniferous species, Abies faxoniana, under experimental warming and nitrogen fertilisation treatments. We then analysed the chemical composition and relative abundance of root exudates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major chemical constituents of root exudates were phenols and their derivatives of all the different treatments, such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. Experimental warming had significant effects on the relative contents of major compounds and an increase effect on the total phenolic acid compounds. By contrast, there were small significant effects of N fertilisation on root exudation and no significant effects of the warming x N fertilisation interaction. Meanwhile, warming also markedly increased soil polyphenol oxidase activity and it may be soil ecological adjustment response to changes of root exudation under global climate warming.","[Qiao, Mingfeng; Xiao, Juan; Yin, Huajun; Pu, Xiaozhen; Liu, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Mingfeng; Yue, Bisong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Mingfeng; Xiao, Juan; Pu, Xiaozhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Liu, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",liuqing@cib.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270552]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA01050303]; National Key Technology R D ProgramNational Key Technology R&D Program [2011BAC09B04],"This study was supported jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31270552), the strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA01050303) and the National Key Technology R & D Program (No. 2011BAC09B04).",,37,6,8,4,120,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0275-7540,1029-0370,,CHEM ECOL,Chem.

In this work, we investigated the effect of plants on Zn isotope fractionation in the soil-plant system of the surface horizon of two Zn-rich Technosols (pH 6.73-7.51, total Zn concentration = 9470-56600 mg kg(-1)). In a column experiment, the presence of Agrostis capillaris L. significantly increased the mobilization of Zn from soil to leachate, predominantly as a result of root-induced soil acidification. The zinc isotope compositions of plants and leachates indicated that the Zn uptake by A. capillaris did not fractionate Zn isotopes as compared to the leachates. Within the plant, heavier Zn isotopes were preferentially retained in roots (Delta Zn-66(root) - shoot = +0.24 to +0.40 parts per thousand). More importantly, the Zn released in leachates due to root-induced mobilization was isotopically heavier than the Zn released in the absence of plants (Delta Zn-66 = +0.16 to +0.18 parts per thousand). This indicates that the rhizosphere activity of A. capillaris mobilized Zn from another pool than the one that spontaneously releases Zn upon contact with the percolating solution. Mobilization of Zn by the roots might thus exert a stronger influence on the Zn isotope composition in the soil solution than the Zn uptake by the plant. This study highlights the key role of the rhizosphere activity in Zn release in soil and demonstrates that stable Zn isotopes provide a useful proxy for the detection of Zn mobilization in soil-plant systems.","[Houben, David; Sonnet, Philippe; Tricot, Guillaume; Opfergelt, Sophie] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Houben, David] HydrISE, Inst Polytech LaSalle Beauvais, F-60026 Beauvais, France; [Mattielli, Nadine; Couder, Eleonore] Univ Libre Brussels, Lab G Time Geochem Tracing Isotopes Minerals & El, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Houben, D (reprint author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2-L7-05-10, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",David.Houben@lasalle-beauvais.fr,"Houben, David/H-4338-2019; Opfergelt, Sophie/L-2107-2015","Houben, David/0000-0003-0574-3033; Opfergelt, Sophie/0000-0002-1773-4823","Fonds pour la formation a la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture (FRIA) of Belgium; ""Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique"" (FNRS, Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; FNRS, BelgiumFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [2.4599.11]","We thank P.

Soil properties may also influence the relation of this pathogen to ectomycorrhizae. To investigate these associations, 96 Q ilex declining stands were selected in western Spain and both declining and non-declining trees were sampled. Soil properties (soil depth, Ah horizon thickness, texture, pH, redox potential, soil bulk density and N-NH4+ and N-NO3- concentrations), P. cinnamomi root infections and ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance were assessed. The most dominant ectomycorrhizal morphotypes were Cenococcum geophilum, Tomentella spp. and Russula spp. Lower percentages of non-vital and vital ectomycorrhizal root tips were observed in declining than in non-declining trees. No significant differences in parameters characterising the ectomycorrhizal community between trees infected with or free of P. cinnamomi were observed. However, results indicate that non-mycorrhizal root tips are vulnerable entry points for the pathogen into the tree. More tips were colonised by Russula spp. and other ectomycorrhizal fungi in non-declining infected trees than in declining infected trees. Trees growing on stream banks showed a lower abundance of ectomycorrhizal root tips in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils. Ectomycorrhizal tip abundance was positively related to Ah horizon thickness, irrespective of tree health status. The presence of P. cinnamomi altered relations between ectomycorrhizal abundance and several soil properties. The limited ectomycorrhizal diversity in Q ilex declining stands and interactions of ectomycorrhizal abundance with soil texture, topography and P. cinnamomi root infections are reported and discussed.

Deeper understanding of the consequences of climate change will come from studies that consider not only the direct effects of temperature on individual species, but also the indirect effects of altered species interactions. Here we show that 20 years of experimental warming has changed the species composition of graminoid (grass and sedge) assemblages in a subalpine meadow of the Rocky Mountains, USA, by increasing the frequency of sedges and reducing the frequency of grasses. Because sedges typically have weak interactions with mycorrhizal fungi relative to grasses, lowered abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or other root-inhabiting fungi could underlie warming-induced shifts in plant species composition. However, warming increased root colonization by AM fungi for two grass species, possibly because AM fungi can enhance plant water uptake when soils are dried by experimental warming. Warming had no effect on AM fungal colonization of three other graminoids. Increased AM fungal colonization of the dominant shrub Artemisia tridentata provided further grounds for rejecting the hypothesis that reduced AM fungi caused the shift from grasses to sedges. Non-AM fungi (including dark septate endophytes) also showed general increases with warming.

The term glomalin is used because this putative protein, or group of proteins, was originally thought to be produced only by Glomus fungi. There is currently little information on the glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) content of tropical soils, particularly allophanic soils that are known to have different carbon dynamics to temperate climate soils. We have measured the Bradford-reactive GRSP content of soils sampled from forests and grasslands on the tropical island of Martinique and compared the observations with soil composition. Two operationally defined fractions of GRSP were measured, namely easily-extractable and total GRSP. The contents of GRSP in moist soils were in the range of 2-36 g kg(-1), accounting for about 8% of soil organic carbon, and were greater in topsoils than in corresponding subsoils. Both the GRSP contents and the fraction of soil organic carbon attributed to GRSP were greater than those reported for temperate climate soils. Both total and easily extractable GRSP contents were positively correlated to soil organic carbon content. The fraction of soil organic carbon that could be attributed to soil protein decreased with increasing allophane content for allophanic soils. No other trends of GRSP content with soil properties or land use were found. GRSP extraction was decreased about seven-fold by air-drying of soils, confirming the irreversible change in the soil microstructure of allophanic soils. Total and easily extractable GRSP were correlated and we conclude that both are good probes of thermo-stable soil protein content for these soils. No attempt was made to verify the fungal origin of the protein detected.","[Woignier, T.] IMBE, IRD, UMR 237, F-97232 Le Lamentin, France; [Woignier, T.] Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Sci & Tech St Jerome, CNRS, UMR 7263,IMBE, F-13397 Marseille 20, France; [Etcheverria, P.; Borie, F.] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Ameliorat & Sustainabil Volcan Soils, BIOREN UFRO, Temuco, Chile; [Quiquampoix, H.; Staunton, S.] INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, UMR Eco & Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France","Staunton, S (reprint author), INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, UMR Eco & Sols, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",staunton@montpellier.inra.fr,"Quiquampoix, Herve/C-7254-2011; Staunton, S./G-8095-2012","Staunton, S./0000-0001-5926-7015; Quiquampoix, Herve/0000-0001-6009-1360","programme Projet Innovant, Departement Environnement & Agronomie, INRA","The authors thank J.

They achieved poor establishment followed by weak summer survival. This was caused in part by low levels of nodulation with the inoculant strains, and by ineffective nodulation with naturalized strains -an example of non-selective nodulation. The aims of this work were to assess Lessertia spp. symbiotic promiscuity, to study the effect of increased doses of an effective inoculant strain (WSM3565) with L. herbacea, and to study the competitive ability and symbiotic performance of different Mesorhizobium strains nodulating L. diffusa. A glasshouse experiment was set up to evaluate the ability of L. diffusa, L. capitata, L. herbacea and L. excisa to nodulate with inoculants under current use in Western Australia. To assess competitive ability two field experiments were set up at Karridale, Western Australia. L. herbacea was inoculated with the strain WSM3565 at different doses and L. diffusa was inoculated with ten different Mesorhizobium strains. Rhizobia were re-isolated from nodules and their identity confirmed through PCR fingerprinting and sequencing of their partial dnaK. There were differences in promiscuity between different Lessertia spp., where L. herbacea proved to be highly promiscuous under controlled conditions. Increasing the inoculation dose of L. herbacea with WSM3565 did not improve establishment and survival of the legume in the field. Although WSM3565 nodule occupancy improved from 28 to 54 % with higher doses of inoculation, none of the treatments increased L. herbacea yield over the inoculated control. The inoculation of L. diffusa with the strains WSM3598, 3636, 3626 and 3565 resulted in greater biomass production than the uninoculated control. These strains were able to outcompete resident rhizobia and to occupy a high (> 60 %) proportion of lateral root nodules. The naturalised strains that achieved nodulation were identified as R. leguminosarum. The high numbers of resident rhizobia and their ability to rapidly nodulate Lessertia spp. are likely to be the main reasons for the low nodule occupancy achieved by some effective inoculant strains with L. diffusa and L. herbacea. Strains WSM 3636 and 3598 were very competitive on nodule occupancy and together with WSM 3565, WSM 3612 and WSM3626, effective on nodule formation and plant growth of L. diffusa despite the high numbers of resident soil rhizobia. These strains and L. diffusa have potential to be introduced as exotic legumes species and rhizobia strains to Western Australia.","[Gerding, Macarena] Univ Concepcion, Fac Agron, Chillan, Chile; [O'Hara, Graham William; Howieson, John Gregory] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Rhizobium Studies, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Braeu, Lambert] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Australia","Gerding, M (reprint author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Agron, Av Vicente Mendez 595, Chillan, Chile.",mgerding@udec.cl; G.Ohara@murdoch.edu.au; J.Howieson@murdoch.edu.au; lambert.brau@deakin.edu.au,"Brau, Lambert/J-3214-2018","Brau, Lambert/0000-0001-7105-8339",,,,72,6,6,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2014,380,2-Jan,,,,,117,132,,10.1007/s11104-014-2081-1,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,AK6PV,WOS:000338550500007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Yin, CY; Pu, XZ; Xiao, QY; Zhao, CZ; Liu, Q",,,,"Yin, Chunying; Pu, Xiaozhen; Xiao, Qunying; Zhao, Chunzhang; Liu, Qing",,,Effects of night warming on spruce root around non-growing season vary with branch order and month,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,C and N concentration; Night warming; Non-growing season; Non-structural carbohydrate; Root branch order; TTC reducing capacity,LONGLEAF PINE FOREST; TREE FINE ROOTS; MEDITERRANEAN SHRUBLAND; LIFE-SPAN; POPULUS-DELTOIDES; CONIFEROUS FOREST; TEMPERATE STEPPE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELEVATED CO2; SUGAR MAPLE,"The Root is an important plant organ and has high heterogeneity; how it responds to global warming is yet to be answered. This study examined the growth and physiological responses of fine roots to warming around the non-growing season. Plants from 4-year-old Picea asperata were grown under experimental warming conditions. A detailed investigation was conducted by measuring biomass, triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) reducing capacity, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentration, non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) of the primal five branch order roots in early (April) and late (September) growing seasons as well as in the non-growing season (December). Warming promoted fine root growth in April and fine root turnover was mostly in the first four orders. It decreased root C, N concentration in the early and late growing seasons but increased N concentration in the non-growing season. Moreover, it increased NSC concentration (especially soluble sugar) in April but decreased its concentration (soluble sugar and starch) in December. TTC reducing capacity in April was higher than in the other 2 months. The effect of warming on tree roots varied with its branch order and month. The lower order (first three or four order, in general) roots were sensitive to warming, especially in April (early part of growing season) and December (non-growing season). Warming accelerated the carbon input from root to soil. It is indicated that any changes in winter temperatures could alter the sink strength of terrestrial ecosystems considerably. Moreover, TTC reducing capacity could reflect more information about root, but it was more sensitive than N concentration.","[Yin, Chunying; Pu, Xiaozhen; Xiao, Qunying; Zhao, Chunzhang; Liu, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Yin, Chunying; Pu, Xiaozhen; Xiao, Qunying; Zhao, Chunzhang; Liu, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Pu, Xiaozhen; Xiao, Qunying] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Yin, CY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu Inst Biol, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",yincy@cib.ac.cn; liuqing@cib.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31070533, 31370495, 31100446]; project of 'Knowledge Innovation Engineering' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-J-22]; ""Young Professor Plan"" Program of Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS [Y3B2021100]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31070533, 31370495 and 31100446), the project of 'Knowledge Innovation Engineering' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KSCX2-EW-J-22) and the ""Young Professor Plan"" Program of Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS (No. Y3B2021100).

Changes in radar waveform parameter of roots to different cross angles were investigated. Tanikawa et al. Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013) clarified that 1) the variation in amplitude area (a signal strength related waveform parameter) to different cross angles fitted a sinusoidal waveform; and 2) the impact of root orientation on root diameter estimation by GPR could be mathematically corrected by applying a grid transect survey. However, we found that the quantitative relationship established in Tanikawa et al. Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013) between amplitude area and cross angle was incorrect, and the application of a grid transect survey still underestimated root diameter. The change in amplitude area to cross angle between transecting line and root orientation fits a sinusoidal waveform but different to that reported in Tanikawa et al. Plant Soil 373:317-327, (2013). The polarization of GPR wave may explain such sinusoidal variation in amplitude area to cross angle.

(2013) and (ii) to improve our method of estimating A(90A degrees) using A(x) of root angle x. Measured A values of Tanikawa et al. (2013) were analyzed with the modified equations. The first inaccuracy was the use of incorrect units for the coefficient b (the phase shift) in the sinusoidal waveform of A(x). The units should have been radians instead of degrees. The second inaccuracy was the mis-derivation of A(x) into A(x + 90A degrees). In the modified method, A(90A degrees) was estimated by A(x) from two orthogonally intersecting transect lines and a transect line at a diagonal to them. The two inaccuracies did not affect the previous main conclusions that the parameter T was suitable for estimating root diameter and that grid transects are likely to identify clear hyperbolas reflecting roots in radar profiles (Tanikawa et al. 2013).

Here we examine whether changes of the soil biota community by the successful invader Solidago canadensis influence growth and herbivore susceptibility of two coexisting native plant species (Tanacetum vulgare, Melilotus albus). Root zone soil from two different habitat types ('urban' and 'suburban') was collected and used as inocula in a plant-soil feedback study. Each plant species was grown either in its own soil biota community or with the community with a history from the competitive invasive or native plant species. To identify potential drivers of responses to the different soil biota communities, we analyzed root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark-septate endophytes (DSE), and the community composition of soil inhabiting nematodes at the end of our experiment. Results show that S. canadensis and M. albus were not affected by soil history. In contrast, T. vulgare showed increased plant growth in 'foreign' soil derived from S. canadensis root zone compared with its 'home' soil suggesting a growth promotion by the soil biota community of S. canadensis. From the examined drivers, the abundance of DSE explained the growth response of T. vulgare to the S. canadensis soil biota community best. However, shoot herbivory by banded snails (Cepaea nemoralis, C. hortensis) was not affected by soil history, but by the habitat type where the soil inocula originated. Our study shows that a native plant species may profit from the presence of an invasive competitor mediated by changes in the soil biota community.","[Schittko, Conrad; Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Schittko, C (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",conrad.schittko@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,70,14,15,4,139,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Consequently, we lack information on the fate of this extra carbon (C) acquired. By a steady application of a (CO2)-C-13 label in a free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, we traced the fate of C in 37-m-tall, ca. 110-year-old Picea abies trees in a natural forest in Switzerland. Hence, we are not reporting tree responses to elevated CO2 (which would require equally C-13 labeled controls), but are providing insights into assimilate processing in such trees. Sunlit needles and branchlets grow almost exclusively from current assimilates, whereas shaded parts of the crowns also rely on stored C. Only 2.5 years after FACE initiation, tree rings contained 100 % new C. Stem-respiratory CO2 averaged 50 % of new C over the entire FACE period. Fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi contained 49-56 and 26-43 % new C, respectively, after 2.5 years. The isotopic signals in soil CO2 arrived 12 days after the onset of FACE, yet it contained only ca. 15 % new C thereafter. We conclude that new C first feeds into fast turnover C pools in the canopy and becomes increasingly mixed with older C sources as one moves away (downward) from the crown. We speculate that enhanced C turnover (its metabolic cost) along the phloem path, as evidenced by basipetal isotope signal depletion, explains part of the 'missing carbon' in trees that assimilated more C under elevated CO2.","[Mildner, Manuel; Bader, Martin K. -F.; Leuzinger, Sebastian; Koerner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Bader, Martin K. -F.] New Zealand Forest Res Inst SCION, Rotorua 3046, New Zealand; [Leuzinger, Sebastian] Auckland Univ Technol, Inst Appl Ecol New Zealand, Sch Appl Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Siegwolf, Rolf T.
