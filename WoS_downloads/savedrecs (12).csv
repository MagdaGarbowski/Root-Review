Carbon and nitrogen mineralisation increased as the transect entered the mangrove, indicating a greater availability of organic matter, probably by root excretion. Time course measurements of sulphate reduction indicated a subsurface pool of labile carbon. Carbon dioxide production within the mangrove exceeded oxygen flux across the sediment surface, indicating a subsurface source of oxygen of 28 to 179 mmol m-2 d-1. The turnover time for the sedimentary sulphide pools decreased as the transect entered the mangrove. The production of ammonium from organic nitrogen, measured by (NH4+)-N-15 turnover, also indicated active subsurface organic matter mineralisation. The source of this organic nitrogen is unknown. Measured rates of nitrogen fixation were too low to supply the required organic nitrogen. The estimated net availability of ammonium to the plant roots was 10 mmol m-2 d-1.

Intensive C cycling was inferred from high rates of O2 uptake (131 mmol m-2 d-1), CO2 production (199 mmol m-2 d-1) and sulfate reduction (34 mmol m-2 d-1). Subsurface input of organic matter was indicated by the high rates of sulfate reduction and the presence of a short-lived organic pool (5 to 10 h). We suggest that this organic pool, which was associated with whole plants, was due to root excretion. There was little accumulation of sulfide, which was probably oxidised in the deeper sediment strata by O2, secreted from roots. Nitrogen cycling was equally active. (NH4+)-N-15 dilution indicated a net production rate for NH4+ of ca 8 mmol m-2 d-1 within the sediment, available for root uptake. Ammonium also accumulated in the sediment overnight (ca 7 mmol m-2) and disappeared during the day, presumably due to greater uptake by the roots in light compared to dark. Rates of nitrogen fixation were low (ca 1 mmol m-2 d-1) and did not Vary much during the day. Dawn denitrification rates were high (ca 4 mmol m-2 d-1), but they decreased during the day.","UNIV ESSEX, DEPT BIOL, COLCHESTER CO4 3SQ, ESSEX, ENGLAND; UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT MICROBIOL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA","BLACKBURN, TH (reprint author), AARHUS UNIV, INST BIOL SCI, DEPT MICROBIAL ECOL, DK-8000 AARHUS, DENMARK.",,,,,,,48,70,73,0,10,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

However, plant growth is determined both by rates of net photosynthesis and by proportional allocation of fixed carbon to autotrophic tissue and heterotrophic tissue. Although CO2 fertilization may enhance growth by increasing leaf-level assimilation rates, reallocation of biomass from leaves to stems and roots in response to higher concentrations of CO2 and higher temperatures may reduce whole-plant assimilation and offset photosynthetic gains. We measured growth parameters, photosynthesis, respiration, and biomass allocation of Pinus ponderosa seedlings grown for 2 months in 2 x 2 factorial treatments of 350 or 650mu bar CO2 and 10/25-degrees-C or 15/30-degrees-C night/day temperatures. After 1 month in treatment conditions, total seedling biomass was higher in elevated CO2, and temperature significantly enhanced the positive CO2 effect. However, after 2 months the effect of CO2 on total biomass decreased and relative growth rates did not differ among CO2 and temperature treatments over the 2-month growth period even though photosynthetic rates increased almost-equal-to 7% in high CO2 treatments and decreased almost-equal-to 10% in high temperature treatments. Additionally, CO2 enhancement decreased root respiration and high temperatures increased shoot respiration. Based on CO2 exchange rates, CO2 fertilization should have increased relative growth rates (RGR) and high temperatures should have decreased RGR. Higher photosynthetic rates caused by CO2 fertilization appear to have been mitigated during the second month of exposure to treatment conditions by a almost-equal-to 3% decrease in allocation of biomass to leaves and a almost-equal-to 9% increase in root:shoot ratio. It was not clear why diminished photosynthetic rates and increased respiration rates at high temperatures did not result in lower RGR. Significant diametrical and potentially compensatory responses of CO2 exchange and biomass allocation and the lack of differences in RGR of ponderosa pine after 2 months of exposure of high CO2 indicate that the effects of CO2 fertilization and temperature on whole-plant growth are determined by complex shifts in biomass allocation and gas exchange that may, for some species, maintain constant growth rates as climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations change. These complex responses must be considered together to predict plant growth reactions to global atmospheric change, and the potential of forest ecosystems to sequester larger amounts of carbon in the future.","UNIV ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL 61801 USA; DUKE UNIV, DEPT BOT, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA; DUKE UNIV, DEPT GEOL, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA",,,,,,,,52,89,102,3,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1994,98,2,,,,,159,166,,10.1007/BF00341468,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NW266,WOS:A1994NW26600007,28313973,,,,10/31/19J,"VANNOORDWIJK, M; SPEK, LY; DEWILLIGEN, P",,,,"VANNOORDWIJK, M; SPEK, LY; DEWILLIGEN, P",,,PROXIMAL ROOT DIAMETER AS PREDICTOR OF TOTAL ROOT SIZE FOR FRACTAL BRANCHING MODELS .1.

The initial size (diameter) and the essential branching rules thus contain the information required to construct the whole pattern. If root branching patterns have fractal characteristics, measurement of the proximal root diameter at the stem base and the branching rules as observed anywhere in the root system, would be enough to predict total root length, root diameter distribution and root length per unit dry weight (specific root length). A 'pipe stem' model is used to derive algebraic relations between total root size and proximal root diameter for two classes of branching patterns, determinate and proportionate. To predict total root length from the proximal root diameter, at least information is needed on the minimum root diameter, the average length of internal and external links (segments) and the proportionality factor between total cross sectional areas before and after branching. For the length of the longest root or the specific root length further information on the branching rules is needed, as it is highest for determinate and proportionate branching rules, respectively.","UNIV UTRECHT,3584 CH UTRECHT,NETHERLANDS; DLO,AGROBIOL & SOIL FERTIL RES INST,9750 AC HAREN,NETHERLANDS","VANNOORDWIJK, M (reprint author), INT CTR RES AGROFORESTRY,SE ASIAN REG RES PROGRAM,POB 161,BOGOR 16001,INDONESIA.",,,"van Noordwijk, Meine/0000-0002-7791-4703",,,,26,75,76,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,1994,164,1,,,,,107,117,,10.1007/BF00010116,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PQ466,WOS:A1994PQ46600013,,,,,10/31/19J,"SPEK, LY; VANNOORDWIJK, M",,,,"SPEK, LY; VANNOORDWIJK, M",,,PROXIMAL ROOT DIAMETER AS PREDICTOR OF TOTAL ROOT SIZE FOR FRACTAL BRANCHING MODELS .2.

A greenhouse study was made to compare the effect of inoculating an effective Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain onto seed (s) or into the bulk soil (b) with treatments containing an additional inoculation (with the same strain, or an ineffective B. japonicum strain) onto seed or into soil. Nodulation, N2 fixation and growth of soybean were measured, using the N-15 isotope dilution method to quantify the N fixed. The method of inoculation had significant effects on nodule distribution along soybean roots, nodule number and fresh weight, and N2 fixation. In general, soil inoculation resulted in more nodules being formed, more uniform distribution of nodules on the root, and greater nitrogen fixation. The influence of the ineffective strain (in combinations containing both strains) on nodulation and N2 fixation depended on where each or both strains were inoculated. Generally, highest N2 fixation was achieved by inoculating the effective strain into soil. N2 fixation by seed-inoculated effective strain was significantly depressed in the presence of the soil-inoculated ineffective strain (Es + Ib) but not when both strains were inoculated onto seed (Es + Is), or when both strains were inoculated together into soil (Eb + Ib). The trend for %Ndfa was generally similar to total nitrogen fixed. Our results therefore indicate that there can still be substantial N2 fixation in legumes by highly effective strains even in the presence of less effective strains if the effective strains are fairly well distributed in soil.","INT ATOM ENERGY AGENCY,JOINT FAO IAEA DIV,POB 100,A-1400 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIV,INST AGR RES & TRAINING,IBADAN,NIGERIA; FAO IAEA LAB,SEIBERSDORF,AUSTRIA",,,,,,,,31,6,6,0,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

The distribution of fine roots in the stratified soil profile was correlated with soil depth, Kjeldahl N, and organic matter, with the latter two parameters showing the highest coefficients of determination (0.73 and 0.71, respectively). In the more sandy but layered subsoil (0.36-3.17 m depth), soil depth, Kjeldahl N, and sand content were most strongly correlated with fine root density, with depth and sand content giving the highest coefficients of determination (0.32 and 0.31, respectively).

Two acid sulfate soils (Typic Sulfaquept, Bang Pakong Series; and Sulfic Tropaquept, Rangsit Series) were adjusted to four pH levels: 3.8 or 4.0 (original soil pH), 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 (amended with lime). Dry weight was determined 49 days after sowing. Concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Al were also determined in aerial plant parts at harvest. The legumes responded differently to soil acidity and liming, but not to soil type. Cajanus cajan had the highest biomass production, followed by S. aculeata, S. rostrata and S. speciosa, in this order. The N concentration closely paralleled biomass production, suggesting that the growth of symbiotic rhizobia and nodulation were perhaps more susceptible to soil acidity than were the host plants. Liming to pH 5.5-6.0 was recommended for the legumes' growth based on the quadratic relationships between dry-matter yield and soil pH, In the unlimed soils, the Ca concentration in C. cajan and S. aculeata (0.32%) was twice as high as that in the two low-yielding legumes (0.15%). Furthermore, plant Ca increased exponentially (or quadratically in case of S. speciosa) as lime additions increased. It was estimated that for adequate growth, the Ca requirement in the shoot dry matter was approximately: C. cajan 1.2% Ca, S. aculeata 0.8%, S. rostrata 0.6%, and S. speciosa 0.4% In contrast with Ca, the concentration of Fe, and to a lesser extent Mn, was significantly lower in C. cajan and S. aculeata than in S. rostrata and S. speciosa. The ratio of Ca to Al in plant tops was used to characterize plant tolerance to soil acidity, and to quantify the critical Al concentration in the plants. It appears that greater than or equal to 90% maximum growth was attained only when Ca/Al was greater than or equal to 150 for C. cajan and S. speciosa, greater than or equal to 200 for S. rostrata, and greater than or equal to 300 for S. aculeata. Cajanus cajan tolerated up to 80 mg Al kg(-1) in the shoot dry matter, whereas significant growth reduction occurred in the Sesbania species at levels > 30 mg Al kg(-1).","UNIV HAWAII,DEPT AGRON & SOIL SCI,HONOLULU,HI 96822","POOLPIPATANA, S (reprint author), KING MONGKUTS INST TECHNOL,DEPT SOIL SCI,BANGKOK 10520,THAILAND.",,,,,,,21,7,8,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1994,163,1,,,,,131,139,,10.1007/BF00033949,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PH746,WOS:A1994PH74600015,,,,,10/31/19J,"VANROSSUM, D; MUYOTCHA, A; DEHOOP, BM; VANVERSEVELD, HW; STOUTHAMER, AH; BOOGERD, FC",,,,"VANROSSUM, D; MUYOTCHA, A; DEHOOP, BM; VANVERSEVELD, HW; STOUTHAMER, AH; BOOGERD, FC",,,SOIL ACIDITY IN RELATION TO GROUNDNUT BRADYRHIZOBIUM SYMBIOTIC PERFORMANCE,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ARACHIS HYPOGAEA; BRADYRHIZOBIUM; GROUNDNUT; SOIL ACIDIFICATION; SOIL ACIDITY,ARACHIS-HYPOGAEA L; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; NODULATION; TOLERANCE; ALUMINUM; PH; RHIZOBIA; STRAINS; CALCIUM,"Effects of soil acidity on groundnut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic performance were studied in a potted, sandy soil in a glasshouse in Zimbabwe. The soil was limed to soil-pH levels of 5.0 and 6.5. Soil acidity negatively affected plant development, measured as leaf area and plant dry weight, while nodulation was enhanced. This acidity-enhanced nodulation was most evident when nodulation was caused by the indigenous Bradyrhizobium population. Effects of soil acidity differed between groundnut cultivars and Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, the former having greater importance. Two Arachis hypogaea L. Spanish-type cultivars, Falcon and Plover, performed equally well at neutral soil pH, but Falcon was more acid tolerant. Comparison of the symbiotic performance in neutral versus acid soil of two Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, MAR 411 (3G4b20) and MAR 1510 (CB 756), showed that MAR 411 performed superiorly in neutral soil, but MAR 1510 in acid soil. The indigenous Bradyrhizobium population was more effective than was inoculation with strains MAR 411 or MAR 1510. Comparison of twelve Bradyrhizobium spp. strains for their symbiotic performance in acid soil showed that some strains were totally ineffective under acidity stress (MAR 253, MAR 967 and MAR 1506), while others performed well. Bradyrhizobium spp. strain MAR 1576 (32 H1) ranked highest for nitrogen accumulation, plant dry weight and leaf area, with strains MAR 1555 (TAL 11) and MAR 1510 following closely. Nitrate fertilisation of groundnut plants led to soil alkalinisation, while nitrogen fixation resulted in soil acidification. Soil acidity in combination with soil sterilisation gave rise to symptoms associated with Al and Mn toxicity.","SOIL PRODUCT RES LAB,MARONDERA,ZIMBABWE; AGR UNIV WAGENINGEN,DEPT MOLEC BIOL,6703 HA WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS","VANROSSUM, D (reprint author), FREE UNIV AMSTERDAM,BIOCTR,INST MOLEC BIOL SCI,DEPT MICROBIOL,DE BOELELAAN 1087,1081 HV AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,32,11,12,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1994,163,2,,,,,165,175,,10.1007/BF00007965,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PL192,WOS:A1994PL19200003,,,,,10/31/19J,"VOLKMAR, KM",,,,"VOLKMAR, KM",,,PRE-GERMINATION EFFECTS ON MECHANICALLY IMPEDED ROOT-GROWTH OF BARLEY (HORDEUM-VULGARE L),PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,BARLEY; ROOT GROWTH; PENETROMETER; SEED GERMINATION; SEED VIGOR,VIGOR; PENETRATION; SOILS; YIELD,"The effects of conditions pre-dating germination on growth rate of impeded barley cv.

One of two horizontal compartments contained 100 g soil (quartz sand : clay loam, 1:1) with 0.5 g ground clover leaves labelled with P-32. The labelled soil received microbial inoculum without AM fungi to ensure mineralization of the added organic matter. The labelling compartment was separated from a central root compartment by either 37 mu m or 700 mu m nylon mesh giving only hyphae or both roots and hyphae, respectively, access to the labelled soil. The recovery of P-32 from the hyphal compartment was 5.5 and 8.6 % for plants colonized with Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively, but only 0.6 % for the non-mycorrhizal controls. Interfungal differences were not related to root colonization or hyphal length densities, which were lowest for G. caledonium. Both fungi depleted the labelled soil of NaHCO3-extractable P and P-32 compared to controls. A 15-25 % recovery of P-32 by roots was not enhanced in the presence of mycorrhizas, probably due to high root densities in the labelled soil. The experiment confirms that AM fungi differ in P uptake characteristics, and that mycorrhizal hyphae can intercept some P immobilization by other microorganisms and P-sorbing clay minerals.","AGR UNIV NORWAY,DEPT BIOTECHNOL SCI,N-1432 AS,NORWAY","JONER, EJ (reprint author), RISO NATL LAB,DEPT ENVIRONM SCI & TECHNOL,PLANT BIOL SECT,DK-4000 ROSKILDE,DENMARK.",,"Jakobsen, Iver/F-1116-2011; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535",,,,34,43,46,0,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1994,163,2,,,,,203,209,,10.1007/BF00007969,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PL192,WOS:A1994PL19200007,,,,,10/31/19J,"GODOY, R; ROMERO, R; CARRILLO, R",,,,"GODOY, R; ROMERO, R; CARRILLO, R",,,MYCOTROPHIC STATUS OF THE VASCULAR FLORA IN NATIVE CONIFER FORESTS FROM SOUTHERN CHILE,REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,MYCORRHIZA; SYMBIOSIS; INOCULATION WITH MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,,"The distribution of native conifers in the Southern Hemisphere are limited to small areas.

In spring and in autumn of two growing seasons, a six day labelling pulse of C-14 labelled CO2 was used to follow the carbon assimilation and distribution in the plant-soil system. Doubling atmospheric CO2 had a significant effect on the tree net carbon uptake. A large proportion of the additional C uptake was 'lost' through the root system. This suggests that increased C uptake under elevated CO2 conditions increases C cycling without necessarily increasing C storage in the plant. Total root derived material represented a significant amount of the 'extra-assimilated' carbon due to the CO2 treatment and was strongly correlated with the phenological stage of the tree. Increasing root rhizodeposition led to a stimulation of microbial activity, particularly near the end of the growing season. When plant rhizodeposition was expressed as a function of the root dry weight, the effect of increasing CO2 resulted in a higher root activity. The C to N ratios were significantly higher for trees grown under elevated CO2 except for the fine root compartment. An evaluation of the plant-soil system nitrogen dynamics showed, during the second season of CO2 treatment, a decrease of soil N mineralization rate and total N uptake for trees grown at elevated CO2 levels.","UNIV PARIS 11, ECOL VEGETALE LAB, CNRS, URA 121, F-91045 ORSAY, FRANCE","ROUHIER, H (reprint author), CNRS, CTR ECOL FONCT & EVOLUT, ROUTE MENDE, BP 5051, F-34033 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",,,,,,,39,60,67,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,1994,162,2,,,,,281,292,,10.1007/BF01347715,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,PC562,WOS:A1994PC56200015,,,,,10/31/19J,"RAGHUWANSHI, A; DUDEJA, SS; KHURANA, AL",,,,"RAGHUWANSHI, A; DUDEJA, SS; KHURANA, AL",,,EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON FLAVONOID PRODUCTION IN PIGEONPEA [CAJANUS-CAJAN (L) MILLSP] IN RELATION TO NODULATION,BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Note,,,,,,RHIZOBIUM SPP; BRADYRHIZOBIUM SPP; TEMPERATURE; PIGEONPEA; FLAVONOIDS; NODULATION; N2 FIXATION,SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN-FIXATION; INDUCE NOD GENES; BRADYRHIZOBIUM SP; RHIZOBIUM; ALFALFA,"To ascertain the reasons for poor nodulation of pigeonpea, we studied the effect of high temperature on the production of flavonoids by the pigeonpea host.

Some authors suggest that this results in decreased growth below and above ground, decline, and ultimately in death. Accordingly, we examined soil solution Al and Ca, soil and foliar chemistry, and their relationship to red spruce decline on Whiteface Mountain, New York, where severe red spruce mortality occurred between the mid-1960s and late 1980s. Spruce mortality and crown condition are strongly related to elevation, but there is no evidence that the occurrence or degree of spruce decline is related to exchangeable Al, Mg, Ca, or their ratios in mineral or organic horizons. Foliar Ca and Mg concentrations that we measured were in the range judged to be sufficient based on field fertilization studies. Soil solution ratios of Ca:Al in mineral and organic horizons were above the threshold (1:1 molar ratio) proposed as detrimental to Ca uptake in all samples collected during three of four growing seasons, and soil-solution Al concentrations were well below levels thought to inhibit spruce root growth. If Al toxicity is a factor in red spruce decline on this mountain, it is acting in a way that is not detectable using soil and foliar analyses.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT NAT RESOURCES,ITHACA,NY 14853; DARTMOUTH COLL,DEPT EARTH SCI,HANOVER,NH 03755; DARTMOUTH COLL,ENVIRONM STUDIES PROGRAM,HANOVER,NH 03755","JOHNSON, AH (reprint author), UNIV PENN,DEPT GEOL,HAYDEN HALL,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19104, USA.",,"Battles, John/G-8233-2012","Battles, John/0000-0001-7124-7893",,,,40,13,13,0,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

A comparative study has been made of the allometric relationships among below-ground and above-ground dimensions of seedlings (6.5-27 cm tall) of 14 abundant shade-tolerant species taken from the forest floor in a warm-temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, southern Japan. 2. The allometric lines between below-ground dimensions are significantly different between species, which reflects the differentiation between the species developing tap-roots and those developing horizontal fine roots in the same forest. The difference correlates with a difference in seed size, but not with height at maturity or habitat (ridge vs slope or gully). It is hypothesized that the differences in root architecture are related to 'choices' in microsite for establishment, the large-seeded tap-rooted species being better suited to soft soil and deep litter, and the small-seeded lateral rooters to rocky soil and a lack of litter. 3. The allometric relationship relating below- and above-ground dry mass is not sufficient to characterize a species' architecture; a species may have a large ratio of root mass to shoot mass but a low ratio of fine-root length to leaf area. 4. Interspecific differentiation in below-ground allometries at the seedling stage is not correlated with that in above-ground allometries at the seedling stage or with that in above-ground allometries at the sapling stage with developed branching architecture. Allometric 'design' in architecture at the sapling stage (related to earlier or later canopy-gap formation) is variously combined with that at the seedling stage (related to the microsite of establishment).",,"KOHYAMA, T (reprint author), KYOTO UNIV,CTR ECOL RES,SHIMOSAKAMOTO,OTSU 52001,JAPAN.",,"Kohyama, Takashi/A-4031-2012","Kohyama, Takashi/0000-0001-7186-8585",,,,0,54,55,0,0,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Achenes of R. adoneus fall directly below the infructescence within 15 cm of the maternal plant. Secondary seed movement is also restricted, with seeds transported only, on average, an additional 10 cm during snowmelt the following spring. The distribution of R. adoneus seeds in the soil mirrors this view of highly restricted dispersal. Snowbed soil contains an average of 0.033 seeds per cm3, but snow buttercup seeds are not found 20-40 m away in meadows bordering the snowbed. These findings suggest that limited seed dispersal acts to confine recruitment to locations within parental habitats. Transplanted seedlings in meadow and snowbed microsites had statistically indistinguishable survival rates over their first growing season. However, causes of seedling mortality differed between habitats. Risk of seedling desiccation was fourfold higher in snowbed than meadow vegetation. In contrast, predation by small mammals occurred only in meadow microsites. These findings imply that genotypes appropriate for regeneration in the snowbed are probably poorly suited for colonization of adjacent plant communities. Experimental modification of transplanting destinations in the meadow showed that microsites most conducive to growth and survival of snow buttercup seedlings provided opportunities for rapid infection by VA mycorrhizae in the absence of neighboring vegetation. Such combinations of environmental factors are probably rare and ephemeral.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT BOT,DAVIS,CA 95616; UNIV CALIF DAVIS,CTR POPULAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","SCHERFF, EJ (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,DIV BIOL SCI,105 TUCKER HALL,COLUMBIA,MO 65211, USA.",,"Stanton, Maureen/E-1204-2012",,,,,60,44,46,1,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1994,69,3,,,,,405,413,,10.2307/3545853,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NP632,WOS:A1994NP63200006,,,,,10/31/19J,"KRISHNAN, HB; PUEPPKE, SG",,,,"KRISHNAN, HB; PUEPPKE, SG",,,"HOST-RANGE, RFLP, AND ANTIGENIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RHIZOBIUM-FREDII STRAINS AND RHIZOBIUM SP NGR234",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,14th North American Conference on Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation,"JUL 25-29, 1993","UNIV MINNESOTA, ST PAUL, MN",,UNIV MINNESOTA,HOST RANGE; NOD GENES; NODULATION; RHIZOBIUM; SYMBIOSIS,FAST-GROWING RHIZOBIA; NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIONT; VIGNA-UNGUICULATA; JAPONICUM STRAINS; NODULATION GENES; ROOT-NODULES; GLYCINE-MAX; USDA 191; SP-NOV; HOMOLOGY,"Rhizobium fredii is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont from China that combines broad host range for nodulation of legume species with cultivar specificity for nodulation of soybean.

NGR234 nodulated 16 of 18 tested lugume species, and nodules on 14 of the 16 fixed nitrogen. The R. fredii strains were not distinguishable from one another. They nodulated 13 of the legumes, and in only nine cases were nodules effective. All legumes nodulated by R. fredii were included within the host range of NGR234. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were detected with four DNA hybridization probes: the regulatory and common nod genes, nodDABC; the soybean cultivar specificity gene, nolC; the nitrogenase structural genes, nifKDH; and RFRS1, a repetitive sequence from R. fredii USDA257. A fifth locus, corresponding to a second set of soybean cultivar specificity genes, nolBTUVWX, was monomorphic. Using antisera against whole cells of three R. fredii strains and NGR234, we separated the 11 strains into four serogroups. The anti-NGR234 sera reacted with a single R. fredii strain, USDA191. Only one serogroup, which included USDA192, USDA201, USDA217, and USDA257, lacked cross reactivity with any of the others.

Experiments with C-14-phenylalanine in the presence and absence of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase inhibitors show that exudation of flavonoid nod-gene inducers from alfalfa roots is linked closely to their concurrent synthesis. In contrast, flavonoid and betaine nod-gene inducers are already present on mature seeds before they are released during germination. Alfalfa seeds and roots release structurally different nod-gene-inducing signals in the absence of rhizobia. When R. meliloti is added to roots, medicarpin, a classical isoflavonoid phytoalexin normally elicited by pathogens, and a nod-gene-inducing compound, formononetin-7-O-(6''-O-malonylglycoside), are exuded. Carbon flow through the phenylpropanoid pathway and into the flavonoid pathway via chalcone synthase is controlled by complex cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors which are not completely understood. Even less information is available on molecular regulation of the two other biosynthetic pathways that produce trigonelline and stachydrine. Presumably the three separate pathways for producing nod-gene inducers in some way protect the plant against fluctuations in the production or transmission of the two classes of signals. Factors influencing transmission of alfalfa nod-gene inducers through soil are poorly defined, but solubility differences between hydrophobic flavonoids and hydrophilic betaines suggest that the diffusional traits of these molecules are not similar. Knowledge derived from studies of how legumes regulate rhizobial symbionts with natural plant products offers a basis for defining new fundamental concepts of rhizosphere ecology.","UNIV CAPE TOWN,RONDEBOSCH 7700,SOUTH AFRICA; POLITECH WROCLAWSKA,WROCLAW,POLAND","PHILLIPS, DA (reprint author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,"Dakora, Felix/0000-0002-9070-6896",,,,82,47,49,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,1994,161,1,,,,,69,80,,10.1007/BF02183086,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,NX786,WOS:A1994NX78600007,,,,,10/31/19J,"FRITZ, E; KNOCHE, D; MEYER, D",,,,"FRITZ, E; KNOCHE, D; MEYER, D",,,A NEW APPROACH FOR RHIZOSPHERE RESEARCH BY X-RAY-MICROANALYSIS OF MICROLITER SOIL SOLUTIONS,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,EDX; ELEMENT ANALYSIS; RHIZOSPHERE; ROOT; SOIL SOLUTION; X-RAY MICROANALYSIS,ROOT INTERFACE; ALUMINUM,"Lolium perenne growing with high root density on a fine nylon mesh (Kuchenbuch and Jungk, 1982) caused the development of element gradients in the rhizosphere below the mesh.

Lack of snow cover caused a decrease in soil temperature to well below 0-degrees-C from December to April and a lowering of the soil water content to 10%. The abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in the spring sap of deep-soil frost-stressed trees was significantly higher than in control or drought-stressed trees. The increase in ABA concentration in the xylem sap in the spring of 1991 and 1992 preceded symptoms of canopy decline and a decrease in leaf area that were observed during the summers of 1991 and 1992. These results suggest a role for ABA in root-to-shoot communication in response to environmental stress. The largest differences in ABA concentration induced by the treatments was found in sap collected at the end of sap flow. The increase in ABA concentration in spring sap at the end of the sap flow could be used as an early indicator of stress suffered by trees during the winter. Not only did the increase in ABA concentration occur before any visible symptoms of tree decline appeared, but the trees that showed the most evident decline had the highest ABA concentrations in the spring sap.

The species were chosen to represent a wide array of taxa, ecological, and morphological characteristics, and were assigned regeneration niche (RN) index values based on observations of life history and spatial distribution of their seedlings and saplings in various forest microsites. 2 Growth, biomass allocation patterns, leaf anatomy and stomatal responses varied appreciably among species, as well as in response to shading. All species showed reduced growth with decreasing light intensity. Plants grown at 37% and 10% PAR exhibited morphological and physiological responses typical of plants found at forest edges and in large gaps: i.e. low leaf area ratio (LAR), high specific leaf weight (SLW), high root-shoot ratio (RSR), high relative growth rate (RGR), high net assimilation rate (NAR), high leaf conductance, and high chlorophyll a/b ratio. Those grown at 2.5% PAR showed the opposite trends. Comparing species within each light level, NAR and LAR showed positive correlation with RGR, but pooled data for all light levels suggests that the contribution of LAR and NAR to RGR are in opposite directions, depending on light conditions. 3 Sensitivity of seedling growth to shading was significantly correlated with mean seed reserve weight of the species: small-seeded species were more affected than large-seeded ones. Relationship between seed reserve weight and species RN index value, though linear, was weak and nonsignificant. RGR was significantly correlated with seed reserve weight at 37% and 10% PAR but not at 2.5% PAR, while LAR showed the opposite trend. 4 Plasticity of most parameters examined appeared highest in species that regenerate mostly in large gaps (> 200 m2) and at forest edges, and least in species that regenerate mostly in forest understorey and small gaps (< 50 m2).

It is used here to compare leaf water relations of ten species coexisting in a semiarid grassland community (Festucetum vaginatae danubiale) in Hungary. Three groups of species can be distinguished. In two of these leaf water potential changes only moderately with decreasing leaf water content. These are either short-lived, drought escaping spring plants relying on seasonally favourable water supply (group 1) or xerophytes with very deep root system having access to permanent water resources (group 2, only one species studied here). Xerophytes with moderately deep roots (group 3) display a rapid drop of leaf water potential with increasing leaf water deficit. This generates a steep water potential gradient in the soil-plant continuum that in turn enhances water uptake by roots.

Plasmid transfer to one of the native soil bacterial isolates was also demonstrated in a soil microcosm containing white clover seedlings. Insertion of Tn5 into the symbiotic plasmid of the strain ICMP2163 impaired nitrogen fixation in some Tn5-labelled derivatives and effective, ineffective or partly effective Rhizobium=Tn5 derivatives were identified. When representative derivatives were crossed with the non-nodulating native soil bacterium NR40 and crosses were inoculated on white clover seedlings, all transconjugants formed nodules. Electron micrographs showed that ineffective or partly effective associations invaded fewer plant cells. Some of the bacteroids formed appeared damaged in comparison to the bacteroids of effective transconjugants which formed nodules and invaded cortical cells in a similar manner to ICMP2163. Competition experiments between the inoculant Rhizobium strain ICMP2]63 and strains of transconjugant soil bacteria showed that the transconjugant soil bacteria outcompeted the inoculant strain to form nodules on clover roots.

The most abundant species, namely Alstonia boonei, Ricinodendron heudelotti and Terminalia superba, each contribute 5% to the total number of trees. These, and many of the other species, are known to form vesicular-arbuscular (VA) (endo-) mycorrhizal associations. Using a modification of the sucrose centrifugation method, spores of VA fungi were extracted from soil of undisturbed forest. The spores were attributed to five species of Acaulospora (laevigatum, mellea, morrowae, scrobiculata and spinosa), seven of Glomus (clavisporum, etunicatum, fasciculatum, geosporum, macrocarpum, occultum and rubiformis) and two of Scutellospora (coralloidea and pellucida). There were two other distinctive types of spores, C4 and C12, with affinities to spores of Acaulospora and Scutellospora respectively. A few spores seemed to be parasitized. Of the 250 spores per 100 g dry soil 63% were attributed to G. etunicatum and 18%, 6% and 5% to aggregates of G. occultum/A. scrobiculata, A. mellea/A. morrowae and C12/S. pellucida respectively. Although spores were very unevenly distributed (Simpson's equitability index = 0.025), mean numbers in replicate plots (each 1 ha) were fairly consistent. However, numbers of C4, A. spinosa, A. laevigatum and G. occultum/A. scrobiculata were significantly larger near the trunks of Terminalia superba than at a distance (7.5-1 0 m away). Total numbers of spores extracted on different occasions sometimes differed significantly, but effects of season were not established. However, during the 2 year period of the investigation numbers of spores of some relatively sparse species consistently decreased while those of others increased. Total numbers of spores in the rhizosphere soils of four tree species were usually twice as large as those of spores in bulk soil (440-600 compared with 250 per 100 g dry soil). As in bulk soil, numbers of spores in rhizosphere soils were dominated by G. etunicatum and G. occultum/A. scrobiculata, but spores of A. mellea/A. morrowae, which tended to be restricted to Entrandrophragma cylindricum and Khaya sp., were replaced by those of G. geosporum. G. etunicatum was more strongly associated with Lovoa trichilioides than Entrandrophragma cylindricum, Khaya sp. and Triplochiton scleroxylon. On the other hand, G. fasciculatum/G. macrocarpum was linked with Entrandrophragma cylindricum, Lovoa trichilioides and Triplochiton scleroxylon but not Khaya sp.","UNIV EDINBURGH,INST ECOL & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,EDINBURGH EH9 3JU,SCOTLAND; INST TERR ECOL,PENICUIK EH26 0QB,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND","MUSOKO, M (reprint author), INT INST TROP AGR,PMB 5320,IBADAN,NIGERIA.",,,,,,,37,19,21,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

A fundamental building block of the biology and ecology of any organism is accurate identification and an understanding of its relationship to other organisms. The taxonomy of the larger fungi has been largely based on morphological classification of sexual structures but now Taxonomy routinely incorporates mating studies, and biochemical and molecular data. Taxonomy may not revolutionize theories on mycorrhiza but can clarify some of the inconsistencies due to misrepresentation or over-generalizations and inappropriate conclusions drawn from studies with inaccurately identified fungi. To illustrate this, we discuss an example where incorrect fungal names were repeatedly erroneously applied in morphological and physiological research reports on this fungus, e.g. Laccaria laccata. In this case subsequent taxonomic study revealed the reason for the conflicting research results reported for this fungus. We discuss the status of identifying the ectomycorrhizal fungi in various forest communities in Australia and the relationships of this process to assessing their use in forestry. Recent intensive efforts to collect, isolate and identify Australian ectomycorrhizal fungi have revealed an enormous and unique species diversity, e.g., for truffle-like fungi, over 2000 collections from the last five years alone have yielded 2 new families, 24 new genera, and about 184 new species. Nearly 95% of the described and undescribed fungi from Australia are novel, with some 22 genera and 3 families endemic. In most cases the current systematic knowledge of mycorrhizal fungi is inadequate to support clear framework for Australian taxa. This reflects the traditional Northern Hemisphere view of the world, the uniqueness of the Australian fungal flora, and how poorly it is known. For example, the genus Hymenogaster had been widely acknowledged as the most reduced member of the Cortinariaceae. However recent work on Hymenogaster species from the Southern Hemisphere has offered a number of alternative affinities to various species. We also discuss the role proper identification of the organisms involved plays in understanding the ecosystem. Emphasis should be placed on how species diversity equates with physiological and genetic diversity and how a sound taxonomic understanding of species and their systematic position is essential to properly manage them. Accurate taxonomic information will continue to be required as the basis for assessing the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in sustained ecological development. Of particular significance is the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in maintenance of plant diversity in natural ecosystems and those disturbed by management. In conclusion, we present some key research areas involving the use of taxonomy that need priority attention.","CSIRO,DIV FORESTRY,WEMBLY,WA 6014,AUSTRALIA","CASTELLANO, MA (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,PACIFIC NW RES STN,FORESTRY SCI LAB,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA.",,,,,,,30,30,32,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1994,159,1,,,,,37,46,,10.1007/BF00000093,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,NB756,WOS:A1994NB75600004,,,,,10/31/19J,"MORTON, JB; BENTIVENGA, SP",,,,"MORTON, JB; BENTIVENGA, SP",,,"LEVELS OF DIVERSITY IN ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI (GLOMALES, ZYGOMYCETES) AND THEIR ROLE IN DEFINING TAXONOMIC AND NONTAXONOMIC GROUPS",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,"International Symposium on Management of Mycorrhizas in Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry","SEP 28-OCT 02, 1992","PERTH, AUSTRALIA",,,DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY; ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR BIOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY; ONTOGENY; PHYLOGENY; VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; ENDOGONACEAE; PLANTS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMATICS; ACAULOSPORA; ANTIBODIES; SYMBIOSIS,"Diversity in glomalean fungi is manifested at the molecular, morphological, and ecological levels. Characters at any of these levels can be ordered into hierarchical patterns defining taxonomic groups if they are conserved enough to be heritable through geologic time in all descendants of a common ancestor. At present, only morphological characters associated with mode of spore formation and in subcellular structure of spores are sufficiently stable and diverse to recognize at least 150 species. Ontogenetic comparisons indicate that species integrity, despite asexual reproduction, is the result of rigid internal constraints imposed on variation during the process of spore subcellular differentiation. Epigenetic factors dominate because the differentiation sequence is linear and each new stage is causally linked to preceding stages. Some morphological characters of the fungal mycelium also exist, but they define more inclusive groups at the family level and above. Most diversity in the mycorrhizae consists of life-history traits associated with abundance and architecture of fungal components, their rate of formation and longevity, and their cost in the symbiosis. These characters participate in processes at the molecular and ecological levels, so they are autonomous from morphological determinants. They often are labile or affected by external environmental conditions, so fewer stable taxonomic characters are likely to be discovered. Instead, molecular and ecological diversity has greater potential to define; (a) niche specificity of organisms/populations and (b) causal processes linked to host-fungus compatibility and mycorrhizal efficiency. Any taxonomic characters that relate to mycorrhizal functions will come only from comparative studies involving organisms from shared habitats rather than those having shared spore morphologies.",,"MORTON, JB (reprint author), W VIRGINIA UNIV,DIV PLANT & SOIL SCI,401 BROOKS HALL,POB 6057,MORGANTOWN,WV 26506, USA.",,,,,,,59,47,54,1,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1994,159,1,,,,,47,59,,10.1007/BF00000094,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,NB756,WOS:A1994NB75600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"CLEMENSSONLINDELL, A",,,,"CLEMENSSONLINDELL, A",,,TRIPHENYLTETRAZOLIUM CHLORIDE AS AN INDICATOR OF FINE-ROOT VITALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS IN CONIFEROUS FOREST STANDS - APPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Note,,,,,,ENZYMES; INE ROOT VITALITY; NITROGEN; PICEA-ABIES; PINUS-SYLVESTRIS; TRIPHENYLTETRAZOLIUM CHLORIDE,SCOTS PINE; DYNAMICS,"The present study is an attempt to investigate whether triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), a chemical compound which measures dehydrogenase activity, could be used to study fine-root vitality from two different points of view: (i) in relation to ageing; (ii) as an indicator of environmental stress, in this case of excess nitrogen.

A positive relationship between leaf photosynthetic capacity and above-ground biomass production was also noted for 4 of the 5 clones. The euramerican clone Robusta was an exception, showing high photosynthetic rates, but low biomass production. This discrepancy was mainly due to the lower leaf area of this clone, and possibly also due to a larger carbon allocation to below-ground biomass (Barigah, 1991).

A mycorrhizal survey was carried out in the sites in relation with seasonal variations. Fifteen plants were sampled every three months during a year to ascertain arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization and the number of spores in the rhizosphere. The mycorrhizal population level was adversely affected by soil degradation, with the lowest values of mycorrhizal colonization (none in Limonium sp.) and spore numbers (average 10.3 spores per 100 g) occurring in the most disturbed sites. In addition, seasonal differences in the incidence of mycorrhizae were observed. The highest values of average spore numbers of all the plant species sampled were obtained in July (40.3 spores per 100 g) and October (48.2 spores per 100 g), which corresponded to plant fructification and repose. The maximum mycorrhizal colonization for each individual plant was reached during flowering or vegetative growth period of the host plant. No relation between infection and spore density was found. Soil disturbance results in a decrease of mycorrhizal population level, but mycorrhizal propagules do not disappear completely suggesting a certain degree of adaptation to stress.",,"DIAZ, G (reprint author), UNIV MURCIA,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL VEGETAL,CAMPUS ESPINARDO,E-30071 MURCIA,SPAIN.",,,,,,,0,15,20,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS,BRISTOL,"1900 FROST ROAD, SUITE 101, BRISTOL, PA 19007-1598",0890-3069,,,ARID SOIL RES REHAB,Arid Soil Res.

Stem mass decreased significantly with increasing altitude, flower mass increased with altitude, but root and leaf mass did not vary. Root: shoot ratios and leaf and flower allocation increased significantly with altitude whilst stem allocation decreased significantly. Because stems comprised up to 80% of community biomass, most of the variation in allocation of other biomass components and root: shoot ratios were simply reflections of variation in absolute stem mass. Variation in stem mass was produced by phenotypic plasticity as well as a lack of stemmed species at high altitudes. Tree seedlings grown without neighbours for two years showed significantly higher stem allocation at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Two common stemless species were found only at high altitudes whilst a third occurred at all altitudes. Species richness was greatest at intermediate altitudes where maximum overlap occurred between stemmed and stemless species.","[Wilson, Scott D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Wilson, SD (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",sdwilson@max.cc.uregina.ca,"Wilson, Scott/D-6923-2011",,,,,24,9,11,0,5,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,1994,1,2,,,,,185,189,,10.1080/11956860.1994.11682242,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,V19XN,WOS:000208105200009,,,,,10/31/19B,"VANTUINEN, D;

In Strategy I which occurs in all plant species except grasses, a plasma membrane-bound reductase is induced with enhanced net excretion of protons. Often the release of reductants/chelators is also higher. In Strategy II which is confined to grasses, there is an increase in the biosynthesis and secretion of phytosiderophores which form chelates with Fe-III. Uptake of Fe-III phytosiderophores is mediated by a specific transporter in the plasma membrane of root cells of grasses. From results based mainly on long-term studies under non-axenic conditions this classification into two strategies has been questioned, and the utilization of Fe from microbial siderophores has been considered as an alternative strategy particularly in grasses. Possible reasons for controversial results are discussed in some detail. The numerous effects of microorganisms in non-axenic cultures, and the as yet inadequate characterization of the so-called standard (basic) reductase present major limitations to understanding different mechanisms of Fe acquisition. In comparison with the progress made in identifying the cellular mechanisms of root responses in Strategy I and Strategy II plants, our understanding is poor concerning the processes taking place in the apoplasm of root rhizodermal cells and of the role of low-molecular-weight root exudates and siderophores in Fe acquisition of plants growing in soils of differing Fe availability.",,"MARSCHNER, H (reprint author), UNIV HOHENHEIM,INST PFLANZENERNAHRUNG 330,D-70593 STUTTGART,GERMANY.",,,,,,,80,350,380,2,74,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1994,165,2,,,,,261,274,,10.1007/BF00008069,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,QC018,WOS:A1994QC01800011,,,,,10/31/19J,"IKEDA, J",,,,"IKEDA, J",,,THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM WITHDRAWAL OF NACL STRESS ON NODULATION OF WHITE CLOVER,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,NACL STRESS; NODULATION; RHIZOBIUM LEGUMINOSARUM; ROOT HAIR CURLING; WHITE CLOVER,NITROGEN-FIXATION; SALINITY; GROWTH; INFECTION; RHIZOBIA,"The number df nodules formed by white clover (Trifolium repens L.) released from NaCl stress for 3 days (137 mol m(-3)) at different periods was examined.

A NaCl stress-free period immediately after inoculation was the best among the stressed treatments, indicating that the early stage of nodulation was more sensitive than the later stages. Microscopic observation showed that imposing NaCl stress during the first 3 days after inoculation suppressed root hair curling to 9.1%; of control, while the numbers of rhizobia attached to roots counted by dilution plates were not affected.

The Rfg1 and Rj4 genes were determined to be located at separate loci. Chi-square analysis for linkage indicated that Rfg1 segregated independently of the Rj4, I and W1 loci.","USDA ARS,BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR W,INST PLANT SCI,SOYBEAN & ALFALFA RES LAB,BELTSVILLE,MD 20705","DEVINE, TE (reprint author), USDA ARS,BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR W,PLANT MOLEC BIOL LAB,BELTSVILLE,MD 20705, USA.",,,,,,,30,6,7,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,1994,158,1,,,,,47,51,,10.1007/BF00007916,,,5,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,MX422,WOS:A1994MX42200006,,,,,10/31/19J,"GRIFFIOEN, WAJ; IETSWAART, JH; ERNST, WHO",,,,"GRIFFIOEN, WAJ; IETSWAART, JH; ERNST, WHO",,,MYCORRHIZAL INFECTION OF AN AGROSTIS-CAPILLARIS POPULATION ON A COPPER CONTAMINATED SOIL,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,AGROSTIS CAPILLARIS; COPPER TOLERANCE; MINE SOILS; VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA; ZINC,VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; METAL TOLERANCE; ZINC TOLERANCE; PLANTS; ROOTS; BETULA; FUNGI; ACQUISITION; PHOSPHORUS; GRASSLAND,"To investigate the possible natural development of heavy metal tolerance in VA-mycorrhizal fungi, plants of Agrostis capillaris from an uncontaminated, a copper-contaminated and a zinc/cadmium-contaminated area were examined for VA-mycorrhizal infection.

Numbers of rhizobia in excess of 1000 per seed did not substantially increase earliness of nodulation or total number of nodules formed on the taproot. Nodules, however, were formed nearer the top of the taproot as numbers of rhizobia increased to 100,000 per seed. Delayed inoculation experiments indicated that nodulation sites for these clovers only remained susceptible to infection for less than 1 day. Delaying inoculation for 4 days resulted in only a 1 to 2 day delay in nodulation for arrowleaf and crimson clovers respectively and no delay for subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.).

To counter this assertion we consider the practical uses of the traditional assay procedure in relation to real research situations. This requires the use of the assay to be considered separately in the different circumstances of pot-grown and field-grown plants. We conclude that for pot-grown legumes there are a few practical applications where the use of the traditional, closed assay procedure is valid and we accept that these can be extended by the careful use of calibrations against open, flow-through systems. However, we doubt that there are many situations where such a calibration approach would have practical advantages over using the flow-through system to obtain the actual measurements.

At the highest level of soil water content the seedling growth increased linearly with light intensity while the root/shoot ratio decreased with light intensity. At low levels of soil water content both the growth and root/shoot ratio slightly increased with increased light. The soil water content was also affected by the light intensity indicating that the soil water content may have caused unobserved effects in responding to increased light in previous investigations.

The activity of cellulase enzymes measured in the laboratory correlated well with basal respiration and correlated better with the S and N pollution gradient than the basal respiration rate.

The hypothesis was tested that early-successional species achieve their greatest seedling size in clearings and contrast in this respect with late-successional species. Late-successional species were expected to show a stronger morphological response (leaf/root ratio) to clearings than early-successional ones. The results provided some evidence in support of these hypotheses with one exception, namely that late-successional Castanopsis fargesii appeared to be a highly sun-tolerant species.

Greater than 50% of annual length production occurred before midsummer in both ecosystems, while the period of greatest mortality was from late summer through winter. About one third of annual fine root production and mortality occur simultaneously, with little observable change in total root length pools. Using fine root length dynamics to derive biomass production and mortality, we calculated annual biomass production values of approximately 8000 and 7300 kg.ha(-1).year(-1), respectively, at the southern and northern sites. Corresponding biomass mortality (i.e., turnover) values were 6700 and 4800 kg.ha(-1).year(-1) and total nitrogen returns to the soil from fine root mortality were 72 kg.ha(-1).year(-1) at the southern site and 54 kg.ha(-1).year(-1) at the northern site. Fine roots dominated total biomass and N litter inputs to the soil in both ecosystems, accounting for over 55% of total biomass and nearly 50% of total N returns. In both ecosystems, roots <0.5 mm comprised the bulk of fine root biomass and N pools, and the contribution of these roots to northern hardwood ecosystem carbon and nitrogen budgets may have been underestimated in the past.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT FORESTRY,E LANSING,MI 48824",,,,,,,,65,274,328,1,62,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Strong competitive effects of Andropogon disappeared in the absence of mycorrhizas indicating that its competitive dominance in tallgrass prairie is highly dependent upon its mycorrhizal associations. The influence of mycorrhizal fungi on Andropogon responses to neighbours decreased with increasing neighbour density indicating reduced host plant benefit from mycorrhizas under crowded conditions. 3 Effects of mycorrhizas on competition were generally smaller for the less mycorrhiza-dependent Elymus. Elymus effects on target plants were not strongly affected by mycorrhizas. Elymus target plants in competition with Andropogon neighbours performed better when nonmycorrhizal, due to the lack of significant competitive suppression by Andropogon in the absence of mycorrhizas. The influence of mycorrhizal fungi on Elymus responses to Andropogon neighbours increased with increasing neighbour density. Neither mycorrhizas nor phosphorus fertilization had a significant effect on intraspecific competition among Elymus. 4 Patterns of tiller production by target plants were similar to patterns in their total dry weight, indicating that competitive and mycorrhizal effects on target plant size were primarily a result of effects on tiller numbers rather than individual tiller size. 5 The results show that mycorrhizal symbiosis can strongly influence the patterns and intensity of both intraspecific density effects and interspecific competition between co-occurring prairie grasses and that the degree of host-plant benefit derived from mycorrhizas is density dependent.","KANSAS STATE UNIV AGR & APPL SCI,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,MANHATTAN,KS 66506","HARTNETT, DC (reprint author), KANSAS STATE UNIV AGR & APPL SCI,DIV BIOL,MANHATTAN,KS 66506, USA.",,"Wilson, Gail/G-4255-2012",,,,,30,168,175,0,72,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Observations can be stored on video tape which facilitates data handling and computer-aided image processing. A color composite technique using digital image analyses was adapted in this study to detect barley root dynamics from sequential minirhizotron images. Plants were grown in the greenhouse in boxes (80 X 80 X 75 cm) containing soil from a surface horizon of a Typic Cryoboroll. A minirhizotron was installed at a 45-degrees-C angle in each box. Roots intersecting the minirhizotron were observed and video-recorded at tillering, stem extension, heading, dough and ripening growth stages. The images from a particular depth were digitized from the analog video then registered to each other. Discrimination of roots from the soil matrix gave quantitative estimates of root appearance and disappearance. Changes in root appearance and disappearance were detected by assigning a separate primary color (red, green, blue) to selected growth stages, then overlaying the images to create red-green and red-green-blue color composites.

All seedlings lifted in mid-February and mid-March survived one growing season in a cultivated, weed-free nursery soil, but height growth was significantly reduced by 300-cm drops. The survival of seedlings lifted in August was reduced by 5 and 15 drops particularly from 300 cm.

Studies on C-11 real-time analyses of P. coloratum to determine above-ground effects of grasshopper grazing and belowground effects of mycorrhizal inoculation and nematode feeding provided the database. A series of multi- and univariate statistical investigations of all available experimental data described responses of leaves, stems, and roots to these biological stresses. From a principal components analysis we have shown differences in distribution of C source-sink locations along three principal component axes, which accounted for 84% of the experimental variance. The first and second components (62% of variance) described C allocation to leaf, stem, and root sinks. The third component (22% of variance) showed a metabolic dichotomy between leaf starch sinks and labile carbon pools throughout the plant. We use the three principal components from a C-11 three-compartment model describing leaf, stem, and root C source and sink variables to present patterns, or fingerprints, of responses to the experiments. Time of day, treatment class, number of days since transplanting, and ecotype controlled a large amount of the overall variation in plant C fixation and reallocation. A comparison of C-12 leaf carbon exchange rates (CER) measured with an infrared gas analyzer and C-11 rates showed a high positive correlation. Slopes for grasshopper grazing, mycorrhizal inoculation experiments, and nematode feeding showed almost identical results; however, differences in the intercept developed as a function of ecotype. We noted a significantly lower intercept in morning studies, but no differences in the slope for morning compared to afternoon studies. CER and all C-11 variables for grasshopper and nematode experiments showed a lower coefficient of variation (CV) than controls; mycorrhizae had slightly lower CV values for C-11 variables and higher for CER. We conclude that C-11 experiments provide the base for developing laboratory, field, and modeling studies to incorporate aggregations of real-time C transfers within plants responding to biological stresses, including those of heterotrophs.","UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT ENTOMOL,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT NEMATOL,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521; SYRACUSE UNIV,BIOL LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13206",,,"Wall, Diana H/F-5491-2011",,,,,24,4,6,0,9,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The major attributes differentiating these groups were the date at which seasonal growth ended, rooting depth, sprouting depth, distance between shoots of the same plant, and degree of 'mesophytism'. We used Cluster and Principal Components Analyses to identify the groups, and the attributes determining them. Late-growth-cycle types had deep roots and/or high 'xerophytism'. Late-cycle-xerophytic types had a great sprouting depth, and late-cycle-deep-rooted types had a great distance between shoots of the same plant. On the basis of current knowledge of the structure and functioning of the Patagonian steppe, we suggested three explanations to account for these correlations. 1. Late-cycle forbs survive summer water deficit if they have xerophytic characteristics that reduce transpiration water losses, and/or they have deep roots that increase water uptake. 2. Sprouting depth results from the shift of active buds to dormant buds at the end of the cycle. Summer forbs have a great sprouting depth because only buds which are located deep in the soil survive hot and dry summers. 3. Distant shoots of summer forbs allow them simultaneously to use the high protection against desiccating winds provided by shrubs, and the ample water availability of bare soil patches. All the functional types of forbs depend on winter water recharge to begin their cycles, but each one completes its cycle by using a different portion of the water resources available in spring and summer.",,"GOLLUSCIO, RA (reprint author), UNIV BUENOS AIRES,FAC AGRON,DEPT ECOL,AV SAN MARTIN 4453,RA-1417 BUENOS AIRES,ARGENTINA.",,,"Sala, Osvaldo/0000-0003-0142-9450",,,,0,73,83,1,28,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,KNIVSTA,"APELSINVAGEN 47, S 741 00 KNIVSTA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

In stands where fem cover is dense, black cherry seeds germinate, but seedlings do not become established. Allelopathy was eliminated as the cause of interference in previous work; the present studies evaluated the resources of soil water, soil phosphorus, soil nitrogen, and light. The impact of hay-scented fem on the level of each resource, the availability of each resource to black cherry seedlings, and the growth response of black cherry seedlings to changes in resource availability were evaluated. Hay-scented fem had little effect on soil moisture levels, nor did it affect plant availability of soil water. The level of soil phosphorus was not reduced by the presence of hay-scented fem nor was phosphorus availability to black cherry seedlings less when they grew with fem. Both the speed and degree of mycorrhizal infection and the foliar phosphorus concentrations were similar in seedlings growing with or without fem cover. Hay-scented fem had no effect on rates of ammonium- or nitrate-nitrogen production nor was the soil concentration of ammonium affected. The presence of hay-scented fem significantly reduced the soil nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the first year after a shelterwood seed cut, but not in die second. Overstory tree roots were more important than hay-scented fem in removing soil nitrate. Availability of soil nitrogen was unaffected by the presence of hay-scented fem or overstory tree roots. Black cherry seedlings grew more where ferns were absent, regardless of whether overstory tree roots were present or absent. Competitive reduction in light was the key mechanism of fem interference with black cherry. Hay-scented fern caused dramatic reductions in both the photon flux density and the ratio of red to far-red light beneath it. Black cherry seedlings survived and grew poorly in the presence of fem foliage shade.

Water stress significantly reduced P-n, G(s), and T-s (by more than 70%), whereas EDU and O-3 treatments had no appreciable effect on these parameters. There was no indication that ethylene evolution was influenced by any of the stress factors imposed in this study. There were no significant interactions between these stress factors and the physiological parameters measured. Growth measurements showed that height increase was reduced by 22% in water-stressed seedlings, whereas new shoot biomass, root biomass and leaf area declined by 10%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. New shoot biomass, root biomass, and leaf area were reduced by the EDU treatment. Root/shoot ratio was not significantly altered by the drought treatment employed. Overall, there were no significant effects of O-3 fumigation on growth. The interaction of water stress and O-3 fumigation at 0.07 ppm significantly reduced root biomass and the root/shoot ratio. The EDU and 0.15 ppm O-3 together reduced height growth more than either factor alone.","OHIO WESLEYAN UNIV,DEPT BOT & MICROBIOL,DELAWARE,OH 43015","CANNON, WN (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,NE FOREST EXPT STN,DELAWARE,OH 43015, USA.",,,,,,,46,17,18,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

A root-segment model was combined with a soil water model to predict water uptake by roots of Agave deserti and Ferocactus acanthodes of four different lengths at 10 orientations from horizontal to vertical after various simulated rainfall events. 2. The soil was divided into 15 strata with specific water potentials (PSI(soil)) and temperatures; each root segment had specific values of radial hydraulic conductivity from the root surface to the xylem (L(R)) and of axial hydraulic conductivity along the xylem (K(h)). For roots of the monocotyledonous A. deserti, L(R) decreased with distance from the root tip up to 80 cm and K(h) became constant and maximal after 40 cm, favouring water uptake from the distal (younger) portions. For roots of the dicotyledonous F. acanthodes, L(R) increased slightly and K(h) increased greatly away from the root tip, favouring water uptake from the proximal (older) portions. 3. As simulated rainfalls were increased from 10 to 30 to 50 mm, the duration and the depth at which PSI(soil) was above the shoot water potential of -0.5 MPa increased. Horizontal roots of A. deserti 60 cm in length took up more water than those oriented more vertically. although differences became less as the rainfall amount increased. 4. Compared with A. deserti, roots of F. acanthodes had maximal simulated water uptake at steeper orientations, reflecting the different variations of L(R) and K(h) along the root. Also, water uptake at essentially all orientations was highest for the shortest (20 cm long) and hence youngest root of A. deserti and the longest (80 cm long) and hence oldest root of F. acanthodes. 5. The root-segment model, which took into account temperature effects on L(R) and K(h) as well as variations in PSI(soil) along a root, can be used to predict water uptake for root systems under realistic conditions in the field.",,"NOBEL, PS (reprint author), UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024, USA.",,,,,,,0,10,10,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The boundaries of the vegetated stripes are, upslope, a colonization ecotone, and, downslope, a regressive ecotone, thus inducing a slow upwards displacement. This formation, recently described in the Chihuahuan Desert (Mexico), is known from Africa and Australia. Flourensia cernua is a dominant shrub species of the stripes whose distribution suggests that its population dynamics is strongly dependent on the upslope ecotone. The spatial restrictions to recruitment were determined analyzing the location of seedlings, young individuals and adults, and the grass cover (Hilaria mutica), in 10 two-meter-wide belts perpendicular to 5 stripes. The seed spatial distribution was studied in 3 other stripes. The survival of seedlings during the winter and spring dry season was observed in naturally open, experimentally clipped and grass-covered plots, as well as under Flourensia cernua adults. We compared the root depths, root/shoot ratios, leaf weight per unit area, and predawn water potentials of shaded and sun-grown seedlings. Seeds and seedlings were present throughout the stripes, but they only survived in the upslope ecotones. Vegetation cover, whether grass or shrub, and its corresponding light interception, was associated to the total mortality of seedlings grown under cover. These seedlings were shallowly rooted, had a low leaf weight per unit area, and low water potentials. Two main patterns were observed in the relative distribution of the grass and the shrub cover, some stripes starting with a dense shrub cover, others with a 5 to 10 m wide grass belt. We suggest that these patterns are related to different recruitment histories and that at a landscape scale, Flourensia cernua populations can only persist in vegetation stripes through metapopulational dynamics (characterized by successive local extinctions and colonizations).","INST ECOL,XALAPA 91000,VERACRUZ,MEXICO","MAUCHAMP, A (reprint author), CNRS,CTR ECOL FONCTIONNELLE & EVOLUT,BP 5051,F-34000 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE.",,"Rambal, Serge/H-5705-2019","rambal, serge/0000-0001-5869-8382",,,,54,37,39,1,17,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1993,68,1,,,,,107,116,,10.2307/3545315,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MB138,WOS:A1993MB13800013,,,,,10/31/19J,"JASPER, DA; DAVY, JA",,,,"JASPER, DA; DAVY, JA",,,ROOT CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE PLANT-SPECIES IN RELATION TO THE BENEFIT OF MYCORRHIZAL COLONIZATION FOR PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,BENEFIT; MYCORRHIZAS; PHOSPHORUS; REVEGETATION; ROOT CHARACTERISTICS,FUNGI; INFECTIVITY,"We aimed to relate the root characteristics of native plants, with their benefit from mycorrhizal colonization, to assist in developing criteria for predicting plant response to mycorrhizal fungi in revegetated soils.

Plant dry weight and that of all plant parts declined in response to shade, as did root/shoot ratio. Plant leaf area was less in unshaded plants than in plants grown in shade, and specific leaf area increased with shade. Unshaded seedlings had a higher light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, a higher light compensation point and a higher light saturation point than seedlings grown in 70% shade. The relationship between plant dry weight and leaf dry weight was independent of shading, whereas the relationship between plant dry weight and plant leaf area was dependent on shading. Therefore, leaf dry weight may be a better predictor of biomass production than leaf area in forest stands where shade is likely to affect growth significantly. Soil temperature had a significant effect on the growth of all plant parts except cotyledons. Total plant growth and shoot growth were maximal at a soil temperature of 30-degrees-C, but root growth had a slightly lower temperature optimum such that the root/shoot ratio was highest at 20-degrees-C. Roots grown at 15-degrees-C were about 30% shorter per unit of dry weight than roots grown at 20 to 35-degrees-C.

The effect of initial seedling height on subsequent survival was examined in both the field and greenhouse by grouping seedlings into live and dead categories on each census dale and comparing the initial heights for seedlings in these categories. For a majority of the census dates, the initial height of surviving seedlings was greater than the initial height of those that subsequently died (significant differences ranged from 1 to S mm), indicating that seedlings that were taller at the initiation of the drought period had a higher probability of survival. In the greenhouse, taller seedlings had greater shoot and root biomass and rooting depth. Seedlings that are larger (i.e., taller and have greater aboveground biomass) in late spring appear to have a higher probability of surviving the summer drought due to greater rooting depth and hence increased access to moisture in deeper soil layers. Seed availability and safe sites for germination were probably not limiting since large numbers of seedlings successfully germinated in a patchy pattern during the study period.

The ratio of rooting depth in unwatered soil to watered soil was calculated to quantify plasticity in rooting depth. The objectives were to determine whether all species show equal plasticity in rooting depth and to measure the extent to which plasticity in seedling rooting depth influences the ability of seedlings to sustain growth in drying soil. 2 Seedlings were allowed to initiate growth in continuously moist sand during a 21-day pretreatment. Two watering treatments (unwatered vs. watered daily) were then applied for an additional 21 days. 3 Rooting depth was not equally plastic for all species. Rooting depth was significantly greater in unwatered soil than in watered soil for seven species. In contrast, five other species showed a significant decrease in rooting depth in unwatered soil. The remaining 30 species showed no significant effect of soil moisture treatment on rooting depth. 4 Species that showed the greatest plasticity in rooting depth also showed the greatest ability to sustain shoot growth in unwatered soil (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.75, P < 0.0001). These results indicate that plasticity in rooting depth contributes to the ability of seedlings to sustain growth in drying soil. 5 Results of this study also suggest that selective pressures promoting plasticity in seedling rooting depth have been greater in species regenerating primarily from seeds than in species regenerating both vegetatively and from seeds.","UNIV SHEFFIELD,DEPT ANIM & PLANT SCI,NERC,COMPARAT PLANT ECOL UNIT,SHEFFIELD S10 2TN,S YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND","READER, RJ (reprint author), UNIV GUELPH,DEPT BOT,GUELPH N1G 2W1,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,31,54,64,2,36,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Results showed that iron can he extracted from the complexes according to the concentrations and pH of the extractants. The mixture of organic acids was generally a better extractant than the siderophore at the high concentration because of lower solution pH.

Despite the extremes of canopy structure, the two vegetation types have similar maximum hourly evaporation rates (E(max)) and maximum surface conductances (g(smax)) (medians = 0.46 mm h-1 and 22 mm s-1). However, on a daily basis, median E(max) of coniferous forest (4.0 mm d-1) is significantly lower than that of grassland (4.6 mm d-1). Additionally, a representative value Of ga for coniferous forest (200 mm s-1) is an order of magnitude more than the corresponding value for grassland (25 mm s-1). The proportional sensitivity of E, calculated by the Penman-Monteith equation, to changes in g(s) is > 0.7 for coniferous forest, but as low as 0.3 for grassland. The proportional sensitivity of E to changes in g(a) is generally +/- 0. 1 5 or less. Boundary-line relationships between g(s) and light and air saturation deficit (D) vary considerably. Attainment of g(smax) occurs at a much lower irradiance for coniferous forest than for grassland (15 versus about 45% of full sunlight). Relationships between g(s) and D measured above the canopy appear to be fairly uniform for coniferous forest, but are variable for grassland. More uniform relationships may be found for surfaces with relatively small g(a), like grassland, by using D at the evaporating surface (D0) as the independent variable rather than D at a reference point above the surface. An analytical expression is given for determining D0 from measurable quantities. Evaporation rate also depends on the availability of water in the root zone. Below a critical value of soil water storage, the ratio of evaporation rate to the available energy tends to decrease sharply and linearly with decreasing soil water content. At the lowest value of soil water content, this ratio declines by up to a factor of 4 from the non-soil-water-limiting plateau. Knowledge about functional rooting depth of different plant species remains rather limited. Ignorance of this important variable makes it generally difficult to obtain accurate estimates of seasonal evaporation from terrestrial ecosystems.","MANAAKI WHENUA LANDCARE RES,CHRISTCHURCH,NEW ZEALAND; CSIRO,CTR ENVIRONM MECH,CANBERRA,ACT 2601,AUSTRALIA","KELLIHER, FM (reprint author), UNIV BAYREUTH,LEHRSTUHL PFLANZENOKOL,POB 101251,D-95440 BAYREUTH,GERMANY.",,"Leuning, Ray/A-2793-2008; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014",,,,,78,262,277,0,70,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1993,95,2,,,,,153,163,,10.1007/BF00323485,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LV564,WOS:A1993LV56400001,28312937,,,,10/31/19J,"GANGE, AC",,,,"GANGE, AC",,,TRANSLOCATION OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI BY EARTHWORMS DURING EARLY SUCCESSION,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOIL; POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE; PROPAGULES; VECTORS,"The distribution of propagules of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi by earthworms was investigated in a number of natural plant communities, differing in successional age. Propagule numbers were quantified using direct spore counts and the Most Probable Number (MPN) dilution method. Propagule number was low in early successional sites and was progressively higher in sites of 3 yr and over. Results of spore counts and MPN analysis showed similar patterns. In all sites, earthworm cast material contained higher numbers of spores and infective propagules than nearby field soil. These differences were significant in sites of 5 yr and over. There was a positive relationship between MPN of propagules and spore counts in cast material, but spore counts underestimated total propagule numbers. It is suggested that, due to feeding on senescing roots, earthworms concentrate mycorrhizal propagules in their cast soil. Due to the fact that surface worm casts were more abundant in early succession, the deposition of propagules was comparable to that in older communities. Earthworms may therefore be important agents in the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi, and thereby influence plant establishment in early succession.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI & TECHNOL,ASCOT SL5 7PY,BERKS,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,27,77,82,0,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Annual soil respiration at control plots, measured by the soda-lime technique, was 371 g C - m-2. year-1. We used aboveground litter inputs (1 38 g C - m-2. year-1) and differences in carbon dioxide effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to total soil respiration by live root respiration (33%) and by organic matter derived from aboveground (37%) and belowground (30%) litter. Newly deposited aboveground litter contributed 31% of the carbon dioxide emitted by total aboveground litter. This estimate is consistent with values published in litter decomposition studies. Nearly two thirds of soil respiration in this forest can be attributed to root activity, comparable with a previous study suggesting that live root respiration plus decomposition of root litter contributes 70-80% of total soil respiration across a wide range of forests.","MARINE BIOL LAB,CTR ECOSYSTEMS,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543; HARVARD UNIV,HARVARD FOREST,PETERSHAM,MA 01366","BOWDEN, RD (reprint author), ALLEGHENY COLL,DEPT ENVIRONM SCI,MEADVILLE,PA 16335, USA.",,,,,,,31,301,382,1,76,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Inoculation with both kinds of native roots and with the tropical G. mosseae isolate increased the shoot dry weight of A. sieberiana significantly, by 48, 33 and 36%, respectively, compared with seedlings in the standard soil. Inoculation with native forest roots and the tropical G. mosseae increased the shoot dry weight of A. abyssinica by 23 and 38%. The temperate isolate of G. mosseae did not improve the growth of either acacia species significantly. Growth stimulation was accompanied by a significantly higher mycorrhizal colonization in all cases except one, whereas shoot phosphorus and magnesium uptakes were generally not significantly affected. The survival of the A. abyssinica seedlings 6 months after their transfer from the nursery to the field was enhanced by all inoculations, although significantly so only with the tropical VAM isolate. The root dry weight after 18 months in the field was also improved in this treatment. The results demonstrate that application of a simple inoculum consisting of chopped roots of native plants with naturally occurring VAM fungi can be equally effective in enhancing seedling growth in tree nurseries in the tropical region as the more elaborate use of pure cultures of VAM fungi, both when seedlings are amply watered and when they are drought-stressed.",,"MICHELSEN, A (reprint author), UNIV COPENHAGEN, DEPT PLANT ECOL, OSTER FARIMAGSGADE 2-D, DK-1353 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.",,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658",,,,29,12,15,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

In a series of greenhouse experiments we studied (1) if sericea root exudates affect seed germination and seedling growth of the perennial grasses tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.], and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge); and (2) if any such responses were cultivar dependent. The effects of the root exudates were measured in 2 experiments. In the first one, coarse perlite was used as a medium to measure seed germination and radicle and coleoptile growth. In the second experiment, soil was used as a medium to measure emergence and biomass. Root exudates from sericea lespedeza had no effect on germination and emergence of tall fescue and bahiagrass but reduced their radicle and coleoptile length and biomass. Germination, radicle, and coleoptile length, and emergence of bermudagrass decreased when exposed to the root exudates; however, biomass was not affected. Cultivars of the grass species differed in their response to the root exudates of sericea lespedeza. Thus, establishment of tall fescue in mixture with sericea lespedeza is not likely to be affected; however, its growth is likely to be decreased. Therefore, tall fescue contribution to total yield will be reduced. Conversely, establishment of bermudagrass is likely to be affected, but once established, its growth is expected to be similar to its grown alone.","AUBURN UNIV,DEPT AGRON & SOILS,AUBURN,AL 36849; AUBURN UNIV,ALABAMA AGR EXPT STN,AUBURN,AL 36849","KALBURTJI, KL (reprint author), ARISTOTELIAN UNIV SALONIKA,FAC AGR,ECOL LAB,GR-54006 SALONIKA,GREECE.",,,,,,,13,6,7,1,10,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

As soil water deficit developed, root length density decreased, indicating that water deficit reduced root proliferation. Root/shoot ratio remained unchanged (p>0.05) as soil water potential decreased from -0.023 MPa to -2 MPa; but it became higher (p<0.05) in extremely stressed plants (-3.4 MPa), indicating that root growth was favored over shoot growth. Root length density was more closely correlated with green tissue dry weight/-stem dry weight ratio (r = 0.82, p<0.0001) than with root/shoot ratio (r = 0.52, p<0.05). This suggests that (1) expansion of photosynthetic area was more sensitive than stem growth to water deficit and (2) carbon allocation within the shoot was more sensitive to water deficit than allocation between root and shoot. Plants died when gravimetric soil water decreased to around 0.03 g g-1 (equivalent to a soil water potential of -7.5 MPa). The leaf relative water content just before death was about 0.50. Soil water content in the top 20 or 30 cm of the profile is the single most important factor determining mortality of the snakeweed plant and can be used in making decisions in snakeweed control programs.","USDA ARS,CROPPING SYST RES LAB,LUBBOCK,TX","WAN, CG (reprint author), TEXAS TECH UNIV,DEPT RANGE & WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,LUBBOCK,TX 79409, USA.",,,,,,,15,10,11,0,9,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

A plot of five trees was subjected to imposed water shortage, while a group of irrigated trees was used as a control. Measurements of xylem sap flows and water potential enabled the computation of plot transpiration, canopy conductance, and specific hydraulic conductance in the soil-tree continuum. Stomatal conductance was measured directly with a porometer. Specific hydraulic conductance of our oaks was of the same order of magnitude as that reported for other species. It decreased significantly during spring because of a time lag between cambial growth and leaf area expansion. Measured transpiration was close to potential evapotranspiration, except during days with high vapor pressure deficits, which promoted stomatal closure in the absence of soil water deficits. Imposed drought caused predawn leaf water potentials to reach values as low as -2.0 MPa and a progressive decline in hydraulic conductance, which was probably attributable to modifications in hydraulic properties at the soil-root interface. This gradual decline in conductance was attributed to their deep rooting (1.40 m). This study revealed that Q. petraea may be considered as drought tolerant because of adaptations like deep rooting, efficient and safe xylem sap transport, maintenance of significant stomatal conductance, and significant transpiration, even during strong drought stress.","INRA,BIOCLIMATOL & ECOPHYSIOL LAB,CHAMPENOUX,F-54280 SEICHAMPS,FRANCE",,,"Cochard, Herve/P-7406-2015; Cochard, Herve/Y-8349-2019","Cochard, Herve/0000-0002-2727-7072; Cochard, Herve/0000-0002-2727-7072",,,,36,152,157,0,31,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

These differences were used as the basis of interpreting allocation of energy in different components of plants that helped them colonize specific micro-habitats along the bank profiles of the floodway. Thus, Deschampsia flexuosa, the dominant plant on the bank slope, allocates about 90% of its biomass in its shallow but dense root systems (compared to its shoots), which provides protection to the bank slope from surface runoff. Alnus rugosa and Salix bebbiana, dominant on erosional scarps, allocate about equal amounts of biomass in their above-ground and below-ground components, but have long tap roots, which help them colonize the steep scarp face. Plants on the bench and under-water shelf, such as Juncus nodosus and Saggitaria latifolia, allocate disproportionately large amounts of biomass to their above-ground components, which are exposed to the dynamic forces of waves and currents. Overall, the study indicates that root-shoot architecture and biomass can be used as biotechnical criteria in selecting riparian plants for bank stabilization of flood control channels.","LAKEHEAD UNIV,DEPT BIOL,THUNDER BAY P7B 5E1,ONTARIO,CANADA; LAKEHEAD UNIV,DEPT GEOG,THUNDER BAY P7B 5E1,ONTARIO,CANADA",,,,,,,,5,14,14,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

A root-shoot model of partitioning during vegetative plant growth is described, which simulates the transport of water, labile nitrogen (N) and labile carbon (C) through the xylem and phloem, and in which C, N and water interact to determine growth. 2. It is assumed that a fraction (lambda) of the N taken up by the root passes upwards in the xylem to the shoot where it is transferred to the phloem. The remaining fraction (1 - lambda) is transferred directly to the root phloem. Phloem translocation of labile C and N downwards from the shoot to the root is driven by a shoot-root gradient of labile C concentration, in accordance with the Munch flow hypothesis. 3. Shoot and root growth rates are assumed to be functions of local water potentials and of the local concentrations of labile C and N. 4. It is shown that, when the fraction of N that passes in the xylem to the shoot (lambda) is less than or equal to the fraction of plant biomass contained in shoot, the Munch flow mechanism of phloem translocation ensures that there is a higher labile N concentration in the root than in the shoot, opposite to the concentration gradient of labile C. This behaviour, in conjunction with the high to low root-shoot gradient of water potential, means that the model's root-shoot partitioning responses to changes in the availability of C, N and water are consistent with observations. 5. In particular, root-shoot responses to changes in C and N supply are more directly related to the existence of counter-gradients of C and N substrate concentration, than to the actual pathways of solute transport through the xylem and phloem that are involved. A more general analysis shows that, in balanced exponential growth, the establishment of counter-gradients of C and N depends only on the net transport of substrates between the shoot and root. 6. The model provides a mechanistic basis for interpreting observed root-shoot responses to deficits of other minerals such as phosphorus and magnesium.",,"DEWAR, RC (reprint author), INST TERR ECOL,EDINBURGH RES STN,BUSH ESTATE,PENICUIK EH26 0QB,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND.",,"Dewar, Roderick/C-9304-2009",,,,,0,93,112,0,22,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The study of mycorrhizal function under field conditions would be greatly aided by a method for controlling infection in roots. The only feasible method at present is the use of fungicides. We have applied three functionally distinct fungicides (benomyl, procloraz and iprodione) to plants of the winter annual grass Vulpia ciliata ssp. ambigua growing both in the field and in a glasshouse. 2. We measured the impact of the fungicides on mycorrhizal colonization, plant performance and on populations of other fungi both in the rhizosphere and the bulk soil. All biocides were effective in some circumstances in reducing mycorrhizal colonization of the roots, but benomyl was the most effective, followed by iprodione and procloraz. Only benomyl controlled infection in both field and glasshouse experiments. 3. There was no evidence for any direct physiological effects of any of the biocides on plant performance, and despite the fact that some biocides effectively controlled mycorrhizal infection, they had little effect on plant performance. 4. Biocide application also affected other soil and root fungi: again benomyl was the most effective of the three. Benomyl reduced the abundance of both the most common soil fungus (an unidentified Penicillium) and the important root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. 5. These results demonstrate that fungicides, especially benomyl, can be used to control the colonization of roots by mycorrhizal fungi, but that it is essential that the changes in the abundance of other fungi are also taken into account.","UNIV YORK,DEPT BIOL,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND; UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND",,,"Watkinson, Andrew/N-1649-2013",,,,,18,44,44,1,9,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We have conducted a series of factorial experiments involving the application of the fungicide benomyl to reduce mycorrhizal infection. and of phosphate, to ascertain whether mycorrhizal fungi contribute to fitness in the winter annual grass Vulpia ciliata ssp. ambigua and whether any such contribution can be ascribed to increased P uptake. 2. Experiments were set up at four sites in East Anglia (UK) where the grass grows with large differences in the natural intensity of mycorrhizal infection. At one site, the factorial experiment was nested within an irrigation treatment. In addition, we performed experiments to test the yield response of V. ciliata to added P. 3. Plant response to P was slight: a small stimulus at very low addition rates and a depression at high rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal infection was well controlled by benomyl addition, but fecundity in this annual grass was scarcely affected either by P or benomyl application. Only at one of the four sites did benomyl application alter fecundity: it increased both number of seeds per plant and mean seed mass. 4. Percentage infection was a positive covariate of plant performance at two sites, unrelated at one, and a negative covariate at one, suggesting that infection can be beneficial, neutral or deleterious depending on conditions. 5. It seems unlikely that any benefits derived from increased P uptake: across all sites and treatments, P inflow was unrelated to infection, and in control plots the relationship was negative, the most infected plants having the lowest inflows. Benefit may have been protection from pathogens: at one site where Fusarium oxysporum had previously been shown to be abundant, no effect of benomyl could be detected, as would be expected if both the mycorrhizal and the pathogenic fungus were eliminated. 6. These data show that benefits of arbuscular mycorrhizal infection may be dependent on local conditions and may be due to other effects than increased P uptake.","UNIV E ANGLIA,DEPT BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND; UNIV YORK,DEPT BIOL,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND",,,"Watkinson, Andrew/N-1649-2013",,,,,24,32,34,1,7,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In general, isolates which developed more extensive mycorrhizas on roots produced the largest growth responses to inoculation. Isolates which increased plant growth also increased phosphorus uptake by the plant. Seedlings inoculated with L. laccata and S. verrucosum retained more phosphorus in their roots than plants inoculated with the other fungal isolates.","CSIRO,ZENTRUM FORESTRY,PRIVATE BAG PO WEMBLEY,WEMBLY,WA 6014,AUSTRALIA",,,"Burgess, Treena I/G-4770-2011","Burgess, Treena I/0000-0002-7962-219X",,,,20,65,69,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1993,153,2,,,,,155,164,,10.1007/BF00012988,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,MF437,WOS:A1993MF43700001,,Green Published,,,10/31/19J,"CAMPRUBI, A; PINOCHET, J; CALVET, C; ESTAUN, V",,,,"CAMPRUBI, A; PINOCHET, J; CALVET, C; ESTAUN, V",,,EFFECTS OF THE ROOT-LESION NEMATODE PRATYLENCHUS-VULNUS AND THE VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS GLOMUS-MOSSEAE ON THE GROWTH OF 3 PLUM ROOTSTOCKS,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; ROOT-LESION NEMATODE; MYCORRHIZAE; PLUM; PRATYLENCHUS-VULNUS; PRUNUS SPP; ROOTSTOCKS,HOST SUITABILITY,"The effects of Pratylenchus vulnus and the endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae on growth of Myrobalan 605, Marianna 2624 and San Julian 655-2 plum rootstocks were measured under shadehouse conditions in the field for two growing seasons (1990-91).

The size of rhizosphere populations was significantly correlated with the number of nodules that formed subsequently. More cells (1.55-fold) of B. japonicum attached to the roots of supernodulating mutant nts382 than to the roots of Bragg. However, the extent of the difference was much less than the increase in nodule number for nts382 relative to Bragg which was between 2.40- and 10.10-fold. Thus, the supernodulating character cannot be accounted for by superior attachment of rhizobia to root surfaces. Differences in rhizosphere colonization of, and rhizobial attachment to, the roots between non-nodulation mutants and the parent Bragg were relatively small; this suggested that the genes coding for non-nodulation do not interfere with these early events normally leading to nodulation. Nodule mass for nts382 constituted 7. 1 % of whole plant dry matter compared with 2.5 % for Bragg (P < 0.00 1).

Levels of genetic variation in both taxa are somewhat higher than the mean for long-lived, woody perennials. There was no indication that the alleles of one species represent a subset of the variation present in the other nor was there any indication of tetrasomic expression in G. sempervirens. Moreover, chromosome counts from root tip squashes confirm that both species are diploid, with 2n = 16. There is, however, unusual mitotic behavior that may explain apparently erroneous counts of lower numbers by some previous workers, who also reported larger and fewer stomates in the presumably autotetraploid G. sempervirens. Sharp genetic differences between the two species (mean genetic identity, IBAR = 0.48) parallel their morphological discontinuities in many characters, and there was no evidence of hybridization or introgression in regions of sympatry. A cladistic analysis using eight morphological characters supports the view that G. sempervirens and C. rankinii are sister species, more closely related to each other than either is to the third species in the genus, G. elegans from southeast Asia. Genetic evidence suggests that the lineage leading to G. rankinii and G. sempervirens split in the late Tertiary, about 3-3.5 million years ago.

During irrigation, the xylem sap flow rate, Q(wt), was measured by the stem-tissue heat balance method with internal heating and sensing. Only a gradual and slight increase in Q(wt) in response to irrigation was observed in the control trees, whereas Q(wt) in the declining trees, whose transpiration rates were only 2-20% those of the control trees, increased 2-5 times within minutes. This suggests, that severe local drought was the major factor limiting tree growth at the site. The extent of the response permits estimation of the supply-limited (soil water) and demand-limited (tree structure) components of stress. Drought caused a decline in Q(wt) in the trees with short crowns and limited root systems that had originally been growing in dense canopies and had become suddenly exposed to full illumination as a result of a severe wind storm and thinning. Trees with deep, narrow, dense crowns, growing in more open places and adapted over a long period to high irradiance remained healthy during drought. Prolonged, periodic water shortage reduced the amount of foliage up to 90% but during drought stimulated the growth of fine roots in the surface and upper soil layers.

Bias associated with minirhizotron and rhizotron observations, and methods that will help realize the potential of these observational platforms are reviewed. Root density estimates in minirhizotrons are prone to bias due to soil compaction, and poor contact between tube and soil. Density estimates of microarthropods observed in minirhizotrons, are less biased by longer observation periods, low light levels, and good optical resolution. Microarthropods observed in a rhizotron were underrepresented compared with soil cores if they belonged to groups that move little, are transparent, or small. Time-lapse video can be used to sample microarthropod density in rhizotrons. Better visualization of all of the biota can be achieved by using long working length microscope objectives, and stains such as fluorescein diacetate, ethidium bromide and the tetrazolium dye, p-Iodonitrotetrazolium Violet.

The deterioration of the fine roots was assessed by comparing electrolyte leakage values before and after storage. As the lifting date progressed from October to mid-December all three species became less adversely affected by storage, indicating that roots undergo physiological changes that increase their tolerance to prolonged cold storage. The interaction between lifting date and storage duration on fine-root quality differed in the three species. For example, Picea sitchensis could tolerate 90 days' storage commencing at any time from mid-December till early April with negligible root damage. Pseudotsuga menziesii could not tolerate 90 days' storage at any time of year, and tolerance to 30 days' storage was limited and could be substantially reversed.

The root systems of a warm-season grass, Andropogon gerardii, and two perennial forbs, Coreopsis tripteris and Solidago altissima, were sampled by excavating soil blocks representing all pairwise inter- and intra-specific combinations of these species. With forb neighbors, Andropogon had higher percentages of its fibrous roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi than with conspecific neighbors. Andropogon root morphology (as measured by average root radius, specific root length, and root branching) did not vary with neighbor growth form; however, Andropogon roots did become finer as restoration age and root densities increased. For Coreopsis and Solidago, colonization of fibrous roots did not vary with neighbor species, but both forbs had coarser roots with interspecific neighbors than with conspecifics. With interspecific neighbors, Coreopsis almost doubled the number of branches per centimetre of root observed in conspecific pairs. Although some of the variations in colonization and root morphology may be attributable specifically to neighbor root mass, others were related to the overall root mass of the target-neighbor pair. The observed variations in mycorrhizal colonization may be related to increased opportunities for colonization by the fungus that are due not only to higher root densities but also to some sort of interaction between the root systems of Andropogon and the forbs.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,CHICAGO,IL 60680","JASTROW, JD (reprint author), ARGONNE NATL LAB,DIV ENVIRONM RES,ARGONNE,IL 60439, USA.",,,,,,,44,25,32,1,22,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,1993,74,2,,,,,561,569,,10.2307/1939316,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KN556,WOS:A1993KN55600025,,,,,10/31/19J,"MURIITHI, WT; HARRY, IS; YEUNG, EC; THORPE, TA",,,,"MURIITHI, WT; HARRY, IS; YEUNG, EC; THORPE, TA",,,PLANTLET REGENERATION IN CHIR PINE (PINUS-ROXBURHII SARG) - MORPHOGENESIS AND HISTOLOGY,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FIR PSEUDOTSUGA-MENZIESII; EMBRYONIC EXPLANTS; INVITRO; INDUCTION; TISSUE; CONTORTA; RADIATA; TREES,"In the first of this two part study, various factors affecting morphogenesis including media, age of explant, phytohormones and environmental factors were tested. Half-strength Bornman's medium (MCM) was superior to all the other media tested.

Half-strength Schenk and Hildebrandt medium produced the highest shoot elongation index and was used from the sixth week to about the fifteenth week of culture. Shoots excised after this time elongated faster on half-strength MCM solidified with Gelrite(R). On average, four axillary shoots were obtained by decapitation of a 28-week-old adventitious shoot. Eighty-one percent rooting was obtained by incubating 28-week-old shoots in MCM containing 0.5 muM naphthalene acetic acid for 4 weeks. In the second part of the study, the anatomy of bud formation and the histology of the root-shoot junction were examined, The anatomical events culminating in shoot formation in 30 days included anticlinal and periclinal mitotic figures, meristemoid formation, meristematic domes and juvenile leaf primordia.

After one growing season, Libocedrus seedlings formed nearly 4 times the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae in ET treatments and more than twice as much in PET treatments than in controls. Survival and basal area growth were significantly better in ET than in the other treatments, and both ET and PET produced more seedling shoot growth than did controls.

Both experiments were in the same field, but one was on an old arable soil and the other on an ex-woodland soil. The following treatments were applied to both experiments: inorganic fertilizer at 180 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (control soils); uncontaminated sludge at 100 m3 ha-1 yr-1 or 300 m3 ha-1 yr-1; or metal-contaminated sludge at the same two rates. In the ex-woodland experimental soil, rhizobial numbers decreased by an order of magnitude in plots treated with 100 m3 yr-1 contaminated sludge compared to the control plots and plots receiving the same amount of uncontaminated sludge. The total Zn and Cd concentrations in these plots were close to the German limits, but were well below the U.K. and E.C. upper limits. Even with 300 m3 yr-1 uncontaminated sludge rhizobial numbers decreased by several orders of magnitude compared to the control soils, in both field experiments: at both sites one of the four replicate plots had no rhizobia, whereas the other three plots had decreased numbers. Metal concentrations in these plots were well below the U.K. and E.C. upper limits, except Zn which was close to the German limit, and ranged from (mg kg-1): Zn, 200-250; Cu, 46-62; Ni, 16-23 and Cd, 0.9-1.6. In plots receiving 300 m3 yr-1 contaminated sludge, in both field experiments, rhizobial numbers were further decreased compared to plots receiving uncontaminated sludge at the same rate and were several orders of magnitude smaller than in the control plots. For example, in the old arable site, three out of four plots had no rhizobia, with one plot containing 20 cell g-1 soil. In the ex-woodland site, two plots out of four had no rhizobia, whereas, the other two had < 4 and 9 cells g-1 soil. Metal concentrations in these plots were above the U.K. and E.C. upper limits for Zn, but were still below the corresponding limits for Cd. Copper concentrations in one old arable plot and three ex-woodland plots were slightly above the U.K. limits for soils of pH 5-6. The German limits for Zn, Cu, and Cd, but not Ni, were considerably exceeded in these plots. The major factor influencing rhizobial numbers, in both field experiments, was not the soil pH, nor the organic carbon content, but rather the metal concentrations in the soil. The smaller N contents, chlorosis and stunting of clover plants grown in soils from plots containing no, or very few, rhizobia was not due to phytotoxicity, but was shown by the addition of nitrogen fertilizer to be due to lack of N2-fixation. Our results indicate that although several metals were accumulated simultaneously in both field experiments there was a strong Zn effect on the numbers of rhizobia in these soils. Significant reductions in rhizobial numbers occurred even at metal concentrations well below the current U.K. and E.C. upper limits for all metals, but close to the much more strict German limits for Zn and Cd. These results are discussed in relation to the setting of safe limits for the long-term protection of soils.","AFRC,INST ARABLE CROPS RES,DEPT SOIL SCI,ROTHAMSTED EXPTL STN,HARPENDEN AL5 2JQ,HERTS,ENGLAND; UNIV LONDON WYE COLL,DEPT BIOCHEM & BIOL SCI,ASHFORD TN25 5AH,KENT,ENGLAND; FED RES CTR AGR BRAUNSCHWEIG VOLKENRODE FAL,INST PLANT NUTR & SOIL SCI,W-3300 BRAUNSCHWEIG,GERMANY",,,"Giller, Ken E/K-2799-2012; McGrath, Steve P/B-5127-2008","Giller, Ken E/0000-0002-5998-4652; McGrath, Steve P/0000-0003-0952-8947",,,,30,138,141,0,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Laboratory and outside in situ results were compared to decomposition rates for seedling roots that were washed, air-dried, and reburied outside in mesh bags. Laboratory decomposition rates of the seedling root system, which contained fine laterals and a small taproot, averaged 31% and 44% weight loss annually, while annual rates of only the fine lateral root component averaged 57% and 66% loss of total weight at 15-degrees and 25-degrees, respectively. Average annual Q-10s of 1.4 and 1.2 were calculated between 15-degrees and 25-degrees for whole root systems and lateral roots alone.

The model was validated against data on the root systems that were allowed to decompose in situ outside. Decomposition of this material after 1 yr was 43% complete for the whole root system and 60% complete for laterals. The observed remaining weight at various time intervals was accurately predicted from the regression model. After 1 yr, roots in the buried bags displayed a weight loss similar to the outdoor in situ samples.

The diversity of strains within the field population could first be detected with IS-fingerprinting, whereby nearly three times more groups of Rhizobium meliloti strains could be identified in comparison to the groups according to plasmid profiles. This complexity and diversity of the rhizobial population was also detected in microcosm studies. Strains identified among the field population were also detected in the microcosm studies. The persistence of rhizobia in soil was demonstrated in soil core samples held in a cold room for 2 years. A decrease in the genomic diversity of the R. meliloti population upon soil storage was observed. A novel monitoring method, IS-handprinting, in which the presence of certain endogenous insertion elements within a strain is registered, was successfully employed to characterize genetically the field R. meliloti strains with simplicity and speed. In contrast to IS-fingerprinting, IS-handprinting is based on a simple plus-or-minus detection, which is sufficient for a taxonomic characterization. Both methods, using a non-radioactive detection system, are sensitive enough to detect one copy of an insertion element in a strain's genome. IS-fingerprinting, with its fine resolution, would be suitable for ecological studies of individual strains in any complex ecosystem, whereas IS-handprinting would be suitable for monitoring strains and characterizing large numbers of strains.",,"KOSIER, B (reprint author), UNIV BIELEFELD,LEHRSTUHL GENET,W-4800 BIELEFELD,GERMANY.",,,"Puhler, Alfred/0000-0003-4723-2960",,,,51,35,36,0,0,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Don) and Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. mannifera (Mudie) seedlings in culture solutions in a glasshouse to help explain the failure of radiata pine trees on some acid, low fertility soils in Australia on which the native eucalypts flourish. Aluminium (Al) in culture solution increased the growth of roots and shoots of seedlings of both species but while growth of the eucalypt continued to increase with increases in Al to 2,222 muM, growth of the pine was largest at 370 muM Al. In addition to total root length, specific root length (length per unit dry weight), a measure of fineness of the root, increased in the eucalypt seedlings as the substrate Al increased. Growth of the shoots and roots of the pine in the absence of any added Al was extremely poor suggesting that Al, in low concentrations, may be an essential element or ameliorate some other factors in solution culture at low pH. Root and shoot concentrations of K increased with increasing Al, whilst Ca and Mg concentrations decreased and Mn concentrations were unaffected in both species. Tissue Ca and Mg concentrations were 2 to 3 times higher in the eucalypt seedlings than the pine at all levels of added Al due to greater uptake of these elements by the eucalypt. In contrast, at the highest concentration of Al in the medium, shoot Al concentrations were lower in the eucalypt than in the pine due to a greater proportion of Al being retained in the eucalypt roots. These differences between the seedlings in terms of root growth and tissue cation concentrations may help explain the ability of eucalypt species to maintain vigorous growth on acid soils high in Al and low in Ca and P, where growth of the pines failed.","AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV,DEPT FORESTRY,CANBERRA,ACT 2601,AUSTRALIA","HUANG, JH (reprint author), SOIL CONSERVAT SERV NEW S WALES,POB 100,BEECROFT,NSW 2119,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,34,33,37,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1993,149,1,,,,,121,127,,10.1007/BF00010769,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,KX992,WOS:A1993KX99200011,,,,,10/31/19J,"GILLER, KE; NUSSBAUM, R; CHAUDRI, AM; MCGRATH, SP",,,,"GILLER, KE; NUSSBAUM, R; CHAUDRI, AM; MCGRATH, SP",,,RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI IS LESS SENSITIVE TO HEAVY-METAL CONTAMINATION IN SOIL THAN RHIZOBIUM-LEGUMINOSARUM BV TRIFOLII OR R-LOTI,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SEWAGE-SLUDGE; NITROGEN-FIXATION; CLOVER,"A gradient of soils with increasing metal contamination was constructed by mixing uncontaminated farmyard manure-treated (FYM) and contaminated, sewage sludge-treated (S) soils from the Woburn Experimental Farm, and separate samples of these soils were inoculated with strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, R. meliloti and R. loti.

Naturally-regenerated saplings of both species were significantly taller than planted trees, had greater leader growth in the previous year and height/diameter ratios, and smaller tap-root diameters 10 cm below groundline. Naturally-regenerated saplings also had up to 2.3-fold the number of lateral roots compared with planted saplings. Seventy to 79% of all primary lateral roots of naturally-regenerated saplings occurred within the top 10 cm of the soil surface, compared with 30-42% for the planted trees. The depth of the first structural lateral root associated with naturally-regenerated saplings was also significantly less than that of planted saplings. The shape of the container in which seedlings were raised in the nursery was clearly evident when root system architecture of planted saplings was examined. Many container-initiated seedling root systems exhibited conical shaping with little lateral root egress. A variety of root deformities which included constriction, coiling and kinkiness were detected in planted, but not naturally-regenerated saplings. These results are discussed in relation to potential difficulties arising from artificial forest regeneration with pine and Douglas fir.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT FOREST SCI,VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4,BC,CANADA",,,,,,,,21,11,13,0,8,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",12-Mar,,,ANN SCI FOREST,Ann.

This overview describes past, present, and future silvicultural practices within the oak-hickory ecosystem of the United States. Past land-use activities favored oak development, but wild-fire and livestock grazing controls have caused severe oak regeneration problems that were not recognized until recently. Prescriptions for weedings, cleanings and the use of stocking charts to control intermediate thinnings were early silvicultural developments. More recently, growth and yield models for managed stands were developed to predict current and future timber volumes. Currently, silviculturists are developing solutions to natural and artificial regeneration problems. Research results indicate that, other factors being equal, regeneration success is favored by simultaneously reducing over and understory densities and that oak seedling survival and development is enhanced in large seedlings that have high root to shoot ratios. Future silvicultural practices will have an ecosystems focus.","US FOREST SERV,N CENT FOREST EXPT STN,COLUMBIA,MO 65211; US FOREST SERV,SE FOREST EXPT STN,ASHEVILLE,NC 28802","ROGERS, R (reprint author), UNIV WISCONSIN,STEVENS POINT,WI 54481, USA.",,,,,,,36,6,6,1,7,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"141 RUE JAVEL, 75747 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",12-Mar,,,ANN SCI FOREST,Ann.

Acidic soils are not conducive to survival of clover rhizobia. A survey of pastures was undertaken to determine the number of rhizobia present. The effect of liming acidic soils on the survival of clover rhizobia was also evaluated in the laboratory. The number of clover rhizobia was more than 100 cells g-1 soil in 70% of the pastures surveyed but populations within pastures varied by more than two orders of magnitude. The number of years of clover production beyond 1 year did not affect the rhizobial population density. The soil pH of twelve samples was below 5.0 and six samples had populations of rhizobia lower than 100 g-1 soil. Eleven out of sixteen samples from fields that had grown clover and had pH values above 6.0 had populations exceeding 1000 g-1 soil and only three samples had populations lower than 100 g-1 soil. Incubating indigenous or inoculated rhizobia in well-mixed soils having pH values of 5.1 or below resulted in populations declining to below 10 g-1 soil in 6 weeks. Mixing of soils with pH values of up to 5.4 induced reduction of rhizobial numbers, possibly by destroying microsites. Liming of soils to increase pH values above 5.5 improved survival of native or inoculated rhizobia in most cases.","TEXAS A&M UNIV SYST,DEPT SOIL & CROP SCI,COLL STN,TX 77843",,,,,,,,32,9,9,0,3,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Thirty-six 2-year-old potted seedlings were placed in each of 30 chambers and exposed from May through October to three levels of O3 (charcoal-filtered (CF), nonfiltered (NF), and NF plus 1.5 times ambient O3 (NF150)); three levels of acidity in simulated rain (pH 3.5, 4.4, 5.3); two levels of dry deposition (60 or 90% filtration), and two levels of soil water availability (well watered (WW) or drought stressed (DS)). An additional six plots served as ambient air (AA) controls. One-third (432) of the trees were harvested at the end of each exposure season. Low soil water availability was the only stress factor to significantly affect growth following the first exposure season. After the second season, O3 significantly reduced foliar biomass in WW-NF150 trees, but DS seedlings did not respond to O3. After 3 years of exposure, WW-NF150 trees averaged 70% loss of 1988 needles and 48% loss of 1989 foliage. Ozone-injured seedlings compensated for these losses by increased growth of current-year needles and stems and also increased growth of fine feeder roots. Radial stem growth and coarse-root growth were significantly reduced in O3-injured trees. DS trees in NF150 chambers averaged half the needle loss of WW trees and showed no reduction in radial growth in response to O3. Rain pH and dry deposition had no direct effects on growth of ponderosa pine. These cumulative responses to interacting stresses indicate the importance of multifactorial, long-term studies to evaluate forest tree responses to atmospheric deposition",,"TEMPLE, PJ (reprint author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,STATEWIDE AIR POLLUT RES CTR,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521, USA.",,,,,,,30,37,37,0,5,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Disc areas created by the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, around their mound nests can comprise over 10% of the land surface in semi-arid shrub steppes of the Great Basin, USA. The harvester ant mounds are abandoned after 12-20 years and the mycorrhizal fungal inoculum dispersion patterns within these patches may affect subsequent plant establishment. 2. It was hypothesized that harvester ant activity reduces mycorrhizal inoculum levels within the disc, and that mycorrhizal fungi must re-establish in these patches from surface-deposited, immigrating inoculum. 3. To test this, we first excavated two ant mounds, which revealed a chambered core consisting of a mat of densely packed, clipped roots with 2000-5000 times the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore density found in the surrounding undisturbed vegetation. To assess the effectiveness of these enriched patches of inoculum, non-mycorrhizal seedlings of Artemisia tridentata (sagebrush) and Oryzopsis hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) were planted around the perimeter of nine mycorrhizae-enriched ant mounds and compared with surface inoculation of an exotic mycorrhizal fungus, Gigaspora margarita, capable of being tracked through immunofluorescence. 4. Results from these field bioassays demonstrated that surface-deposited mycorrhizal inoculum did not expand downward into the soil and buried inoculum resulted in high levels of endophyte root infection. 5. It was concluded that harvester ant mounds exhibit nest microbial enrichment, and that the ants leave high densities of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in locations suitable for assisting in the establishment of mutualistic mycorrhizal associations after the mounds are abandoned.",,"FRIESE, CF (reprint author), UNIV DAYTON,DEPT BIOL,300 COLL PK,DAYTON,OH 45469, USA.",,,,,,,0,41,45,2,31,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Excised Rumex root tips have a low hypoxia tolerance, but that of R. acetosa was the lowest. This correlates with a high rate of ethanolic fermentation in both R. crispus and R. palustris and a low rate in R. acetosa. 5.

In 2 greenhouse experiments, sand bluestem [Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus (Nash) Fern.], switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and prairie sandreed [Calamovilfa longifolia (Hook) Scribn.] were grown in steam-sterilized sand in pots and inoculated with either indigenous Sandhills VAM, Glomus deserticola, or noninoculated. In the second experiment, VAM inoculated and control plants were treated with 5 P levels ranging from 5.4 to 27.0 mg P pot-1. Increasing levels of P fertilizer caused an initial increase, then dramatic decrease, in percentage colonization by Glomus deserticola but had no effect on percentage colonization by indigenous Sandhills VAM. Mycorrhizal inoculated plants had a greater number of tillers, greater shoot weight, root weight, tissue P concentration and percentage P recovered, and a lower root/-shoot ratio and P efficiency than noninoculated plants. Non-inoculated sand bluestem had significantly lower shoot P concentration but greater P efficiency over all P levels than any other grass-VAM treatment combination. Phosphorus fertilizer and VAM effects were often complementary at P levels up to 16.2 to 21.6 mg P pot-1, with no change or a decrease in plant responses at higher P levels. These 3 major Sandhills warm-season grasses were highly mycorrhizal dependent. Successful reestablishment of these on eroded sites in the Sandhills may be greatly improved if soil reinoculation with VAM occurred prior to revegetation.","MILLERSVILLE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MILLERSVILLE,PA 17551; UNIV NEBRASKA,DEPT AGRON,LINCOLN,NE 68583","BREJDA, JJ (reprint author), UNIV MISSOURI,SCH NAT RESOURCES,COLUMBIA,MO 65211, USA.",,,,,,,23,19,19,0,20,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

Although trees came from orchards which differed in soil-type, tree spacings and management, consistent patterns were found in root systems. In orchards of 4-y and older, roots of adjacent trees met so that soil volumes within the planting grids (i.e, tree spacings of approximately 5 m inter-row x 4 m intra-row distances) were completely explored, although not completely occupied by roots. Mean root-length densities declined with depth for these orchards. In the 1.5-y orchard, roots from adjacent trees did not meet and root-length densities declined with radial distance from the stem as well as with depth. Root-length densities in the top 1 m ranged from zero to about 1.0 cm. cm-3 in all orchards and were highly variable. The proportions of core samples having zero values for root-length density were used to subdivide the root zone into volumes in which all samples contained roots, and volumes in which some samples had no roots. Results suggest that roots in an 'average' tree penetrate to at least one metre depth in all but very young orchards so that soil in this volume is fully explored.

We studied the effects of both symbionts together and of each alone on water-stable soil aggregate (WSSA) formation. Split-root soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.) plants were grown in containers. One side of the split root was colonized by the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe; from here the VAM hyphae penetrated through a screen (44 - mu openings) to a root-free chamber. On the other side of a solid barrier, the non-VAM portion of the root was in contact through a screen with control soil free of roots and VAM hyphae. Thus, the four treatments, VAM roots (roots and hyphae), VAM hyphae, non-VAM roots, and control, were contained in the same experimental unit. Root length and mass were greater in the VAM-root than in the non-VAM-root chamber, whereas the density of VAM hyphae in the soil was lower in the VAM-root than in the VAM-hyphal chamber. The relative amount of WSSA was highest with VAM roots, lowest in the control chamber, and intermediate and similar with non-VAM roots and VAM hyphae. This incidence of WSSA was lower in all of the chambers at harvest (8 mo.) than in the starting material due to slaking. The composition of WSSA showed that the differences in WSSA between treatments was due to a variable slowing of the slaking process by the mycorrhizae. Non-VAM roots and VAM hyphae had similar effects on soil aggregation.","USDA ARS, HORT CROPS RES LAB, 3420 NW ORCHARD AVE, CORVALLIS, OR 97330 USA; USDA ARS, WESTERN REG RES CTR, ALBANY, CA 94710 USA; CASTLE MT VENTURE, SEARCHLIGHT, NV 89046 USA",,,,,,,,23,47,49,3,24,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

The results of many studies indicate that lower evaporative flux density is associated with high CO2-induced stomatal closure. As a result of decreases in evaporative flux density and increases in net photosynthesis, also found to occur in high CO2 environments, plants have often been shown to maintain higher water use efficiencies when grown at high CO2 than when grown in normal, ambient air. Plants grown at high CO2 have also been found to maintain higher total water potentials, to increase biomass production, have larger root-to-shoot ratios, and to be generally more drought resistant (through avoidance mechanisms) than those grown at ambient CO2 levels. High CO2-induced changes in plant structure (i.e., vessel or tracheid anatomy, leaf specific conductivity) may be associated with changes in vulnerability to xylem cavitation or in environmental conditions in which runaway embolism is likely to occur. Further study is needed to resolve these important issues. Methodology and other CO2 effects on plant water relations are discussed.","UNIV VERMONT, DEPT BOT, BURLINGTON, VT 05405 USA","TYREE, MT (reprint author), US FOREST SERV, NE FOREST EXPT STN, POB 968, BURLINGTON, VT 05402 USA.",,,,,,,89,136,141,2,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,JAN,1993,104,,,,,,47,62,,10.1007/BF00048144,,,16,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,KM790,WOS:A1993KM79000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"BENNETT, AF",,,,"BENNETT, AF",,,"MICROHABITAT USE BY THE LONG-NOSED POTOROO, POTOROUS-TRIDACTYLUS, AND OTHER SMALL MAMMALS IN REMNANT FOREST VEGETATION OF SOUTH-WESTERN VICTORIA",WILDLIFE RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MYCOPHAGOUS MARSUPIALS; SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FEEDING ECOLOGY; HABITAT; DINGO; FIRE; SELECTION; HEATHLAND; WALLABY,"Microhabitat use by the long-nosed potoroo, Potorous tridactylus, and six other species of small mammal was studied in remnant forest vegetation in south-western Victoria, Australia. Throughout its geographic range, P. tridactylus is consistently associated with dense vegetation in the ground and shrub strata. However, at a local scale, captures of P. tridactylus were not clearly associated with a particular floristic group, and were not strongly correlated with any structural feature of the vegetation. Rather, individuals utilised a range of sites of differing floristic composition and vegetation density. Dense cover provided diurnal shelter and protection from predators, whereas food resources were most abundant in adjacent more open areas. The use of vegetation mosaics or ecotones that allow the inclusion of contrasting microhabitats within an individual home range appears to be characteristic of potoroids in temperate environments. Such mosaics may result from topographic or edaphic variation, or from seral successional stages in vegetation following disturbance. Of the other small mammals, the bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and the brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii, favoured floristic groups that provided dense low cover. Captures of the swamp rat, Rattus lutreolus, were clumped, and centred on several sites along the forest edge on impeded drainage where potential foods were common. The long-nosed bandicoot, Perameles nasuta, and the southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus, were uncommon and clear microhabitat preferences were not displayed. The house mouse, Mus musculus, was of transient occurrence, mostly during autumn, and no obvious habitat preference was apparent. The quality and availability of microhabitats in remnant vegetation, together with landscape structure, are important in ensuring the persistence and conservation of small mammals in fragmented landscapes.","UNIV MELBOURNE,DEPT ZOOL,PARKVILLE,VIC 3052,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,55,51,57,3,51,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

The density of bettongs showed no consistent relationship with the floristics of an area nor the type of vegetation community present. Bettongs did not occur in areas with a dense undergrowth. However, the occurrence of an open undergrowth did not guarantee the presence of bettongs. The abundance of bettongs on areas with an open undergrowth was related to the extent of mycorrhizal root development, sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi forming the major component of the diet of bettongs. The highest densities of bettongs occurred in areas with infertile soils. Since mycorrhizal fungi develop and sporulate well in soils of low fertility this factor may be important in indirectly influencing their numbers.","UNIV TASMANIA,DEPT ZOOL,HOBART,TAS 7001,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,38,18,20,0,11,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

The proportion of roots colonized by Trichoderma viride rose from 10 to 30 %. Under normal humid conditions the inoculation with two selected strains of T. viride caused a fivefold increase, mainly based on nearby infection. In combination with drought stress there was no further increase by artificial inoculation. The tests show that periods of drought favour the colonization of fine roots by potential pathogens.

By means of a sampling procedure, the components needle dry mass and branchwood dry mass without needles of individual trees are recorded. Using the relationship between branch basal diameter and needle respectively branchwood dry mass, the total needle and branchwood dry mass of trees is estimated. Based on that, stand or regional parameters for the allometric function between diameter breast height and needle respectively branchwood dry mass can be determined for defined H/D-clusters. Published data from various sources were used in this paper. The lowest coefficients of determination were found in H/D-cluster 120 (H/D-values over 114). Therefore, further differentiation within this range seems to be necessary. For assimilation models, there should be quantification of needle dry mass separately for needle age classes and morphological characteristics of needles. Basis for the estimate of tree-bole volume is the relationship between H/D-value and oven-dry weight. There are problems as far as methods for quantifying the subterranean dendromass (e.g. dynamics of fine roots) are concerned; this is requiring considerable efforts, too. Spatial structure was also described by allometric functions (crown length and crown cover in relation to diameter breast height). For the partial model to express wind modification by-the stand, standardized wind profiles as related to crown canopy density were used.

This paper reports results from an experiment designed to determine whether plants of two grass species subjected to a gradient of defoliation intensities, from 0 to 100% aboveground biomass removal, showed such a response. The relationship between aboveground RGR and defoliation intensity was exponential and closely matched the theoretical relationship of equal absolute growth rate. Thus, plants showed the same aboveground growth regardless of defoliation intensity thanks to an exponential stimulation of RGR by defoliation. Belowground RGR was depressed by defoliation of more than 20% of the above-ground biomass. In spite of the drastic modification imposed by the treatments on the relative proportions of different plant parts, after a 42-day recovery period basic allometric relationships, such as root: shoot and leaf-area: weight ratios, were not affected by defoliation intensity. Exponential aboveground compensatory responses represent a key feedback process resulting in constant aboveground growth regardless of defoliation intensity and appear to be a simple consequence of strong commitments to certain allometric relationships.","SYRACUSE UNIV,BIOL RES LABS,SYRACUSE,NY 13244",,,,,,,,16,60,62,1,37,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1992,92,3,,,,,313,316,,10.1007/BF00317456,,,4,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC357,WOS:A1992KC35700002,28312596,,,,10/31/19J,"CONNER, WH; ASKEW, GR",,,,"CONNER, WH; ASKEW, GR",,,RESPONSE OF BALDCYPRESS AND LOBLOLLY-PINE SEEDLINGS TO SHORT-TERM SALTWATER FLOODING,WETLANDS,,,English,Note,,,,,,SALINITY; WETLANDS; BALDCYPRESS; LOBLOLLY PINE; HURRICANE,,"Six-month-old and eighteen-month-old baldcypress and loblolly pine seedlings were subjected to a simulated saltwater surge (salinity = 30 parts per thousand) for 0 to 5 days followed by flushing and daily watering with fresh water.

Seedlings were planted in an acidic (pH 5.5), P-deficient soil containing re-established native microflora (minus VAM) and appropriate rhizobia, and inoculated with the rhizobacterium, the VAM fungus, or both. The plants were assayed at three intervals for up to 10-11 weeks. The growth-promoting rhizobacteria alone increased alfalfa shoot mass by 23% compared to all other treatments, but only at 8 weeks of growth, apparently by promoting nodulation and N2 fixation (acetylene reduction activity). The presence of VAM, either alone or in combination with the rhizobacteria, generally decreased root length but only at 8 weeks also. As a group, the inoculation treatments increased all nodular measurements by 10 weeks of growth. Few treatment effects were found at 7 and 9 weeks for birdsfoot trefoil; neither plant nor nodular measurements differed among treatments. By 11 weeks, shoot mass was increased by the rhizobacteria alone by 36% compared to the control. As a group, the inoculation treatments all showed increased nodular responses by this time. The rhizobacteria stimulated mycorrhizal development on both plant species, but only at the initial samplings. No synergistic effects between the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium and VAM inoculation were found. Although these results lend credence to the concept of managing microorganisms in the rhizosphere to improve plant growth, they emphasize the necessity for a more thorough understanding of microbial interactions as plants mature.","NPI,SALT LAKE CITY,UT 84108","STALEY, TE (reprint author), USDA ARS,NAA,APPALACHIAN SOIL & WATER CONSERVAT RES LAB,POB 867,BECKLEY,WV 25802, USA.",,,,,,,23,13,15,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Brief reviews of the mycorrhizal symbiosis and rangeland ecology provide a background for discussion of the role of VAM fungi in inter- and intraspecific competition in sagebrush-grass systems. Plants can be significantly better competitors for soil resources when mycorrhizal than when not mycorrhizal, and VAM fungi can alter the outcome of competitive interactions among plants. Additionally, soil resources can be transferred from one plant to another through a network of hyphae produced by VAM fungi; such transport can improve growth in the receiver plant. The response of a plant to the formation of mycorrhizae depends upon the taxa of the plant and fungal symbionts, their phenologies, and on the severity of environmental stress. Native bunchgrasses of the Intermountain West are mychorrhizal. Alien weeds introduced to the sagebrush steppe include both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal species. When a rangeland site is colonized by nonmycorrhizal species, VAM fungi populations decline. In the absence of VAM fungi, mycorrhizal bunchgrasses are at a competitive disadvantage compared to nonmycorrhizal species in capturing limited soil resources. However, the opposite is also true: mycorrhizal species out-compete nonmycorrhizal species when VAM fungi are abundant. One naturalized alien, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), is a facultative host of mycorrhizal fungi. Cheatgrass is an effective competitor in the rangeland environment, and its relative competitive ability, compared to native bunchgrasses, is unlikely to be altered by VAM fungi. Though mycorrbizal fungi would enhance the competitive ability of native bunchgrasses, cheatgrass would reap comparable or greater benefit since it also hosts VAM fungi and, due to a rapid rate of growth, acts as a strong sink for soil resources. This is probably one of the factors behind continued, long-term occupancy and/or dominance of rangeland sites by cheatgrass. However, it is not unreasonable to expect greater efficiency among coevolved mutualists compared to a profiteering alien. If assimilates are more efficiently transferred from a native bunchgrass to its progeny, then VAM fungi have an important role to play in the restoration of Intermountain rangelands. Research into the role of mycorrhizal fungi in competitive interspecific interactions, rhizosphere community dynamics, the mycorrhizal dependence of rangeland grasses, and patterns of translocation is needed before definitive answers can be presented.",,"GOODWIN, J (reprint author), OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT RANGELAND RESOURCES,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA.",,,,,,,0,30,33,1,27,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,PULLMAN,"PO BOX 645910, PULLMAN, WA 99164-5910",0029-344X,,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,NOV,1992,66,4,,,,,251,260,,,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JW776,WOS:A1992JW77600006,,,,,10/31/19J,"SANTRUCKOVA, H",,,,"SANTRUCKOVA, H",,,"MICROBIAL BIOMASS, ACTIVITY AND SOIL RESPIRATION IN RELATION TO SECONDARY SUCCESSION",PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,SECONDARY SUCCESSION; FIELD; FALLOW; MEADOW; FOREST; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; SOIL RESPIRATION; SOIL ORGANIC CARBON; TEMPORAL FLUCTUATION; TURNOVER RATE,ORGANIC-MATTER; DYNAMICS; CARBON; MICROORGANISMS; CULTIVATION,"Microbial biomass (C(mic)), microbial activity (SRA) and soil respiration (SR) were studied in a secondary successional row represented by an intensively cultivated field, by 2 - 10 years uncultivated fields (fallow and meadow, respectively) and by an oak forest.

This study was conducted to determine the unconfined compressive strength associated with herbaceously rooted streambanks, and whether greater compressive strength is developed from greater root-length density (length of roots per volume of sample) or specific plant communities. The unconfined compressive strength, root-length density, plant community, and engineering soil characteristics were measured on 122 samples from six meadow stream reaches. Sample compressive strength emulated an elastic condition in highly rooted samples, and developed negligible compressive strength in samples containing very small amounts of roots. Additionally, compressive strength was found to increase nonlinearly with increases in very fine root-length density (herbaceous roots < 0.5 mm in diam.), and reached an apparent asymptote at 50 kPa. The greatest compressive strength was derived from samples dominated by Nebraska sedge (Carex nebrascensis Dewey). Correlations between unconfined compressive strength and engineering soil properties were mostly insignificant, primarily because samples were derived from unconsolidated alluvium. Stream morphology parameters showed little correlation to compressive strength, root-length density, or other independent variables, suggesting other unmeasured factors may have an equal or greater influence on stream morphology. Herbaceous roots appear to supply most of the compressive strength and soil stability found in meadow streambanks, especially those dominated by Nebraska sedge.","UNIV NEVADO,DEPT RANGE WILDLIFE & FORESTRY,RENO,NV 89512; UNIV NEVADO,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,RENO,NV 89512",,,,,,,,26,28,30,0,11,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

A study was conducted to determine the most-efficient methodology for sampling surface mineral soils in a mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest for total C, total N, and fine root biomass to obtain stand level estimates. Specifically, we evaluated the variation within and among plots, the performance of small- and large-diameter corers, the effect of stem proximity, the influence of fine roots on soil C and N estimates, and the effect of compositing samples. We concluded that (i) C and N levels always increased with proximity to stems; (ii) proximity to a stem did not affect mean fine root biomass estimates; (iii) variability of the estimates of C and N consistently decreased with increased distance from the stem, but no trend occurred for fine root biomass; (iv) for total stand estimates of N and fine root biomass, stratification with respect to tree stems does not yield a gain in precision, for C precision increased only slightly; (v) C associated with fine roots represented almost-equal-to 5% of the total C in a core sample, while N in roots was < 2% of its total; (vi) for C and N estimates, the variation with a 1.8-cm-diam. core was similar to that obtained with a 6.1-cm core; and (vii) chemical analyses could be reduced and precision maintained by compositing the soil core samples.","US FOREST SERV,ATHENS,GA 30602","RUARK, GA (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,3041 CORNWALLIS RD,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709, USA.",,,,,,,14,23,23,0,9,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Soil samples were obtained with corers and cut in 2-cm thick slices. The number of rootlets of diameter classes <0.3, 0.3-0.5, 0.5-0.8, and 0.8-1.0 mm were determined under microscope (x150) on the upper surface of slices. Rootlet surface for each class was measured on thin sections of soil, with an optic microscope connected to a digitalizing board. Mean rootlet surface (SBAR) showed a small standard deviation within each diameter class. The rootlet surface (S) on a surface of soil S(t) can be estimated as S = NSS(t)BAR/(n(c)S(o)), where N is the number of rootlets observed in n(c) fields of observation, each field having a surface S(o). If two soil slices are located at depths h1 and h2, respectively, and if the rootlet surfaces of those slices are S1 and S2, the rootlet volume V of the first slice corresponds approximately to the volume of a truncated cone, and can be calculated as V = [S1 + S2 + (S1S2)0,5](h2 - h1)/3. The rootlet density (g.cm-3 of root) was also determined for each diameter class. The standard deviation from DBAR), the mean density for each diameter class was small. Thus, the rootlet mass M was determined as M = VDBAR). Estimated and real rootlet volume and mass values were compared. A difference of about 10% was found between estimated and real values.","UNIV SHERBROOKE,DEPT BIOL,SHERBROOKE J1K 2R1,QUEBEC,CANADA","PAGE, F (reprint author), MINIST AGR PECHERIES & ALIMENTAT QUEBEC,SERV SOLS,2700 RUE EINSTEIN,ST FOY G1P 3W8,QUEBEC,CANADA.",,,,,,,24,3,3,0,0,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Conventional 2-year-old, bare-root nursery stock was compared with containerized seedlings whose roots had been inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker and Couch and treated with indolebutyric acid. One-half of the seedlings were clipped just above the root collar. During both years, seedlings planted in a clearcut maintained significantly higher predawn and midday leaf water potentials compared with seedlings planted in a shelterwood, despite the development of greater leaf area in the clearcut-planted seedlings. This was associated with restricted root system development in the shelterwood and to greater availability of soil moisture in the clearcut. Similarly, photosynthesis and transpiration rates were greater in the clearcut because of reduced water stress and higher light levels. The advantage to seedlings in the clearcut was diminished by the second year, a result that was attributable to greater competition for light and water from herbaceous vegetation. During the first year, containerized seedlings maintained higher water potentials and stomatal conductance, and lower liquid flow resistance from soil to leaf than bare-root seedlings, but had comparable photosynthesis and transpiration rates. By the second year, only predawn leaf water potential and conductance were higher in containerized seedlings. These differences were attributed to greater root length and better root-shoot balance of containerized seedlings. Clipping of seedling shoot before planting appeared to have little effect on measured physiological processes. It was concluded that during the first two growing seasons following planting, the clearcut appeared to offer a better environment for northern red oak seedling establishment and growth than did the shelterwood. However, by the end of the second growing season competition from herbaceous vegetation was evident in the physiological performance of clearcut-planted seedlings.","UNIV MISSOURI,SCH NAT RESOURCES,COLUMBIA,MO 65211",,,,,,,,25,15,16,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Applications of N-15-labelled urea enriched at 2.33 atom % excess were applied at different frequencies and in different seasons to single-tree root-isolated plots (area, 7 m2). A single application of 90 g N per tree in spring was compared with either three by 30 or nine by 10 split applications. Applications of 30 g N per tree in either autumn, spring or summer were also compared. The uptake of fertiliser-nitrogen was about 20% of that applied for all treatments irrespective of frequency, rate or season of application. Uptake was positively correlated with the size of the tree at the time of application. Seventy-two percent of fertiliser-nitrogen was retained within the soil following the application of 30 g N in spring but only 39% for the single application of 90 g N per tree. Splitting the application increased the retention of fertiliser-nitrogen to 54% and 67% for the three-split and nine-split applications, respectively. Those trees receiving 90 g N showed a diameter response of 9% compared to controls. Height growth was not affected by fertiliser. Above-ground biomass was 19% higher than controls with the main increase being in foliage formed during the experiment (+26%). The largest growth responses were below ground with overall root biomass 55% higher than controls with fine roots (less than 2 mm) 80% higher. The only response to 30 g N per tree was below ground with fine-root biomass being 27% higher. Split applications of urea reduced losses of fertiliser, probably as leaching, but the increased nitrogen within the soil has not benefitted the trees in the first year. The relatively low losses from applying 30 g N per tree and the increase in fine-root biomass suggest that an optimal fertiliser strategy in young pines would be to apply a single small dressing followed by a heavier application a year later when root density and sink size have increased. There is no evidence for the superiority of applying nitrogen in any particular season.","UNIV CANTERBURY,SCH FORESTRY,CHRISTCHURCH 1,NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,51,15,16,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Two orange needles were isolated and identified as anthraquinone compounds: emodin and physcion. Both compounds exhibited inhibitory activities against the seedling growth of several testing plant species. Glucosides were isolated from P. sachalinense and were identified as emodin-1-O-beta-D-glucoside and physcion-1-O-beta-D-glucoside, respectively. On plant growth bioassay, these glucosides showed no phytotoxic activity against lettuce seedlings. The concentrations of emodin, physcion, and their glucosides from rhizome with roots, aerial parts, fallen leaves, and soil were determined. The rhizome with roots and fallen leaves contained emodin and physcion at relatively high concentrations. Emodin also occurs in the soil of this plant community with effective concentrations in the fall.

(white mustard). Physiological and growth measurements were made on individuals of white mustard grown in controlled-enviroment wind tunnels at windspeeds of 0.3, 2.2 and 6.0 ms-1 for 42 days. Plants were harvested at four different dates. Increasing wind speed slightly increased transpiration and stomatal conductance. We did not observe a significant decline in the photosynthetic rate per unit of leaf area. Number of leaves. stem length, leaf area and dry weights of total biomass and plant parts were significantly lower in plants exposed at high wind speed conditions. There were no significant differences in the unit leaf rate nor relative growth rates, although these were always lower in plants grown at high wind speed. Allocation and architectural parameters were also examined. After 42 days of exposure to wind, plants showed higher leaf area ratio, root and leaf weight ratios and root/shoot ratio than those grown at control treatment. Only specific leaf area declined significantly with wind speed, but stem and reproductive parts also decreased. The responses of plants to each wind speed treatment depended on the age of the plant for most of the variables. It is suggested that wind operates in logarithmic manner, with relatively small or no effect at lower wind speeds and a much greater effect at higher speeds. Since there is no evidence of a significant reduction in photosynthetic rate of Sinapis with increasing wind speed it is suggested that the effect of wind on plant growth was due to mechanical effects leading to changes in allocation and developmental patterns.","UNIV SHEFFIELD,SCH BIOL SCI,DEPT ANIM & PLANT SCI,SHEFFIELD S10 2UQ,ENGLAND","RETUERTO, R (reprint author), UNIV SANTIAGO,FAC BIOL,AREA ECOL,E-15071 SANTIAGO,SPAIN.",,"Woodward, Ian F/B-7762-2008; Woodward, Frank Ian/P-4530-2019; Retuerto, Ruben/B-4853-2008","Retuerto, Ruben/0000-0002-9879-5512",,,,41,24,28,0,34,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1992,92,1,,,,,113,123,,10.1007/BF00317271,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU080,WOS:A1992JU08000017,28311821,,,,10/31/19J,"WISSEMEIER, AH; DIENING, A; HERGENRODER, A; HORST, WJ; MIXWAGNER, G",,,,"WISSEMEIER, AH; DIENING, A; HERGENRODER, A; HORST, WJ; MIXWAGNER, G",,,CALLOSE FORMATION AS PARAMETER FOR ASSESSING GENOTYPIC PLANT TOLERANCE OF ALUMINUM AND MANGANESE,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ALUMINUM; CALLOSE; CELL CULTURE; COWPEA; LINSEED; MANGANESE; SCREENING; SOYBEAN; TOLERANCE; TOXICITY,COWPEA VIGNA-UNGUICULATA; TOXICITY; GROWTH; ROOTS; CELLS,"Callose ((1,3)-beta-glucan) formation in plant tissues is induced by excess Al and Mn.

The BIOMASS model estimates total CO2 uptake by a forest stand from intercepted radiation and photosynthetic properties of the foliage. Net Primary Production is obtained by subtracting respiration rates of the component parts of trees. BIOMASS simulated well the observed growth patterns of trees, especially stem and foliage components. Close similarities between the processes involved in transpiration and CO2 Uptake, and good correspondence between calculated and measured soil water balances over a 4 year period, increased confidence in the total CO2 uptake predictions of the model.

The mineralogy in the sand, silt, and clay fractions was determined by XRD and SEM/EDAX, and element concentrations in the same fractions were deter-mined by AA and XRF. Physical weathering has had a significant influence on the mineral distribution in the silt and clay fractions. Consequently, in these soils mineral weathering cannot be studied based on these fractions alone. The distribution of plagioclase and chlorite appears to be most affected by physical weathering of the coarse fragments. An irregular distribution with depth of shale fragments in the coarse sand fraction has resulted in a similar distribution of chlorite in the clay fraction and, for two of the profiles, a similar distribution of soil pH. In both the silt and clay fractions, chlorite appears more stable than mica due to a higher input rate of chlorite from coarser fractions. Rapid weathering of the clay fraction and comminution of coarser particles have resulted in a similar clay mineralogy across soil age within the A, E, and B horizons. Mica weathers to vermiculite with maximum Al-hydroxy interlayers in the B horizon and minimum in the A horizon. Reduced drainage seems to impede the formation of Al-hydroxy interlayers. Chlorite dissolves either directly or via a vermiculite phase. Carbonates have been dissolved below rooting depth (approximately 80 cm) within a few hundred years after stabilization of the dunes.","DEPT SOIL SCI,N-1432 AS,NORWAY; UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT SOIL SCI,MADISON,WI 53706",,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,SEP,1992,54,4-Jan,,,,,91,105,,10.1016/0016-7061(92)90099-S,,,15,Soil Science,Agriculture,JR906,WOS:A1992JR90600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"BROOKE, BM; STOUT, DG; TUCKER, R; PRESTON, CM",,,,"BROOKE, BM; STOUT, DG; TUCKER, R; PRESTON, CM",,,PREINOCULATION OF CLOVER SEED FOR AERIAL SEEDING ON LOGGED SITES,JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,"LOGGING; COATED SEED; CLOVER (ALSIKE, WHITE); N-FIXATION; N-15 NATURAL ABUNDANCE",NITROGEN-FIXATION; BRITISH-COLUMBIA,"In 1989 a mixture of clover (Trifolium hybridum L. and T. repens L.) seed pre-inoculated with Rhizobia by 2 commercial techniques (Guardcoat(TM(1)) and Dormal(TM(1))) were compared to bare seed.

Colonization of mycotrophic plants by VAM fungi at a mine study site in the Red Desert region of southwestern Wyoming was accelerated by the reclamation practice of supplemental irrigation. Frequency of VAM fungal colonizations in three grass species were substantially increased in plots irrigated at rates of 5 and 10 cm mo-1 in the first 2 yr of reclamation. Irrigation at a rate > 5 cm mo-1 was less important to fungal colonizations than irrigation scheduling during vegetative establishment. Colonization of mycotrophic plants by VAM fungi was not affected by fertilization with an 18-46-0 (N-PK) fertilizer during the first year of reclamation.

Aluminium was found in very high concentrations in the root cortex, but could not be detected in stelar tissues. In contrast, magnesium was found only in the central cylinder in low amounts. The calcium concentration in the cortex was low, but was higher in the stele. Aluminium has been shown to interfere with cation uptake by blocking exchange sites in the cortical apoplast. Thus these results strongly suggest that the low foliar magnesium and calcium contents of the declining red spruce trees are driven by aluminium-induced inhibition of magnesium and calcium uptake. Soil solution chemistry, ion distribution in fine roots, and foliar ion contents at Whiteface Mountain were compared with equivalent data from other forest sites as well as with data from controlled studies on spruce seedlings. These data suggest that aluminium toxicity contributes to red spruce decline at Whiteface Mountain.","CORNELL UNIV,BOYCE THOMPSON INST PLANT RES,ITHACA,NY 14853","SCHLEGEL, H (reprint author), UNIV GOTTINGEN,INST FORSTBOT,BUSGENWEG 2,W-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,"Amundson, Ronald/E-2654-2015","Amundson, Ronald/0000-0003-1510-7313",,,,44,27,27,0,2,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

During the first year, some seedlings and juveniles of Aspidosperma fendleri were collected and the number of rootlets, the primary root length and the shoot : root ratio were determined. Both species show periodicity in growth but their relative growth rate differs between species. For Aspidosperma fendleri, the highest relative growth rate (0.313 y-1) was found for individuals grown under greenhouse conditions followed by individuals growing in an old forest gap (0.143 y-1) and finally individuals under the forest canopy (0.137 y-1). For Richeria grandis, the relative growth rate under the forest canopy was 0.261 y-1. Leaf production for Aspidosperma fendleri in the forest (natural conditions) was 4.39 total mean leaf number for five years and 5.46 total mean leaf number under greenhouse conditions. For Richeria grandis it was 5.34 mean leaf production for four years. The root : shoot ratio for Aspidosperma fendleri was constant during the observation year. Aspidosperma fendleri showed a lower number of rootlets than did Richeria grandis. There was an inverse relationship between growth and survival during the dry season. During this period, mortality was higher and the highest mortality occurred during the first year when the total relative growth rate was highest. Slow growth is evident in both species. This mechanism may represent an adaptive advantage to remain dormant until there is an opening in the forest canopy. Since the seeds of Aspidosperma fendleri and Richeria grandis are highly vulnerable to predators and pathogens, slow growth as seedlings and juveniles allows them to survive, and contributes to regeneration in cloud forest.",,"FLORES, S (reprint author), INST VENEZOLANO INVEST CIENT,CTR ECOL & CIENCIAS AMBIENTALES,APARTADO 21827,CARACAS 1010A,VENEZUELA.",,,"flores, saul/0000-0003-0687-8271",,,,0,9,12,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

Time-averaged, total carbon storage (at equilibrium) was generally in the range 40-80 Mg C ha-1 in trees, 15-25 Mg C ha-1 in above- and belowground litter, 70-90 Mg C ha-1 in soil organic matter and 20-40 Mg C ha-1 in wood products (assuming product lifetime equalled rotation length). The rate of carbon storage during the first rotation in most plantations was in the range 2-5 Mg C ha-1 year-1. A sensitivity analysis revealed the following processes to be both uncertain and critical: the fraction of total woody biomass in branches and roots; litter and soil organic matter decomposition rates; and rates of fine root turnover. Other variables, including the time to canopy closure and the possibility of accelerated decomposition after harvest, were less critical. The lifetime of wood products was not critical to total carbon storage because wood products formed only a modest fraction of the total. The average increase in total carbon storage in the tree-soil-product system per unit increase in Yield Class (m3 ha-1 year- 1) for unthinned Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations was 5.6 Mg C ha-1. Increasing the Yield Class from 6 to 24 m3 ha-1 year-1 increased the rate of carbon storage in the first rotation from 2.5 to 5.6 Mg C ha-1 year-1 in unthinned plantations. Thinning reduced total carbon storage in P. sitchensis plantations by about 15%, and is likely to reduce carbon storage in all plantation types. If the objective is to store carbon rapidly in the short term and achieve high carbon storage in the long term, Populus plantations growing on fertile land (2.7 m spacing, 26-year rotations, Yield Class 12) were the best option examined. If the objective is to achieve high carbon storage in the medium term (50 years) without regard to the initial rate of storage, then plantations of conifers of any species with above-average Yield Classes would suffice. In the long term (100 years), broadleaved plantations of oak and beech store as much carbon as conifer plantations.

To investigate the belowground effects of a cloud water deposition gradient between two mature red spruce stands on the summit of Whitetop Mountain, Virginia, the chemistries of precipitation, throughfall, and soil solution were monitored over a 2-year period, and fine-root distributions were characterized. Deposition of water, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in throughfall and stemflow was from 15 to 55% greater at the site with greater exposure to cloud water deposition (high cloud site), depending upon the particular ion and year. Soil solution nitrate concentrations were highly variable over time, and base cation, Al, and H ion concentrations were highly correlated with nitrate in both organic and mineral horizons at both sites. Soil solution nitrate, base cation, Al, and H ion concentrations were two to six times greater during periods of low soil moisture in the summer-autumn of 1987 and 1988 than during the remainder of the study period. In the mineral soil solutions, the high cloud site had significantly higher (p < 0.001) concentrations of nitrate and Al, and significantly lower (p < 0.05) Ca:Al and Mg:Al ratios.

Dicotyledonous species were affected more than monocotyledons at potentials of -0.25 and -0.5 MPa but less at -1.0 MPa. Root diameters of all the species were thicker than those of the unstressed at potentials of -0.25 and -0.5 MPa. At a potential of -1.0 MPa the dicotyledons were still thicker, though not by as much as they were at -0.25 and -0.5 MPa. The monocotyledons, in contrast, were thinner at -1.0 MPa. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.81, p < 0.01) between root diameter and root elongation at -1.0 MPa potential. Species were ranked according to the relative root elongation (RRE) and relative root thickness (RRT) at the highest level of stress (-1.0 MPa). In both rankings dicotyledonous species were in the top ranks and monocotyledous species were in lower positions.

Pioneer and 'late-stage' fungi as well as one strain collected from a Zn-polluted site were included in the study. The accumulation of zinc in the host plants was determined at two different sublethal substrate Zn concentrations. The mycobionts varied considerably in their protection of the autobionts against zinc toxicity. Several fungal species reduced zinc accumulation in the pine seedlings. A Thelephora terrestris (Ehrh.) Fr. Strain, however, increased the Zn concentration in its host plants. Specific zinc-retaining capacity of the mycelium and density of the extramatrical mycelium were important features determining the effectiveness of the zinc retention in the fungal symbiont. The experiments were carried out in a growth chamber where plants were cultivated in root observation chambers. The determination of the extent of substrate colonization showed that an elevated zinc concentration in a substrate might be an important stress factor for the growth of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. The growth of the extramatrical mycelium of some species was inhibited at the highest zinc concentration supplied. A determination of the in vitro zinc tolerance of the fungi could not always predict their tolerance as symbionts, where the latter characteristic did not determine the Zn retention capacity of their mycelium. In this paper we also discuss the possibility that on Zn-polluted soils ectomycorrhizal species and strains are selected that are Zn-tolerant and, in addition, are able to protect their own energy source, the autobiont, from toxicity.

Averaging data from minirhizotrons within plots prior to analysis reduced variation about plot means, but extensive intraplot variation invalidates this approach on statistical grounds. Both nested and averaged data failed to account for the contribution of individual roots to the mean, and root production rates were consequently overestimated.

Adding 5% bentonite clay to a loamy sand before inoculation markedly improved bacterial survival through the creation of large amounts of protective microhabitats. However, amending loamy sand with 5% bentonite clay also had a strong influence on soil physical properties. We therefore studied different introduction methods, with the aim of applying less bentonite, but maintaining high bacterial survival levels similar to those found with 5% bentonite. Using starved cells instead of a freshly grown culture slightly increased survival in a loamy sand in the absence of bentonite. In the presence of bentonite, no positive effects on survival due to the use of starved cells could be found. Soil-adapted rhizobia survived better in unamended and bentonite-amended loamy sand than freshly cultured rhizobia. However, this was only the case in soil containing up to 1% bentonite. The previously found high survival levels using 5% bentonite could not be reached. Mixing a fresh rhizobial culture or freeze-dried cells with bentonite clay before introduction into soil was very successful in enhancing bacterial survival. Only 1% of bentonite was necessary to reach survival levels comparable to those found previously, after mixing 5% bentonite with loamy sand before inoculation. It was concluded that when bacteria and bentonite were mixed prior to inoculation, the clay offered protection at the site of introduction, resulting in a more efficient use of bentonite for enhancing bacterial survival.",,"HEIJNEN, CE (reprint author), INST SOIL FERTIL RES,POB 48,6700 AA WAGENINGEN,NETHERLANDS.",,"van Veen, Johannes A/C-3697-2011",,,,,17,44,45,2,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

The substances were tested with eight rhizobial strains from three cross-inoculation groups: Rhizobium leguminosarum b.v. trifolii, R. meliloti and R. loti in pure culture studies. Bacteria were obtained from a culture collection or from soils. Sensitivity of the bacteria to the agrochemicals and heavy metals varied. None of the bacteria were tolerant to all chemicals. No difference in tolerance between cross-inoculation groups existed. Bacteria were able to multiply at concentrations of agrochemicals equal to or higher than recommended field-application rates. Heavy metals concentrations that severely inhibited growth were far lower than the highest amounts allowed under the current Commission of the European Communities' guidelines for environmental protection. Bacterial growth in presence of the agrochemicals and heavy metals, apart from glyphosate and zinc, did not influence nodulation ability of the strains. Development of uninoculated plants was inhibited at increasing concentrations of all compounds, red clover being most sensitive. Herbicides were most harmful, with injuries occurring at levels 1/10-1/10,000 of recommended applied concentrations. Uninoculated plants were less tolerant to agrochemicals, but were more tolerant to heavy metals compared to the bacteria. Root hair deformations similar to bacterial-induced root hair deformations were induced by bentazone, chlorsulphuron and monochlorophenoxyacetic acid on uninoculated plants. Symbiotic interactions were adversely affected by several of the agrochemicals. Bacterial-induced root hair deformations necessary for nodulation decreased in the presence of benomyl, bentazone, chlorsulphuron, fenpropimorph, mancozeb and monochlorophenoxyacetic acid. Fenpropimorph and mancozeb did not cause root hair deformations at increasing concentrations, indicating that these may inhibit nodulation under field conditions. Nodule development was inhibited at increased levels of bentazone, chlorsulphuron, glyphosate and mancozeb.

Ozonation affected the S, P and N concentration of leaves and increased delta-C-13 in leaves and stem, while the CO2 assimilation rate declined with increasing CO2 concentration in mesophyll intercellulars. While whole-plant production correlated negatively with the O3 dose, ozone increased the specific leaf weight (i. e. leaf weight/leaf area, SLW) but decreased the ratios of stem weight/stem length and root/shoot biomass. Neither the latter ratio nor SLW changed in experimentally defoliated control plants, whereas in ozonated plants starch accumulated along leaf veins and phloem tissue was deformed in the leaf petioles and the stem. Only in early summer was the relative growth rate higher in the ozonated than in the control plants.

However, when relating biomass to the actual foliage area present due to leaf loss, this ratio did not differ between treatments. Similarly the ratio of actual foliage area versus basal stem area in cross-section did not differ.

The rate of root elongation was decreased by treatment with greater-than-or-equal-to 200-mu-M Mn when N was supplied as NO3-, but not when it was supplied as NH4+. This difference could be attributed to the higher Mn concentrations in root tips of the NO3--grown seedlings compared with the NH4+-grown seedlings.

This negative correlation may have been caused by an alteration in food supply of enchytraeids, owing to changes in litter quality and the amount and species composition of fungi and mycorhizae. Nematode numbers showed a positive correlation with the activity of dehydrogenase enzymes, mineral N, and soil pH. The feeding characteristics of nematodes as a group need further study.

Some plants emit CS2. The present study was designed to determine if CS2 emissions from Mimosa pudica could inhibit the rhizosphere growth of six different bacterial species. Albizia julibrissin, a plant that does not emit CS2 and is closely related to M. pudica, was used as a negative control. Two pseudomonads, streptomycetes and rhizobia were each inoculated at a concentration of 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) plant-1 into assemblies with and without a gnotobiotically grown M. pudica or A. julibrissin plant. Roots of M. pudica and A. julibrissin had a variable effect on bacterial growth. Neither plant inhibited pseudomonad nor rhizobial growth on the rhizoplane or in the rhizosphere, but both plants inhibited streptomycete growth on the rhizoplane and in the rhizosphere. However, the inhibition of streptomycete growth was temporary and. after 7 days, little difference in streptomycete numbers was observed between assemblies with a plant and assemblies without a plant but with an added carbon source. Similar results were observed in a competition study between a rhizobium and a streptomycete on the rhizoplane and in the rhizosphere of M. pudica except the streptomycete counts did not recover to the same extent after 7 days. In CS2 studies, the growth of all six bacterial species was inhibited by 155 ng CS2 ml-1, and with two exceptions, to a lesser extent by 1.9 ng CS2 ml-1. It is unlikely that CS2 inhibited streptomycete growth because the streptomycetes were inhibited by A. julibrissin (which does not emit CS2), and little relationship was observed between the inhibition of streptomycete growth in assemblies with M. pudica plants and in assemblies with CS2. It is likely that other compounds on the rhizoplane and in the rhizosphere of M. pudica and A. julibrissin are responsible for the inhibition of streptomycete growth.","UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT BOT, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA","HARTEL, PG (reprint author), UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT AGRON, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,43,16,16,0,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Ten of the 15 isolates belonged to a same serogroup as indicated by their cross-reactivity with antisera raised against R. loti strain B816.

One isolate harboured two megaplasmids and no plasmids could be detected in three other isolates. No hybridization to any of the identified plasmids was detected when R. meliloti nif D DNA was used as nif probe.

Root growth potentials of all three stock types remained above threshold values established for transplants throughout winter.

We also examined how host tree gender and environmental stress might be involved in this interaction. Four major patterns were observed. First, the mycorrhizal levels of trees of both sexes were negatively correlated with mistletoe density. In comparisons of heavily and lightly infested trees at the stressful site, high mistletoe levels were associated with 27% less mycorrhizae on male trees and 38% less mycorrhizae on the roots of female trees. Second, the reduction of mycorrhizae on trees with high mistletoe levels was slightly but significantly greater for female trees than male trees. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that severe mistletoe infestation suppresses mycorrhizae and that this suppression is more severe in female trees because of their greater energetic investment in reproduction. Third, female junipers growing in the stressful ash and cinder fields averaged three-fold higher levels of mistletoe infestation than male trees. Fourth, no differences in mistletoe infestation were observed between male and female trees growing in the more favorable soils. Comparisons with other systems suggest that both mistletoes and herbivores have similar interactions with mycorrhizae.",,"GEHRING, CA (reprint author), NO ARIZONA UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, FLAGSTAFF, AZ 86011 USA.",,,,,,,59,63,66,1,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,1992,89,2,,,,,298,303,,10.1007/BF00317231,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC112,WOS:A1992HC11200020,28312886,,,,10/31/19J,"VEJSADOVA, H; SIBLIKOVA, D; HRSELOVA, H; VANCURA, V",,,,"VEJSADOVA, H; SIBLIKOVA, D; HRSELOVA, H; VANCURA, V",,,EFFECT OF THE VAM FUNGUS GLOMUS SP ON THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF SOYBEAN INOCULATED WITH BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; DRY MATTER YIELD; GLOMUS SP; GLYCINE-MAX; NITROGEN FIXATION; NODULE MASS; ROOT INFECTION,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; RHIZOBIUM SYMBIOSIS; COLONIZATION; NODULATION; FIXATION; ROOTS,"The effect of two Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains (D344 and Urbana), on the frequency and intensity of infection by a VAM fungal Glomus sp. and the effect of VAM on biomass production by nodulating plants were tested in soybean growing in a soil containing low levels of accessible P and N. During the initial stage of vegetative growth, mycorrhiza frequency in roots inoculated with the two rhizobial strains did not differ. However, during flowering it was 178% higher in roots with the strain D344 than in the presence of the strain Ubrana. At final harvest (green pods) the VAM frequency did not differ in the presence of either strain. VAM positively affected biomass production, foliar concentrations of P, Zn and Cu, and number and dry matter yield of pods, but did not increase concentrations of total N and K. In nonmycorrhizal plants total nitrogenase activity (not nodule mass) and growth were higher with the rhizobial strain Urbana. The greatest nitrogenase activity, growth and yield occurred in the presence of the VAM fungus, and did not differ for plants with different strains of rhizobia.","RES INST CROP PROD, CS-16000 PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC","VEJSADOVA, H (reprint author), CZECHOSLOVAK ACAD SCI, INST MICROBIOL, VIDENSKA 1083, CS-14220 PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC.",,"Hrselova, Hana/H-6340-2014","Hrselova, Hana/0000-0003-3546-2718",,,,16,18,19,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1992,140,1,,,,,121,125,,10.1007/BF00012813,,,5,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HL497,WOS:A1992HL49700013,,,,,10/31/19J,"TARDIEU, F; BRUCKLER, L; LAFOLIE, F",,,,"TARDIEU, F; BRUCKLER, L; LAFOLIE, F",,,ROOT CLUMPING MAY AFFECT THE ROOT WATER POTENTIAL AND THE RESISTANCE TO SOIL-ROOT WATER TRANSPORT,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MODELING; ROOT SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT; ROOT-TO-SHOOT COMMUNICATION; SOIL RESISTANCE; WATER TRANSPORT,SPATIAL VARIABILITY; WHEEL COMPACTION; PLANT-ROOTS; DENSITY; EXTRACTION,"We have appraised for clumped root systems the widely-accepted view that the resistance to water flux from soil to roots ('soil resistance') is low under most field conditions, so that root water potential would closely follow the mean soil water potential. Three root spatial arrangements were studied, simulating either the regular pattern generally assumed in models, or two degrees of root clumping frequently observed in the field. We used a numerical 2-dimensional model of water transfer which assumes a control of evapotranspiration by root signalling. Calculations were carried out at two evaporative demands and for two contrasting soil hydraulic properties. The rate of soil depletion, the timing of the reduction in evapotranspiration and the difference between root water potential and mean soil water potential were all affected by the root spatial arrangement, with a greater effect at high evaporative demand and low soil hydraulic conductivity. Almost all the soil water reserve was available to plants without reduction in evapotranspiration in the regular case, while only a part of it was available in clumped cases. In the regular case, calculated 'soil resistances' were similar to those calculated using Newman's (1969) method. Conversely they were higher by up to two orders of magnitude in clumped root spatial arrangements. These results place doubt on the generality of the view that 'soil resistance' is low under common field conditions. They are consistent with the results of field experiments, especially with recent data dealing with root-to-shoot communication.","INRA,SCI SOL STN,F-84143 MONTFAVET,FRANCE","TARDIEU, F (reprint author), INRA,AGRON LAB,F-78850 THIVERVAL GRIGNON,FRANCE.",,"Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012",,,,,34,87,88,0,21,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,1992,140,2,,,,,291,301,,10.1007/BF00010606,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,HM818,WOS:A1992HM81800014,,,,,10/31/19B,"NOYD, RK; PFLEGER, FL; STEWART, EL",,,AMER SOC SURFACE MIN & RECLAMAT,"NOYD, RK; PFLEGER, FL; STEWART, EL",,,NATIVE PLANTS AND VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN RECLAMATION OF COARSE IRON-MINE TAILINGS IN MINNESOTA,ACHIEVING LAND USE POTENTIAL THROUGH RECLAMATION,,,English,Proceedings Paper,"9TH ANNUAL NATIONAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN SOC FOR SURFACE, MINING AND RECLAMATION : ACHIEVING LAND USE POTENTIAL THROUGH RECLAMATION","JUN 14-18, 1992","DULUTH, MN",,,RECLAMATION; VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR FUNGI; NATIVE PLANTS; COARSE IRON MINE TAILINGS,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC SURFACE MINING & RECLAMATION,PRINCETON,PRINCETON,,,,,,,1992,,,,,,,361,369,,,,,9,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BX48D,WOS:A1992BX48D00036,,,,,10/31/19J,"PRIN, Y; KODJA, H; DUHOUX, E; DIEM, HG; ROEDERER, Y; DOMMERGUES, YR",,,,"PRIN, Y; KODJA, H; DUHOUX, E; DIEM, HG; ROEDERER, Y; DOMMERGUES, YR",,,AERIAL NODULATION IN CASUARINA SPP - FIELD SURVEY AND PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL-DATA,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ADVENTITIOUS ROOT; AERIAL NODULE; FRANKIA; CASUARINA; LA-REUNION; MYCORRHIZAE; NITROGEN FIXATION; NODULE-HARBORING PROTUBERANCE; RHYTIDOME; STEM NODULE,LEGUME SESBANIA-ROSTRATA; STEM NODULES; TROPICAL LEGUME; AESCHYNOMENE; AZORHIZOBIUM; FIXATION,"Following previous field studies on the aerial nodules (nodule-harboring protuberances) that develop spontaneously on the trunk of 40-50-year-old Casuarina cunninghamiana in La Reunion Island, an experimental study was carried out in a glasshouse and in vitro to mimic the formation of the aerial nodules. In the glasshouse, adventitious roots were produced on the stem of 1-year-old C. cunninghamiana and C. equisetifolia by keeping the stem moist and were inoculated with crushed aerial nodules from the field. Within 1 month, the adventitious roots of C. cunninghamiana nodulated profusely (ca. 30 nodules per stem), whereas those of C. equisetifolia did not nodulate at all. In vitro 90% of the axenically grown C. cunninghamiana plantlets formed 2.5 adventitious roots per stem under the best treatment, comprising addition of IBA. Both Casuarina spp. axenically grown in vitro formed aerial nodules when inoculated with a pure culture of Frankia ORS 021001, but only one third of the plants nodulated. The experimental data confirm the conclusion of the field study that several favorable factors must act together to induce the formation of aerial N2-fixing nodules on Casuarina. Further study is needed on the role of the rhytidomal microflora (including mycorrhizal fungi) in the induction of aerial nodules, and the ecology, physiology and genetics of the Frankia strain of La Reunion.","CIRAD, CTFT, F-97410 ST PIERRE, Reunion, FRANCE; IRAT, OFF NATL FORETS, F-97410 ST PIERRE, Reunion, FRANCE","PRIN, Y (reprint author), BSFT, ORSTOM, CIRAD, CTFT, 45 BIS AVE BELLE GABRIELLE, F-94736 NOGENT SUR MARNE, FRANCE.",,,,,,,23,3,3,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1146-609X,1873-6238,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

Roots and shoots were harvested after the fourth growing season. Response surfaces for root, shoot, and total biomass per tree were generated within the matrix. Regression analysis quantified the effect of each species' density on biomass components. Alder overtopped the Douglas-fir in all mixed stands. Alder density influenced the root and shoot biomass of both species more than Douglas-fir density. Douglas-fir density interacted with red alder density to influence all biomass components. While increasing the density of each species reduced root and shoot biomass per tree, allocation of biomass to roots and shoot was not affected by competition, nor were the allometric equations relating biomass to stem diameter and stem volume index.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT FOREST SCI,CORVALLIS,OR 97331","SHAINSKY, LJ (reprint author), US FOREST SERV,FOREST SCI LAB,PACIFIC NW RES STN,POB 3890,PORTLAND,OR 97208, USA.",,,,,,,38,9,10,0,8,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The purpose of this study was to determine if subsoiling increased the depth of leaching of the nonreactive Br- anion in a Norfolk soil (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudult) having a tillage-induced pan. Three tillage treatments, replicated three times, were selected: (i) current-year subsoiling (S88); (ii) one-year subsoiling carry-over (subsoiled in 1987: S87); and (iii) double disk tillage (DD). Mechanical impedance was measured at 35 d after tillage with a recording cone penetrometer to a depth of 60 cm on transects normal to the soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) row. Cone index exceeded 3000 kPa for the DD treatment at the 20- to 45-cm depth; current-year subsoiling reduced cone index at that depth to 1300 to 2500 kPa. Six days after planting soybean, KBr was uniformly broadcast on the soil surface at the rate of 280 kg Br-/ha. Soil samples were taken after the plots received 130, 260, 545, and 1217 mm of cumulative rain and/or irrigation (28, 64, 128 and 351 d, respectively, after applying KBr). Soil samples were collected using a hydraulic probe at seven positions on duplicate transects normal to the soybean row in each plot. Bromide concentration measured with a specific-ion electrode was highly variable at all depths. For the four consecutive sampling dates, the center of Br- mass occurred at the 11-, 17-, 51-, and 90-cm depths, respectively, for Treatment DD; at the 19-, 27-, 71-, and 1002-cm depths for Treatment S88; and at the 13-, 20-, 57-, and 108-cm depths for Treatment S87. Both subsoil treatments loosened the soil and increased the depth of Br- transport. Although the depth of Br- transport was slightly deeper for the subsoiled treatments, it leached below the rooting depth for all treatments. No definitive relationship between cone index and Br- leaching depth was observed.","N CAROLINA STATE UNIV,DEPT SOIL SCI,POB 7619,RALEIGH,NC 27695",,,"Agus, Fahmuddin/C-9703-2013","Agus, Fahmuddin/0000-0003-2369-5725",,,,14,10,12,0,4,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Leaf and root biomass were labeled by injection of N-15 directly into the vessel elements of hybrid Populus trees during their second growing season. The N-15 was uniformly distributed throughout the canopy and root system. The rate and amount of N-15 turnover from plant tissue can be determined by pool transfer or through differences in plant N-15 concentrations. The N-15 was detected in the dead-root pool 8 wk after injection, indicating root turnover.

The root systems of 32 single-stemmed holm oaks growing in shallow soils on largely unfissured bedrock were excavated in a mesic site and a xeric site in the Montseny Mountains (northeast Spain). Individual root:shoot biomass ratios (roots with diameter < 1 cm not included) of single-stemmed trees were significantly higher in the xeric site (mean 0.45) than in the mesic site (mean 0.37), probably reflecting the lower water availability and higher light availability in the xeric site. It is concluded that single-stemmed holm oaks have higher root:shoot ratios than most temperate forest trees, particularly so when growing on a xeric site. Root:shoot ratios of single-stemmed trees were not linearly correlated with dbh. Allometric regressions of root biomass on dbh did significantly differ between sites. Roots < 1 cm in diameter were sampled with soil cores in the mesic site. Holm oaks greater-than-or-equal-to 5 cm dbh in a stand dominated by single-stemmed trees on the mesic site had an aboveground biomass of 160 t/ha and a belowground biomass of 63 t/ha. The belowground biomass was composed of 30 t/ha of root crowns plus roots > 5 cm in diameter, 17 t/ha of roots 1-5 cm in diameter, and 16 t/ha of roots < 1 cm in diameter. The xeric stand was dominated by multistemmed holm oaks with massive root crowns developed after repeated coppicing. Three multistemmed trees were excavated, yielding a mean root:shoot ratio of 1.2.

(4) Most measures of size decreased for Tsuga as canopy cover increased; for Abies, only the amount of root branching declined. As litter increased, root dimensions of both genera declined, but biomass of Tsuga increased whereas that of Abies decreased. Abies seemed less affected by both shade and limited soil moisture than Tsuga. (5) Seedling growth rate and allocation appear to be important in deter-mining the types of micro-environments in which the two genera can establish, and thus may affect long-term stand dynamics.

Study species occupied different positions along the gradient and had a variety of growth forms, including basal rosettes, creeping graminoids, and stemmed, leafy dicots. Plasticity was measured in plants grown singly along an experimental gradient of soil organic matter content for one growing season. The degree of plasticity exhibited by a species was not significantly related to its competitive ability measured in a diallel experiment. Nor was plasticity related to position on the environmental gradient, although species of sandy soils tended to be more plastic than those of organic soils. Plasticity was significantly greater in monocots than dicots, and species differed in characters displaying plasticity along the experimental gradient. All four rosette species responded to increased soil organic matter by increasing leaf mass while holding ramet number constant, whereas other species increased ramet number. Species also differed in the direction of plastic response: root: shoot ratios had positive, negative, quadratic or non-significant relationships to the experimental gradient depending on the species considered.

Small roots of alder had the highest initial concentrations of nitrogen and lignin, and lost 9 and 10% less mass than medium and large roots, respectively. Large roots of poplar had the highest lignin-to-nitrogen ratio and showed the smallest loss of mass over the total incubation period. Slow root decomposition of black alder and hybrid poplar was characterized by a greater proportion of initial root nitrogen immobilized per unit of carbon respired. Lignin concentration in roots of alder and poplar increased rapidly at the beginning of the incubation. Our results suggest that high levels of nitrogen in roots of alder could contribute in slowing the rate of decomposition by allowing the formation of nitrogen-lignin derivatives and low levels of nitrogen in roots of poplar may limit the growth of microorganisms and the rate of root decomposition. A multiple regression was developed using initial nitrogen, lignin concentration and the ratio of lignin to nitrogen to produce an index of the rate of root decomposition.

Almost all chemical, physical, and morphological parameters have changed, resulting in most cases in an enhanced potential productivity, accompanied by a complex disturbance regime. Historical reconstruction of the change in river vegetation is presented to compare the frequency of macrophyte species 40 years ago with the situation of today. For a total of 289 sampling sites, the floristic change was exactly reconstructed. Nearly all species show a decline in frequency. This trend is also recognizable in Potamogeton, with the exception of two narrow-leaved species. An attempt is made to explain both decline and maintenance in terms of life history characters (vital attributes) allowing the species to react to the changing habitat conditions. The successful species are characterized by certain life history characteristics which enable them to survive under the current disturbance regime. Most important aspects of life history are the ability to reproduce by means of turions and other fragments, a long-lived, deep-rooting rhizome system, phenotypic plasticity of above-ground parts, synchronous shoot polymorphism, and the potential to regenerate quickly from remaining buds after disturbance. The decline of formerly frequent species can be attributed mainly to the lack of certain key characters; however, physiological characters also may be important. The extirpation of some rare species could also be caused by random fluctuations in small populations. The general importance of population ecological research, particularly demography, life history theory, and the modelling of clonal populations in conservation ecology is stressed.","INST APPL BIOL LANDSCAPE ECOL & LANDSCAPE PLANNING,W-2900 OLDENBURG,GERMANY","WIEGLEB, G (reprint author), UNIV OLDENBURG,FACHBEREICH BIOL,POB 2503,W-2900 OLDENBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,,,74,27,30,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,DEC,1991,97,2,,,,,161,172,,10.1007/BF00035389,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HP978,WOS:A1991HP97800007,,,,,10/31/19J,"GREGER, M; KAUTSKY, L",,,,"GREGER, M; KAUTSKY, L",,,"EFFECTS OF CU, PB AND ZN ON 2 POTAMOGETON SPECIES GROWN UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS",VEGETATIO,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,SYMP ON ECOLOGY OF SUBMERSED AND FLOATING-LEAVED AQUATIC VEGETATION ( SYMP SI-6-05 ) AT THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ECOLOGY,"AUG 23-30, 1990","YOKOHAMA, JAPAN",,,BIOACCUMULATION; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; HEAVY METALS; MACROPHYTES; POTAMOGETON; SEDIMENT,TISSUE NITROGEN CONCENTRATION; FRESH-WATER MACROPHYTES; MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM; CADMIUM UPTAKE; HEAVY-METALS; LAKE WINGRA; SEDIMENT; PLANTS; ZINC; LEAD,"Two common macrophyte species, Potamogeton perfoliatus L. and Potamogeton pectinatus L. were grown for 12 weeks at shallow depths in sediments contaminated with 1250 or 2500-mu-g Pb or Cu and/or Zn (gDW sediment)-1. Control experiments were run at background levels of 4, 13, and 38-mu-g Pb, Cu and Zn (gDW sediment)-1, respectively. Effects of heavy metals on biomass production and metal uptake and distribution in plants are presented in relation to total amount and plant-available fraction of metals in the sediment. All three studied metals gave reduced biomass production, and the toxicity of the metals decreased in the order Zn > Cu > Pb. The root/shoot biomass ratio increased for P. pectinatus, but decreased for P. perfoliatus with metal treatment. The content of any single metal was higher in shoots than in roots of plants grown on sediments not contaminated with that specific metal, but addition of that metal increased the proportion in roots. The uptake by plants of any of the heavy metals increased with increased metal addition. The magnitude of the plant-available fraction of metals of untreated sediment was Zn > Cu > Pb, and increased in contaminated sediments. Addition of Cu decreased both the plant-available fraction and the total concentration of Zn in the sediment, while increased the uptake of Zn by the plants. The opposite was found for Cu when Zn was added. P. pectinatus accumulated about twice as much Cu as P. perfoliatus. On the other hand, the concentration of Pb was higher in P. perfoliatus than in P. pectinatus, and was negligible in P. pectinatus when cultivated in untreated sediments.","UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT BOT,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN",,,,,,,,38,10,11,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,DEC,1991,97,2,,,,,173,184,,10.1007/BF00035390,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HP978,WOS:A1991HP97800008,,,,,10/31/19J,"SCHONHAR, S",,,,"SCHONHAR, S",,,INVESTIGATIONS OF THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIES OF FUNGAL GENUS TRICHODERMA IN SOILS OF DIFFERENT FOREST SITES,ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG,,,German,Article,,,,,,,,Soils with different degrees of acidity were examined under Picea abies as well as under Fagus sylvatica stocking for the occurrence of species of Trichoderma.

The distribution of soluble ions in the profiles indicated that the ash layer had negligible impact on the height of capillary rise.

Yet they are essential in order to assess belowground effects of forest-management activities. This study used the soil core-break method to measure the number of roots crossing a horizontal unit area (N, expressed in no. cm-2) as an alternative to measuring the more time consuming root-length density (Lv, expressed as cm root length cm-3 soil volume). Soil core samples were taken from the surface horizon of a 7-yr-old slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) stand growing on a Pomona sand (sandy, silliceous, hyperthermic Ultic Hapiaquod). Soil cores, 15.2-cm diameter by 30 cm long, were extracted from two microsite locations within the check and complete-weed-control plots. Root-length density and roots per square centimeter were measured at 2-cm depth increments. The roots-per-square centimeter measure was a useful predictor of root-length density only when treatment means were used, and even then the data did not fit the theoretical relationship of Lv = 2N. An Lv/N slope of = 1 suggested that roots have a preferential vertical orientation in the A horizon. However, depth trends of root-length density and roots per square centimeter were similar regardless of management practices or microsite. Roots measured as roots per square centimeter was also a less variable measure of root quantity than was root-length density. Although roots per square centimeter can only be used to calculate root-length density on an empirical basis, the more easily obtained value of roots per square centimeter can be used to depict root response to belowground competition.","US FOREST SERV,DEP SOIL SCI,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611; US FOREST SERV,SE FOR EXP STN,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611; UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT SOIL SCI,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",,,,,,,,12,22,22,0,7,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Prolonged soil wetness or dryness during the growing season caused reductions in fine-root-biomass concentrations.

The effect of these factors on Zn uptake by a single plant root was simulated mathematically by Bar-Yosef et al. (1980). The objective of this paper was to validate this simulation model and evaluate the relative importance of soil chemical properties, the stability of Zn complexes and the soil pH in determining Zn transport in soil and absorption by plant roots. To avoid problems of soil and plant variability, an artificial root, namely a ceramic tube through which solutions of known composition flowed, was used. The soil was a montmorillonite-sand mixture of known Zn adsorption characteristics. The model satisfactorily described the decline in net Zn influx into the root (F(Zn)) as soil pH increased or as total Zn in soil (Q(Zn)) decreased, and also described F(Zn) as a function of time. Addition of fulvic acid (FA) to the soil decreased F(Zn). The decreased uptake rate stemmed from the lower permeability of the root to the large Zn-FA molecule. When the pH of the solution that flowed inside the tube was decreased from 5.0 to 2.0, thus generating a greater efflux of H+ by the roots, F(Zn) increased four- to sixfold, depending on the time. The model satisfactorily described the decline in F(Zn) as the clay fraction in the soil increased, while maintaining the same quantity of Zn per volume of soil.","HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM, IL-76100 REHOVOT, ISRAEL","BAR-TAL, A (reprint author), VOLCANI CTR, IL-50250 BET DAGAN, ISRAEL.",,"Bar-Tal, Asher/A-8144-2012",,,,,27,8,8,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4588,,,J SOIL SCI,,SEP,1991,42,3,,,,,399,411,,10.1111/j.1365-2389.1991.tb00418.x,,,13,Soil Science,Agriculture,GK897,WOS:A1991GK89700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"DARRAH, PR",,,,"DARRAH, PR",,,MEASURING THE DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT OF RHIZOSPHERE EXUDATES IN SOIL .1.

Analyses of variance and detrended correspondence analysis showed that the relative magnitude of the effects of these factors upon the composition of the ectomycorrhizal community on seedlings planted out was site > time of out-planting > forest/clearcut > age of clearcut > time of soil scarification. In general, clear-cutting had a minor effect, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Nineteen different mycorrhizal types were recorded. After two seasons, seedlings hosted an average of 1.8 indigenous mycorrhizal types and 0.95 nursery mycorrhizal types comprising 35% and 65% of the mycorrhizal roots, respectively. Piloderma croceum colonized seedlings significantly more frequently in forests than in clearcuts, whereas the reverse was found for Cenococcum geophilum, and two other mycorrhizal types.

In Gliricidia and Leucaena, both mycorrhizal inoculations stimulated greater plant growth, P and N uptake compared to their non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants under both watering regimes. However, in Acacia and Albizia, these parameters were only stimulated by either ectomycorrhiza (Acacia) or VA mycorrhiza (Albizia). Growth reduction occurred as a result of inoculation with the other type of mycorrhiza. This was attributed to competition for carbon between Acacia and VA mycorrhizas and parasitic association between Albizia and ectomycorrhiza. Drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Leucaena, and drought-stressed mycorrhizal Acacia tolerated lower xylem pressure potentials and larger water losses than the drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Albizia and Gliricidia. These latter plants avoided drought by maintaining higher xylem pressure potentials and leaf relative water content (RWC). All the four leguminous plants were mycorrhizal dependent. The higher the mycorrhizal dependency (MD), the lower the drought tolerance expressed in terms of drought response index (DRI). The DRI may be a useful determinant of MD, as they are inversely related.","INT INST TROP AGR,IBADAN,NIGERIA; UNIV IBADAN,DEPT FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,IBADAN,NIGERIA","OSONUBI, O (reprint author), UNIV IBADAN,DEPT BOT & MICROBIOL,IBADAN,NIGERIA.",,,,,,,50,49,52,0,22,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,1991,136,1,,,,,131,143,,10.1007/BF02465228,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,GA709,WOS:A1991GA70900015,,,,,10/31/19J,"ANDERSEN, CP; HOGSETT, WE; WESSLING, R; PLOCHER, M",,,,"ANDERSEN, CP; HOGSETT, WE; WESSLING, R; PLOCHER, M",,,OZONE DECREASES SPRING ROOT-GROWTH AND ROOT CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT IN PONDEROSA PINE THE YEAR FOLLOWING EXPOSURE,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE,,,English,Note,,,,,,,SULFUR-DIOXIDE; SEEDLINGS,"Storage carbohydrates are extremely important for new shoot and root development following dormancy or during periods of high stress. The hypothesis that ozone decreases carbohydrate storage and decreases new root growth during the year following exposure was investigated. Ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) exposed to ozone in 1989 were harvested prior to shoot elongation (nongrowing seedlings) and following a root growth test (growing seedlings) in the spring of 1990 to evaluate starch and soluble sugar concentrations. Seedlings exposed to the highest ozone level had 34% less lateral root biomass and 65% less new root biomass the following spring. Exposure to 122 and 169 ppm-h (sum of hourly means, 24 h/day, over the exposure period) during the 1989 growing season resulted in significant decreases of carbohydrate pools examined in both nongrowing and growing seedlings the following spring. Starch concentrations were most affected: at the highest ozone level, there were decreases of 43 and 44% in coarse and fine roots, respectively, of nongrowing seedlings, and 50, 65, and 62% in coarse, fine, and new roots, respectively, of growing seedlings. The results suggest that (i) ponderosa pine seedlings exposed to 122 and 169 ppm-h ozone for one season have significantly less root starch reserves available just prior to and during bud break the following year and (ii) spring root growth is decreased following ozone exposure. The carry-over effects of ozone stress may be important in long-lived perennial species that are annually subjected to ozone.","NORTHROP SERV INC,TECHNOL SERV,CORVALLIS,OR 97333","ANDERSEN, CP (reprint author), US EPA,ENVIRONM RES LAB,200 SW 35TH ST,CORVALLIS,OR 97333, USA.",,,,,,,18,47,48,0,0,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The starch concentration in fine roots of seedlings grown under periodic drought did not increase with age; in contrast, the starch concentration in fine roots of well-watered seedlings continued to increase for at least 70 days.

Symbionts were identified and their respective colonization abilities were determined. Eight species of symbiotic fungi, which may have originated in adjacent coniferous forests, were observed on the root systems. Mycorrhizal diversity differed between inoculated (5 taxa) and control (8 taxa) seedlings. Ectomycorrhizal fungi which occurred naturally in the nursery on control seedlings (Thelephora terrestris and Suillus sp.) did not survive after outplanting. Both inoculated and naturally occurring Laccaria species, as well as Cenococcum geophilum, survived on the old roots and colonized the newly formed roots, limiting the colonization by other naturally occurring fungi. Other fungi, such as Paxillus involutus, Scleroderma citrinum and Hebeloma sp. preferentially colonized the old roots near the seedling's collar. Russulaceae were found mainly in the middle section of the root system. Mycorrhizal colonization by Laccaria species on inoculated seedlings (54%) was significantly greater than on controls (13%) which were consequently dominated by the native fungi. Significant differences (up to 239%) were found in the growth of inoculated seedlings, especially in root and shoot weight, which developed mainly during the second year after outplanting. Seedling growth varied with the species of mycorrhizae and with the degree of root colonization.

Order of branching of roots associated with the first foliar node was greater in cheatgrass than in Hycrest or Whitmar at all water applications and dates. Length of the primary root, length of the second group of seminal roots, and length of the first group of adventitious roots were similar in cheatgrass and Hycrest. Root branching for the 3 species decreased as less water was applied, except for cheatgrass irrigated with 5 ml/day. The ability of cheatgrass seedlings to grow with little water was related to their greater order of branching of seminal roots, branching density on the main axis, and length of lateral roots and external-external links. The greater root branching densities, lateral root lengths, and external-external link lengths enabled Hycrest seedlings to grow better than Whitmar seedlings with little water.

An important factor affected by the interaction between applied lime (soil acidity), applied P, and VAMF inoculation was the soil Al. Five application rates of P as KH2PO4 and three rates of lime were tested. Potassium was equalized with KCl (muriate of potash). P-efficiency (g seed/mg P kg-1 soil) by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) was maximal at 20 mg P kg-1 soil at all lime and VAMF treatments. VAMF inoculation increased plant survival and protected the soybeans from leaf scorch, thereby substituting for the effects of lime and P. The Ge inoculum was superior in ameliorating leaf scorch in the nonlimed soil. The Gf inoculum required more lime and P than the Ge inoculum to increase seed yield relative to the noninoculated controls containing only native VAMF. Both inocula increased root Al uptake and extractable soil Al in the acid soil without apparent adverse effects on root or shoot. The ability of the VAMF inocula to enhance the efficiency of applied P and decrease seed Cl concentration was increased by lime. Seed yield (Y) was negatively related to seed Cl concentration (X) where Y = aX-b.

Rhizobial strains were classified by their growth response at an optical density (OD) of 704 mM; Groups One and Two did not exceed 0.10 and 0.33, respectively. Forty three different rhizobial strains were identified as salt-sensitive and 49 as salt-tolerant at 704 mM NaCl. None grew in a saline solution of 792 mM NaCl. The second set of experiments investigated the drought tolerance of R. meliloti accessions that exhibited differential salt tolerance. Fifteen salt-sensitive and 15 salt-tolerant strains of R. meliloti from the first experiment were exposed to simulated drought stress by adding polyethylene glycol 6,000 (PEG-6,000) to the YEM medium at concentrations of 0, -0.4, -0.8 or -1.0 MPa. Rhizobium strains were incubated for 10 days at 25-degrees-C and growth turbidity was measured at 420 nm. Growth turbidity of the 30 accessions ranged from 100% at -0.4 MPa to 0% at -1.0 MPa. With one exception, strains that were more drought-tolerant (at -1.0 MPa) were also more salt-tolerant (616 mM). However, some of the more salt-tolerant strains at 616 mM were not the more drought-tolerant stains at -1.0 MPa. These salt- and drought-tolerant Rhizobium accessions are excellent models to study the mechanism(s) of such resistance, and to elucidate the role of genetics of NaCl and drought tolerance.","UNIV ISFAHAN, INST HORT, ESFAHAN, IRAN; UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANTS SOILS & BIOMETEOROL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA; USDA, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA","MOHAMMAD, RM (reprint author), WAYNE STATE UNIV, LANDE BLDG 317, 550 E CANFIELD, DETROIT, MI 48201 USA.",,,,,,,36,32,36,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,1991,134,2,,,,,271,276,,10.1007/BF00012045,,,6,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FX934,WOS:A1991FX93400009,,,,,10/31/19J,"RASTETTER, EB; RYAN, MG; SHAVER, GR; MELILLO, JM; NADELHOFFER, KJ; HOBBIE, JE; ABER, JD",,,,"RASTETTER, EB; RYAN, MG; SHAVER, GR; MELILLO, JM; NADELHOFFER, KJ; HOBBIE, JE; ABER, JD",,,"A GENERAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE RESPONSES OF THE C-CYCLE AND N-CYCLE IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS TO CHANGES IN CO2, CLIMATE, AND N-DEPOSITION",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A model that simulates carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in terrestrial ecosystems is developed.

The model is a highly aggregated, process-based, biogeochemical model designed to examine changes in the fluxes and allocation of C and N among foliage, fine roots, stems, and soils in response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature, soil water, irradiance, and inorganic nitrogen inputs. We use the model to explore how changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and N inputs affect carbon storage in two ecosystems: arctic tundra and temperate hardwood forest. The qualitative responses of the two ecosystems were similar.

Nitrogen cycling is closely linked with the carbon (C) and water cycles. Thus models of N cycling must include aspects of these other cycles. Although much is known about individual processes, development of a generic model of forest N cycling is not possible at present because the links and interactions among the individual processes are not well understood. The weakest links with respect to the N cycle are: quantification of atmospheric (especially dry) deposition rates in polluted environments, controls on C and N allocation in vegetation, controls on N turnover in fine roots, controls on decomposition of the older components of soil organic matter, and feedbacks among N availability, litter ""quality"" and subsequent N mineralization rates. To examine possible effects of long-term change in climate or atmospheric chemistry on the storage of C and other elements in forest ecosystems, we need to model in detail the effects of these factors on complex soil processes such as organic matter decomposition.

All trees sampled showed > 60% ectomycorrhizal tips (average, 89%, sd = 0.17). All mycorrhizae were monopodial. Three morphotypes predominated at both sites. Cenococcum geophilum Fr. colonized over 92% of the sampled trees and accounted for an average of 36% of ectomycorrhizal tips per tree. Ninety percent of trees had plump, pallid mycorrhizae with a smooth mantle, which ranged in color from beige to reddish brown. All wetland trees, but only 40% of the mesic trees, exhibited mycorrhizae with a diffuse network of extramatrical hyphae and a sheathed white tip. Other morphotypes were present in 15-20% of trees. These minor morphotypes were more abundant and more diverse on trees with low levels of colonization by C. geophilum and the white-tip morphotype. There was more variation in level and type of colonization between trees than within individual trees.","DREW UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MADISON,NJ 07940","GLENN, MG (reprint author), SETON HALL UNIV,DEPT BIOL,S ORANGE,NJ 07079, USA.",,,,,,,36,17,17,0,7,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Large differences in growth at the low P level, and in growth response to the higher P rate occurred among L. leucocephala isolines and G. sepium provenances. Shoot dry weight at low P varied from 1.30 to 3.01 g plant-1 for L. leucocephala and from 1.44 to 3.07 g plant-1 for G. sepium. Leucaena isolines had only half the root weight of G. sepium provenances yet produced approximately 90% of the shoot weight of the corresponding G. sepium treatments, i.e. more than a 2-fold difference in root/shoot ratios. Total P in shoots of G. sepium was some 85% greater than of the respective L. leucocephala isolines in corresponding treatments. Physiological phosphate use efficiency (g shoot/mg P in shoots) (PPUE) was not a simple reciprocal relation, being markedly lower at higher shoot % P and content. However, for the same shoot P both species produced the same shoot weight. Nevertheless, there were apparent genotypic differences within species in the root development, shoot P and PPUE. In another study, the numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of L. leucocephala, nodulation, N2 fixation at five different levels of P were determined. The numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of inoculated L. leucocephala during the first two weeks were lower when P was added but later became similar to those without added P. Nodules formed earlier than inoculated plants fertilized with P and in greater numbers (4- to 5-fold) and dry weights than in those without P. However, the percentage of N2 derived from fixation did not change with increasing levels of P application. These results suggest that the observed P effect did not operate via stimulated growth of rhizobia in the rhizosphere, nor through increased N2 fixation rate. The major effect appeared to be due to effects via plant growth.","INT ATOM ENERGY AGCY,SOIL FERTIL IRRIGAT & CROP PROD SECT,POB 100,A-1400 VIENNA,AUSTRIA; INT ATOM ENERGY AGCY,SOIL SCI UNIT,A-1400 VIENNA,AUSTRIA",,,,,,,,21,28,28,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,1991,133,2,,,,,201,208,,10.1007/BF00009192,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FP507,WOS:A1991FP50700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"GRIFFIN, DH; SCHAEDLE, M; MANION, PD; DEVIT, M",,,,"GRIFFIN, DH; SCHAEDLE, M; MANION, PD; DEVIT, M",,,"CLONAL VARIATION IN AMINO-ACID CONTENTS OF ROOTS, STEMS, AND LEAVES OF ASPEN (POPULUS-TREMULOIDES MICHX) AS INFLUENCED BY DIURNAL DROUGHT STRESS",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Three aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) clones were grown hydroponically in growth chambers and subjected daily to 6 h of drought stress by exposing the roots to air.

Method: In a thinning experiment in Westerhof, between Gottingen and the Harz mountains, FR Germany, 3 plots were selected with different thinning intensity and mixture of tree species (tab. 1). Root sampling points were distributed regularly in a grid. Every tree in the stand, its diameter at breast height (from which the basal area of the tree is calculated) and the root sampling points were mapped in a system of horizontal co-ordinates. Thus, the distance of any tree from any root sampling point could be calculated. At every sampling point a soil core was extracted with an auger, but only outside a 2 m radius around the trunk. Subsequently the fine root biomass (smaller than 2 mm in diameter) was determined, classified by species. In the mixed stand beech and spruce roots were found in most of the samples. Rooting intensity is to be understood as the fine root biomass of one tree species in the complete soil core per area unit (mg dry matter/cm2). It should be noted, however, that in this paper quantitative assessments can only be made for the area outside the 2 m radius. 2. Modelling: To calculate the dependence of the rooting intensity on the structure of the stand at a given point, a modified logistic model is developed. For a single tree it is assumed that its rooting intensity depends mainly on the basal area of the tree and the distance between it and the sampling point, that is the borehole (model 2). The total rooting intensity at a sampling point is the sum of all individual contributions of the surrounding trees (fig. 2). Up to 14 trees were taken into account in model 3. By fitting model 3 to the rooting intensity values, the parameters for the logistic models can be estimated (A, B, C and D). For the first time it is possible to relate a certain amount of fine root biomass found in a soil core to single trees. As a result, the 4 models (1 each for spruce and beech in the mixed stand and 1 each for the 2 differently thinned pure spruce stands; fig. 3) are able to explain up to 84 % of the variation in rooting intensity (tab. 2). Even the influence of competition between the tree species on the rooting intensity can be assessed (fig. 6). For testing the models, 2 indices were calculated out of the 28 independent variables (basal area and distance of 14 trees). The indices are MAX (Grundflache) being the highest value of the basal area and MIN (Abstand) being the smallest distance of one of the trees considered. Both show no significant correlation with the residuals (tab. 3). 3. Application: By estimating the 4 parameters of the model, diagrams for single trees can be constructed that show the decrease of the rooting intensity with the increase of the distance (Fig. 4) and with the decrease of the basal area (fig. 5). A three-dimensional bell-shaped diagram is shown in figure 7. By integrating the volume of the bell (model 4) an assessment of the total fine root biomass of a tree can be achieved (tab. 4). For a 100 years old stand with its great spatial heterogenity of trees and their roots, the models make it possible to construct a three-dimensional map of the rooting intensity (fig. 8). Since the models explain a large portion of the roots spatial variation, the residuals rather than the measured values themselves should be used for the analysis of further parameters, e.g. soil chemistry. Since, for other reasons, no-soil cores were sampled closer than 2 m from the trees, all models and biomass estimations must be looked at with caution. Further experiments with sampling close to the stem should improve the models. The calculations expect the roots to be distributed rather symmetrically around trees. That must not be true in nature, especially on slopes and very heterogenic soils. As long as our models become not more sophisticated their use is restricted to even-aged stands in flat areas.",,"NIELSEN, CCN (reprint author), KONIGLICHEN VET & LANDWIRTSCHAFTLICHEN UNIV KOPENHAGEN,INST BOT DENDROL & FORSTGENET,ARBORETET,DK-2970 HORSHOLM,DENMARK.",,,,,,,0,26,26,0,7,SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",Feb-52,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

Franco was grown on an acid sandy soil (pH(H2O) = 3.87), fertilized with ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source (50 and 150 kg N.ha-1), and maintained at two soil water levels. At both nitrogen levels, ammonium uptake was much higher in the wet soil than in the dry soil, whereas nitrate uptake was not affected by soil water content. From calculation of the nitrogen supply at the root surface, it was concluded that P. menziesii preferentially took up ammonium. Under dry soil conditions, movement of ammonium in the soil was impeded, so that the ammonium preference could not manifest itself; thus a large part of the nitrogen absorbed was in the nitrate form. Proton excretion per unit organic nitrogen formed was greater in the wet soil than in the dry soil owing to a larger ammonium contribution to total nitrogen uptake. In all treatments, the rhizosphere at the root tip was more alkaline than the bulk soil, whereas along the older root zones, acidification of the rhizosphere occurred. The strongest alkalization at the root tip occurred in the dry soil. Analysis of the rhizosphere pH pattern with a simulation model on proton transport in the soil showed that the results could only be explained by a gradual transition from OH-excretion at the root tip to H+ excretion along the older root zones. Soil water content was an important factor in determining rhizosphere pH. By extrapolating the results to forest conditions, it was determined that rhizosphere acidification may occur when the nitrification rate is low and the soil is not too dry.",,"GIJSMAN, AJ (reprint author), INST SOIL FERTIL RES,POB 30003,9750 RA HAREN,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,39,24,24,0,11,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Mortality of P. ponderosa greater than 22 cm diameter at breast height was higher in burned areas (19.5%) than in unburned areas (6.6%), and early-season burns had over 30% mortality. Mortality was associated with fire severity, as measured by scorch height and ground char, season of burning, and tree vigor. Pines of high, moderate, and low vigor were subjected to a prescribed burn in June; half of the trees had debris raked from tree bases as an additional treatment. Lethal heat loads (> 60-degrees-C) occurred in > 75% of samples at the soil surface and at 5 cm soil depth, with duration exceeding 5 h. Burning reduced fine-root dry weight 50-75% 1 and 5 months after burning; raking and burning reduced fine-root dry weight more than burning alone after 1 month and had similar effects to burning after 5 months. A low-vigor tree that had been raked and burned died by the beginning of the fourth dry season after burning. Present fuel loads may be too high to burn during spring if old-growth P. ponderosa are to be protected.","UNIV WASHINGTON,COLL FOREST RESOURCES,AR-10,SEATTLE,WA 98195",,,,,,,,51,164,166,1,23,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

In the nif genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae there was no evidence for selection pressure in favor of highly translatable codons. However, in the nitrogen regulatory operon glnAntrBntrC of enteric bacteria the stoichiometrically high level of glutamine synthetase may be facilitated by the presence of efficiently translatable codons in glnA. The nif genes of the cyanobacterium Anabaena showed codon selection in favor of translational efficiency. Computation of codon adaptation indices for expression in heterologous systems indicated that the reading frames most suitable for expression of nif genes in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were present in azotobacters, clostridia, and cyanobacteria, respectively. In codon-usage-based cluster analysis, type 3 nitrogenase genes of Azotobacter vinelandii grouped along with the type 1 and type 2 genes. This is in contrast to the nucleotide sequence-based multiple alignment in which type 3 nitrogenase genes of A. vinelandii have been reported to cluster with entirely unrelated diazotrophs such as methanogens and clostridia. This may be indicative of lateral transfer of nif genes among widely divergent taxons. The chromosomal- and plasmid-located nif genes of rhizobia also cluster separately in nucleotide sequence-based analysis but showed similar codon usage. These analyses suggested that the phylogeny of nif genes drawn on the basis of nucleotide sequence homology was not masked by the taxon-specific pressure on codon usage.","BHABHA ATOM RES CTR,DIV MOLEC BIOL & AGR,BOMBAY 400085,INDIA",,,,,,,,29,5,7,1,2,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0022-2844,,,J MOL EVOL,J.

The naturally acidic soils in these ecosystems lead to high concentrations of aqueous Al in soil solutions and contribute to the biocycling of Al by the A. amabilis/T. mertensiana stand. Root concentrations of Al were very closely related to aqueous Al3+ activities, but poorly correlated with total aqueous Al concentrations. The solution Al/Ca molar ratios followed a seasonal cycle with low values during the fall and high values during the spring. Ratios remained < 1 throughout the Oa horizon while they varied between 2 and 14 in the E and Bhs horizons. The vertical distribution of roots and the mortality of fine roots may be linked to the soil solution Al/Ca ratio. Root cation exchange capacity ranged between 180 and 225-mu-mol g-1 and the exchangeable Al fraction represented from 12-17% of the total Al content in the root. Evidence for solid-phase co-precipitates of Al with PO4 and oxalate was indicated from selective dissolution of the root tissue. Sufficient quantities of PO4 and oxalate exists in the roots to tie up 20-40% of the Al present in the roots of the Oa and E horizons, but only 9% of that present in the Bhs horizon. Species differences in the distribution of Al between the above-ground and below-ground components may be dictated by these retention processes in the fine roots.","YALE UNIV,SCH FORESTRY & ENVIRONM STUDIES,NEW HAVEN,CT 06511; UNIV FIRENZE,DIPARTIMENTO SCI SUOLO,I-50144 FLORENCE,ITALY","DAHLGREN, RA (reprint author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT LAND AIR & WATER RESOURCES,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,45,38,44,1,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAY,1991,133,1,,,,,117,129,,10.1007/BF00011906,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,FK800,WOS:A1991FK80000015,,,,,10/31/19J,"KUBIKOVA, J",,,,"KUBIKOVA, J",,,FOREST DIEBACK IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA,VEGETATIO,,,English,Article,,,,,,AIR POLLUTION; FOREST DECLINE; ECOSYSTEM DISTURBANCE,STANDS,"The article reviews the literature dealing with levels of air pollution in Central Europe and Czechoslovakia particulary in connection with the rate of forest damage and dieback since the fifties.

Seven, 8 and 10 of the stands were < 20, 20-40 and > 40 years old, respectively: 6, 13 and 6 were located in the north, central and south of The Netherlands, the atmosphere in the north was the least polluted and that in the south the most polluted. Mycorhizal status was assessed on soil samples taken in November-December 1987. Numbers of mycorrhizal species producing fruitbodies, and the numbers of their fruitbodies, were inversely related to the ages of the different stands; 16 species in stands < 20 years old and 8 species in stands > 40 years old. There were averages of 12.5 species in the northern region and 6.0 in the south. Numbers of fruitbodies, when accumulated over 3 seasons, were positively correlated with numbers of mycorrhizas per unit volume of soil. This being so, it is suggested that numbers of fruitbodies may be a reliable index of numbers of mycorrhizas. There were fewer mycorrhizas per unit volume of soil in old than in young stands; numbers were larger in the less polluted northern region than in the southern region. However, while numbers and frequencies of mycorrhizas and numbers of species and of fruitbodies were consistently and inversely related to loads of atmospheric pollutants, except NH3, only some of the associations were statistically significant. Whereas numbers of mycorrhizas and those of fruitbodies were inversely related to the extent of crown ""transparency"", loss of twigs and incidence of damaged bark, there were no significant correlations with tree vitality as determined by needle loss and discolouration, the criteria used by the Netherlands State Forest Service. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that decreased numbers of mycorrhizas in old stands, particularly in the polluted southern region, may be related to the inability of mycorrhizal fungi to colonize, possibly as a result of changed soil conditions which did not seem to affect the production of root tips. The proportion of root tips that were mycorrhizal decreased from 41% in young stands to 12% in old stands and from an average of 36% in the north to 9% in the south.","WAGENINGEN UNIV AGR,DEPT SILVICULTURE & FOREST ECOL,BIOL STN,9418 PD WIJSTER,NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,29,40,41,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

In some forests in some regions fewer ectomycorrhizal fungi are now producing sporocarps, notably those associated with trees more than 40 years old and in particular conifers, for instance species of Phellodon, Hydnellum, Suillus, Tricholoma and Cortinarius. It is argued that this decline in different parts of Europe is coincident with decreased numbers of mycorrhizas. A scheme of progressive changes with three phases of ectomycorrhizal impoverishment and seven subphases is presented. The more probable causes of decline are discussed, namely forest succession, the collection of sporocarps (of edible mycorrhizal fungi), changes in forest management, direct influences of air pollutants, acidification of forest soils and consequent increased availability of aluminium in soil solution, nitrogen deposition, increased litter accumulation, changes in the herb layer of forests and reduced tree vitality. It is argued that changes in the populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi are most likely to be attributable to indirect effects of air pollution, in particular to increases in amounts of available nitrogen (possibly in combination with acidification) and/or to decreased tree vitality with consequent reductions in the transport of current assimilates to roots and mycorrhizas. The relative importance of these different factors, and their interactions, are likely to differ in different locations. It is supposed that liming and applications of other corrective fertilizers are unlikely to restore the diversity and sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi; they may even have adverse effects. In the circumstances therefore it seems that the abatement of emissions is likely to be the only effective way of improving and sustaining stable forest ecosystems in areas at risk, notably in densely populated Europe.",,"ARNOLDS, E (reprint author), AGR UNIV WIJSTER,BIOL STN,KAMPSWEG 27,9418 PD WIJSTER,NETHERLANDS.",,,,,,,107,241,267,0,75,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

The model was driven with observed weather and with combinations of elevated atmospheric CO2, elevated temperature, and either increased or decreased precipitation. Precipitation and CO2 level accounted for most of the variation among climate change treatments in the responses of soil, plants, animals and microbes. Elevated temperature extended the growing season but depressed photosynthesis in the summer, with little net effect on annual primary production. Doubling CO2 (1) caused persistent increases in primary production, in spite of greater nitrogen limitation, and (2) led to greater storage of carbon in plant residues and soil organic matter. The increased carbon storage was not great enough to keep pace with the present rate of increase in atmospheric CO2.","COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT RANGE SCI,FT COLLINS,CO 80523; USDA ARS,HORT RES LAB,SPP UNIT,ORLANDO,FL 32803; COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523; COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT ENVIRONM HLTH,FT COLLINS,CO 80523","HUNT, HW (reprint author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,NAT RESOURCE ECOL LAB,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,"Detling, James K/I-1691-2013; Moore, John/E-9802-2011; Kittel, Timothy/F-2792-2011","Kittel, Timothy/0000-0002-4153-1006",,,,91,98,104,1,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Sixty-three percent of the nodules of the Rj2Rj3-cultivars were occupied by rhizobia of nodulation-type C, which were compatible with the Rj2Rj3-cultivars but incompatible with the Rj4-one. Sixty-one percent of the nodules of the Rj4-cultivars were occupied by isolates of nodulation-type B, which were compatible with the Rj4-cultivars but compatible with the Rj2Rj3-one. Non-Rj-cultivars preferred rhizobia of nodulation-type A, which were compatible with both Rj-cultivars. To estimate the effect of planting of Rj-cultivars on the rhizobial population in soils, Rj2Rj3-(IAC-2) and Rj4-(Hill) cultivars were inoculated with dilutions of supernatants of suspended soils in which the Rj4-cultivar (Fukuyutaka) and non-Rj-one (Akisirome) were planted in the preceding year, and the nodule number was counted. Based on the results, it was shown that the planting of the Rj4-cultivar increased the population of compatible rhizobia with the Rj4-cultivar and decreased that of the compatible rhizibia with the Rj2Rj3-cultivar. Planting of the non-Rj-cultivar did not influence remarkably the rhizobial population in soil. The cultivars IAC-2 (Rj2Rj3), Hill (Rj4), and Orihime (non-Rj) were planted in the soils used in the above experiment, and the nodulation-types of the isolates from the nodules were identified. Marked preference of IAC-2 for type C rhizobia was observed in the soil planted with the non-Rj-cultivar (87%), while for the type A ones in the soil planted with the Rj4-cultivar (87%). IAC-2 significantly preferred the type C rhizobia in the soil containing type C rhizobia, but the type A rhizobia when the number of type C rhizobia was very small as in the Fukuyutaka (Rj4)-cultivated soil. On the basis of these results, it was suggested that the Rj-genes were involved in the inhibition of effective nodulation by certain serogroups of rhizobia as well as in preference for appropriate rhizobia in relation to nodulation and increase of those populations in soil.",,"ISHIZUKA, J (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC AGR,HIGASHI KU,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN.",,,,,,,16,43,44,0,2,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Twelve antigens of nodulation-type C isolates (compatible with the Rj2Rj3-cultivar, but incompatible with the Rj4-cultivar) and strain USDA-61 were agglutinated with one or two antisera against the nodulation-type C strains, but did not react with antisera against the nodulation-type A strains (compatible with the Rj2Rj3- and Rj4-cultivars). On the other hand, 3 out of 10 antigens of type A isolates reacted only with antisera against type C strains, and 2 of them reacted with both antisera against type A and C strains. Five antigens reacted only with antisera against type A strains. Therefore, it was assumed that the incompatibility of the Rj4-cultivars with the nodulation-type C strains did not depend only on their most active antigenic determinants. Nodulation-type C strains were divided into two subtypes. One of them was a strict type C, and the antisera against strains belonging to this subtype reacted only with type C strains as Is-34 and -48. The other was a non-strict subtype, and antisera against this subtype of strain reacted with type A strains in addition to type C strains. The characteristics of the non-strict nodulation-type C strain, Is-21 were examined in relation to the culture age of the inoculant. The cultures which were 12 to 24 days old did not nodulate the Rj4-cultivar, Hill, but those which were less than 8 days and more than 31 days old nodulated Hill effectively. The bacterial cells harvested from cultures ranging from 8 to 23 days of age were not agglutinated with the antiserum against Is-21. These results suggest that the compatibility of the non-strict nodulation-type C strain Is-21 with the Rj4-cultivar changed with the culture age, that the change in the compatibility may be related to that in the serological characteristics, and that the most active antigenic determinant of Is-21 may not be involved in the incompatibility with Rj4-cultivars because certain rhizobia of nodulation-type A were agglutinated with the antiserum against Is-21 and the compatibility of cultured cells of Is-21 with Rj4-cultivars was lost simultaneously with the reactivity with Anti-21.",,"ISHIZUKA, J (reprint author), KYUSHU UNIV,FAC AGR,HIGASHI KU,FUKUOKA 812,JAPAN.",,,,,,,14,22,23,0,2,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

The trees were labeled with 14CO2 and harvested after a 72-hour chase period. Roots attached to each labeled tree were analyzed for morphological traits at the time of harvest. Detached roots from within a 1-m3 volume of soil surrounding each tree were separated from the soil and sorted on the basis of rooting depth and root diameter. Lateral roots > 2 mm in diameter had a largely horizontal orientation at their point of origin from the cutting and extended horizontally up to 4 m from the cutting. This resulted in considerable overlap of root systems in the plantation. Results from C-14 labeling indicated that 24 +/- 4% (+/- SD) of the carbon exported from branches-labeled within two weeks after branch budset-was translocated to the root system. Dilution of the root C-14 label indicated that from 0 (> 5 mm diameter roots) to 75% (< mm diameter roots) of the roots recovered from within the 1-m3 volume of soil surrounding a harvested tree originated from other trees. Total root biomass was 6 +/- 1 Mg ha-1 for both hybrids. Sixty percent of the root biomass was recovered directly from excavation, 16% from coarse-sieving excavated soil, and 24% from re-sorting sieved soil.

Borescopes, minihizotrons and soil biotrons are well-suited to studying events at the intermediate, millimeter-minute spatiotemporal scale of fine roots, fungi and invertebrates. Soil biotrons are particularly well-suited for study of the intermediate spatio-temporal scale because microscopes, cameras and video can be used within them, and in situ experimental manipulations can be performed. The large amounts of observational data that can be collected with video recording can be analyzed using computer image analysis.

Competition intensity and asymmetry were measured after one growing season for six species of plants grown in an additive pairwise design. Similarity was measured using a guild classification and was assigned to three levels: intraspecific, intra-guild and inter-guild interactions. The guild classification was based upon 27 ecological traits associated with both niche properties (e.g. rooting depth) and competitive ability (e.g. plant height). The six species represented two distinct guilds of wetland plants: obligate and facultative annuals. The results confirmed two key predictions: The intensity of competition increased with increasing similarity between interacting plants, as predicted by the niche control paradigm. The asymmetry of competition decreased with increasing similarity, as predicted by the dominance control paradigm. Guild identity, as defined in our study, was not a good predictor of competitive ability.","UNIV OTTAWA,DEPT BIOL,OTTAWA K1N 6N5,ONTARIO,CANADA","JOHANSSON, ME (reprint author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ECOL BOT,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,56,68,71,1,31,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1991,60,1,,,,,27,34,,10.2307/3544988,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY489,WOS:A1991EY48900005,,,,,10/31/19J,"PIJNENBORG, JWM; LIE, TA; ZEHNDER, AJB",,,,"PIJNENBORG, JWM; LIE, TA; ZEHNDER, AJB",,,NODULATION OF LUCERNE (MEDICAGO-SATIVA L) IN AN ACID SOIL - EFFECTS OF INOCULUM SIZE AND LIME-PELLETING,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ACID SOIL; CROWN NODULATION; INOCULATION; NITROGEN FIXATION; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; RHIZOBIAL SURVIVAL,RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; CLOVER SEED; GROWTH; INOCULATION; TOLERANCE; ALFALFA; RHIZOSPHERE; RESISTANCE; TRUNCATULA; SYMBIOSIS,"The effects of inoculum level and lime-pelleting were studied in an acid soil with respect to the nodulation and growth of lucerne (Medicago sativa cv Resis) and the population dynamics of Rhizobium meliloti.

Aliette applied to seeds of alfalfa inoculated with an aliette-resistant strain of Rhizobium meliloti increased the numbers of R. meliloti in the rhizosphere after 3 but not 37 days, increased the number of nodules, and with some seed treatments, increased the growth of alfalfa. The enhanced colonization by R. meliloti as a result of seed treatment with aliette lasted for at least 31 days for alfalfa, although plant weights did not increase. Colonization by R. meliloti was further enhanced if seeds and foliage were treated with the fungicide. Coating seeds or spraying the foliage with aliette also increased the number and weight of nodules and nitrogenase activity in soybeans inoculated with an aliette-resistant strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The stimulation of B. japonicum in the rhizosphere and of nodulation was evident with successive plantings of soybeans if the seeds for each planting were treated with the chemical, but aliette did not increase the yield of inoculated soybeans in the subsequent plantings. With only the seeds of the first planting of inoculated soybeans treated with aliette, the numbers of B. japonicum in the rhizosphere of subsequent plantings were only occasionally greater and the numbers of nodules on the later plantings were not increased.

Melrose) by two strains of arctic rhizobia (from Astragalus or Oxytropis sp.) and two strains of temperate rhizobia (from sainfoin) were evaluated at temperatures of 9, 12, or 15-degrees-C for roots and 20-degrees-C (day) and 15-degrees-C (night) for shoots. The inocula consisted of effective individual or paired arctic and temperate strains which were identified on the basis of differential growth. At 9-degrees-C, the arctic strains were generally more competitive than the temperate strains, whereas at the highest temperature tested, the converse was apparent. Symbiotic effectiveness (shoot dry weight, nitrogenase activity, and number of nodules) was similarly affected by root temperature, except that at 15-degrees-C the arctic strains were generally as effective as the temperate strains. The marked interaction between temperature and strain on competitiveness or on effectiveness indicates symbiotic adaptation of the arctic rhizobia to low temperatures. On the basis of these data we suggest that the use of selected, cold-adapted rhizobia in sainfoin inoculants may be beneficial in temperate regions where low soil temperatures occur early in the growing season.","AGR CANADA,PLANT RES CTR,OTTAWA K1A 0C6,ONTARIO,CANADA","PREVOST, D (reprint author), AGR CANADA,RES STN,ST FOY G1V 2J3,QUEBEC,CANADA.",,,,,,,19,12,13,0,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Inoculated plants showed a greater response to the application of Zn at 2.5 and 5.0 mg kg-1 soil in a Zn deficient clay loam soil. The inoculated plants also absorbed - more water than the uninoculated plants. Mass flow and diffusion were the principal processes by which Zn reached the plant roots; mass flow was particularly important in the absence of VAM in a sandy soil fertilized with higher Zn doses (5 and 10 mg kg-1 soil). The greater supply of Zn to inoculated roots was attributed to an apparent diffusion process rather than to mass flow of Zn.","GOVIND BALLABH PANT UNIV AGR & TECHNOL,DEPT SOIL SCI,PANTNAGAR 263145,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA; GOVIND BALLABH PANT UNIV AGR & TECHNOL,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,PANTNAGAR 263145,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA",,,,,,,,22,12,15,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Root proliferation of the shrub was considerably influenced by the species of grass roots in the patches; root densities of Artemisia were generally two to three times more abundant with Pseudoroegneria than when with Agropyron. There was also a greater tendency for roots of Artemisia and Pseudoroegneria to segregate (avoid one another) in comparison with the combination of Artemisia and Agropyron. Interference at the level of individual roots is suggested. The species also reacted to the fertile microsites differently; only Agropyron exhibited a significant proliferation compared to control microsites. In general, Agropyron had greater root densities than Pseudoroegneria.

One adult earthworm Octolasion lacteum (Orley) was placed in half of the containers. Transpiration, CO2 assimilation, chlorophyll synthesis and N incorporation were higher in the acid brown earth than in the rendzina. Fine root production was also higher in the acid brown earth. Production of stems and total N incorporation were higher in the O. lacteum treatments than in the controls. Burrowing activity of O. lacteum did not affect total root production but stimulated the transfer of C and N towards aboveground parts of the plants and shifted the large root to fine root ratio towards large roots. O. lacteum effects were similar in both soils. It is concluded that endogeic earthworms significantly affect resource allocation patterns of beech seedlings over a wide range of soils. This effect can be partly explained by an increased availability of N in soils worked by earthworms.","UNIV GOTTINGEN,INST SYST GEOBOT,LEHRSTUHL GEOBOT,W-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY","WOLTERS, V (reprint author), UNIV GOTTINGEN,INST ZOOL 2,BERLINER STR 28,W-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY.",,"Wolters, Volkmar/B-4635-2010",,,,,40,17,17,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,1,,,,,125,131,,10.1007/BF00328412,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GG562,WOS:A1991GG56200017,28312740,,,,10/31/19J,"JOHNSON, NC; ZAK, DR; TILMAN, D; PFLEGER, FL",,,,"JOHNSON, NC; ZAK, DR; TILMAN, D; PFLEGER, FL",,,DYNAMICS OF VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE DURING OLD FIELD SUCCESSION,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,VA-MYCORRHIZAE; OLD FIELD SUCCESSION; INFECTIVITY; SPORE POPULATIONS,SEMI-ARID WEST; REVEGETATION PRACTICES; SOIL FUMIGATION; VASCULAR PLANTS; ROOT EXUDATION; FUNGI; PHOSPHORUS; ENDOGONACEAE; INFECTION; PH,"The species composition of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungal communities changed during secondary succession of abandoned fields based on a field to forest chronosequence. Twenty-five VAM fungal species were identified. Seven species were clearly early successional and five species were clearly late successional. The total number of VAM fungal species did not increase with successional time, but diversity as measured by the Shannon-Wiener index tended to increase, primarily because the community became more even as a single species, Glomus aggregatum, became less dominant in the older sites. Diversity of the VAM fungal community was positively correlated with soil C and N. The density of VAM fungi, as measured by infectivity and total spore count, first increased with time since abandonment and then decreased in the late successional forest sites. Within 12 abandoned fields, VAM fungal density increased with increasing soil pH, H2O soluble soil C, and root biomass, but was inversely related to extractable soil P and percent cover of non-host plant species. The lower abundance of VAM fungi in the forest sites compared with the field sites agrees with the findings of other workers and corresponds with a shift in the dominant vegetation from herbaceous VAM hosts to woody ectomycorrhizal hosts.","UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,ST PAUL,MN 55108; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT SOIL SCI,ST PAUL,MN 55108; UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,ST PAUL,MN 55108","JOHNSON, NC (reprint author), UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV,318 CHURCH ST SE,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,54,190,199,1,90,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,86,3,,,,,349,358,,10.1007/BF00317600,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FK488,WOS:A1991FK48800007,28312920,,,,10/31/19B,"MADDOX, JJ; SOILEAU, JM",,"WRIGHT, RJ; BALIGAR, VC; MURRMANN, RP",,"MADDOX, JJ; SOILEAU, JM",,,"EFFECTS OF PHOSPHATE FERTILIZATION, LIME AMENDMENTS AND INOCULATION WITH VA-MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ON SOYBEANS IN AN ACID SOIL",PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,2ND INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,"JUN 24-29, 1990","BECKLEY, WV","USDA, US DEPT INTERIOR, STATE W VIRGINIA, BECKLEY NATL BANK, QUOTA CLUB BECKLEY, CENT PRINTING, SOVEREIGN WORLD TRAVEL, LILLYS CROWN JEWELERS, APPLALACHIAN ARTISTS CRAFTSMEN, PENTEK SCI",,ALUMINUM; CHLORIDE; GLOMUS-ETUNICATUM; GLOMUS-FASCICULATUM; GLYCINE-MAX; LIME; POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE; SOIL PH,,,,,,,,,,,0,5,5,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,DORDRECHT,,,0-7923-1105-1,DEV PLANT SOIL SCI,,,1991,45,,,,,,215,225,,,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BU70E,WOS:A1991BU70E00023,,,,,10/31/19B,"WRIGHT, SF; ZETO, SK",,"WRIGHT, RJ; BALIGAR, VC; MURRMANN, RP",,"WRIGHT, SF; ZETO, SK",,,EFFECTS OF PH AND AL-3+ ACTIVITY ON SURVIVAL OF RHIZOBIUM-LEGUMINOSARUM BV TRIFOLII IN A SIMPLE SOLUTION AND ON NODULATION OF RED-CLOVER IN ACID SOILS,PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,2ND INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,"JUN 24-29, 1990","BECKLEY, WV","USDA, US DEPT INTERIOR, STATE W VIRGINIA, BECKLEY NATL BANK, QUOTA CLUB BECKLEY, CENT PRINTING, SOVEREIGN WORLD TRAVEL, LILLYS CROWN JEWELERS, APPLALACHIAN ARTISTS CRAFTSMEN, PENTEK SCI",,AL SPECIES; AL TOLERANCE; LEGUME; PH TOLERANCE; RHIZOBIA,,,,,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,DORDRECHT,,,0-7923-1105-1,DEV PLANT SOIL SCI,,,1991,45,,,,,,603,609,,,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BU70E,WOS:A1991BU70E00067,,,,,10/31/19B,"MARSCHNER, H",,"WRIGHT, RJ; BALIGAR, VC; MURRMANN, RP",,"MARSCHNER, H",,,MECHANISMS OF ADAPTATION OF PLANTS TO ACID SOILS,PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCES,,English,Proceedings Paper,2ND INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON PLANT-SOIL INTERACTIONS AT LOW PH,"JUN 24-29, 1990","BECKLEY, WV","USDA, US DEPT INTERIOR, STATE W VIRGINIA, BECKLEY NATL BANK, QUOTA CLUB BECKLEY, CENT PRINTING, SOVEREIGN WORLD TRAVEL, LILLYS CROWN JEWELERS, APPLALACHIAN ARTISTS CRAFTSMEN, PENTEK SCI",,AL TOXICITY; AVOIDANCE VERSUS TOLERANCE; CA AND MG DEFICIENCY; MYCORRHIZAE; RHIZOSPHERE PH; ROOT EXUDATES; RHIZOSPHERE MICROORGANISMS,,,,,,,,,,,0,34,35,1,18,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,DORDRECHT,,,0-7923-1105-1,DEV PLANT SOIL SCI,,,1991,45,,,,,,683,702,,,,,20,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BU70E,WOS:A1991BU70E00077,,,,,10/31/19J,"RUTISHAUSER, R; HUBER, KA",,,,"RUTISHAUSER, R; HUBER, KA",,,"THE DEVELOPMENTAL MORPHOLOGY OF INDOTRISTICHA-RAMOSISSIMA (PODOSTEMACEAE, TRISTICHOIDEAE)",PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,"ANGIOSPERMS, PODOSTEMACEAE, TRISTICHOIDEAE, INDOTRISTICHA-RAMOSISSIMA; RHEOPHYTES, WATER PLANTS, LIFE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, ROOT-SHOOT MODEL, LEAF-STEM INTERMEDIATES, PHYLLOTAXIS, FLOWER STRUCTURE, SYSTEMATICS",UTRICULARIA,"The developmental morphology of Indotristicha ramosissima, a submerged rheophyte from South India, is described. Besides creeping organs (called roots) there are branched shoots with two kinds of short-lived photosynthetic appendages: scales and compound structures (called ramuli). These ramuli may be interpreted as leaf-stem intermediates because they combine typical leaf characters (extra-axillary position, determinate growth, subtending an axillary bud) and typical stem characters (nearly radial symmetry, acropetal development with apical meristem, arrangement of the scaly subunits helical or irregular). Floral shoots arise from axillary exogenous buds along the vegetative shoots, occasionally also from endogenous buds along the roots and vegetative shoots. The uppermost scales and ramuli of each floral shoot form a cup-like structure around the base of the terminal flower. Indotristicha is thought to be primitive within the Tristichoideae (Podostemaceae).

The enzymes were assayed by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. An examination of the allozyme profiles revealed that twenty-seven of these selections (16%) were misidentified as P. deltoides. Eighteen of the misidentified selections displayed isozyme genotypes and patterns typical of P. deltoides x P. higra L. hybrids (P. x canadenis Moench) and the remaining nine selections typical of P. deltoides x P. balsamifera L. (P. x jackii Sarg.). The results indicated a need for screening North American P. deltoides selections used for plantation, breeding, and biological studies to assure their accurate species identification. Allozyme markers can be of potential importance in detecting misidentified P. deltoides specimens and in ascertaining their correct species identity.","[Rajora, Om P.; Zsuffa, Louis] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada","Rajora, OP (reprint author), Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Plant Biotechnol, 110 Gymnasium Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W9, Canada.",,,,"Ontario Tree Improvement and Forest Biomass Institute, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Maple, Ontario; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Committee","This research was supported by the Ontario Tree Improvement and Forest Biomass Institute, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Maple, Ontario and by an Ontario Renewable Resource Research Program, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

The disease and the fungus virtually disappeared, within one season, when chlorthal dimethyl replaced propazine. An explanation for these observations was sought by examining the effects of propazine and chlorthal dimethyl on soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane bacteria, Actinomycetes and fungi and the effect of the herbicides on the resistance per se, of P. radiata seedlings to Ph. cinnamomi. These tests were carried out in a laboratory, phytotron and greenhouse. The nursery disease symptoms were reproduced in the phytotron when Ph. cinnamomi-free soils were inoculated and treated with both herbicides. Chlorthal dimethyl was found to strongly inhibit root disease and soil inoculum potentials of Ph. cinnamomi in 5 month-old seedlings while propazine had the opposite effect. When the stems of herbicidal-treated seedlings growing in Ph. cinnamomi-free soils were inoculated with Ph. cinnamomi, there was evidence that propazine increased disease sensitivity considerably while the effect of chlorthal dimethyl was not consistent. Examination of the effects that both herbicides had, in phytotron tests, on soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane microflora showed that chlorthal dimethyl reduced numbers of Gram-positive and -negative and spore forming bacteria ca 90% while propazine increased their numbers. In the rhizosphere and rhizoplane the inhibitory effect of chlorthal dimethyl and the stimulatory influence of propazine on bacteria was very variable which suggests that the root exudates had a greater influence on microbial numbers than that of the herbicides. Examination of the effects various bacterial types on sporangial formation of Ph. cinnamomi showed that the spore-forming bacteria associated with propazine soil drenches strongly stimulated sporangial production. The evidence suggest that the disease outbreak at the Benalla nursery may have been due to an increase in numbers of soil bacteria that stimulated production of Ph. cinnamomi inoculum and a reduction in disease resistance. The disease reduction following applications of chlorthal dimethyl may have been due directly to fungitoxicity to Ph. cinnamomi and failure to stimulate soil microflora that may have increased inoculum levels. Its influence on disease resistance of P. radiata was possibly negligible.","DEPT CONSERVAT FORESTS & LANDS,378 COTHAM RD,KEW,VIC 3101,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,17,8,8,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Gerdemann & Trappe, Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, and Acaulospora longula Spain & Schenck, were studied to characterize the variety of responses of VAM fungi to storage. Spores were stored at 23-degrees-C for up to 4 months in soil at several matric potentials [psi-m], then removed and exposed for 1 month in soil at field capacity to induce germination. Each species studied has a different response to storage duration and moisture availability, reflecting the complexity of the problem of storage of VAM fungi in soil. Net germinability, the difference in percentage germination between that which occurred in storage and germination after the subsequent month at field capacity, was effectively zero for Gi. margarita. Hyphae continued to grow and additional germ tubes were produced upon removal from storage. Gi. margarita spores which produced one germ tube per spore during storage in moist soil subsequently produced less root colonization of Paspalum notatum than spores stored in drier soil. Net germinability of spores of G. intraradices increased with decreasing storage psi-m and was independent of storage duration. Upon removal from storage, preexisting hyphae resumed growth. Net germinability of spores of G. mosseae was inversely proportional to duration of storage and independent of psi-m. Spores which germinated in storage did not resume growth upon removal from storage. Net germinability of A. longula increased with duration of storage and was independent of moisture availability during storage, indicating a dormant period.","UNIV FLORIDA,DEPT PLANT PATHOL,GAINESVILLE,FL 32611",,,,,,,,17,29,29,2,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

To examine this possibility, alfalfa plants (Medicago sativa) were collected from soils containing low to very high concentrations of the metals, Cd and Zn. The source of the metals was a Zn smelter in operation for nearly 100 yr. Fifty isolates of Rhizobium meliloti were collected and purified from each soil. All isolates, regardless of their origin, were capable of growing on media containing very high concentrations of the heavy metals, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cd. For example, R. meliloti isolated from soil with extractable [10 mM Ca(NO3)2] Zn and Cd concentrations of 0.025 and 0.003-mu-g g-1 were tolerant of medium concentrations of 162-mu-g Zn g-1 and 22-mu-g Cd g-1, respectively. There was no correlation between extractable soil metal concentrations and the ability of the isolates to tolerate metal salts in their growth medium. In fact, the greatest number of metal-tolerant rhizobia were isolated from soil containing the lowest metal concentration. These results indicate that the intrinsic level of metal tolerance of R. meliloti is much higher than metal activities in soil, even highly contaminated soils. This intrinsic level of metal tolerance probably explains the lack of metal response by rhizobia collected from these soils.","UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT AGRON,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742; USDA ARS,BELTSVILLE AGR RES CTR,SOIL MICROBIAL SYST LAB,BELTSVILLE,MD 20705",,,,,,,,20,25,25,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Karst.] in at least equal amounts on a fresh weight basis, in both adult and 5-year-old trees. NRA could also be demonstrated in trunk wood of derooted trees after fertilization with 5 mM NO3-, exhibiting a longitudinal profile in the trunk. Inducibility in needles can more efficiently be achieved by NO2 (100-mu-g.m-3) than by 5 mM nitrate, which is effective only in root-amputated trees. A remarkably high level of needle-NRA in unfertilized trees, which are characterized by a very low level of nitrate in the xylem sap, suggests that NRA in spruce needles may in part be constitutive. Organic-N is a major nitrogen source for the needles even in root-amputated trees, indicating pronounced exchange processes between ray parenchyma and trunk xylem, which in turn are modified by the nitrogen source fed to the trunk stump. Intact trees exhibit a very similar amino acid composition of the xylem sap, regardless of whether NO3- or NH4+ has been fed. The amino acid pattern of the needles is not thrown out of balance by ""flooding"" with NO3- and NH4+, which occurs in fertilized derooted trees. This indicates a distinct potential for homoeostasis of nitrogen entrance-metabolism (i.e. NRA and glutamine synthetase activity) in the needles. In the ectomycorrhiza/fine root-system (EMC), marked differences in NRA were observed depending on root-tip diameter and along the longitudinal profile of the fine roots. EMC-nitrate reductase is strongly enhanced by NO3-. Needle-NRA exhibits a circannual rhythm. An early summer maximum is followed by a December minimum. This activity pattern matches well the transitory increase of soluble nitrogen in spring and the total protein maximum in winter. In an indirect way assimilatory NRA may well contribute to nitrogen overfertilization (by consumption of NOx) as one possible cause of the contemporary decline of spruce populations.","UNIV COLOGNE,INST BOT,LEHRSTUHL 3,GYRHOFSTR 15,W-5000 COLOGNE 41,GERMANY",,,,,,,,0,11,12,1,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

When nitrate concentrations were very low, both nodulation and seedling growth were impaired, whereas nitrate concentrations high enough to promote plant growth strongly inhibited symbiotic nitrogen fixation. When nitrate was added to the growth medium after infection, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of the seedlings decreased. This effect was even more marked when nitrate was applied before infection with rhizobia. Higher nitrogen concentrations also reduced nodule number and nodule mass when applied simultaneously with the infecting bacteria. The contribution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to black locust shoot mass by far exceeded its effects on shoot length and root mass. When nitrate availability was very low, specific nitrogen fixation (i.e. nitrogenase activity per nodule wet weight) was improved with increasing nitrogen supply, but rapidly decreased with higher nitrogen concentrations.","UNIV MARBURG,DEPT BIOL,W-3550 MARBURG,GERMANY",,,,,,,,0,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

This study was designed to assess the influence of L-TRP on radish (Raphanus sativus) yield when applied to soil. The amount of L-TRP added to soil to give optimum radish growth in glasshouse studies was 3.0 mg kg-1 soil which enhanced the root yield by 1.31-fold over the control. The root/shoot ratio was increased by 1.10-fold upon this amendment. One L-TRP application was sufficient to promote growth. The best time to apply L-TRP was at the onset of seedling emergence. The application of L-TRP promoted radish yield comparable to those plants treated with indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-acetamide and indole-3-lactic acid. Foliar application of L-TRP had no effect on the root and shoot dry weight. A field study was conducted in which L-TRP applications at a rate of 20.4 and 204 mg m-2 significantly enhanced the radish yield in fertilized plots receiving fertilization. The shoot dry weight was increased by 1.29-fold and the root dry weight by 1.15-fold over the control in response to 20.4 mg L-TRP m-2. These findings indicate that L-TRP, applied at the appropriate times and concentrations, can increase radish yield. The effect of L-TRP on radish growth could be attributed to i) substrate-dependent auxin production in soil by the indigenous microflora, ii) uptake directly by plant roots followed by metabolism within their tissues, and/or iii) a change in the balance of rhizosphere microflora affecting plant growth.",,"FRANKENBERGER, WT (reprint author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT SOIL & ENVIRONM SCI,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521, USA.",,,,,,,24,29,32,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,1990,129,2,,,,,235,241,,10.1007/BF00032418,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,EV074,WOS:A1990EV07400017,,,,,10/31/19J,"BOOT, RGA; MENSINK, M",,,,"BOOT, RGA; MENSINK, M",,,SIZE AND MORPHOLOGY OF ROOT SYSTEMS OF PERENNIAL GRASSES FROM CONTRASTING HABITATS AS AFFECTED BY NITROGEN SUPPLY,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,DESCHAMPSIA-FLEXUOSA; FESTUCA-OVINA; FESTUCA-RUBRA; HOLCUS-LANATUS; MOLINIA-CAERULEA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; ROOT HAIR DENSITY; ROOT HAIR LENGHH; ROOT-SHOOT RATIO; ROOT SYSTEM MORPHOLOGY; SPECIFIC ROOT AREA; SPECIFIC ROOT LENGTH,PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE; PLANTS; LENGTH,"This paper discusses interspecific differences and phenotypic responses to nitrogen supply in various root parameters of five perennial grasses from contrasting habitats.

When one seedling of P. glandulosa was grown with two or more C. dactylon in an additive experiment, aboveground, belowground, and total dry weight of P. glandulosa decreased 84, 71, and 79% respectively. Root : shoot ratios for P. glandulosa increased almost four times from lowest to highest density of C. dactylon. Conversely, P. glandulosa caused a significant reduction in dry weight of C. dactylon but mainly in the lowest grass densities. When P. glandulosa was planted with C. dactylon at the same time, dry weight of P. glandulosa was reduced 83%. If P. glandulosa was planted 2 months after C. dactylon was planted, dry weight of P. glandulosa was reduced 96%. Although P. glandulosa had a negative effect on C. dactylon, the negative effect only occurred when the density of C. dactylon was low or they were planted at the same time.

The pH at the root surface (rhizoplane) and in the rhizosphere can differ considerably from that of the bulk soil. Depending on the root zone and nitrogen source (NH4-N or NO3-N), the pH at the rhizoplane can be higher or lower than in the bulk soil. Along the root axis four zones of different pH-changes could be observed. The pH increase at the root tip was independent of the N-source and may reflect an effective mechanism of adaptation of Norway spruce to acid mineral soils. In basal root zones, pH-decrease and proton release, or pH-increase and proton consumption in the rhizosphere were closely correlated with the concentration of NH4+ or NO3- in the soil solution. Although acidic mist caused severe needle losses and reduced root growth, rhizosphere pH was only related with different concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- in the soil solution. The results stress the importance to consider the rhizosphere pH for evaluation of effects of soil acidification on root growth. The high pH-values at the root tip of both healthy and damaged Norway spruce probably explains why soil acidification in forest stands and shoot damage not necessarily lead to root damage.",,"LEISEN, E (reprint author), UNIV HOHENHEIM,INST PFLANZENERNAHRUNG,POSTFACH 700562,W-7000 STUTTGART 70,GERMANY.",,,,,,,0,8,8,0,0,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0015-8003,,,FORSTWISS CENTRALBL,Forstwiss.

No allelopathic effect was observed for lupine plants treated with tall fescue leachates. The nitrogen-fixing potential measured by nodule dry weight and acetylene reduction rates was not significantly affected by tall fescue turf. Both the greenhouse and field studies showed that the growth, sexual reproductive allocation and number of inflorescences were significantly reduced when lupine plants were grown with tall fescue. The root-length densities of tall fescue turf and lupine monoculture were measured. The tall fescue turf had 20 times higher root-length density (20 cm cm-3 soil) than the lupine plant monoculture. This suggests that intense competition at the root zone may be a dominant factor which limits the growth of the lupine plants. The flowering characters of the lupine plants were improved by phosphorus fertilization.

The initiation and differentiation of the Hartig net were recorded. Differences between the two tree species were found, as were differences between the two tree species and angiosperms. The Casparian band developed immediately after the origin of endodermal cells from the meristem in mycorrhizae of both tree species. In L. decidua only the primary endodermis was present in most mycorrhizal laterals. The secondary structure of the endodermis was restricted to main roots and proximal parts of larch mycorrhizae. In P. abies mycorrhizae, however, the secondary stage of the endodermis developed soon after the primary endodermis and was characterized by regular alternation of short, active passage cells and elongated, rapidly degenerating cells, the inner surface of which was covered by a thick suberin layer. Hartig net development started in P. abies short roots only after the differentiation of endodermis into the secondary stage, whereas in L. decidua, the Hartig net was already initiated at the primary endodermal stage. Differences were specific for tree species.","[Kottke, Ingrid; Oberwinkler, Franz] Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany","Kottke, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Bot, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),The authors are indebted to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for supporting the investigations.

Three types of aggregates were observed in sand dunes: ( 1) microbial aggregates, 1-12 mm in diameter, formed by the action of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi, ( 2) root-microbial aggregates, formed by microorganisms in conjunction with root exudates and root structural components, and ( 3) debris-microbial aggregates, up to 6 mm in diameter, formed during decomposition of macroscopic plant debris. In maritime sand dunes the aggregates contributed up to 0.4% of total bulk soil weight. The VAM fungal hyphae participated in aggregate formation, and the presence of cyanobacteria in aggregates indicated their contribution to nitrogen cycling. Inocculation of dune sand with fungi and bacteria in addition to soluble organic matter improved soil structure and plant growth. The results indicated that soil microflora could be used as a tool for improving soil structure with a subsequently improved plant growth in sandy desert soils.","[Forster, Susan M.] Univ Dundee, Dept Biol Sci, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland","Forster, SM (reprint author), Higher Brightor Cottage, Landrake PL12 5HZ, Cornwall, England.",,,,U.K. Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council,The financial assistance of the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council is gratefully acknowledged.

Pinus sylvestris; P. contorta; ectomycorrhizae; establishment; humus,,"The presence of humus was evaluated as a factor affecting the establishment and development of mycorrhiza in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia Engelm.) during the first growing season after outplanting on two clear-cut sites. Humus proved to be of minor importance for the formation of mycorrhizae. Instead, the colonisation showed a patchy pattern, indicating spatial variation in the amounts of active inoculum. This variation may reflect differences in soil microhabitat and perhaps the mycorrhizal distribution in the logged stands. Total mycorrhizal short-root frequency increased from 10% at outplanting in June to 40-65% in October. The nursery mycorrhiza accounted for 80-95% of the total mycorrhiza at the end of the investigation. However, by this time 60-90% of the seedlings had, to some extent, indigenous mycorrhiza with fungi from the clear-cut sites. Piloderma croceum tended to be formed at a higher rate in the presence of humus than in its absence while another mycorrhizal type increased faster in the mineral soil.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Dahlberg, A (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, Box 7026, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,Swedish Research Council for Forestry and Agriculture; Foundation of the Cellulose Industry for Forestry and Technical Development,"I gratefully acknowledge the Swedish Research Council for Forestry and Agriculture and the Foundation of the Cellulose Industry for Forestry and Technical Development for supporting the investigation, and Iggesund AB for providing land and seedlings.

Paxillus involutus was also inoculated to control tubes in the absence of Pinus resinosa seedlings. In vivo labelling of proteins in Pinus resinosa roots and in Paxillus involutus mycelium was carried out using S-35 L-methionine 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 days after inoculation. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the protein extracts from the four treatments and autoradiography demonstrated that the presence of root exudates altered protein synthesis in Paxillus involutus as three major bands disappeared when Paxillus involutus was exposed to root exudates. Protein synthesis in Pinus resinosa was also altered when Paxillus involutus was introduced into the tubes, since at least two bands were more intense when seedlings were inoculated with Paxillus involutus, as compared to control roots. No difference was observed in the growth and the label incorporation of Paxillus involutus growing with or without root exudates. Ectomycorrhizal roots were not formed during this experiment. Gene regulation in this ectomycorrhizal association occurs, therefore, prior to the formation of ectomycorrhizal roots.","Univ Toronto, Dept Bot, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Duchesne, LC (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Bot, Erindale Campus, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Thanks are addressed to J.

However, wind dispersal is generally assumed to be random or logarithmically related to distance. We assessed the wind dispersal and subsequent establishment of an important group of plant symbionts, VA mycorrhizal fungi, across a 74 Ha recontoured surface mine. Winds were predominantly westerly aloft, but due to complex north-south ridges, up-valley, thermally-driven air flows developed. Patterns of spore dispersal were tested by a combination of released spore mimics from the potential source areas and by assessing the composition of species deposited across the site and in the putative source areas. Survival of the fungi was assessed two years after the dispersal patterns were monitored. The spore mimics moved in predictable but complex patterns across the site depending on the interactions of surface and upper winds. Mimics from the valley sources moved up the valleys in the lower flows and occasionally over the ridges in the upper winds. Those from the ridge approximately 2 km distant were entrained in the upper air flows and deposited all across the site. The VA mycorrhizal fungal species compositions from the soils correlated with the deposition patterns measured with the mimics. Fungal survival showed a pattern similar to dispersal; the fungi often survived in habitats not resembling the habitat of origin although some selection in both more favorable and less favorable sites occurred. These data suggest that microbial dispersal even by wind is predictable if the wind characteristics are known, that the VA mycorrhizal fungi from the site can survive in habitats different from their habitats of origin, but that some selection among species may occur after deposition.","[Allen, Michael F.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Allen, Michael F.] San Diego State Univ, Syst Ecol Res Grp, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Hipps, Lawrence E.; Wooldridge, Gene L.] Utah State Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Biometeorol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Allen, MF (reprint author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",,,"Hipps, Lawrence/0000-0002-7658-8571",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR 83-17358]; United States Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [83-CRCR-1-1229]; Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R813751-01-0],"We thank E.B.
